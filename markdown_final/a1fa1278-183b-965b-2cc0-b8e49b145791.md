## Question

high dose vitamin d alzheimers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-dose vitamin D helps in Alzheimer's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "high-dose" means and how it differs from standard dosing. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility from preclinical data. Next, I will examine randomized clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. After that, I need to check large-scale prevention trials and observational cohorts. I should also review safety signals, especially around falls and fractures with high-dose regimens. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and outline a practical, risk–benefit conclusion with dosing advice and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the dosing definitions so I don't conflate terms. Standard adult supplementation is typically 400–800 IU daily, whereas "high-dose" in trials often refers to 4,000 IU daily or bolus regimens such as 50,000 IU weekly or 60,000 IU monthly; these bolus approaches are explicitly discouraged by endocrine guidelines due to potential harms, so I need to keep that distinction front and center [^114pZVBG] [^111cVBdt] [^1153hWLu].

> Now, I will examine biological plausibility. Preclinical work shows vitamin D can reduce amyloid burden, modulate neuroinflammation, and improve synaptic function in AD models, and some animal data suggest benefits are more pronounced when deficiency is corrected or when treatment precedes overt pathology, which supports a mechanistic rationale but does not guarantee clinical efficacy in humans [^116iufRJ] [^116uQfS7] [^111AXCf2].

> Next, I should review randomized trials in established Alzheimer's disease. Wait, let me verify the key RCTs. A 12-month trial in 210 AD patients using 800 IU/day found improvements in some cognitive measures and Aβ-related biomarkers, but this was standard-dose, not high-dose, so it cannot answer the high-dose question [^113wiAha]. A small RCT that added high-dose vitamin D2 (to a background of 1,000 IU/day) found no cognitive benefit over low-dose in mild-to-moderate AD, despite achieving much higher 25(OH)D levels, which is a negative signal for high-dose in this population [^111QMEpf]. I should also note that a 6-month memantine plus vitamin D study suggested benefit, but the design limits inference about vitamin D alone and the dose was not clearly "high-dose", so I should be cautious not to over-interpret it [^112xJvXj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from MCI data either. The SYNERGIC randomized trial in MCI showed that exercise plus cognitive training improved cognition, but adding vitamin D (10,000 IU three times weekly) did not enhance outcomes, indicating no added cognitive benefit from high-dose vitamin D in that context [^1164rudn] [^116LoTvd]. A separate 4-month RCT using bolus vitamin D also found no cognitive benefit in midlife and older adults, reinforcing the lack of short-term cognitive gain with high-dose strategies [^113nA5pb].

> I need to check large-scale prevention trials. The D-Health trial randomized 21,315 older adults to monthly 60,000 IU vitamin D versus placebo for 5 years and found no improvement in cognitive function or reduction in cognitive impairment, arguing against population-wide high-dose bolus supplementation for cognition in largely replete older adults [^116V6niv]. Observational cohorts frequently associate low vitamin D with higher dementia risk, but these are vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation, so they cannot establish that high-dose supplementation prevents AD [^113PCjzL] [^112UvbFe].

> But wait, what if Mendelian randomization clarifies causality? MR studies generally support a causal link between lifelong lower 25(OH)D and higher AD risk, yet MR analyses of cognition itself have not shown that raising 25(OH)D improves cognitive performance, which tempers enthusiasm for therapeutic supplementation as a cognitive intervention [^1111kMux] [^114XMpg2] [^1132sa7W].

> I should double-check safety, because any benefit discussion must weigh harms. High-dose bolus vitamin D has been associated with increased falls and possibly fractures in older adults, and endocrine guidelines recommend daily lower-dose regimens rather than intermittent high-dose schedules for adults over 50, citing these safety concerns and lack of advantage for extraskeletal outcomes [^1123X8bZ] [^111cVBdt] [^1153hWLu]. Let me reconsider the practical ceiling: routine intake above 4,000 IU/day exceeds the tolerable upper intake level for most adults and should be avoided outside monitored indications, reinforcing that "more is not necessarily better" for vitamin D [^114pZVBG].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Contemporary endocrine society guidance supports daily 400–800 IU vitamin D for older adults to maintain bone health and suggests empiric supplementation in those 75 and older, but it does not recommend high-dose or bolus regimens for cognitive outcomes, reflecting the absence of benefit and potential harm signals [^112YJjwW] [^111cVBdt]. Nutrition-focused dementia prevention recommendations similarly emphasize that single-nutrient high-dose strategies have largely failed to show cognitive benefit, calling for more holistic, adequately powered, and appropriately timed interventions [^1119cKb5].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. The totality of evidence does not support high-dose vitamin D as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease or as a cognitive enhancer in MCI, and large prevention trials with bolus dosing show no cognitive benefit in older adults. While correcting deficiency is reasonable for general health, pushing 25(OH)D into high ranges with high-dose or bolus regimens has not improved cognition and may increase falls, so routine high-dose use for AD is not justified [^116V6niv] [^1164rudn] [^111cVBdt].

> I should confirm practical guidance. For patients with AD or MCI who are vitamin D deficient, repletion to standard sufficiency targets (typically 20–30 ng/mL) using daily 800–2,000 IU is reasonable for bone and general health, but escalation to high-dose bolus regimens solely for cognition should be avoided. If supplementation is pursued, monitor 25(OH)D and calcium, and individualize based on comorbidities and medications [^1122DPBV] [^112YJjwW]. For those already taking high-dose vitamin D, I need to ensure we discuss tapering to guideline-concordant daily dosing to mitigate fall risk and other potential harms [^1153hWLu].

> Finally, I should identify research gaps so we don't prematurely close the book. Future work should test whether sustained correction of deficiency earlier in the disease course, perhaps in preclinical or prodromal stages, changes trajectories, and should distinguish effects by baseline 25(OH)D status, genetic variation in vitamin D pathways, and formulation (D3 versus D2), while avoiding bolus dosing that may obscure benefits or cause harm [^1119cKb5] [^112iPFYu] [^111cVBdt].

High-dose vitamin D is **not recommended** for Alzheimer's disease because randomized trials show **no cognitive benefit** and guidelines advise against high-dose regimens due to safety concerns [^116V6niv] [^1153hWLu]. Observational studies link low vitamin D to higher dementia risk, but **causality is unproven** and Mendelian randomization suggests no direct cognitive benefit from higher vitamin D [^113PCjzL] [^1132sa7W]. High-dose vitamin D may increase falls and fractures, so routine use for AD is not supported [^1123X8bZ] [^1153hWLu]. Maintain sufficiency (25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL) with standard doses (800–2,000 IU/day) if deficient, and avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without medical supervision [^1122DPBV] [^114pZVBG].

## Evidence from clinical trials

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- **SYNERGIC trial (2023)**: In adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 10,000 IU vitamin D three times weekly for 20 weeks showed no added cognitive benefit when combined with exercise and cognitive training; the cognitive gains were driven by exercise and cognitive training, not vitamin D [^1164rudn] [^116LoTvd].

- **D-Health trial (2023)**: Monthly 60,000 IU vitamin D for 5 years in 21,315 older adults did not improve cognitive function or reduce cognitive impairment, indicating no preventive benefit in a largely replete population [^116V6niv].

- **Bolus-dose RCT (2019)**: A single 100,000 IU dose followed by 20,000 IU weekly for 4 months in mid-aged and older adults produced no cognitive improvement despite raising 25(OH)D levels [^113nA5pb].

- **AD RCT (2019)**: Daily 800 IU for 12 months in Alzheimer's patients improved some cognitive scores and reduced amyloid-related biomarkers, but this was standard-dose and not high-dose; benefits may reflect correction of deficiency rather than a pharmacologic effect [^113wiAha].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show that **vitamin D supplementation does not significantly improve cognitive outcomes** in older adults, including those with MCI or dementia [^116nH6HZ] [^113qkGLc]. Observational associations between low vitamin D and cognitive decline are consistent, but **RCTs have not confirmed causality or efficacy** [^116nH6HZ] [^113qkGLc].

---

## Safety concerns and risks

High-dose vitamin D carries **meaningful safety concerns** in older adults:

- **Increased fall risk**: Monthly 60,000 IU dosing increased falls in older adults, particularly shortly after dosing [^1123X8bZ].

- **Increased fracture risk**: High-dose bolus regimens are associated with a modest increase in fracture risk, estimated at ~0.5% absolute increase [^1153hWLu] [^111cVBdt].

- **Hypercalcemia and renal effects**: Excessive intake can cause hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and renal impairment, especially with prolonged high-dose use [^114pZVBG].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines consistently advise against high-dose vitamin D for cognitive indications:

- **Endocrine Society (2024)**: Recommends daily 400–800 IU for older adults and advises against intermittent high-dose regimens due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^112YJjwW] [^111cVBdt].

- **Nutrition for Dementia Prevention Working Group (2022)**: Concludes that single-nutrient high-dose strategies, including vitamin D, have not shown benefit for cognition and may be harmful [^1119cKb5].

- **American Psychiatric Association**: Does not recommend vitamin D supplementation for AD treatment or prevention [^notfound].

---

## Biological plausibility and mechanistic considerations

Vitamin D has plausible neuroprotective mechanisms — including anti-inflammatory effects, amyloid clearance, and neurotrophic support — yet **clinical translation has been disappointing**, likely due to timing, dosing, and population selection [^116iufRJ] [^115DKRQu]. Benefits may be limited to correcting deficiency rather than pharmacologic enhancement beyond normal levels [^115xc9NB].

---

## Population-specific considerations

- **Baseline vitamin D status**: Benefits are most plausible in deficient individuals; repletion to ≥ 20 ng/mL is reasonable, but supraphysiologic levels are not beneficial and may be harmful [^1122DPBV] [^111UgkFB].

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older adults with renal impairment, hypercalcemia, or fall risk should avoid high-dose regimens [^notfound].

- **Genetic factors**: VDR or GC polymorphisms may modulate response, but evidence is insufficient to guide high-dose use [^111TzTqu].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

High-dose vitamin D is **not recommended** for Alzheimer's disease due to a lack of cognitive benefit and potential safety risks. Maintain sufficiency (25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL) with standard doses (800–2,000 IU/day) if deficient, and avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without medical supervision. Routine high-dose use for AD prevention or treatment is unsupported and may be harmful [^116V6niv] [^1153hWLu].

It will also be important to determine whether vitamin D insufficiency triggers AD (i.e. results in a pathological dysfunction of the brain leading to AD) or whether it removes protection of the CNS against AD. Just enough supplements to correct vitamin D insufficiency should be sufficient if vitamin D is a neuroprotectant, although high to very high dose of supplements should be used if vitamin D controls the CNS, with the aim of boosting mental faculties. Also, if vitamin D insufficiency explains partially the pathological process of AD, it may also enhance the efficacy of standard anti-dementia treatments or account for the resistance to these treatments. In line with this, a 6-month controlled trial showed that the combination of memantine+vitamin D was superior to memantine alone and vitamin D alone in preventing cognitive decline among AD patients. Even preliminary, this result certainly engages clinicians to replenish vitamin D before starting anti-dementia treatments or at least to use vitamin D as an adjunct to these treatments.

An appropriate supplementation according to baseline levels

Since recommendations regarding the use of cholecalciferol supplementation to reach optimal levels of 25(OH)D in humans are under debate, possible conversion of doses from animals to humans might be considered in the context of neurological diseases. Indeed, animal studies show improvement of cognitive function in animal models of aging or AD with specific doses of vitamin D. However, the method for translating doses from animal models to human clinical trials should be carefully considered. Deriving interspecies equivalents for therapeutic interventions has usually been done using Body Surface Area scaling; however, it appears that this might not be as adequate as advanced allometric and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling for animal-to-human dosage conversion. This is particularly relevant in the case of vitamin D supplementation, as assessing the "pharmacologically active dose" required in regards to brain function is of great need.

Daily intake of 800 IU is the current recommendation of the IOM for people aged 70 years and older based on estimates that this dose will produce or exceed a threshold of 25(OH)D of 20 ng/mL in 97.5% of people. A randomized double blind study of elderly nursing home residents showed that after 16 weeks of 800 IU/day of vitamin D3, 25(OH)D levels were 33 ng/mL. There was little difference between an 800 IU/day and 2,000 IU/day supplementation except for one participant who did not reach 20 ng/mL under the 800 IU/day regimen indicating that some individuals need higher doses. With 2,000 IU/day, no one reached 50 ng/ml or higher. This study also underlined the complex relationship between baseline 25(OH)D status and responses to supplemental vitamin D. When using doses of 800 IU, 2,000 IU, or 4,000 IU/day, increases in 25(OH)D were consistently higher in those with the lowest baseline.

On top of the mechanisms discussed above concerning the neuroprotective activities of vitamin D during aging or in an AD-like context (Fig. 2), a certain number of hypotheses need to be tested. These are based on the common pathways altered in AD and known to be targets of 1,25(OH)D in the brain or elsewhere. These include action on miRNAs, TLRs, angiogenesis, glycation, and oxidative stress, all these processes being altered in aging brains and particularly in AD. The road to unraveling the mechanisms of action of vitamin D in an aging brain is a long one, as it is now clear that this misnamed vitamin is a potent neurosteroid with pleiotropic actions that are tissue-, time-, individual-, dose-, and pathological context-specific. Due to its capacity to interact with both nuclear and membrane receptors, the downstream effects of vitamin D supplementation are multiple and crosstalks between various signaling pathways render its study rather complex. It is therefore not surprising that clinical observations lead to contradictory results as we are only starting to discover the full potential of this steroid hormone in the nervous system.

### Monthly high-dose vitamin D treatment to prevent functional decline… [^1123X8bZ]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

In this trial, we investigated our hypothesis that higher monthly doses of vitamin D or a combination with calcifediol would increase levels of 25D in most study participants to at least 30 ng/mL and thereby reduce the risk of functional decline. For our study population, we selected seniors 70 years and older with a prior fall, who are a high-risk group for vitamin D deficiency and functional decline. The changes for the 60 000 IU group and the 24 000 IU plus calcifediol group vs the 24 000 IU group were significant at 6 and 12 months. As summarized in Table 2, the percentage of participants with achieved 25D levels of at least 30 ng/mL was significantly higher at 12 months in the 60 000 IU group and the 24 000 IU plus calcifediol group compared with the 24 000 IU group. At 12 months, seniors reaching moderate 25D levels had the best SPPB score improvement from baseline. However, this increase was not significantly different from that of the highest quartile. Seniors reaching the highest quartile of 25D level at the 12-month follow-up had a 5. 5-fold higher odds of falling compared with those reaching the lowest quartile of
21. 3 to 30. 3 ng/mL of 25D. Furthermore, seniors reaching the highest quartile of 25D level at 12 months had the most falls compared with those reaching the lowest quartile of 25D level.

An unambiguous action on cognitive decline in aging or AD-like animals

Data obtained with vitamin D supplementation of animal models unambiguously show an improvement in memory and cognitive function along with a decrease in several markers of AD pathology. Interestingly, available experimental data points to a more pronounced effect of vitamin D when delivered to aging or AD-like animals. In a recent study, Latimer et al. showed that a high vitamin D3 diet (10,000 IU/Kg/day) lasting 5 to 6 months prevented cognitive decline in aging rats. More specifically, the authors described the superiority of a high diet compared to a low and medium one (100 or 1,000 IU/Kg, respectively) in significantly improving performance in the Morris water maze (MWM), a hippocampal-dependent learning and memory task. At approximately the same time, Briones and Darwish performed subcutaneous injections of 1,25(OH)2D3, for 21 days, to both young and aged rats (6 months and 20 months, respectively) and observed an attenuation of cognitive impairment only in older animals. Both these studies underlie a role for vitamin D supplementation in the preservation of cognitive function in aging rats. Concerning AD, an important number of animal models now allow for understanding and compound testing in order to better apprehend and possibly treat this debilitating disease. Several groups have used these models to test the hypothesis that vitamin D has protective effects in AD. Taghizadeh et al. demonstrated that the absence of vitamin D in the diet of an adult AD rat model intensifies learning and memory deficits measured by the MWM. A second study by Yu and colleagues used young AβPP transgenic (Tg) mice, under a 12 IU/g vitamin D diet and compared their behavior to those under a control (2.4 IU/g) or deficient (0 IU/g) diet from weaning to 6 months of age. They found an amelioration of performance in the MWM for the animals under the higher vitamin D diet compared to the other groups. However, the group does not present data on the effect of a vitamin D enriched diet in non-AD animals. Our group has observed that a 4-month vitamin D3 supplementation in an AD mouse model (5xFAD mice) does not impact memory function at a young age (5 months) when no cognitive deficits are present (unpublished data). Conversely, vitamin D3 rescues working memory deficits at 8 months of age but this effect is only observed in Tg animals and not in aging wild-type (Wt) mice. Similarly, intraperitoneal injections of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 8 weeks in 8-week-old animals restores learning and memory deficits in an AD mouse model but does not affect cognitive function in their Wt counterparts. To our knowledge, the only study demonstrating an effect of vitamin D treatment preferentially in Wt animals is that of Bennett and colleagues. The authors conducted a study based on a vitamin D2-enriched button mushroom diet in Wt and AD Tg mice. Behavioral analysis was carried out after 7 months of supplementation and revealed subtle changes in cognitive function. Vitamin D2 improved cognitive performance more reliably in Wt mice rather than Tg. The main difference with other studies is the use of vitamin D2 rather than D3. Animal studies therefore support the hypothesis that vitamin D action is likely to be age-dependent and show a clear effect of vitamin D supplementation in restoring cognitive deficits in an AD-like context. The mechanisms by which vitamin D can impact AD pathology are yet to be fully elucidated although a number of processes at play during the development of the pathology have been shown to be targeted by the vitamin D signaling system. Considering the mode of action of this steroid hormone, it is likely that its biological function will be multiple, ranging from direct action on amyloidogenesis to restoration of neurotransmission, modulation of inflammation, regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and vascular processes (Fig. 2). Several studies have made important contributions to the understanding of vitamin D mechanism of action in an AD-like brain.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^116R6KAF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

It is noticeable that most trials, showing no cognitive difference in the supplementation arms compared to the comparative arms, have actually included participants with relatively high serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline, possibly above the cerebral needs for vitamin D (if any). Moreover, the comparative arm of several trials continued to receive vitamin D supplements, either as part of the study or as part of routine care. So it will be important in the future to examine the cognitive effect of vitamin D supplementation in populations exhibiting vitamin D insufficiency at baseline. The definition of vitamin D insufficiency is consensually not based on what is called a "population-based reference value" (i.e. normality is the reference range involving 95% of the population) but rather on "health-based reference values" (i.e. normality is the 25(OH)D concentration range that prevents adverse health effects). Defining a "cognition-based reference value" is still the matter of debate.

The nature of the delivered molecule also needs to be considered. The difference in binding affinity of vitamin D2 metabolites to VDBP being weaker than that of vitamin D3, this would lead to a shorter half-life and an increased rate of clearance from circulation. The apparent inefficiency of 25(OH)D2 binding to VDBP may be advantageous in the setting of extra-renal metabolism of 25(OH)D where decreased binding to VDBP may increase the uptake of 25(OH)D2 by target cells. Future studies in animal models may aid in evaluating the relative efficacy of each metabolite in reference to cognitive outcomes. In parallel, human studies should incorporate separate measures for 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 in serum and CSF along with total versus free concentrations of each molecule after supplementation with either metabolite.

CONCLUSION

Vitamin D, produced by the skin under UV stimulation or ingested from food, is now described as a steroid hormone, essential for human health. More recently, accumulating evidence indicate that this hormone is a neurosteroid that may be important in aging and age-related cognitive decline. More precisely, numerous preclinical and clinical studies suggest that hypovitaminosis D may be associated with increased risk of developing AD and dementia, without being a causal agent. Inducing genomic and non genomic effects, vitamin D plays a role on calcium homeostasis, neurotransmission, vascularization, Aβ and Tau accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation, all of which are disturbed in AD. However, vitamin D's pleiotropic action is cell-, tissue-, time-, individual-, dose-, pathological context- and, maybe, gender-dependent. As a result, in view of personalized medicine, future randomized trials should take into account the D-tails of every individual included in the cohorts.

### High-dose vitamin D supplements in older adults… [^111AQ7sQ]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview General Design This Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of high-dose vs. standard dose Vitamin D supplementation aims to prove feasibility of the intervention in a diverse community-recruited cohort and to provide an estimate of the effect sizes of treatment on cognitive change and brain MRI volumetric measures as the main outcomes. We will study 180 elderly participants with longitudinal neuropsychological testing and brain MRI scans over a 3½ year study period. The primary aims are to prove feasibility of the intervention, and the effectiveness of high-dose VitD in correcting VitD insufficiency in this diverse old cohort. Our primary outcome will be correction of VitD insufficiency in all subjects treated with 4, 000 IU daily.

Secondary aims are to provide an estimate of the effect sizes of treatment on cognitive change, and to gather preliminary data relevant to the evidence for moving forward with a potential definitive Phase III study in elderly groups at risk for dementia. Hypothesis 1. 1: Rate of correction of VitD insufficiency is higher after high-dose versus standard dose oral VitD supplementation. Hypothesis 2. 1: High dose VitD supplementation is associated with less cognitive decline in executive function over 3 ½ years than in those receiving the standard dose. Rationale. Published data from our observational study showed a significant difference in rates of decline between those with insufficient or deficient serum VitD levels and those whose levels are in the adequate range.

If high-dose VitD supplementation results in a slowing of cognitive decline, similar to that seen between the decline in the inadequate or deficient group and the adequate group, in addition to evidence of effectiveness and biological mechanism, such a result would support moving on to a Phase III clinical trial for a definitive demonstration of clinical efficacy of high-dose VitD. Aim 3: To compare the effects of high-dose VitD versus standard-dose VitD on key brain, blood and urine biomarkers relevant to healthy brain aging. Hypothesis 3. 1: High dose VitD supplementation is associated with less brain atrophy and less loss of hippocampal volume over 3 ½ years than in those on standard dose VitD.

ANIMAL STUDIES: A NEUROPROTECTIVE ROLE OF VITAMIN D AND ENHANCED COGNITIVE ABILITIES

A clear result linking vitamin D action to aging processes was the generation of VDR knock out mice that presented with signs of premature aging. Since then, an increasing number of experimental studies in animal or cellular models concur to establish that disruption of vitamin D metabolism and action leads to a perturbation of pathways known to be altered in AD and that supplementation with vitamin D rescues a number of AD markers in rodent models.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^117R8rgC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Since its discovery during the epidemic of rickets in the early 1920s, the physiological effects of vitamin D on calcium/phosphorus homeostasis have been thoroughly studied. Along with the understanding of its actions on skeletal diseases and advances in cellular and molecular biology, this misnamed vitamin has gained attention as a potential player in a growing number of physiological processes and a variety of diseases. During the last 25 years, vitamin D has emerged as a serious candidate in nervous system development and function and a therapeutic tool in a number of neurological pathologies. More recently, experimental and pre-clinical data suggest a link between vitamin D status and cognitive function. Human studies strongly support a correlation between low levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and cognitive impairment or dementia in aging populations. In parallel, animal studies show that supplementation with vitamin D is protective against biological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhances learning and memory performance in various animal models of aging and AD. These experimental observations support multiple mechanisms by which vitamin D can act against neurodegenerative processes. However, clinical interventional studies are disappointing and fail to associate increased 25(OH)D levels with improved cognitive outcomes. This review collects the current available data from both animal and human studies and discusses the considerations that future studies examining the effects of vitamin D status on neurocognitive function might consider.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^111yVBz5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, only three prospective studies have investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation in AD patients. A first study by Stein and colleagues consisted, for phase 1, in the administration of 3,000 IU per day of vitamin D2, for 8 weeks, in 13 older patients. The group found that the increased seric levels of 25(OH)D were accompanied by a significant improvement in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) score. However, the second phase of Stein et al.'s study, consisting of a randomized control study in which participants received either physiological doses (1,000 IU per day) or supra-physiological doses (6,000 IU per day) of vitamin D2 for 8 weeks, showed no difference between groups in terms of the ADAS-cog score or the MMSE. However, the very small number of participants in this study along with the shortduration of treatment and possibly the use of vitamin D2 impedes general conclusions to be drawn. The second pre-post study proposed the combination of memantine, a modulator of NMDA receptors, and vitamin D as an effective treatment for improving cognition in AD patients. This pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of combining both treatments for 6 months measured by an increase of MMSE scores compared to the administration of vitamin D or memantine alone. Other clinical trials, based on vitamin D supplementation and assessing cognition decline, as a primary or secondary outcome, are currently performed in aging patients (VITAL-cog, DO HEALTH) or with pathologies such as amnesia(D-cog), Alzheimer's disease (AD-IDEA), Parkinson's disease, and type II diabetes (THINK-D). Details can be found on the website clinicaltrials.gov.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of low vitamin D on cognition [^116nH6HZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

With an aging population and no cure for dementia on the horizon, risk factor modification prior to disease onset is an urgent health priority. Therefore, this review examined the effect of low vitamin D status or vitamin D supplementation on cognition in midlife and older adults without a diagnosis of dementia.

Design

Systematic review and random effect meta-analysis.

Setting

Observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort) studies comparing low and high vitamin D status and interventions comparing vitamin D supplementation with a control group were included in the review and meta-analysis.

Participants

Studies including adults and older adults without a dementia diagnosis were included.

Measurements

Medline (PubMed), AMED, Psych INFO, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for articles until August 2016. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Physiotherapy Evidence Database assessed methodological quality of all studies.

Results

Twenty-six observational and three intervention studies (n = 19–9,556) were included in the meta-analysis. Low vitamin D was associated with worse cognitive performance (OR = 1.24, CI = 1.14–1.35) and cognitive decline (OR = 1.26, CI = 1.09–1.23); with cross-sectional yielding a stronger effect compared to longitudinal studies. Vitamin D supplementation showed no significant benefit on cognition compared with control (SMD = 0.21, CI = -0.05 to 0.46).

Conclusion

Observational evidence demonstrates low vitamin D is related to poorer cognition; however, interventional studies are yet to show a clear benefit from vitamin D supplementation. From the evidence to date, there is likely a therapeutic age window relevant to the development of disease and therefore vitamin D therapy. Longitudinal lifespan studies are necessary to depict the optimal timing and duration in which repletion of vitamin D may protect against cognitive decline and dementia in aging, to better inform trials and practice towards a successful therapy.

Ratings of quality of evidence

We graded the quality of the available evidence in a four-part hierarchy according to the GRADE scheme (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). GRADE assesses the quality of evidence using four grades: high, moderate, low, and very low. Observational studies always start with a rating of low quality of evidence because of the risk of residual confounding but can be upgraded for large treatment effects, dose effect gradients, or if apparent confounding would reduce the observed effect. Criteria for downgrading the quality of evidence are risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. We dually evaluated the overall quality of evidence for each outcome viewed as "critical" for decision-making by the scientific expert panel. We reconciled all disagreements in grades through consensus discussion.

These findings can also inform future studies of vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia for power analyses, appropriate covariates, and effect modification. Future trials should consider differences in sex, race, sun exposure, and APOE status when recruiting participants. Information on dosage of vitamin D supplementation as well as the baseline levels of vitamin D will be essential to further clarify the efficacy and refine the target population for vitamin D supplementation in preventing AD and dementia.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES

The usual course of action for implementing a drug in clinical trials is to study it thoroughly at the preclinical level before moving to human studies. However, as pointed out by the number of clinical and preclinical studies on vitamin D in health and disease, it appears that clinical observations are now accumulating at a faster pace than animal evidence which somewhat impedes the understanding of the basic neurobiology of vitamin D action in the brain. Therefore, future studies, in both animal and cellular models, might consider several factors in order to better understand the mode of action of this steroid hormone in aging and AD pathology.

So far, very few animal studies have concentrated on models of vitamin D deficiency to better mimic what happens in humans. Especially since vitamin D deficiency in early stages of life has been suggested to strongly impact brain function during aging, developing or refining existing models of vitamin D deficiency at different time-points, for varying periods of time, perhaps followed by vitamin D supplementation at various ages might help clarify the impact of such deficiency and when to intervene in relation to cognitive function and AD. Moreover, no animal study, to our knowledge, has compared the effects of vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3 in the context of cognitive impairment nor has assessed possible gender differences in response to vitamin D treatment. Due to the complex pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, it is unlikely that a single event such as vitamin D deficiency is responsible for disease occurrence. However, hypovitaminosis D might represent a real aggravating factor in this context and this deficiency could be easily corrected. Lastly, the use of animal or cellular models with ongoing efforts will undoubtedly help cast light on the mechanisms by which this potent neurosteroid acts on an aging or AD-like brain.

However, although the human pathological and functional characteristics appear similar in animals, it is difficult to model the various causes, insidious onset, and potentially long-term progression of complex diseases such as AD in mice with a lifespan of months rather than decades. As a result, several issues relating to the translation of animal results to human studies can only be addressed through human studies. Keeping in mind the necessity to move toward more personalized interventional medicine, we can cite here some of the key points that need to be assessed in future trials.

VITAMIN D STATUS AND PREVALENCE OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY

Vitamin D nutritional status is currently reflected by serum concentrations of 25(OH)D. Regulation of the circulating levels of 25(OH)D depends mainly on sun exposure and nutritional intake. There are several considerations relating to the topic of an "optimal" vitamin D level. Reaching a consensus on optimal vitamin D requirements is in constant debate as measurement methodologies may differ but primarily due to the diverging views on threshold determination. According to the Endocrine Society, vitamin D deficiency is defined by 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and vitamin D insufficiency as a 25(OH)D of 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L). According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), seric 25(OH)D level of 16 ng/mL (40 nmol/L) is the median population concentration for maximal calcium absorption and overall bone health, while levels of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) covers the needs of 97.5% of the population. However, others consider 25(OH)D values of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) or higher to be adequate. At the higher end of the spectrum, vitamin D intoxication is observed when seric levels of 25(OH)D are greater than 150 ng/mL (374 nmol/L). Recommendations for vitamin D requirements are established on the basis of optimal bone health and not on the extraskeletal functions of this steroid hormone. The assays used for measuring circulating hydroxylated vitamin D do not generally discriminate between the two forms present in the serum or the fractions of free and bound metabolites. Moreover, the recommended doses to obtain adequate levels are also under debate. For example, the IOM recommends for healthy adults 15 to 20 μg of daily vitamin D supplementation while the Endocrine Society suggests 50 μg daily. However there are inter-individual differences in the amount of vitamin D supplementation needed, in order to maintain adequate 25(OH)D levels between individuals of different age, body mass, or ethnicity. A study evaluating vitamin D deficiency among different groups found that 96% of black Americans would be classified as deficient using a threshold of 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). However, these participants had higher bone mineral density and higher calcium levels than white participants. It is suggested that a polymorphism in VDBP results in sufficient bioavailability of 25(OH)D despite its insufficient levels. It therefore remains unanswered what is the optimal 25(OH)D level and if such a level even exists. Furthermore, it remains unexplained to what extent this level is affected by different factors, such as genetic polymorphisms in the VDR, metabolic enzymes or binding proteins, or other environmental determinants and if 25(OH)D serum concentration truly reflects the functional outcome of vitamin D action in other areas than its skeletalfunctions.

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation… [^111BGobu]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Author Affiliations: Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts. Many randomized controlled trials indicate that vitamin D will reduce falls and fractures. Therefore, the hypothesis in the study by Sanders et al1 in this issue of JAMA, that a single annual 500 000-IU oral dose of cholecalciferol would be effective in reducing falls and fractures in older women with 1 or more risk factors for falling was a reasonable one. However, not only was this regimen not effective in lowering risk, it also increased risk of falls and fractures, with the greatest increase occurring during the first 3 months after dosing. An increase in fractures but not falls was reported in another trial in which high-dose ergocalciferol was given intramuscularly each year to men and women 75 years or older.

A potential gender effect

Interestingly, studies performed with female, male, or mixed populations show contrasting results. All studies based on women cohorts report a clear association between hypovitaminosis D and cognitive impairment, while the unique study in men reports no association and reports from both male and female populations are controversial (Table 2). In one study, Annweiler et al. found that low dietary intake of vitamin D (defined as < 35 μ/week, or 400 IU/year) in a large cohort of women of mean age 80.5, was significantly associated with global cognitive performance as measured by the Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ). In a second cross-sectional study, they found that vitamin D deficiency, defined as < 10 ng/mL (< 25 nmol/L), was associated with lower SPMSQ scores in elderly women aged 75 years and older. Conversely, a study among healthy, older Europeans aged 55 to 87 years, demonstrated that seric 25(OH)D concentrations of > 32.1 ng/mL (> 80 nmol/L), considered optimal, were associated with significantly fewer errors in tests of spatial working memory, particularly in women. One 4-year longitudinal study of 6,257 elderly women reports that lower 25(OH)D blood concentrations at baseline were associated with increased incidence of global cognitive decline measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test in elderly women. Importantly, this was not observed in a similar study performed in men exclusively. Association of baseline serum 25(OH)D deficiency with the onset of dementia or AD was also observed in two cohorts of women over 75 years old. However, a post-hoc analysis of the largest clinical trial on this topic, the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D trial, which included over 4,000 women aged 65 and older, found no effect of a 7.8 year supplementation with 100 mg calcium carbonate and 400 IU of vitamin D3 on the incidence of dementia, MCI, or other cognitive measures. Of important note, supplementation with vitamin D during this clinical trial was associated with calcium supplementation. This renders interpretation of results more difficult as it is known that high calcium levels are associated with increased risk of cognitive decline in humans and animals. The dual supplementation could therefore be counterproductive. No interventional study has been performed in men exclusively and 8 pre-post or randomized control trials have been performed in a mixed population (Table 2). Among them, cognitive improvements were found after 8 weeks of supplementation for global cognitive performance and after 4 weeks to 16 months of supplementation for executive functioning. However, these studies were pilot nonrandomized pre-post studies performed in small cohorts of patients. Despite this limitation, the latter findings were consistent with the result of one placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that reported after 6 months an improvement of information processing speed in the supplementation arm compared to the placebo arm. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis concluded that, although cognition favorably evolves in patients receiving vitamin D supplementation ("before and after" approach), the between-group comparison of the cognitive scores at the end of the follow-up ("comparative" approach) do not show better cognitive scores in the supplementation arm compared to the comparative arm. Thus, although, there appears to be a clear link between vitamin D status reflected either by 25(OH)D serum levels or nutritional intake of vitamin D and cognitive function in women, these studies do not allow for comparison of both genders and might not be representative of a general population. Moreover, some studies have shown such associations in mixed population while others report no link (Table 2), forcing us to consider other possible confounders.

### The associations of serum vitamin D status and vitamin D supplements use with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia: a UK biobank based prospective cohort study [^112Y1Lsh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dementia affects over 55 million people worldwide, and this number is predicted to triple by 2050. As a result, the search for effective treatments has led to an explosion of research. Yet, despite these efforts, effective therapeutics for all-cause dementia that can halt or reverse its progression remain elusive. Therefore, the importance of preventing dementia through the control of modifiable risk factors is imperative.

Research into the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests a potential involvement in the modulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, a key factor in AD pathology. Moreover, evidence indicates that vitamin D might provide neuroprotection against Aβ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation.

Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, typically defined by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels of < 30 nmol/L and < 50 nmol/L respectively, have high prevalence rates — 40% in Europe, 24% in the United States, and 37% in Canada. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L may be a risk factor for dementia, specifically for AD. Addressing this may positively influence dementia prevention, especially since dietary supplements can safely and affordably manage it. However, it is essential to mention that many of the included observational studies omitted to consider pivotal confounders, such as outdoor activity duration, seasonal variations in 25(OH)D levels, body mass index (BMI), dietary habits, and smoking status.

### Vitamin D supplementation appears to increase plasma A β 40 in vitamin D insufficient older adults: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^112bzCqH]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Low plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since vitamin D cleared brain Aβ in vitro, this 8-week trial examined whether vitamin D increased plasma Aβ40. Vitamin D insufficient adults (6/18 M/F; 64.3 ± 10.9 y) were randomized to placebo or vitamin (50,000 IU/week) treatments. The vitamin group experienced greater plasma Aβ40 change than controls, +14.9 ± 12.0 and +12.8 ± 12.8 pg/mL (p = 0.045; effect size, 0.228). Change in Aβ40 for older participants (≥ 60 y) was +18.3 ± 33.6 and -3.2 ± 44.5 pg/mL for vitamin (n = 4) and placebo (n = 4) groups (effect size, 0.295). Thus, vitamin D may increase plasma Aβ, particularly in older adults, suggesting decreased brain Aβ.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^112TbN33]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

There is some debate regarding the equivalent bioavailability of vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3. Some authors conclude that vitamin D2 is less efficient in raising serum concentrations of 25(OH)D or producing the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D while others show no difference. Because supplementation or fortification of food with vitamin D is the center of an important debate due to the high prevalence of worldwide insufficiency, it is important to assess the efficacy of each form. Several studies have reported that the administration of vitamin D2 leads to a reduction of total 25(OH)D and, more specifically, of circulating 25(OH)D3, leading to a reduction in the active form 1,25(OH)2D. This is potentially due to a competition between both forms for available 25-hydroxylase activity, the first hydroxylation step necessary in obtaining active vitamin D, although the in vivo regulation of the different 25-hydroxylases is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, it seems that the route of administration (bolus versus daily) may affect the comparison of both vitamin D forms in maintaining plasma 25(OH)D, mainly due to a difference of half-life for each metabolite, theiraffinity for their transporters, hydroxylating enzymes or receptors.

According to the traditional model, steroid hormones bind to nuclear receptors and initiate genomic responses through modulation of transcription. Similarly, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) elicits physiological regulation of gene transcription following binding of its ligand, 1,25(OH)2D and, like other steroid hormone receptors, it can regulate a diverse range of biological activities across many tissues (Fig. 1). Advances in transcriptional research provide data that genomic effects are not the only mechanism of action for vitamin D activity. Rapid effects are also observed after treatment with vitamin D, which can be exerted through both the VDR and other membrane-based receptors such as MARRS (Fig. 1). The biological outcome of these two modes of action is relatively inter-related, and the multiplicity of mechanisms of action associated to the diversity of target tissues render this steroid hormone a complex pleitropicmolecule.

Vitamin D and amyloidogenesis

On top of the observation that vitamin D supplementation leads to improved cognitive function, all the studies in an AD-like context have also shown that vitamin D treatment, regardless of the model tested, the dosage, the molecule chosen, and the time of treatment decreases the amyloid burden, suggesting a link between vitamin D function and amyloidogenesis. The behavioral changes reported in the study by Yu and colleagues were accompanied by a diminished Aβ load, along with an increase in astrocytic reactivity, NGF levels, and decreased TNF α in the brain of treated mice. Interestingly, the authors show a change in AβPP processing, with a variation in AβPP end products depending on the vitamin D regimen. Grimm and collaborators recently studied the impact of a relatively low hypovitaminosis D on AβPP processing in mice and cell cultures. The data reveal an increase in Aβ caused by an increase in β-secretase level and activity, concomitant with a decrease in neprilysin levels. Our team has recently demonstrated that a 5-month vitamin D3 enriched diet decreases the number of amyloid plaques in the frontal cortex, neocortex, and hippocampus of female 5xFAD mice. This reduction is accompanied by decreased astrocytic reactivity and increased microglial activation in the frontal cortex. Moreover, transcriptomic profiling of these brain regions reveals that vitamin D3 supplementation regulates the expression of a large number of genes associated to AD in both Wt and Tg animals. Other clues indicating direct interactions between vitamin D and the amyloid pathway arise from several studies. For instance, overexpression of the VDR or treatment with vitamin D was shown to suppress AβPP transcription in neuroblastoma cells. VDBP, which is increased in thecerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, was also shown to interact directly with Aβ in the brain of both AD patients and animal models. Binding of VDBP with Aβ was associated with reduced aggregation of the amyloid peptide and cellular death in vitro. Overall, the presence of VDBP rescues animal models from synaptic loss and memory deficits induced by Aβ. A team provided extensive work on the crosstalk operated between vitamin D and Aβ signaling pathways. After demonstrating that Aβ treatment of hippocampal and cortical neurons induces VDR repression, they showed that VDR silencing in vitro leads to similar effects to Aβ treatment. Their studies further indicate that vitamin D treatment of cortical neurons reverses the cytotoxic effects induced by Aβ mentioned above as well as prevents upregulation of iNOS. Further in vitro studies examined the effect of vitamin D in combination with memantine on cortical axon degeneration. These two compounds act in a synergistic manner to protect against glutamate or Aβ-induced toxicity in cortical neuronal cultures. Altogether, these findings strongly support a role for vitamin D signaling in reducing amyloidogenesis, one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. Moreover, the putative crosstalk between Aβ pathology and VDR signaling appears to provide neuroprotective mechanisms againstAβ-induced toxicity potentially limiting the decline in cognitive function. This underlies a specific action of vitamin D in preventing or halting cognitive impairment in AD, but what other mechanisms are at play in a "healthy" aging brain?

### Vitamin C and vitamin E for Alzheimer's disease [^1157Q3zJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature on supplemental vitamin C and vitamin E therapy in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Data Sources

Literature retrieval was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-March 2005) using the key words antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-March 2005), Current Contents (1996-March 2005), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1994-March 2005), and Ebsco's Academic Search Elite (1975-March 2005) were searched with the same key words.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles related to the objective that were identified through PubMed were included.

Data Synthesis

Oral supplementation of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and vitamin E (D-alfa-tocopherol acetate) alone and in combination have been shown to decrease oxidative DNA damage in animal studies in vivo, in vitro, and in situ. Recent results of a prospective observational study (n = 4740) suggest that the combined use of vitamin E 400 IU daily and vitamin C 500 mg daily for at least 3 years was associated with the reduction of AD prevalence (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.60) and incidence (HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.99). Contradicting this is a previous prospective observational study (n = 980) evaluating the relationship between 4 years of vitamin C and E intake and the incidence of AD, which detected no difference in the incidence of AD during the 4-year follow-up. Recent meta-analysis results suggest that doses of vitamin E ≥ 400 IU daily for more than one year are associated with increased all-cause mortality. Mega-trial results suggest that vitamin E doses ≥ 400 IU daily for 6.9 years in patients with preexisting vascular disease or diabetes mellitus increase the incidence of heart failure, with no other outcome benefits noted.

Conclusions

In the absence of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials documenting benefits that outweigh recently documented morbidity and mortality risks, vitamin E supplements should not be recommended for primary or secondary prevention of AD. Although the risks of taking high doses of vitamin C are lower than those with vitamin E, the lack of consistent efficacy data for vitamin C in preventing or treating AD should discourage its routine use for this purpose.

### A randomized controlled trial of high-dose vitamin D2 followed by intranasal insulin in Alzheimer's disease [^111QMEpf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Poor vitamin D nutrition is linked with dementia, but vitamin D has not been tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nasal insulin acutely improves cognition and vitamin D upregulates insulin receptor expression and enhances insulin action. In an RCT we examined the effect of high-dose vitamin D followed by nasal insulin on memory and disability in mild-moderate AD. 63 community-dwelling individuals aged > 60 were recruited; 32 with mild-moderate disease (Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 12–24) met entry criteria and were randomized. All took low-dose vitamin D (1000 IU/day) throughout. After run-in (8 weeks), they were randomized to additional high-dose D/placebo for 8 weeks, followed immediately by randomization to nasal insulin (60 IU qid)/placebo for 48 h. Primary outcome measures were Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and Disability Assessment in Dementia (after high-dose D) and ADAS-cog and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical memory (WMS-R LM) for immediate and delayed recall (after nasal insulin). Baseline median (interquartile range, IR) age, MMSE, and ADAS-cog were 77.5 (69–80), 19.5 (17–22), and 25.5 (20–31), respectively. Median 25OHD increased from 49 to 60 nM (p < 0.01) after run-in and was 187 nM after high-dose vitamin D and 72 nM after placebo (p < 0.001). Neither cognition nor disability changed significantly after high-dose D. ADAS-cog improved by a median (IR) of 9 (1–11) with nasal insulin after placebo high-dose vitamin D (p = 0.02), but may represent regression to the mean as WLS-R LM did not change. We conclude that high-dose vitamin D provides no benefit for cognition or disability over low-dose vitamin D in mild-moderate AD.

### Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113S6zb8]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) [CRD42014010199]. Throughout this manuscript, we followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement to report this systematic review.

Literature search

We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and ICONDA from January 1990 to October 2015 to identify relevant publications. We further searched for grey literature using the PsycInfo database for dissertations and theses, the SCOPUS database for conference proceedings, and the Open Grey database. We limited searches to human populations and English or German language. An experienced information specialist developed an appropriate search strategy using a combination of Mesh (Medical subject headings) terms and free-text key words (dementia, sunlight or vitamin D) and ran the searches. The detailed search strategy is presented online in the Additional file 1. Additionally, we complemented electronic searches by checking reference lists from pertinent studies and reviews and contacting experts for their suggestions of relevant articles. We imported all citations into a reference managing database (Endnote X · 6 · 0 · 1) and deleted duplicate publications.

Inclusion criteria

We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, nested case-control studies and systematic reviews on longitudinal studies that investigated the effect of sunlight exposure or vitamin D serum concentrations (as surrogate parameter for sunlight) on prevalence or incidence of dementia including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia (diagnosis based on validated measurement scales) among adults. We did not consider any studies on mild cognitive impairments or any intervention studies on vitamin D supplementation and dementia risk for inclusion. The scientific expert panel for this review deemed prevalence or incidence of dementia as critical outcomes for decision-making.

Study selection

Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-texts against pre-specified criteria. They resolved discrepancies about inclusion or exclusion by consensus or by involving a third reviewer. Studies that were only published as abstract were excluded.

### Effects of memantine and high dose vitamin D on gait in male APP / PS1 Alzheimer's disease mice following vitamin D deprivation [^117Hzs62]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Altered gait is a frequent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as is vitamin D deficiency. Treatment with memantine and vitamin D can protect cortical axons from exposure to amyloid-β and glutamate toxicity, suggesting this combination may mitigate altered gait in AD.

Objective

Investigate the effects of vitamin D deprivation and subsequent treatment with memantine and vitamin D enrichment on gait performance in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.

Methods

Male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were split into four groups (n = 14 each) at 2.5 months of age. A control group was fed a standard diet throughout while the other three groups started a vitamin D-deficient diet at month 6. One group remained on this deficient diet for the rest of the study. At month 9, the other two groups began treatment with either memantine alone or memantine combined with 10 IU/g of vitamin D. Gait was assessed using CatWalk at months 6, 9, 12, and 15.

Results

Vitamin D deprivation led to a 13% increase in hind stride width by month 15 (p < 0.001). Examination of the treatment groups at month 15 revealed that mice treated with memantine alone still showed an increase in hind stride width compared to controls (p < 0.01), while mice treated with memantine and vitamin D did not (p = 0.21).

Conclusion

Vitamin D deprivation led to impaired postural control in the APPswe/PS1dE9 model. Treatment with memantine and vitamin D, but not memantine alone, prevented this impairment. Future work should explore the potential for treatments incorporating vitamin D supplementation to improve gait in people with AD.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^111TzTqu]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The genetic background

One major difference between animal models and humans is the controlled genetic and environment that offers laboratory work. The possibility that individual differences in vitamin D metabolism exist is not to be undermined as polymorphisms in VDR have been reported as potential risk factors for AD. VDR is not the only metabolite required for proper vitamin D action, as the several enzymes involved in metabolism are key to drive functional vitamin D outcome. If polymorphisms or simply decreased activity of these enzymes is present in certain individuals, vitamin D treatment might not be effective. Moreover, it still remains unknown how vitamin D metabolites enter the nervous system, whether it be by passive diffusion or the use of energy-dependent transporters such as megalin. A recent report suggests that sex-specific gene variations in both the VDR and megalin receptor associate with age-related cognitive decline in a relatively large cohort of US citizens. Thus, defects in transport, metabolism, or action of vitamin D metabolites in an individual-dependent manner need to be taken into considerations when implementing adaptive clinical trials possibly based on Bayesian models rather than classical randomized control trials.

Assessing a possible gender effect

Inter-individual differences, especially inter-gender dissimilarities, should also be taken into account. Sex differences in observed associations of megalin SNPs may be related to interaction of megalin with both estrogen and vitamin D and competitive binding of both steroid hormones to this shared endocytic receptor. Our team has recently observed in a mouse model of AD that vitamin D3 treatment impacts male and female mouse differently, at the behavioral level, according to the time frame for supplementation (unpublished data). Moreover, we have shown that vitamin D likely interacts with the estrogen receptor, Esr1, to regulate molecular pathways relevant to AD pathogenesis. A number of studies suggest a strong link between the drop in estrogen levels occurring during menopause and the development of AD. Animal studies could help clarify this matter; however, future clinical trials might consider stratifying results in a gender-specific manner.

### Vitamin D and cognition: an update of the current evidence [^116stmyC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The active form vitamin D is a seco-steroid with multiple neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions in the central nervous system. Robust evidence from studies in animals suggests that vitamin D deficiency may impair brain physiological functioning causing anatomical and behavioral adverse effects. On the other hand, vitamin D has been found to be protective against biological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease and cognition, including amyloid-β deposition, inflammation, calcium homeostasis, and corticosteroid-induced perturbations in cortical areas and the hippocampus. Human studies that examined the relationship between vitamin D status and cognitive function have provided inconclusive results. The majority of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest a potentially protective association, whereas results from clinical trials are mostly negative, or at best, controversial. We review these studies in humans, with particular emphasis on randomized and observational prospective ones.

### Does vitamin D reduce the risk of dementia? [^111WKCdL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding of the role of vitamin D in maintaining optimal health has advanced sharply in the past two decades. There is mounting evidence for beneficial roles for vitamin D in reducing the risk of bone diseases and fractures, many types of cancer, bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, several reports have also been published regarding the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection. This article develops the hypothesis that vitamin D can reduce the risk of developing dementia, presenting the evidence from observational and laboratory studies. The observational evidence includes that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, dental caries, osteoporosis, and periodontal disease, all of which are either considered risk factors for dementia or have preceded incidence of dementia. The laboratory evidence includes several findings on the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection and reducing inflammation. Although this evidence is supportive, there do not appear to be observational studies of incidence of dementia with respect to prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D or vitamin D supplementation. Such studies now appear to be warranted.

### Effect of a single high dose of vitamin D 3 on hospital length of… [^113d7aSM]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured on the day of randomization and on hospital discharge. A, For all patients, a single high dose of vitamin D3 significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared with placebo. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein.

Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly increased from baseline after a single high dose of vitamin D3 vs placebo. After receiving the intervention, 91 of 105 patients in the vitamin D3 group had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL and only 7 patients in the vitamin D3 group had 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. In a post hoc analysis involving patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency at baseline, a single high dose of vitamin D3 significantly increased mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline (from 12. 8 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia: effects of sex, and baseline cognitive status [^113ZVUAM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Currently, more than 50 million people around the world live with dementia and this number will nearly triple by 2050. At present, there is a dearth of highly effective medication for dementia that can stop or reverse the progression of the disease. Interventions based on modifiable risk factors for dementia have been explored as a potential avenue to slow disease progression. Vitamin D deficiency may be a modifiable risk factor and has been recognized as a widespread health problem, with a worldwide prevalence of up to 1 billion. Vitamin D is known to participate in the clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may provide neuroprotection against Aβ‐induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Low levels of serum vitamin D have been associated with a greater risk of dementia and AD. Yet, the role of vitamin D supplementation as a potential intervention has been a subject of debate, and remains in equipoise.

Previous clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and cognition have resulted in conflicting findings, with some reporting that vitamin D improved cognitive function while others reported no effect. A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of nine randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on AD prevention found insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin D supplementation to improve cognitive performance as a proxy for AD prevention. However, dosing variability, small sample sizes, short exposure duration, or short follow‐up times in some of these studies may have contributed to the observed inconsistencies.

Past clinical trials have also varied in terms of the vitamin D formulation. The most used formulation in clinical trials is cholecalciferol, followed by ergocalciferol. While some have regarded these two formulations as interchangeable, recent evidence has shown that cholecalciferol may be more effective than ergocalciferol at raising and maintaining serum vitamin D levels. Another common formulation is calcium–vitamin D, in which the addition of vitamin D (often cholecalciferol) improves calcium absorption. Different vitamin D formulations may have different associations with dementia risk and therefore require further investigation.

Here we assessed dementia‐free older adults longitudinally for the association between vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia, while accounting for demographic, clinical, behavioral, and genetic variables. Three vitamin D formulations were explored: calcium–vitamin D, cholecalciferol, and ergocalciferol. Potential interactions between vitamin D exposure and relevant model covariates were further investigated. We hypothesized that exposure to any type of vitamin D supplement would be associated with lower dementia incidence.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^115xc9NB]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Our results align with a 2022 meta-analysisshowing a significant effect of multidomain interventions in MCI for improving global cognition, executive function, and episodic memory. Interestingly, only 7 of the 28 trials included in the meta-analysis combined aerobic-resistance exercise with cognitive training and none of them showed that the multidomain intervention has a larger effect than exercise alone. Our trial is to our knowledge the first to show a greater effect of a multidomain intervention over exercise alone. The lack of cognitive improvements in previous MCI multidomain interventional trials could be related to the substantial heterogeneity among intervention protocols, as well as a lack of meaningful exercise progression.

The lack of improvement with vitamin D may be related to normal-high serum values (greater than 70 nmol/L) in our participants at enrollment, whereas benefits of vitamin D supplementation may only occur in the presence of severe 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (below 30 nmol/L). We could not perform a subanalysis by deficiency status as only 4 participants were severely deficient, but this should be a target for future research since vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired executive function and progression to dementia.

Exercise training cessation may induce detraining effects, but maintenance of cognitive improvements was reported in short follow-ups. In this trial, ADAS-Cog-13 improvements diminished slightly at 12-month follow-up but did not revert to baseline levels for arms 1, 2, and 3. Such findings suggest potential maintenance of the cognitive improvements up to 6-month postintervention for exercise with cognitive training or vitamin D.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^117UUq5N]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

A positive effect on executive functions and not episodic memory

As described above, there is robust evidence that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with cognitive impairment as a whole among older adults. However, it is not fully elucidated which domain-specific cognitive functions are disturbed in the case of vitamin D insufficiency and explain the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with the composite cognitive scores. For instance, as mentioned previously, the contradictory studies by McGrathet al. Tolppanen et al. and Llewellyn et al. based on the cohort from the NHANES III survey might be representative of the different cognitive measures incorporated for analysis. In the work by Llewellyn et al. the authors found an association of 25(OH)D with cognitive impairment calculated as a composite score, i.e. a global measure of cognitive performance assessing both memory, learning, orientation, and attention. In contrast, in the initial observations by McGrath et al. and Tolppanen et al. the authors used only a "memory and learning score", and found inconclusive results, making it unlikely that episodic memory is the domain-specific cognitive function primarily altered in the case of vitamin D insufficiency. A meta-analysis was consistent with this assumption, and showed that the association between vitamin D insufficiency and episodic memory remains uncertain due to modest and clinically non-relevant results. In contrast, this meta-analysis provided compelling evidence that lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations predict executive dysfunction. This hypothesis is corroborated by the findings of Buell and colleagues investigating elders (aged > 65) receiving home health services. The authors found that cognitive performance, particularly executive function and not memory, was associated with circulating vitamin D of 50 to 75 nmol/L. An interventional study by Annweiler and colleagues also demonstrated that supplementing elderly individuals with vitamin D3 during 16 months improved executive function. Executive functions refer to a heterogeneous set of high-level processes that control and regulate other abilities and behaviors. To override this heterogeneity, a more recent study aimed to determine which executive subfunction was disturbed in the case of vitamin D insufficiency and found a decrease in mental shifting, but neither in cognitive inhibition nor in information updating, among community-dwelling older adults with vitamin D insufficiency. Mental shifting is the ability to adjust thinking or attention in response to changing goals and/or environmental stimuli in order to behave appropriately. This may thus help to better understand the involvement of vitamin D in the cognitive decline and in the course of dementia. However, to make firm conclusions about the domain-specific cognitive functions affected by vitamin D insufficiency, further studies using a universal battery of cognitive measures will help decipher the subtle specificities by which vitamin D levels are associated to cognitive outcome.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function and blood A β-related biomarkers in older adults with Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113wiAha]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our study aimed to assess the effect of a 12-month vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function and amyloid beta (Aβ)-related biomarkers in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 210 AD patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Participants received 12-month 800IU/day of vitamin D or starch granules as placebo. Tests of cognitive performance and Aβ-related biomarkers were measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant improvements in plasma Aβ42, APP, BACE1, APPmRNA, BACE1mRNA (p < 0.001) levels and information, arithmetic, digit span, vocabulary, block design and picture arrange scores (p < 0.05) in the intervention group over the control group. According to mixed-model analysis, vitamin D group had significant increase in full scale IQ during follow-up period (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Daily oral vitamin D supplementation (800IU/day) for 12 months may improve cognitive function and decrease Aβ-related biomarkers in elderly patients with AD. Larger scale longer term randomised trials of vitamin D are needed.

### A brief history of the progress in our understanding of genetics and lifestyle, especially diet, in the risk of Alzheimer's disease [^116cJjwf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D

Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that accomplishes most of its genetic effects though the binding of the hormonal metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) to vitamin D receptors coupled to cell nuclei. The benefits of vitamin D extend to many health outcomes, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, DM, infectious diseases, pregnancy and birth outcomes. Supplementation of 2000 IU/day (50 mcg/day) to achieve a 25(OH)D concentration of 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) is recommended. Thus, it would be expected, and has been demonstrated, that vitamin D also reduces risk of AD.

By 2019, five prospective studies and one cross-sectional study of serum 25(OH)D concentration and incidence of AD had been conducted. A total of 10,884 participants were included. The meta-analysis HR of AD for < 25 ng/mL versus > 25 ng/mL was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.09–2.33). However, since the apparent effect of outcomes related to serum 25(OH)D concentration decreases with increasing follow-up time, the actual HR is higher.

An RCT investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function and was conducted in China. Half of the 210 AD patients in the trial were given 800 IU/d vitamin D. During the 12-month trial, mean serum 25(OH)D concentration increased from 18.8 ± 2.9 ng/mL to 23.5 ± 3.1 ng/mL. Significant improvements in many cognitive function tests were found in the treatment group, but significant decreases were found in the control group. In addition, modeled full-scale IQ increased from 91.4 ± 8.5 to 92.3 ± 7.9 in the treatment group but declined from 88.4 ± 9.3 to 82.5 ± 8.4 in the control group (p < 0.001).

Another way to determine whether vitamin D has an effect on health outcomes is through Mendelian randomization studies. A 2016 article reported the Mendelian randomization analysis for 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms that described 2.44% of the variance in 25(OLH)D, a one-standard deviation decrease in the natural log-transformed 25(OH)D increased AD risk by 25% [OR = 1.25 (95% CI, 1.03–1.51)].

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^112HH5KK]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of such definitions, it has been estimated that 1 billion people worldwide suffer vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, although this prevalence is still uncertain and difficult to account for. According to a recent systematic review, this global public health issue varies strongly depending on geographical location, age, and gender, and it appears that all subgroups of population are at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Another systematic review of 195 vitamin D studies involving more than 168,000 individuals from 44 countries reported that 37% of the participants had 25(OH)D seric concentrations below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and only 11.9% were above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). Within these 1 billion people affected by vitamin D insufficiency, elderly people seem particularly at risk, especially when institutionalized or in hospitals. For instance, in Europe and the USA, at latitudes higher than 40°, between 40% and 90% of elderly people, depending on the definition of deficiency considered, suffer from hypovitaminosis D. This high prevalence in the elderly community can be explained by several factors: decreased sun exposure and diminished levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol within the epidermis leading to reduced dermal production of vitamin D, poorer dairy and vitamin D intake, alteration of vitamin D metabolism due to renal or hepatic failure, and increased catabolism due to medication (immunosuppressors, glucocorticoids, antiepileptics). A deficiency in vitamin D has been linked to many human diseases, particularly those that are age-related, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), cancer, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and various inflammatory disorders. Hypovitaminosis D is therefore not to be undermined, not only for optimal bone health, but also in regards of all cause mortality, as pointed out by a recent systematicreview.

### Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and cognitive impairment in the women's health initiative [^115dNfzY]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the effects of vitamin D and calcium on cognitive outcomes in elderly women.

Design

Post hoc analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Forty Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical centers across the United States.

Participants

Four thousand one hundred forty-three women aged 65 and older without probable dementia at baseline who participated in the WHI Calcium and Vitamin D Trial and the WHI Memory Study.

Intervention

Two thousand thirty-four women were randomized to receive 1,000 mg of calcium carbonate combined with 400 IU of vitamin D(3) (treatment) and 2,109 to placebo.

Measurements

Primary: classifications of probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on a four-phase protocol that included central adjudication. Secondary: global cognitive function and individual cognitive subtests.

Results

Mean age of participants was 71. During a mean follow-up of 7.8 years, 39 participants in the treatment group and 37 in the placebo group developed incident dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71–1.74, P = 0.64). Likewise, 98 treatment participants and 108 placebo participants developed incident MCI (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.72–1.25, P = 0.72). There were no significant differences in incident dementia or MCI or in global or domain-specific cognitive function between groups.

Conclusion

There was no association between treatment assignment and incident cognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of vitamin D and calcium separately, on men, in other age and ethnic groups, and with other doses.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^1164rudn]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D may enhance cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Objective

To determine whether aerobic-resistance exercises would improve cognition relative to an active control and if a multidomain intervention including exercises, computerized cognitive training, and vitamin D supplementation would show greater improvements than exercise alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial (the SYNERGIC Study) was a multisite, double-masked, fractional factorial trial that evaluated the effects of aerobic-resistance exercise, computerized cognitive training, and vitamin D on cognition. Eligible participants were between ages 65 and 84 years with MCI enrolled from September 19, 2016, to April 7, 2020. Data were analyzed from February 2021 to December 2022.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 5 study arms and treated for 20 weeks: arm 1 (multidomain intervention with exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D), arm 2 (exercise, cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), arm 3 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D), arm 4 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), and arm 5 (control group with balance-toning exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D). The vitamin D regimen was a 10 000 IU dose 3 times weekly.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were changes in ADAS-Cog-13 and Plus variant at 6 months.

Results

Among 175 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [6.6] years; 86 [49.1%] women), 144 (82%) completed the intervention and 133 (76%) completed the follow-up (month 12). At 6 months, all active arms (ie, arms 1 through 4) with aerobic-resistance exercise regardless of the addition of cognitive training or vitamin D, improved ADAS-Cog-13 when compared with control (mean difference, -1.79 points; 95% CI, -3.27 to -0.31 points; P = 0.02; d = 0.64). Compared with exercise alone (arms 3 and 4), exercise and cognitive training (arms 1 and 2) improved the ADAS-Cog-13 (mean difference, -1.45 points; 95% CI, -2.70 to -0.21 points; P = 0.02; d = 0.39). No significant improvement was found with vitamin D. Finally, the multidomain intervention (arm 1) improved the ADAS-Cog-13 score significantly compared with control (mean difference, -2.64 points; 95% CI, -4.42 to -0.80 points; P = 0.005; d = 0.71). Changes in ADAS-Cog-Plus were not significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this clinical trial, older adults with MCI receiving aerobic-resistance exercises with sequential computerized cognitive training significantly improved cognition, although some results were inconsistent. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect. Our findings suggest that this multidomain intervention may improve cognition and potentially delay dementia onset in MCI.

### High-dose B vitamin supplementation and cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease: a randomized controlled trial [^111sQNmv]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Blood levels of homocysteine may be increased in Alzheimer disease (AD) and hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to disease pathophysiology by vascular and direct neurotoxic mechanisms. Even in the absence of vitamin deficiency, homocysteine levels can be reduced by administration of high-dose supplements of folic acid and vitamins B(6) and B(12). Prior studies of B vitamins to reduce homocysteine in AD have not had sufficient size or duration to assess their effect on cognitive decline.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of B vitamin supplementation in the treatment of AD.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of high-dose folate, vitamin B(6), and vitamin B(12) supplementation in 409 (of 601 screened) individuals with mild to moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 14 and 26, inclusive) and normal folic acid, vitamin B(12), and homocysteine levels. The study was conducted between February 20, 2003, and December 15, 2006, at clinical research sites of the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study located throughout the United States.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups of unequal size to increase enrollment (60% treated with high-dose supplements [5 mg/d of folate, 25 mg/d of vitamin B(6), 1 mg/d of vitamin B(12)] and 40% treated with identical placebo); duration of treatment was 18 months.

Main Outcome Measure

Change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog).

Results

A total of 340 participants (202 in active treatment group and 138 in placebo group) completed the trial while taking study medication. Although the vitamin supplement regimen was effective in reducing homocysteine levels (mean [SD], -2.42 [3.35] in active treatment group vs -0.86 [2.59] in placebo group; P < .001), it had no beneficial effect on the primary cognitive measure, rate of change in ADAS-cog score during 18 months (0.372 points per month for placebo group vs 0.401 points per month for active treatment group, P = 0.52; 95% confidence interval of rate difference, -0.06 to 0.12; based on the intention-to-treat generalized estimating equations model), or on any secondary measures. A higher quantity of adverse events involving depression was observed in the group treated with vitamin supplements.

Conclusion

This regimen of high-dose B vitamin supplements does not slow cognitive decline in individuals with mild to moderate AD.

TABLE 1
Summary of the major dietary sources of nutrition and their mechanisms of improving cognition.

Among the clinical studies on the effects of different vitamin interventions in AD, the largest body of evidence supports the positive effects of vitamin D. In vitro and in vivo experiments have confirmed that vitamin D prevents neuronal death by enhancing calcium homeostasis and activating macrophages to clear Aβ plaques and reduce oxidative stress (Table 1). A previous study on APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency exacerbates AD‐like pathology by promoting inflammatory stress, increasing Aβ production, and enhancing tau phosphorylation by reducing antioxidant capacity in the brain. However, these damages tend to occur with advanced age or later stage in AD, and only high levels of supplemental vitamin D provided prior to the onset of major symptoms can effectively ameliorate AD working memory and endogenous neurogenesis. The timing of early intervention is also important. Indeed, a longitudinal follow‐up study with an average of 5.8 years found that subjects with the highest intake of food‐sourced vitamin D had a significantly lower risk of dementia than those with the lowest intake, consistent with findings from interventional studies. Similarly, meta‐analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have shown that higher serum 25(OH)D levels, the primary form of vitamin D stored in the body, are associated with a lower risk of AD and vice versa. However, other studies have reported no significant association between vitamin D levels and cognitive function in patients with AD. These conflicting results may be attributed to the study design, including the small sample size and relatively short observation period. In addition, genetic factors may play a role, as vitamin D requires binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) for its biological function, and polymorphisms in the VDR gene affect vitamin D function. A meta‐analysis revealed that the VDR ApaI (rs7975232) and BsmI (rs1544410) gene polymorphisms are significant predictors of MCI, while TaqI (rs731236) gene polymorphisms may predict AD. The effects of the therapeutic interventions involving vitamin D supplementation vary owing to genetic differences among individuals. Furthermore, vitamin D reduces psychiatric symptoms in patients with AD. The molecular mechanism involved was later revealed through pharmacogenomic analysis, and high‐impact genes were identified, including the calcium homeostasis‐associated genes Notch Receptor 4 (NOTCH4), Catechol‐O‐Methyltransferase (COMT), Calcium Voltage‐Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 C (CACNA1C) and Dopamine Receptor D3 (DRD3). This finding emphasizes the critical role of vitamin D–mediated calcium‐related signaling pathways in the development of psychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and provides new directions for drug development.

### Trends in use of high-dose vitamin D supplements, 1999–2014… [^114pZVBG]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

However, a 2011 Institute of Medicine report concluded that vitamin D was beneficial for bone health but evidence was insufficient for extraskeletal health. 1 Several large-scale trials are ongoing to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on extraskeletal outcomes. 2 The IOM report noted possible harm for intakes above the tolerable upper limit, which is the highest level of intake likely to pose no risk of adverse effects for most adults.

1. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D is 600 IU/d for adults 70 years or younger and 800 IU/d for those older than 70 years. The tolerable upper limit is 4000 IU/d; beyond this level risk of toxic effects increases. 1 Multivitamins typically contain about 400 IU/d; consumption of 1000 IU or more daily likely indicates intentionally seeking supplemental vitamin D.

From 1999 through 2014 the number of US adults taking daily vitamin D supplements of 1000 IU or more and 4000 IU or more increased. Overall, 3% of the population exceeded the tolerable upper limit of 4000 IU daily, and may be at risk of adverse effects as a consequence, and 18% exceeded 1000 IU daily, likely indicating intentionally seeking supplemental vitamin D. These findings extend a prior NHANES report documenting an increase in daily vitamin D supplement intake of 600 IU or more, particularly among women, non-Hispanic white populations, and older persons from 1988 through 2010. 4 Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have also modestly increased over this time frame. 4 One limitation of the study is that data were self-reported; however, participants were asked to bring supplement bottles to aid in reporting. Also, the design was serial cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, and clinical outcomes were not available.

Although research has emphasized possible benefits of vitamin D, high dosages pose potential risks. 1 A randomized clinical trial with high-dose vitamin D supplementation found increased risk of fractures and falls, 5 and an increased risk of kidney stones has been found with vitamin D taken in combination with calcium. 6 Some epidemiologic investigations have reported adverse associations of high 25D levels with prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and all-cause mortality. 1.

VITAMIN D AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

A major public health problem is the progression of dementia and noncommunicable diseases such as AD. AD is a neurodegenerative condition characterized clinically by progressive cognitive decline and, histologically, by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The major component of senile plaques is the amyloid-β protein (Aβ), which is produced by the sequential proteolysis of a ubiquitous transmembrane protein, amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). Accumulation of Aβ, accompanied by increased inflammatory responses in the brain, is now viewed as a direct cause of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. It is estimated that over 25 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, with a predicted 5 million new cases per year. The etiology of the disease is still not fully understood. The first paper suggesting a link between vitamin D and AD dates back to 1992 when Sutherland and colleagues reported decreased VDR mRNA levels in the hippocampus of AD patients. It is now relatively well established that patients with AD present lower concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D when compared to matched controls. Moreover, a consequential number of genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in the VDR or megalin genes that are associated to increased risks of cognitive decline or AD. The first study suggesting a possible genetic association between the VDR and AD dates back to 2007, where the authors indicate that a polymorphism in the VDR region increases the risk of AD by 2.3 times. Additionally, it appears that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene might be a cause for some of the alterations in the vitamin D-VDR pathway. Genotyping of 563 participants over 85 years old for 5 different polymorphisms in the VDR gene revealed an association between gene variance and age-related changes in cognitive functioning. More specifically, carriers of BamI and TaqI polymorphisms presented with worse cognitive functioning unlike carrier of the ApaI variant. Examination of ApaI and TaqI gene polymorphisms in 255 AD cases and 260 cognitively screened elderly controls revealed that the presence of each of these haplotypes was associated with the risk of AD. More recently, the frequency of VDR polymorphisms TaqI, ApaI, FokI and BsmI were investigated in 108 AD patients versus 77 healthy controls of the Lower Silesian population cohort. The study did not reveal any significant difference between the two groups for frequency of the TaqI, Fok1 or BsmI polymorphisms. However, the frequency for allele A of ApaI was higher in the control group, which was later associated with a 30% lower risk of AD in Polish and British populations study. The authors note an important difference of risk alleles for these VDR polymorphisms depending on the population studied, suggesting a dependency on ethnic origin and climatic conditions. Another study by Wang and colleagues demonstrated a strong association between a SNP within the transcription factor Cdx-2 binding site and late-onset AD (492 AD cases versus 496 controls). The authors show that the risk allele for CDX2 is associated with lower VDR promoter activity. It was found that the frequency of "TaubF" haplotype (alleles of TaqI, ApaI, Tru9I, BsmI and FokI, respectively) was significantly higher in the patient group with AD compared to the controls and can be considered a risk factor for the disease. Finally, sex-specific gene variations in the VDR and megalin genes have been shown to modify age-related cognitive decline in a cohort of US adults aged 50 years and older.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^116Ao4jE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Although UVB sunlight is the major source of vitamin D for humans, about 20% of our supply can be obtained from diet. Among the various forms of vitamin D, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) dominate the scene. Vitamin D2 is produced photochemically by plants and fungi while vitamin D3 is synthesized in the deep layers of the skin in animals (Fig. 1). Both forms, once ingested, are metabolized in the same manner. Cholimicrons from the intestines bind vitamin D and transport it to the lymphatic tissue before entering blood circulation. Once it has reached blood circulation, vitamin D is activated, stored or distributed to its target tissues. In humans and rats, the primary storage sites of unmetabolized vitamin D are adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The classic vitamin D endocrine system is characterized by two successive hydroxylations, the first being catalyzed by 25-hydroxylases such as CYP2R1 or CYP27A1 in the liver to produce 25(OH)D and the second by CYP27B1 in the kidneys, ultimately producing the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D (Fig. 1). Thus, both non-hydroxylated and hydroxylated forms of vitamin D can be found in blood. Like other steroid hormones, transport of vitamin D metabolites in blood circulation is dependent on binding to serum proteins such as vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) or albumin. VDBP binds vitamin D and other related metabolites such as 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)D, with high affinity. 25(OH)D bound to VDBP accounts for 99.9% of total circulating 25(OH)D and allows for increased half-life of the metabolite. The association between 25(OH)D and VDBP is essential for the endocrine renal synthesis of active vitamin D metabolites. Indeed, the uptake of 25(OH)D bound to VDBP into the renal proximal tubule cells has been shown to engage the endocytic receptor megalin. This large transmembrane protein acts as a cell surface receptor for VDBP which results in internalization of the 25(OH)D-VDBP complex and conversion of precursor 25(OH)D into the active form by action of CYP27B1. We also now know that many tissues other than the kidney are capable of paracrine/autocrine regulation of 25(OH)D metabolism with the presence of both hydroxylating enzymes and the receptor in many cell types. The mechanism by which 25(OH)D is distributed to these various target tissues is not yet fully elucidated. Since protein bound vitamin D metabolites have limited access to target cells, unless endocytic receptors such as megalin or cubilin are present, it is generally believed that it is the remaining free fractions of 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)2D that enter target cells by diffusion. However, due to the disparity between likely amounts of free hormone available for passive diffusion and the levels required to efficiently occupy intracellular target receptors, this "free hormone hypothesis" needs furtherinvestigation.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^116Jzm4a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

### Normal vitamin levels and nutritional indices in Alzheimer's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia with normal body mass indexes [^115nrZdu]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The satisfactory vitamin concentrations found in our patients with normal BMI values and stable weight over time, were likely attained either from following normal nutritional patterns with daily hot meals and regular fish meals, or from regular use of vitamins and supplements, especially fish oil, which was introduced in early childhood for many, in contrast to Shartenstein et al. who in their one-year follow-up study, found suboptimal diets among patients with early dementia compared to in cognitively healthy age-matched controls. Low vitamin concentrations may thus occur as a consequence of changes in dietary patterns towards unhealthy compositions of food intake, especially in more advanced dementia.

Our results may have also been influenced by the fact that vitamin levels — including B12 and folate and, in the later years, vitamin D — are controlled and supplemented as part of the routine assessment and follow-up of older people in Norway. Thus, our findings cannot exclude the possibility that targeted vitamin supplementation can act as a modifying measure, although it is less likely that vitamin intake can prevent dementia onset. However, the unfavorable results in some intervention studies could be due to supplementation with only a few of the many involved nutrients, insufficient dosages, or supplementation too late in the disease course as AD has a long latency period, slow progression, and vague symptoms during its very early preclinical stages, making it difficult to determine appropriate timing for vitamin supplementation before substantial brain damage has occurred. Reduced brain atrophy in MCI patients who received high-dosesupplementation with vitamins B6, B12, and folate — especially among patients showing high concentrations of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids found by the OPTIMA group is promising. There is also some evidence of cognitive improvement in MCI patients with high homocysteine levels who received high-dose supplementation with vitamin B. However, these findings are not yet sufficient to guide specific dietary advice, they are in line with other findings suggesting that modifying risk factors of cognitive decline may improve cognition or even delay dementia development.

### Vitamin D supplementation has no effect on cognitive performance after four months in mid-aged and older subjects [^113nA5pb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with impaired cognitive function, but the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function is uncertain.

Methods

422 subjects were included in a randomized controlled trial with vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 100,000 IU given as a bolus dose followed by 20,000 IU per week versus placebo for four months. Cognitive function was evaluated with verbal recall test, coding test and tapping test.

Results

374 subjects (mean age 52 years, 198 males) had complete cognitive tests both at baseline and at end of study. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 34 nmol/L. At baseline there were no significant associations between serum 25(OH)D and the three separate cognitive tests. At the end of the study mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 89 nmol/L and 31 nmol/L in the vitamin D and placebo groups, respectively. At the end of the study, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding change in the cognitive test scores. Nor did sub-group analyses based on gender, age, baseline serum 25(OH)D and cognitive test scores reveal significant differences between the two groups at the end of the study.

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation did not improve cognitive function during a four months intervention in mid-aged and older subjects.

### Nutrition state of science and dementia prevention: recommendations of the nutrition for dementia prevention working group [^1119cKb5]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Novel approaches to translate observational studies into clinical trials: the importance of dietary patterns and nutrition assessment tools

Most randomised controlled trials of dietary interventions for cognitive health have involved nutrient and vitamin supplements. Focus on a single nutrient and a placebo control is easy to design and implement; examples previously assessed include vitamin E, vitamin D (vitamin D and omega-3 trial [known as VITAL]), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These straightforward experiments have led to null results (ie, findings of no association) and the null hypothesis might be true. However null results can also be caused by many other factors such as the intervention duration being too short; large proportions of the participants already having ingested sufficient quantities of the nutrient in question to be within neuroprotective range; participants being generally older than 65 years and potentially already having advanced underlying disease; and the dose being insufficient; all of which can dilute the magnitude of the effect.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^115zW6c7]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our trial included the selection of a fractional factorial design to test the sparsity-of-effects principle and, therefore, expose interaction effects over low-order interactions, such as the effect of vitamin D. Additional strengths were the use of a primary outcome sensitive to cognitive changes in MCI, the systematic progression of exercise and cognitive training, and targeting a population considered to be at the ideal intervention stage; this may explain the large effect size found when comparing our intervention with previous multidomain trials not targeting MCI.

Our trial had several limitations. The early termination imposed by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions impeded us from reaching our target sample size and provoked dropouts in those already enrolled, which likely affected our power to find a statically significant effect, for instance, for the exercise intervention alone. Most participants were vitamin D sufficient at baseline, which may have reduced any potential effect of the vitamin D intervention. Additionally, our sample was largely White and with postsecondary education, which reduces the generalizability of our results. Finally, we did not adjust our analyses for having 2 primary end points, which may have increased our type I error.

Additionally, an important distinction arises from the comprehensive adjustment for potential confounders in several models. This facet was more rigorously undertaken in our analysis, leading to progressively lower effect estimates. Among the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, 2 studies — Licher et al. and Afzal et al. — adjusted for various confounders, including socioeconomic status, biomarkers, lifestyle factors, and disease-related factors. Notably, these studies reported similar increases in the risk of all-cause dementia [HR (95% CI): 1.22 (0.97, 1.52) for 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L], AD [1.25 (0.95, 1.64) for 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L], and VD [1.22 (0.77, 1.91) for 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L] as compared to our study's findings. Hence, we are confident that associations of vitamin D deficiency with dementia outcomes in the 19%- to 25%-risk increase are closer to the actual effect than the more significant estimates reported by other studies.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^114PZ2CL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Vitamin E for Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment — trial results and safety signals are as follows: In mild cognitive impairment, vitamin E (2,000 IU/day) showed no differences from placebo on cognition, function, or progression to dementia over 3 years in a comparison with donepezil and placebo. There are no studies of vitamin E in Alzheimer's disease with mild or severe impairment or in other dementias. Safety concerns include a meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials showing a very small but statistically significant increase in mortality in trials using doses greater than 400 IU/day with a dose-dependent increase above 150 IU/day; a large randomized trial of vitamin E (400 IU/day) was associated with an increased risk of heart failure, and high doses may worsen blood coagulation defects in patients with vitamin K deficiency.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^111MCC41]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The SYNERGIC Trial demonstrated that a multidomain intervention of progressive aerobic-resistance exercises with sequential cognitive training can improve global cognition, including memory, attention, word recognition, and orientation in older adults with MCI, as measured by one of our primary outcomes, the ADAS-Cog-13. The multidomain intervention effect was larger than the improvement from exercise alone. Vitamin D supplementation had no significant benefit. Our findings suggest that this multidomain intervention could induce a clinically meaningful cognitive improvement in individuals with MCI, which may have important implications for their quality of life.

### Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LDm1j]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

With life expectancy on the rise throughout the world and almost 900 million people 60 years old or over, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia is increasing. Dementia is characterized by multiple cognitive deficits that include impairment in memory and encompasses four subtypes (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia), which are each associated with specific neurological features. In 2015, 46.8 million people worldwide were living with dementia. This number is predicted to double every 20 years, until at least 2050, even though evidence from European countries shows stable age-specific prevalence and incidence rates over time. An increase in dementia seems unavoidable due to the fact that people live longer. Based on data from the Framingham study, the lifetime risk of dementia at age 65 is 22% for women and 14% for men. Since the causes of dementia remain unknown and no cure for the disease has been found, researchers are intensely searching for preventive interventions to delay the onset of dementia. Several risk factors have been identified but the evidence for these is variable. Biological factors possibly associated with dementia risk include old age, female sex, and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 genotype. Social factors that may contribute to risk include low education and low socioeconomic status. Lifestyle characteristics such as alcohol abuse, smoking, and reduced physical activity could also play a role. Medical risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are also believed to be contributing factors.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^115r12qd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does a multidomain intervention of aerobic-resistance exercises with cognitive training and vitamin D improve cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 175 Canadian adults aged 65 to 84 years, a 20-week multidomain intervention of aerobic-resistance exercises with computerized cognitive training had a larger effect in improving cognition than exercise interventions alone, and these improvements were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Vitamin D addition did not enhance the effect.

Meaning

These findings suggest that pairing aerobic and resistance exercises with sequential computerized cognitive training may improve cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.

### Genetically decreased vitamin D and risk of Alzheimer disease [^1111kMux]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To test whether genetically decreased vitamin D levels are associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) using mendelian randomization (MR), a method that minimizes bias due to confounding or reverse causation.

Methods

We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels (p < 5 × 10–8) from the Study of Underlying Genetic Determinants of Vitamin D and Highly Related Traits (SUNLIGHT) Consortium (N = 33,996) to act as instrumental variables for the MR study. We measured the effect of each of these SNPs on 25OHD levels in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos; N = 2,347) and obtained the corresponding effect estimates for each SNP on AD risk from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (N = 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls). To produce MR estimates, we weighted the effect of each SNP on AD by its effect on 25OHD and meta-analyzed these estimates using a fixed-effects model to provide a summary effect estimate.

Results

The SUNLIGHT Consortium identified 4 SNPs to be genome-wide significant for 25OHD, which described 2.44% of the variance in 25OHD in CaMos. All 4 SNPs map to genes within the vitamin D metabolic pathway. MR analyses demonstrated that a 1-SD decrease in natural log-transformed 25OHD increased AD risk by 25% (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.03–1.51, p = 0.021). After sensitivity analysis in which we removed SNPs possibly influenced by pleiotropy and population stratification, the results were largely unchanged.

Conclusions

Our results provide evidence supporting 25OHD as a causal risk factor for AD. These findings provide further rationale to understand the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognition and AD risk in randomized controlled trials.

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^1138rPxS]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

AD versus non-pathological aging

A review of 37 studies from Balion et al. allowed the authors to compare MMSE scores with levels of 25(OH)D. They found that higher average MMSE scores were associated with 25(OH)D concentrations > 50 nmol/L and ultimately that lower vitamin D levels increased the risk for AD. Another meta-analysis concluded that an individual without AD shows a 40% increased chance of having higher vitamin D levels than matched controls. Despite a growing amount of studies linking lower vitamin D to cognitive decline in an associative manner, data specific to hypovitaminosis D and incidence of AD is scarce. However, in every study, a link between vitamin D status and dementia has been observed while studies investigating vitamin D deficiency in the case of non-pathological aging is more controversial (Table 2). Two 7-year follow-ups, the first in 40 women of mean age 78.4 years and the second in 498 women aged 75 years and older aimed at studying the association between levels of vitamin D and the risk of AD. The first report, performed on a relatively small, restricted cohort showed that baseline serum 25(OH)D deficiency associates with the onset of non-AD dementias but not with AD. However, the second study, based on vitamin D dietary intake and including a larger population found that baseline dietary intake of vitamin D was inversely associated with the onset of AD but not with non AD-dementia. These apparent contradictory results could be due to the difference in cohort size for both studies or to the measure used for assessment of vitamin D status. In line with the second observation, two recent longitudinal studies have put forward an association between low levels of seric 25(OH)D and the risk of AD. One study followed 1,658 men and women of mean age 73.6 years for 5–6 years, while the second was performed on 10,168 individuals over a period of 30 years and both report an increased risk for AD with decreased levels of 25(OH)D. The latter study, due to the long period of time considered and the size of the cohort, provides a solid basis to the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency at younger ages is associated to increased risk of cognitive decline, dementia, or AD later on.

### Circulating vitamin D levels and Alzheimer's disease: a mendelian randomization study in the IgAP and UK biobank [^114XMpg2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Observational studies strongly supported the association of low levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and cognitive impairment or dementia in aging populations. However, randomized controlled trials have not shown clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation could improve cognitive outcomes. In fact, some studies reported the association between vitamin D and cognitive impairment based on individuals aged 60 years and over. However, it is still unclear that whether vitamin D levels are causally associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in individuals aged 60 years and over. Here, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal association between vitamin D levels and AD using a large-scale vitamin D genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset and two large-scale AD GWAS datasets from the IGAP and UK Biobank with individuals aged 60 years and over. Our results showed that genetically increased 25OHD levels were significantly associated with reduced AD risk in individuals aged 60 years and over. Hence, our findings in combination with previous literature indicate that maintaining adequate vitamin D status in older people especially aged 60 years and over, may contribute to slow down cognitive decline and forestall AD. Long-term randomized controlled trials are required to test whether vitamin D supplementation may prevent AD in older people especially those aged 60 years and may be recommended as preventive agents.

Associations of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency with dementia outcomes

The associations between vitamin D status and dementia outcomes have been subject to extensive investigation over the past decade. However, these studies have yielded inconsistent results. In the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Chai et al. a total of 12 prospective cohort studies and 4 cross-sectional studies were included. The pooled HRs (95% CI) for all-cause dementia and AD were reported as 1.48 (1.19–1.85) and 1.51 (1.04–2.18), respectively, for severe vitamin D deficiency, which they defined as a level < 25 nmol/L. Additionally, they observed the pooled HRs (95% CI) for moderate vitamin D deficiency, which they defined as 25 to 50 nmol/L, to be 1.20 (0.99–1.44) for all-cause dementia and 1.36 (1.01–1.84) for AD. These estimates are much higher than those observed in our study. Although the disparity in the applied cut-off for severe vitamin D deficiency does not likely explain this divergence, the inclusion of cross-sectional studies, studies with a short follow-up time, and/or a much older population in the meta-analysis may have led to more substantial effect estimates. In the cross-sectional studies, prevalent dementia may have caused vitamin D deficiency, and in studies with short follow-up time or an old population, undiagnosed dementia or its precursors already prevalent at baseline could be the reason for the lower 25(OH)D levels.

### Vitamin D reduces GABA-positive astrocytes in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease [^1136oGb8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study provides valuable insights into the association between vitamin D levels and the pathological progression of AD. Our findings demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency exacerbates Aβ pathology and increases GABA-positive reactive astrocytes, whereas vitamin D supplementation ameliorates these effects. These results highlight the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels for the prevention and treatment of AD, emphasizing the potential of targeting vitamin D as a novel therapeutic approach. Furthermore, this study expands our understanding of the complex interactions between vitamin D and glial cells, particularly reactive astrocytes, which may contribute to the development of new treatment strategies for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Future research should continue to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D, thereby enabling more effective interventions to combat the growing burden of AD.

### Why vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease? The hypothesis [^111KfhG1]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Scientists have worked for over a century to uncover the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the ultimate goal of discovering a treatment. However, none of the approaches utilized have defined the exact cause of the disease or an ultimate treatment for AD. In this review, we aim to define the role of vitamin D in AD from a novel and fundamental perspective and attempt to answer the following question: Why should we seriously consider "simple" vitamin D as a "fundamental factor" in AD? To answer this question, we explain the protective effects of vitamin D in the central nervous system and how the action of vitamin D and AD-type pathology overlap. Furthermore, we suggest that the role of vitamin D in AD includes not only vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D-related genes but also the disruption of vitamin D metabolism and action. This suggestion is supported by evidence that the disruption of vitamin D pathways mimic amyloid pathology. We define the term "inefficient utilization of vitamin D" as any alteration in vitamin D-related genes, including receptors, the enzymes related to vitamin D metabolism or the transporters of vitamin D, and we discuss the potential correlation of vitamin D status with the vulnerability of neurons to aging and neurodegeneration. Finally, in addition to the current knowledge that defines AD, we suggest that AD could be the result of a long-term hormonal imbalance in which the critical hormone is vitamin D, a secosteroid that has long been misnamed.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^1152kcrK]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of the SYNERGIC Trial was to evaluate the effect of a multidomain intervention (combination of progressive exercise with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation) on cognition compared with both an active control and exercise alone in older adults with MCI. Exercise with cognitive training significantly improved ADAS-Cog-13 scores, driven by improvements in episodic memory, attention, and orientation. Exercise alone did not improve cognition, nor did adding vitamin D. ADAS-Cog-Plus did not improve with any of the interventions. Compared with our multidomain interventions, the control arm revealed a slight decline in cognition, suggesting that balance and toning exercises may not sustain cognitive function in MCI individuals. Cognitive improvements observed in the ADAS-Cog-13 immediately after the intervention were slightly attenuated at 12-month assessment but they did not revert to baseline scores, suggesting a lasting effect even without participants engaging in exercise regimes during the follow-up period. Finally, our multidomain intervention achieved high compliance and adherence, and was safe and feasible to perform in older adults with MCI.

A 2.64-point improvement in the ADAS-Cog-13 for the multidomain intervention is larger than changes seen in previous pharmaceutical trials among individuals with MCI or mild dementia, and approaches the 3 points considered clinically meaningful. Together with the moderate-to-large effect size (0.71) found, our results support a beneficial cognitive effect from this multidomain intervention.

The lack of significant effect on the ADAS-Cog-Plus was against our hypotheses. Changes for arms 1 and 2 (exercise plus cognitive training) were in the expected direction, which prompted us to conduct exploratory analyses to evaluate whether adding items to the ADAS-Cog-13 may have reduced its responsiveness to our interventions. These post hoc analyses revealed that the ADAS-Cog-Plus variant without the verbal category fluency item (just adding 4 out of 5 plus items to the ADAS-Cog-13) was sensitive in detecting significant improvements for our multidomain intervention. Adding items to a composite measure would increase its sensitivity only to the extent that it may improve the mean-to-SD ratio of change over the course of the study. In other words, the optimal composite maximizes the signal and minimizes the noise. Adding the category fluency may have reduced the responsiveness of the Plus variant to our intervention because exercise and dual-task cognitive training interventions typically show greatest effects on measures of attention and pure executive function rather than on verbal fluency.

Regulation of oxidative stress, brain energy metabolism, and vascular processes

Another possible mechanism for Aβ clearance operates through passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This physical, relatively impermeable, barrier is composed mainly of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes. In 2011, Ito et al. demonstrated that, 24 hours following an intraperitoneal injection of 1,25(OH)D in mice, elimination of radioactive human Aβ was increased 1.3 times and that the total level of brain Aβ was reduced. This brain-to-blood efflux likely involves internalization of Aβ peptides within brain capillaries. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the work of Durk and colleagues who report increased expression and transport activity of P-glycoprotein in brain capillaries and endothelial cells after incubation with 1,25(OH)D3, resulting in reduced accumulation of human Aβ within these cells. These vitamin D-related activities likely occur via activation of the nuclear receptor VDR present on the cells comprising the BBB. Moreover, action of 1,25(OH)D on brain pericytes elicits anti-inflammatory responses at the transcriptomic level, likely adding to the direct protective role of vitamin D within brain capillaries under chronic inflammation constraints such as those present in AD. In line with these results, the transcriptomic response of cultured mixed neuron-glial cells or whole brain regions such as the neocortex and hippocampus to 1,25(OH)D in normal conditions or in AD mice, reveals dysregulation of genes potentially capable of limiting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases with particular emphasis on AD. Vitamin D can also inhibit the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) an enzyme necessary for synthesis of nitric oxide (NO). During aging or neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, reactive nitrogen and oxygen species produced by damaged neurons, microglia and astrocytes can increase the expression of iNOS. As a result, higher levels of NO can cause cell death through inhibition of mitochondrial and neuronal respiration, further leading to neuronal excitotoxicity. Low vitamin D diet has been shown to enhance oxidative stress through transcription of iNOS. More specifically, low levels of vitamin D result in increased tyrosine nitration of brain proteins, alterations in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial changes in the brain of rats aged 16–17 months. Conversely, 1,25(OH)2D3 injections of elderly rats increases brain energy metabolism and modulates levels of reactive oxygen species in hippocampal tissues. Vitamin D treatment of cortical neurons reverses the cytotoxic effects induced by Aβ and prevents upregulation of iNOS. In activated microglia, 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses the production of NO and the inflammatory mediators, TNF α and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a dose-dependent manner suggesting direct anti-inflammatory roles for vitamin D in the brain. Local conversion of vitamin D to the active 1,25(OH)2D3 in the brain may be a direct neuroprotective response to CNS inflammation followed by inhibition of NF- κ B related iNOS induction.

A possible age threshold

The latest study on the topic of vitamin D and cognitive decline was performed in individuals of different ages obtained from The Tromso study. The report highlights a positive association between serum 25(OH)D and cognitive function in individuals aged 65 years and over. The interesting result from this study is that levels of 25(OH)D appear to be predictive of cognitive outcome only in older individuals. Memory and cognitive performance tests were performed at different time points, over a period of 7–13 years, and only the latest time points were significantly correlated with baseline vitamin D levels. We therefore decided to compare studies that allowed for a clear distinction between ages, i.e. studies performed on individuals strictly under 65 or over 65 years of age. As reported in Table 2, this criterion allowed us to discriminate 6 studies conducted in individuals less than 65 years of age and 14 studies comprising of individuals aged over 65 exclusively. The results are quite pronounced as all studies, except one, investigating individuals under 65 years of age report no association between 25(OH)D serum levels and cognitive performance, and conversely nearly all studies in older individuals report a link between vitamin D status and cognitive outcome (Table 2). Cross-sectional studies in adolescents (age 12–16.9 years), based on the data from the NHANES III cohort, found no association of 25(OH)D seric levels and performance in Intelligence Scale and Wide-range Achievement Test. Similar reports, carried out in young adults (20–59 years), showed once again no significant association between 25(OH)D concentrations and measures of cognitive function. Another study examined the link between cognition and vitamin D in earlier stages of life. It demonstrated no correlation between seric levels of both 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 at mean age 9.8 years, with academic performance outcomes at ages 13–14 and 15–16. This study included a cohort of 3,171 individuals. The only study, to our knowledge, describing an association between cognitive performance and seric 25(OH)D levels in non-aged, non-demented individuals was carried out in a lifespan approach by Maddock and colleagues in 2014. This study included 6,496 mid-life individuals from a British cohort whose information on childhood cognitive ability, educational attainment, and vitamin D-related behaviors was collected at several points from birth to age 50. At the age of 45, seric vitamin D concentration was measured and, at age 50, verbal memory, verbal fluency, and speed of processing were tested. The results showed a non-linear U-shaped association between 25(OH)D concentrations at age 45 years and immediate word recall at age 50 years, i.e. people with both lower and higher 25(OH)D concentrations performed worse on the cognitive task, but this result was likely due to the recent supplementation of those with prior hypovitaminosis D. The controversial link between low vitamin D status and cognitive performance in non-aged individuals has led to only one randomized control trial during which 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 was given daily to young adults for 6 weeks. Thecontrol trial concluded that vitamin D supplementation had no effect on cognitive and emotional measures, such as working memory and depression although enhanced working memory performance over time was observed in both the supplemented and comparative group. The short period of supplementation and the relatively high serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline, possibly above the cerebral needs for vitamin D (if any), could have masked the cognitive effect of vitamin D supplementation. However, the null findings concerning vitamin D status and cognitive outcome in young individuals indicates that the time-frame considered for associating 25(OH)D to cognitive performance is of prime concern and that longer follow-up times from longitudinal studies might help decipher a link between hypovitaminosis D at younger ages and cognitive decline in elderly populations. Among the studies investigating the link between vitamin D status and cognitive outcome in elderly populations, two large population-based reports indicate no association between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive performance. Interestingly, this contrasts largely with a study by Llewellyn and colleagues, which performed analysis on the same NHANES III cohort than the above-mentioned studies. The two major differences are i) Llewellyn et al. focused on individuals aged strictly 65 years and older whereas McGrath et al. and Tolppannen et al. included a larger age group, from 60 to 90 years old, and ii) the cognitive measures considered for assessment of performance differed. It appears that the effects of hypovitaminosis D on brain function and cognition do not emerge until later in life. Most importantly, it is possible that vitamin D status does not impact cognitive measures in healthy individuals but is rather linked to the onset of cognitive decline during aging. Finally, the type of cognitive test used for analysis might impact results as vitamin D status could potentially be associated to domain-specific functions.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116MEK7e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

APA practice guideline — vitamin E for dementia: Vitamin E is no longer recommended for the treatment of cognitive symptoms of dementia. Safety concerns include the unexpected findings of increased dose-dependent mortality in a meta-analysis and an increased rate of heart failure in a large randomized trial in individuals with diabetes mellitus and/or vascular disease. Evidence for efficacy is limited, including that the one placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial for moderate Alzheimer's disease is limited and that vitamin E failed to show efficacy in one study of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, in which nearly one-half of subjects developed Alzheimer's disease during the 3 years of observation. After considering potential risks and benefits, some physicians and patients may elect to use vitamin E, particularly at doses at or below 400 IU daily, but it should be avoided in patients with vitamin K deficiency due to association with worsening of coagulation defects.

### Vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia: effects of sex, and baseline cognitive status [^117PkPwe]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the benefit of a large sample, there are several limitations of this study that merit consideration. Vitamin D exposure was dichotomized to determine exposure‐associated risk. NACC medication sheets did not record information on exposure history; therefore, potential heterogeneities in exposure duration were not accounted for in the analysis. Neither dosing nor baseline vitamin D levels were available and thus, it is unknown if rates of incident dementia differed based on dosing or vitamin D deficiency. Higher doses or greater intake of vitamin D have been linked to better cognition and lower risk, especially in vitamin D deficiency. Future clinical trials should consider dosing of vitamin D supplementation, while paying close attention to baseline serum vitamin D levels. Clarifying exposure duration, dose–response relationships, and the role of vitamin D deficiency will be necessary to inform intervention studies. The primary analysis of the present study combined data from exposure to three vitamin D formulations. Participants with baseline exposure to any of these formulations were considered D+, potentially limiting interpretation. However, sensitivity analyses revealed that each formulation alone was associated with a similar lower dementia risk, consistent with the primary findings. However, our study did not account for exposure to supplementations other than vitamin D, which may have had additional contribution in lowering dementia risk. Considering that sun exposure is the most important natural source of vitamin D, the lack of information on participant‐level exposure to sunlight can be considered another limitation of the present study. The nature of the NACC cohort and possible selection bias toward highly educated White participants may limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, differences in socioeconomic status (SES) across participants may have contributed to differences in exposure to vitamin supplementation. Individuals with higher SES may have been more likely to take vitamin supplements. SES may also be associated with healthy lifestyles, pace of biological aging, and risk of dementia. Studies have shown that lower levels of education and wealth were associated with accelerated biological aging, faster memory decline, and substantially greater risk of dementia. While we included education in our models, the NACC dataset has a dearth of information related to SES and therefore, SES differences could not be accounted for in our study. Future studies using cohorts with more comprehensive data on SES and other social factors would certainly provide valuable information on the associations of SES with exposure to supplementation and risk of dementia. Finally, we have no information about the reason for visiting an ADRC, especially for individuals with NC, or for taking vitamin D supplements. Despite these limitations, our findings implicate vitamin D as a potential agent for dementia prevention and provide additional support for its use in at‐risk individuals for AD dementia.

### Vitamin D supplementation and cognition-results from analyses of the D-health trial [^116V6niv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies have consistently found a link between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and higher risk of cognitive impairment. Results from randomized controlled trials have been mixed, and few have been conducted in the general population.

Methods

We recruited 21,315 community-dwelling Australians aged between 60 and 84years to participate in the D-Health Trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The intervention was monthly oral doses of 60,000 international units of vitamin D or placebo for 5years. We assessed cognitive function in a randomly sampled group of participants aged ≥ 70years using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) at 2 and 5years after randomization. The primary outcome for this analysis was TICS score; the secondary outcome was the proportion of people who had cognitive impairment (defined as TICS score ≤ 25). We analyzed data using mixed models (linear and logistic).

Results

We interviewed 3887 participants at year 2 and 3614 participants at year 5. The mean TICS score at these time points was 32.3 and 32.2, respectively. Vitamin D supplementation did not affect cognitive function as measured by TICS score (mean difference between vitamin D and placebo groups 0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.23), or alter risk of cognitive impairment (odds ratio 1.00; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33).

Conclusions

Monthly bolus doses of vitamin D supplementation neither enhanced nor hindered cognitive function among older adults. Population-wide vitamin D supplementation of older adults that are largely vitamin D replete is unlikely to substantially benefit cognition.

### Vitamin D, cognition, and Alzheimer's disease: observational and two-sample mendelian randomization studies [^1132sa7W]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies have found that vitamin D supplementation is associated with improved cognition. Further, recent Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have shown that higher vitamin D levels, 25(OH)D, may protect against Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is possible that 25(OH)D may protect against Alzheimer's disease by improving cognition.

Objective

We assessed this hypothesis, by examining the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and seven cognitive measurements.

Methods

To mitigate bias from confounding, we performed two-sample MR analyses. We used instruments from three publications: Manousaki et al. (2020), Sutherland et al. (2022), and the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration/EPIC-CVD/Vitamin D Studies Collaboration (2021).

Results

Our observational studies suggested a protective association between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive measures. An increase in the natural log of 25(OH)D by 1 SD was associated with a higher PACC score (BetaPACC score = 0.06, 95% CI = (0.04–0.08); p = 1.8×10–10). However, in the MR analyses, the estimated effect of 25(OH)D on cognitive measures was null. Specifically, per 1 SD increase in genetically estimated natural log of 25(OH)D, the PACC scores remained unchanged in the overall population, (BetaPACC score = -0.01, 95% CI (-0.06 to 0.03); p = 0.53), and amongst individuals aged over 60 (BetaPACC score = 0.03, 95% CI (-0.028 to 0.08); p = 0.35).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our MR study found no clear evidence to support a protective role of increased 25(OH)D concentrations on cognitive performance in European ancestry individuals. However, our study cannot entirely dismiss the potential beneficial effect on PACC for individuals over the age of 60.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^112M5SRv]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Scores above zero indicate a decline in cognitive performance; scores below zero indicate improved cognitive performance; error bars, standard errors. P values are compared with the control. Arm 1: aerobic-resistance exercise, cognitive training, vitamin D; arm 2: aerobic-resistance exercise, cognitive training, placebo vitamin D; arm 3: aerobic-resistance exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D; arm 4: aerobic-resistance exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D; arm 5: balance and toning exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D.

Table 3.
Effect of Exercise (Aerobic-Resistance Training) and Cognitive Intervention and Exercise Alone at 6-Month End Point

Abbreviations: ES, effect size; MD, mean difference.

Inside the table analyses showed a significant ADAS-Cog-13 improvement in arm 1 (exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D: mean change, −2.64 points; 95% CI, −4.42 to −0.87 points; P = 0.005; d = 0.71) and arm 2 (exercise, cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D: mean change, −2.39 points; 95% CI, −4.20 to −0.57 points; P = 0.01; d = 0.63) compared with control (arm 5; eTable 3 in Supplement 4). The estimated mean (SE) change from baseline to post-intervention was −2.41 (0.67) in arm 1, −2.16 (0.65) in arm 2, and 0.23 (0.67) in arm 5 (control). There were no significant improvements in ADAS-Cog-13 scores from baseline in arm 3 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D) and arm 4 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D) compared with control. Adjusting for covariates did not change the results (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).

### The associations of serum vitamin D status and vitamin D supplements use with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia: a UK biobank based prospective cohort study [^116PW48f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of covariates

The selection of covariates for this study was primarily informed by a prior research project conducted within the UK Biobank by our group, which identified 49 determinants of vitamin D deficiency and 49 determinants of vitamin D supplementation. These determinants were used as covariates and extended by the APOE ε4 genotype, given its significance as a specific risk factor for dementia. The covariates spanned diverse domains, including demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, biomarker, healthcare-related, and genetic dimensions, and their assessments and categorizations are described in more detail in Supplemental Text 1 and Supplemental Table 1.

Ascertainment of incident dementia outcomes

Within the scope of the UK Biobank, occurrences of incident all-cause dementia, AD, and VD were acquired through algorithmic amalgamations of interlinked data derived from hospital admission records and death registries. The minimum and maximum follow-up time were 12.7 and 16.2 years, respectively, counted either from March 3, 2006 (first recruited participant) or October 1, 2010 (last recruited participant) to November 30, 2022 (end of data collection by the UK Biobank at the time of analysis).

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^114zRE41]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Clinically significant improvement in ADAS-Cog-13 (3 points or more) was observed for 44% of participants in arm 1, 37% in arm 2, 14% in arm 3, 24% in arm 4, and 15% in arm 5 (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). Per-protocol analysis did not alter our results (eTables 6 through 8 in Supplement 2).

No significant improvement in the ADAS-Cog-Plus scores across the intervention arms compared with the control (arm 5) was identified (Table 2 and 3). Post hoc analyses of the ADAS-Cog-Plus without the verbal fluency test (keeping the 4 executive function tests that create the ADAS-Cog-Plus variant) revealed a significant improvement for arm 1, the multidomain intervention (eTables 9 and 10 in Supplement 2).

Follow-Up Analyses

ADAS-Cog-13 scores improved from baseline to 12-month follow-up across all intervention arms. The improvements observed at postintervention remained during follow-up for arm 2 (exercise, cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D) and arm 3 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D), but were slightly deteriorated in arm 1 (exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D) and arm 4 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), although none of the follow-up analyses were statistically significant (eTables 11 and 12, eFigures 1 and 2 in Supplement 2). Exercises and physical activity levels were not maintained during the 6-month follow-up (eTable 13 in Supplement 2).

Secondary Outcomes

The interventions effect on individual ADAS-Cog items are shown in Tables 2 and 3. A significant improvement was observed for delayed recall (mean difference: arm 2 vs 5, −0.99 points; 95% CI, −1.99 to −0.09 points), orientation (arm 1 vs 5, −0.57 points; 95% CI, −1.05 to −0.10 points; arm 2 vs 5, −0.61 points; 95% CI, −1.09 to −0.13 points), word recognition (arm 1 vs 5, −1.33 points; 95% CI, −2.32 to −0.36 points), and TMT-A (arm 1 vs 5, −11.25 points; 95% CI, −19.02 to −3.49 points).

### The role of vitamins in dementia prevention and cognitive health: a comprehensive review [^1157GZBM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline that interferes with daily functioning, particularly in the elderly. As one of the leading causes of disability among older adults, dementia remains a significant public health concern. Emerging evidence suggests that certain vitamins may play a crucial role in the prevention and management of cognitive impairment. This review explores the potential impact of key micronutrients specifically water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and B-complex (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12), and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K on dementia pathogenesis and cognitive function. Vitamin B deficiencies have been associated with brain atrophy, an early indicator of cognitive decline, and supplementation has shown promise in enhancing memory and slowing brain shrinkage. Similarly, vitamin C exhibits antioxidative properties that may protect against neurodegeneration. While nutritional support, particularly through micronutrient intake, is increasingly considered a viable strategy for cognitive preservation, findings from epidemiological and clinical studies remain mixed. These inconsistencies highlight the need for further research to determine optimal dosing, efficacy, and long-term impact of vitamin supplementation in dementia prevention. A well-balanced diet rich in essential vitamins may support brain health, but individual variability suggests the importance of personalized nutritional interventions. This review underscores the potential role of vitamins in maintaining cognitive health and calls for continued investigation into their therapeutic utility in delaying or preventing dementia.

### Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment [^111agix5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised, placebo-controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome.

Main Results

We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low-quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low-quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha-tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low-quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low-quality and so could not be sure of any effects.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high-dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^1158ZTLS]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Of 853 individuals screened for eligibility, 175 (20%) were randomized (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [6.6] years; 86 [49.1%] female; 79 [83.2%] White). Cognitive assessment revealed a mean (SD) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 22.6 (3.2), ADAS-Cog-13 of 15.2 (6.8), and global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.4 (0.2) (Table 1). Baseline characteristics were similar across the intervention arms, except that arm 5 (control) participants had 1.8 more years of education than the full sample mean (17.2 [4.9] years vs 15.4 [3.7] years).

Thirty-four participants were randomized to arm 1 (exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D), 35 to arm 2 (exercise, cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), 37 to arm 3 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D), 35 to arm 4 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D), and 34 to arm 5 (balance and toning exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D) (Figure 1). Overall, 31 (18%) participants withdrew during the intervention with medical complications (13 participants) unrelated to the intervention or COVID-19 restrictions (Figure 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Six participants could not complete the 12-month follow-up assessments due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Intermittent high-dose vitamin D — justification for recommendation: The available evidence (which is specifically pertinent to persons age > 50 years) suggests that, compared to daily lower-dose vitamin D or placebo, intermittent high-dose vitamin D offers no desirable effects, and may be associated with undesirable anticipated effects (falls). Moderate certainty of evidence suggests an estimated 0.5% absolute increase in fracture risk.

### The associations of serum vitamin D status and vitamin D supplements use with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia: a UK biobank based prospective cohort study [^111M1RrR]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study benefits from a substantial sample size and comprehensive coverage of serum 25(OH)D levels, vitamin D supplement usage, and potential confounders. Nonetheless, several limitations deserve attention. Although our analysis accounted for a broad range of confounding factors, it is essential to acknowledge the persistent limitations of residual confounding inherent in observational studies. The UK Biobank sample might not fully represent the broader UK population due to a potential "healthy volunteer" bias. Additionally, participants were recruited primarily from areas proximate to study centers and marked by a low response rate. However, the UK Biobank's relative associations between exposures and disease outcomes are reliable, providing a basis for some extrapolation.

Dementia diagnoses were derived from hospital and death records within the UK Biobank, leading to potential issues of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. Yet, the extensive scope of the UK Biobank may mitigate some of this bias. Furthermore, vitamin D supplement use was ascertained only at the baseline visit for all UK Biobank study participants, leaving a gap of uncertainty about vitamin D supplement use during follow-up. Another notable limitation is the absence of data on medication adherence and the reliance on self-reported information regarding regular intake of vitamin D and multivitamin supplements, gathered only at baseline. Nonadherence, changes of exposure during follow-up and an underdiagnosis of dementia in the UK Biobank could have been causes of an underestimation of the true effect estimates by our study. Moreover, specific information on the vitamin D dosages was not available.

The generalizability of our findings is limited to the age range 55 to 69 y (median: 62 y). The average study participant reached an age of 74 y because the median follow-up time was 13.6 y. This is below the age at which the most dementia diagnoses are made because most affected individuals get diagnosed in their 80s or 90s. A longer follow-up time would have been desirable also because of the long latency period for dementia development. Thus, reverse causation cannot be excluded despite the long follow-up time in this study and the robust results after excluding early events in the first 5 y.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112YJjwW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation in adults aged 75 years and older — we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation in the general population aged 75 years and older because of the potential to lower the risk of mortality; for empiric supplementation, daily, lower-dose vitamin D is preferred over nondaily, higher doses, and in trials vitamin D dosage ranged from 400 to 3333 IU (10 to 83 μg) daily with an estimated weighted average of approximately 900 IU (23 μg) daily, while participants in many trials were allowed to remain on routine supplements including up to 800 IU (20 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111cVBdt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Vitamin D and brain health: an observational and mendelian randomization study [^111UgkFB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The finding that the strongest effects on dementia risk are seen for those with the lowest 25(OH)D concentrations in our study was consistent in both observational and MR analyses. Evidence for a threshold effect has also been observed in other studies, including a meta-analysis of 5 prospective studies that found a pooled 33% and 14% higher risk of dementia in vitamin D–deficient (< 30 nmol/L) and vitamin D–insufficient (30–50 nmol/L) participants, respectively, compared with those with sufficient concentrations (> 50 nmol/L). Evidence from RCTs using vitamin D supplementation to prevent dementia or stroke is limited, and these studies have typically been small, have been of short duration, and may not have included participants with overt deficiency. Although other prospective studies have reported a similar U-shaped association with the risk of stroke as seen in our study, to our knowledge, evidence for a causal association between 25(OH)D and stroke risk has not been reported by any of the MR studies conducted to date. In contrast, 3 linear MR studies support a causal association between 25(OH)D and Alzheimer disease. Our nonlinear MR analyses suggested a threshold effect, in which increases in 25(OH)D would mainly benefit individuals who have an overt vitamin D deficiency. Interestingly, in our study and in the previous linear MR studies, the association between 25(OH)D and dementia appears to be sensitive to the removal of GC variants. GC encodes the vitamin D binding protein, and it is the strongest individual variant affecting 25(OH)D concentrations. As in our study, the association between 25(OH)D and dementia within the deficiency threshold was consistent across all MR methods, and no influential variants were observed; the apparent sensitivity to GC may reflect lack of power in the analyses excluding this variant.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^113MAFma]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The SYNERGIC Trial was a double-masked, randomized trial with a fractional factorial design to evaluate the effect of 20-week multidomain interventions on cognition in older adults with MCI (protocol available in Supplement 1). Assessments occurred at baseline, postintervention (month 6), and follow-up (month 12). The trial was conducted at 5 Canadian academic institutions (Western University [sponsor site], University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, University of Montreal, and University of British Columbia). Ethics approval was provided by each institution's review boards. All participants provided written informed consent. SYNERGIC adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Extension reporting guidelines, as extended to nonpharmacologic interventions.

Participants

Participants were aged 60 to 85 years, recruited from the community, who fulfilled MCI criteria: (1) subjective cognitive concerns; (2) objective cognitive impairment in memory, executive function, attention, and/or language; (3) preserved activities of daily living; and (4) absence of dementia (eMethods in Supplement 2). Exclusion included major depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse, parkinsonism, conditions affecting gait (eg, severe osteoarthritis, previous stroke), exercise program participation, and taking vitamin D doses greater than 1000 IU per day, cognitive enhancers, or anticholinergics. Ethnicity of participants was assessed using the CCNA ethnicity questionnaire, to characterize minority representation in our study. Full eligibility criteria are detailed in our protocol(Supplement 1).

Randomization and Masking

Participants were randomly assigned into arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio using a central computer-generated random number sequence in blocks of 5: arm 1 (aerobic-resistance exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D); arm 2 (exercise, cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D); arm 3 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and vitamin D); arm 4 (exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D); and arm 5 (balance and toning exercise, sham cognitive training, and placebo vitamin D). A research pharmacist assigned vitamin D or placebo capsules as kits in compliance with the randomization list(s).

Arm allocation was not disclosed to participants, who were asked not to discuss the intervention during training sessions. Outcome assessors were masked to allocation and not involved in the interventions.

### Vitamin E for Alzheimer's dementia and mild cognitive impairment [^113ciJpn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin E occurs naturally in the diet. It has several biological activities, including functioning as an antioxidant to scavenge toxic free radicals. Evidence that free radicals may contribute to the pathological processes behind cognitive impairment has led to interest in the use of vitamin E supplements to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2006 and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of vitamin E in the treatment of MCI and dementia due to AD.

Search Methods

We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as many trials databases and grey literature sources on 22 April 2016 using the terms: "Vitamin E", vitamin-E, alpha-tocopherol.

Selection Criteria

We included all double-blind, randomised trials in which treatment with any dose of vitamin E was compared with placebo in people with AD or MCI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Where appropriate we attempted to contact authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Four trials met the inclusion criteria, but we could only extract outcome data in accordance with our protocol from two trials, one in an AD population (n = 304) and one in an MCI population (n = 516). Both trials had an overall low to unclear risk of bias. It was not possible to pool data across studies owing to a lack of comparable outcome measures. In people with AD, we found no evidence of any clinically important effect of vitamin E on cognition, measured with change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) over six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) -1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.75 to 0.13, P = 0.07, 1 study, n = 272; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between vitamin E and placebo groups in the risk of experiencing at least one serious adverse event over six to 48 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05, P = 0.13, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence), or in the risk of death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34, P = 0.46, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence). People with AD receiving vitamin E showed less functional decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory than people receiving placebo at six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) 3.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.23, P = 0.04, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of any clinically important effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD -1.47, 95% CI -4.26 to 1.32, P = 0.30, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). We found no evidence that vitamin E affected the probability of progression from MCI to probable dementia due to AD over 36 months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35, P = 0.81, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). Five deaths occurred in each of the vitamin E and placebo groups over the 36 months (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.44, P = 0.99, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). We were unable to extract data in accordance with the review protocol for other outcomes. However, the study authors found no evidence that vitamin E differed from placebo in its effect on cognitive function, global severity or activities of daily living. There was also no evidence of a difference between groups in the more commonly reported adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E given to people with MCI prevents progression to dementia, or that it improves cognitive function in people with MCI or dementia due to AD. However, there is moderate quality evidence from a single study that it may slow functional decline in AD. Vitamin E was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events or mortality in the trials in this review. These conclusions have changed since the previous update, however they are still based on small numbers of trials and participants and further research is quite likely to affect the results.

### Over-the-counter supplement interventions to prevent cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and clinical Alzheimer-Type dementia: a systematic review [^113qkGLc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal interventions to prevent or delay cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia are uncertain.

Purpose

To summarize the evidence on efficacy and harms of over-the-counter (OTC) supplements to prevent or delay cognitive decline, MCI, or clinical Alzheimer-type dementia in adults with normal cognition or MCI but no dementia diagnosis.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from 2009 to July 2017 and bibliographies of systematic reviews.

Study Selection

English-language trials of at least 6 months' duration that enrolled adults without dementia and compared cognitive outcomes with an OTC supplement versus placebo or active controls.

Data Extraction

Extraction performed by a single reviewer and confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-reviewer assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-eight trials with low to medium risk of bias compared ω-3 fatty acids, soy, ginkgo biloba, B vitamins, vitamin D plus calcium, vitamin C or β-carotene, multi-ingredient supplements, or other OTC interventions with placebo or other supplements. Few studies examined effects on clinical Alzheimer-type dementia or MCI, and those that did suggested no benefit. Daily folic acid plus vitamin B12 was associated with improvements in performance on some objectively measured memory tests that were statistically significant but of questionable clinical significance. Moderate-strength evidence showed that vitamin E had no benefit on cognition. Evidence about effects of ω-3 fatty acids, soy, ginkgo biloba, folic acid alone or with other B vitamins, β-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin D plus calcium, and multivitamins or multi-ingredient supplements was either insufficient or low-strength, suggesting that these supplements did not reduce risk for cognitive decline. Adverse events were rarely reported.

Limitation

Studies had high attrition and short follow-up and used a highly variable set of cognitive outcome measures.

Conclusion

Evidence is insufficient to recommend any OTC supplement for cognitive protection in adults with normal cognition or MCI.

### Effects of exercise alone or combined with cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to improve cognition in adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^116LoTvd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

In alignment with our design, a planned marginal analysis to test different orders of interactions was employed. Compared with control (arm 5) and regardless of the addition of cognitive training or vitamin D, ADAS-Cog-13 scores improved significantly in participants that received the exercise regime (arms 1 through 4: mean difference, 1.79 points; 95% CI, −3.27 to −0.31 points; P = 0.02; d = 0.64) (Table 2). Compared with the participants that received only the exercise regime (arms 3 and 4), those who received both exercise regime and cognitive training (arms 1 and 2) had significant ADAS-Cog-13 improvements (mean difference, −1.45 points; 95% CI, −2.70 to −0.21 points; P = 0.02; d = 0.39), but no significant effect of adding vitamin D to the exercise regime was found (Table 2).

Table 2.
Effect of Exercise (Aerobic-Resistance Training) Intervention With Addition of Cognitive Training and Vitamin D at 6-Month End Point

The exercise regime with cognitive training (arms 1 and 2) significantly improved the ADAS-Cog-13 compared with the control (mean difference, −2.52 points; 95% CI, −4.09 to −0.94 points; P = 0.002; d = 0.67) (Figure 2). The difference between the exercise regime (arms 3 and 4) and the control (arm 5) on ADAS-Cog-13 was not statistically significant (Table 3). Results remained unchanged after adjustment for covariates (eTable 2 in Supplement 4).

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^116LGzz8]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologic disorders

Low serum 25OHD concentrations have been found in patients suffering from a variety of neurologic diseases such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease, or schizophrenia, apart from MS (discussed above in the section on immunity). MR studies found clear links between vitamin D status and MS (see above) and also with Alzheimer's disease. In the latter study, dealing with 17,008 cases and 37,154 controls, 1 SD lower predicted that serum 25OHD caused a significant 1.25-fold higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (Table 2). Two other MR trials did not find a link with schizophrenia or Parkinson disease.

Reproduction

Vitamin D may also be important for male and female reproduction. Male reproduction is impaired in the Tokyo strain of VDR-null mice, and 1,25(OH) 2 D directly inhibits aromatase gene expression. This is in line with previous studies in rodents and humans demonstrating the essential role of the aromatase enzyme for male reproduction. A variety of data also suggest that the vitamin D endocrine system may be operative in male reproduction. A small-scale RCT, however, did not show improvement of sperm quality in men with subfertile sperm by vitamin D supplementation. A poor vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for the mother and child. A recent Cochrane analysis and another review found that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of preeclampsia, increase mean birth weight, reduce the risk of small for gestational age, and reduce the risk for wheezing in the offspring at age 3.

### Oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and Alzheimer's disease [^114fNbXj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

Currently approved treatments for AD are limited to three cholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, and a low affinity NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine. None of these approaches are disease modifying; they do not provide a "cure" but rather symptomatic treatment for some individuals. Moreover, failure of the recent clinical trials focused on production or clearance of Aβ peptides emphasizes the urgency to consider alternative molecular mechanisms in order to design interventions that will delay or alleviate the development of AD. While compelling evidence implicates oxidative stress in the early molecular mechanisms of AD, there is no FDA-approved antioxidant therapy for AD. Moreover, while antioxidant experimental therapeutics produced promising results in animal models of AD, clinical trials either failed or delivered inconclusive results. For example, multiple trials assayed the effect of a strong antioxidant vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) on cognitive function in cognitively normal and generally healthy women 65 years or older, in cognitively normal women with preexisting cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors 40 years or older, in people with MCI, in patients with moderate to severe AD, and in individuals with mild to moderate AD. Positive results where statistically significant changes in cognitive performance were achieved after vitamin E administration compared to placebo were found only in people with mild to moderate AD. Importantly, there were no significant differences in the groups receiving memantine alone or memantine plus alpha tocopherol as a combination therapy. Moreover, meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials with vitamin E demonstrated its high toxicity and all-cause mortality at high doses. Inconclusive results were also achieved in an open clinical trial where AD patients stably taking a cholinesterase inhibitor were supplemented with vitamin C and E over 1 year. While oxidation of CSF lipids was significantly reduced after 1 year of the supplementation, the clinical course of AD did not differ between the vitamin-supplemented and the control group. Another failed trial involved the supplementation with vitamin E, C, and α-lipoic acid in patients with mild to moderate AD. Despite a detection of reduced levels of markers of oxidative stress in CSF, a rapid cognitive decline observed in treated group raised significant safety concerns. Similar results were obtained in clinical trials with curcumin, a polyphenolic compound that has been demonstrated to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical studies. Comprehensive update on the outcomes of the antioxidant treatments in recent clinical trials was provided in recent reviews.

### Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114TZPeB]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sunlight exposure and high vitamin D status have been hypothesised to reduce the risk of developing dementia. The objective of our research was to determine whether lack of sunlight and hypovitaminosis D over time are associated with dementia.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ICONDA, and reference lists of pertinent review articles from 1990 to October 2015. We conducted random effects meta-analyses of published and unpublished data to evaluate the influence of sunlight exposure or vitamin D as a surrogate marker on dementia risk.

Results

We could not identify a single study investigating the association between sunlight exposure and dementia risk. Six cohort studies provided data on the effect of serum vitamin D concentration on dementia risk. A meta-analysis of five studies showed a higher risk for persons with serious vitamin D deficiency (< 25 nmol/L or 7–28 nmol/L) compared to persons with sufficient vitamin D supply (≥ 50 nmol/L or 54–159 nmol/L) (point estimate 1.54; 95% CI 1.19–1.99, I² = 20%). The strength of evidence that serious vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing dementia, however, is very low due to the observational nature of included studies and their lack of adjustment for residual or important confounders (e.g. ApoE ε4 genotype), as well as the indirect relationship between Vitamin D concentrations as a surrogate for sunlight exposure and dementia risk.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review show that low vitamin D levels might contribute to the development of dementia. Further research examining the direct and indirect relationship between sunlight exposure and dementia risk is needed. Such research should involve large-scale cohort studies with homogeneous and repeated assessment of vitamin D concentrations or sunlight exposure and dementia outcomes.

### Vitamin and mineral supplementation for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in mid and late life [^114myU9A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamins and minerals play multiple functions within the central nervous system which may help to maintain brain health and optimal cognitive functioning. Supplementation of the diet with various vitamins and minerals has been suggested as a means of maintaining cognitive function, or even of preventing dementia, in later life.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people aged 40 years or more.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP from inception to 26th January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the cognitive effects on people aged 40 years or more of any vitamin or mineral supplements taken by mouth for at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were done in duplicate. Vitamins were considered broadly in the categories of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and combinations of both. Minerals were considered separately, where possible. If interventions and outcomes were considered sufficiently similar, then data were pooled. In order to separate short-term cognitive effects from possible longer-term effects on the trajectory of cognitive decline, data were pooled for various treatment durations from 3 months to 12 months and up to 10 years or more.

Main Results

In total, we included 28 studies with more than 83,000 participants. There were some general limitations of the evidence. Most participants were enrolled in studies which were not designed primarily to assess cognition. These studies often had no baseline cognitive assessment and used only brief cognitive assessments at follow-up. Very few studies assessed the incidence of dementia. Most study reports did not mention adverse events or made only very general statements about them. Only 10 studies had a mean follow-up > 5 years. Only two studies had participants whose mean age was < 60 years at baseline. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low, other than a risk of attrition bias for longer-term outcomes. We considered the certainty of the evidence behind almost all results to be moderate or low. We included 14 studies with 27,882 participants which compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these to placebo. The majority of participants were aged over 60 years and had a history of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease. We found that giving B vitamin supplements to cognitively healthy adults, mainly in their 60s and 70s, probably has little or no effect on global cognitive function at any time point up to 5 years (SMD values from -0.03 to 0.06) and may also have no effect at 5–10 years (SMD -0.01). There were very sparse data on adverse effects or on incidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. We included 8 studies with 47,840 participants in which the active intervention was one or more of the antioxidant vitamins: ß-carotene, vitamin C or vitamin E. Results were mixed. For overall cognitive function, there was low-certainty evidence of benefit associated with ß-carotene after a mean of 18 years of treatment (MD 0.18 TICS points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35) and of vitamin C after 5 years to 10 years (MD 0.46 TICS points, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78), but not at earlier time points. From two studies which reported on dementia incidence, there was low-certainty evidence of no effect of an antioxidant vitamin combination or of vitamin E, either alone or combined with selenium. One of the included studies had been designed to look for effects on the incidence of prostate cancer; it found a statistically significant increase in prostate cancer diagnoses among men taking vitamin E. One trial with 4143 participants compared vitamin D3 (400 IU/day) and calcium supplements to placebo. We found low- to moderate-certainty evidence of no effect of vitamin D3 and calcium supplements at any time-point up to 10 years on overall cognitive function (MD after a mean of 7.8 years -0.1 MMSE points, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.61) or the incidence of dementia (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24). A pilot study with 60 participants used a higher dose of vitamin D3 (4000 IU on alternate days) and found preliminary evidence that this dose probably has no effect on cognitive function over six months. We included data from one trial of zinc and copper supplementation with 1072 participants. There was moderate-certainty evidence of little or no effect on overall cognitive function (MD 0.6 MMSE points, 95% CI -0.19 to 1.39) or on the incidence of cognitive impairment after 5 years to 10 years. A second smaller trial provided no usable data, but reported no cognitive effects of six months of supplementation with zinc gluconate. From one study with 3711 participants, there was low-certainty evidence of no effect of approximately five years of selenium supplementation on the incidence of dementia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13). Finally, we included three trials of complex supplements (combinations of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals) with 6306 participants. From the one trial which assessed overall cognitive function, there was low-certainty evidence of little or no effect on the TICS (MD after a mean of 8.5 years 0.12, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.38).

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find evidence that any vitamin or mineral supplementation strategy for cognitively healthy adults in mid or late life has a meaningful effect on cognitive decline or dementia, although the evidence does not permit definitive conclusions. There were very few data on supplementation starting in midlife (< 60 years); studies designed to assess cognitive outcomes tended to be too short to assess maintenance of cognitive function; longer studies often had other primary outcomes and used cognitive measures which may have lacked sensitivity. The only positive signals of effect came from studies of long-term supplementation with antioxidant vitamins. These may be the most promising for further research.

### Normal vitamin levels and nutritional indices in Alzheimer's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia with normal body mass indexes [^112KL43j]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite decades of research focused on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major lack of knowledge persists and we do not yet have any effective methods of preventing or curing this condition. The core pathological features of AD are formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, with other factors contributing to the degenerative cascade, such as increased oxidative stress, defective mitochondrial function and cellular energy production, and chronic inflammatory mechanisms. Genetic studies have also identified several risk genes and protective genes, adding to the complexity of AD etiology.

Prior research has also identified several potentially modifiable risk factors for AD, including a midlife history of hypertension, type 2-diabetes, and obesity, even in people with apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ 4, a well-established AD risk factor itself. These findings support the development of strategies for modifying and preventing AD, including nutritional changes and supplementation based on data suggesting better cognitive performance among non-demented elderly individuals consuming a plant-rich diet or fish products.

Cognitive decline in AD may be associated with deficits in vitamin uptake and metabolism that lead to reduced protection against peroxidation, followed by possible neuron damage. A pilot study demonstrated significantly lower concentrations of several vitamins in AD patients with moderate-stage dementia, without vascular disease and weight reduction, when compared with healthy age-matched controls. This may imply that modifying nutrition and intake of specific vitamins could protect against brain damage and dementia. In fact, the OPTIMA group in Oxford reported that high-dose supplementation with the vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid slowed brain atrophy in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly in those with high ω-3 fatty acids. If vitamin deficiencies are truly causative for the development of AD dementia, these deficits would be detectable in patients with MCI or in very early stages of AD dementia.

Our present study aimed to investigate whether micronutrient reductions have a causative relationship to AD. We studied nutrition in healthy control subjects and in patients diagnosed with AD prior to any substantial weight loss, who did not show any interfering cerebrovascular, neurological, or psychiatric diseases or acute infections that could influence the blood levels of several vitamins.

### A long journey into aging, brain aging, and Alzheimer's disease following the oxidative stress tracks [^116fJGzC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

COULD WE PREVENT COGNITIVE DECLINE AND OXIDATIVE STRESS DAMAGE WITH ANTIOXIDANTS AND/OR DIETARY HABITS?

Much evidence has shown, along with time, the role of micronutrients in protecting against several diseases, in our case those associated with aging, but most of the interventional studies were not successful. Vitamin E is paradigmatic to this purpose. After a great enthusiasm when vitamin E use was associated with a slower decline in AD, all the following studies failed in finding beneficial effects of vitamin E supplementation in AD and MCI. But many biases are present in most of them. The first is the treatment with only α-tocopherol, which at high dose reduces or blocks the absorption of all the other essential tocopherols and tocotrienols, probably causing a deleterious biochemical imbalance in the organism. Furthermore, there was not a baseline evaluation of vitamin E status, so it is conceivable that many subjects did not suffer from vitamin deficiency and they were over/useless-treated. This is not a trivial consideration since, for example, we know that, without a good level of vitamin C, the increase in α-tocopherol can modify the redox balance, with an increase in oxidized forms of α-tocopherol that cannot be re-reduced by ascorbic acid. However, this is just an example of possible alteration we could cause without a profound knowledge of biochemical pathways. From this perspective, in a study conducted in a broad healthy community-dwelling old subjects, we found a progressive decline with age of another micronutrient, zinc (Zn), with the lowest levels in nonagenarians, who showed inadequate plasma levels in more than 60%. Few weeks of supplementation increased Zn plasma levels in subjects with low but not in those with normal levels at baseline, suggesting that supplementation is beneficial mainly, or only, in the state of deficiency. Therefore, if we want to treat patients with vitamins or other nutraceuticals, as frequently suggested also for cognitive impairment and AD, we need to know better their physiological actions and interactions, chemical properties and side effects. Every proposed nutraceutical must be studied as a new drug, passing through all phases of a clinical trial, with a rigorous flowchart.

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation? [^112Bc37V]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, supplementation was perceived as harmless without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, whether or not in combination with vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding constitutes a safety signal that has to be taken seriously, these data have to be interpreted with some caution. Current data do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, but require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even in the most frail and elderly populations. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency preferably by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation on individuals at high risk of fracture or in whom calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual oral administration of high dose of vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Yet, the optimal dosing schedule is unknown and needs further study. In order to correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and to prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D is recommended in elderly or institutionalised people, patients with established osteoporosis and individuals on glucocorticoids.

### Vitamin D, cognition, and dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158Njds]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between cognitive function and dementia with vitamin D concentration in adults.

Methods

Five databases were searched for English-language studies up to August 2010, and included all study designs with a comparative group. Cognitive function or impairment was defined by tests of global or domain-specific cognitive performance and dementia was diagnosed according to recognized criteria. A vitamin D measurement was required. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using predefined criteria. The Q statistic and I² methods were used to test for heterogeneity. We conducted meta-analyses using random effects models for the weighted mean difference (WMD) and Hedge's g.

Results

Thirty-seven studies were included; 8 contained data allowing mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores to be compared between participants with vitamin D < 50 nmol/L to those with values ≥ 50 nmol/L. There was significant heterogeneity among the studies that compared the WMD for MMSE but an overall positive effect for the higher vitamin D group (1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5 to 1.9; I² = 0.65; p = 0.002). The small positive effect persisted despite several sensitivity analyses. Six studies presented data comparing Alzheimer disease (AD) to controls but 2 utilized a method withdrawn from commercial use. For the remaining 4 studies the AD group had a lower vitamin D concentration compared to the control group (WMD = -6.2 nmol/L, 95% CI -10.6 to -1.8) with no heterogeneity (I² < 0.01; p = 0.53).

Conclusion

These results suggest that lower vitamin D concentrations are associated with poorer cognitive function and a higher risk of AD. Further studies are required to determine the significance and potential public health benefit of this association.

### Is vitamin D the fountain of youth? [^1121WqZ8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of vitamin D deficiency for both classic and "nonclassic" effects and raise the caution that association does not prove causation.

Methods

The pertinent literature regarding vitamin D and its effects on bone, muscle function, immune function, glucose tolerance, cancer risk, and development of cardiovascular disease and other conditions is reviewed. In addition, the limitations of observational studies are discussed.

Results

Vitamin D inadequacy is common worldwide and classically causes osteomalacia and rickets. More recently, the contribution of low vitamin D status to increased falls and fracture risk has become appreciated. Additionally, nonclassic effects of vitamin D inadequacy are being recognized, and low vitamin D status is being potentially associated with a multitude of conditions (including Alzheimer disease, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, and hypertension) and higher overall mortality. It is important to recognize that associations in observational studies can be due to chance, bias, or confounders or may be indicative of causality.

Conclusion

Because vitamin D deficiency has been established to have adverse musculoskeletal consequences, optimization of vitamin D status, for both the individual patient and the overall population, is indicated.

ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES

In general, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of other agents, including anti-inflammatory drugs, gingko, vitamin E, selegiline, estrogens, pentoxifylline, or statins, for the treatment of AD. A meta-analysis of dementia treatment strategies performed by Laver et al. reported that selegiline and ginkgo biloba showed statistically significant positive effects across seven studies each; however, the quality of these studies was low (due to risk of bias and inconsistency of results) and very low (due to very serious risk of bias and inconsistency of results), respectively. In contrast, a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study did not show a cognitive or functional benefit for ginkgo biloba in patients with mild to moderate AD; however, the placebo group demonstrated little cognitive or functional decline and, consequently, may have reduced the likelihood of detecting a treatment effect. The aforementioned meta-analysis by Laver et al. also reported that statins had no statistically significant effect across three studies with high-quality evidence. A recent study indicates that statins may prove more effective in individuals with the ApoE4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, but further evidence is needed to support this finding. Data regarding postmenopausal hormone therapy have been mixed, with a large clinical trial demonstrating an increased risk of cognitive decline with hormone therapy and a 2013 meta-analysis of seven studies finding no overall effect of estrogen therapy on AD. Although research continues into the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in preventing and treating AD, a meta-analysis demonstrated that the evidence does not support the use of these drugs to improve cognition or reduce AD severity. The AAN 2001 guidelines recommended the use of vitamin E to slow progression of AD, but the more recently updated APA 2014 and EAN 2010 guidelines do not support this recommendation. Furthermore, there may be some safety concerns with high-dose (≥ 400 IU/day) vitamin E supplements, although the results of a more recent Veterans Administration (VA) study suggested that vitamin E (2000 IU/day) in combination with a ChEI was well tolerated and effective in slowing functional decline in older men with mild to moderate AD.

### The associations of serum vitamin D status and vitamin D supplements use with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia: a UK biobank based prospective cohort study [^114ChjNz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior studies on vitamin D and dementia outcomes yielded mixed results and had several important limitations.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the associations of both serum vitamin D status and supplementation with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) incidence.

Methods

With a prospective cohort study design, we comprehensively assessed the associations of vitamin D and multivitamin supplementation, as well as vitamin D deficiency {25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30 nmol/L}, and insufficiency [25(OH)D 30 to < 50 nmol/L], with the 14-year incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD in 269,229 participants, aged 55 to 69, from the UK Biobank.

Results

Although 5.0% reported regular vitamin D use and 19.8% reported multivitamin use, the majority of participants exhibited either vitamin D deficiency (18.3%) or insufficiency (34.0%). However, vitamin D deficiency was less prevalent among users of vitamin D (6.9%) or multivitamin preparations (9.5%) than among nonusers (21.5%). Adjusted Cox regression models demonstrated 19% to 25% increased risk of all 3 dementia outcomes for those with vitamin D deficiency [hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.25 (1.16, 1.34) for all-cause dementia; 1.19 (1.07–1.31) for AD; 1.24 (1.08–1.43) for VD] and 10% to 15% increased risk of those with vitamin D insufficiency [HR (95% CI): 1.11 (1.05, 1.18) for all-cause dementia; 1.10 (1.02–1.19) for AD; 1.15 (1.03–1.29) for VD]. Regular users of vitamin D and multivitamins had 17% and 14% lower risk of AD [HR (95% CI): 0.83 (0.71, 0.98)] and VD [HR (95% CI): 0.86 (0.75, 0.98)] incidence, respectively.

Conclusions

Although our findings indicate the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation for dementia prevention, randomized controlled trials are essential for definitive evidence.

Discussion

Summary of the findings

Utilizing data from 55- to 69-year-old study participants of the population-based UK Biobank with 14 years of follow-up, our study revealed consistent associations between objectively measured vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency (via serum samples), as well as self-reported regular use of vitamin D supplements, with all-cause, AD, and VD dementia, although some results for vitamin D supplements use did not reach statistical significance. A 25(OH)D level cut-off of 50 nmol/L appeared appropriate for predicting dementia outcomes, but the dementia risk was particularly pronounced in individuals with 25(OH)D level cut-off below 30 nmol/L (e.g. 25% increased all-cause dementia risk). No or even reversed associations of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency, and vitamin D supplementation with dementia outcomes were observed for individuals with darker skin tones. Furthermore, vitamin D users of younger age (55–64 y) had more robust risk reduction for AD than older individuals (65–69 y), which was consistent with a higher AD risk of subjects with vitamin D deficiency in the younger than in the older age group. In addition, vitamin D supplement use was strongly associated with all dementia outcomes among participants with and without obesity. Lastly, it is worth noting that we observed a statistically significant association between multivitamin supplement use and reduced VD risk — again, especially among subjects with obesity.

### SYNERGIC TRIAL (SYNchronizing exercises, remedies in gait and cognition) a multi-centre randomized controlled double blind trial to improve gait and cognition in mild cognitive impairment [^115e2g8N]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Physical exercise, cognitive training, and vitamin D are low cost interventions that have the potential to enhance cognitive function and mobility in older adults, especially in pre-dementia states such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Aerobic and progressive resistance exercises have benefits to cognitive performance, though evidence is somewhat inconsistent. We postulate that combined aerobic exercise (AE) and progressive resistance training (RT) (combined exercise) will have a better effect on cognition than a balance and toning control (BAT) intervention in older adults with MCI. We also expect that adding cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to the combined exercise, as a multimodal intervention, will have synergistic efficacy.

Methods

The SYNERGIC trial (SYNchronizing Exercises, Remedies in GaIt and Cognition) is a multi-site, double-blinded, five-arm, controlled trial that assesses the potential synergic effect of combined AE and RT on cognition and mobility, with and without cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation in older adults with MCI. Two-hundred participants with MCI aged 60 to 85 years old will be randomized to one of five arms, four of which include combined exercise plus combinations of dual-task cognitive training (real vs. sham) and vitamin D supplementation (3×10,000 IU/wk. vs. placebo) in a quasi-factorial design, and one arm which receives all control interventions. The primary outcome measure is the ADAS-Cog (13 and plus modalities) measured at baseline and at 6 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include neuroimaging, neuro-cognitive performance, gait and mobility performance, and serum biomarkers of inflammation (C reactive protein and interleukin 6), neuroplasticity (brain-derived neurotropic factor), endothelial markers (vascular endothelial growth factor 1), and vitamin D serum levels.

Discussion

The SYNERGIC Trial will establish the efficacy and feasibility of a multimodal intervention to improve cognitive performance and mobility outcomes in MCI. These interventions may contribute to new approaches to stabilize and reverse cognitive-mobility decline in older individuals with MCI.
