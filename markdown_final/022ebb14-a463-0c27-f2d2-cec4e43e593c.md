## Question

What function hot nodules

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what function hot nodules have. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and pathophysiology of a "hot" thyroid nodule. Then, I should verify the functional consequences, including hormone production and TSH suppression. Next, I will review the clinical implications for malignancy risk and diagnostic strategy. After that, I should consider treatment options and their outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically oriented answer and double-check for any exceptions or nuances I might miss.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: a "hot" thyroid nodule is a hyperfunctioning nodule that shows increased radionuclide uptake on thyroid scintigraphy, reflecting autonomous thyroid hormone production independent of TSH stimulation, which is why it appears "hot" relative to surrounding tissue.

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Autonomous function is typically driven by somatic activating mutations in the TSH receptor or G-protein signaling pathways, leading to constitutive cAMP signaling and unchecked hormone synthesis and proliferation; this mechanistic link explains both the functional autonomy and the low malignancy risk in most cases [^2f81217a] [^498c27e8] [^4d3a3df4].

> Hold on, let's not conflate "function" with "malignancy". I should confirm the clinical implication: because hot nodules are autonomously functioning, they almost never represent clinically significant malignancy, with a negative predictive value for cancer around 96–99%, so routine fine-needle aspiration is not indicated unless there are atypical clinical or sonographic features [^4d3a3df4] [^cc390a20] [^412ef00a].

> Next, I should review the functional consequences. Autonomous hormone production suppresses TSH, which can lead to subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism; symptoms include anxiety, palpitations, weight loss, heat intolerance, and long-term risks such as atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis, particularly in older adults or those with persistently suppressed TSH [^0f97c37a] [^7b32fa4e].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't overgeneralize. The first step is to measure serum TSH; if TSH is low, a radionuclide thyroid scan (preferably iodine-123) is indicated to confirm autonomous function and identify the culprit nodule, after which cytologic evaluation is generally unnecessary unless additional red flags are present [^cc390a20] [^ed9f0bb2] [^5411ab48].

> I will now examine treatment options and expected outcomes. Definitive therapy is typically radioactive iodine ablation, which normalizes thyroid function in 85–100% of patients and reduces goiter size by a median of about 35% at 3 months and 45% at 24 months; however, hypothyroidism can occur in up to 60% over 20 years, so lifelong monitoring is needed [^a0691649]. Alternatives include surgery for large nodules or when malignancy is suspected, and thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) for patients who decline or are ineligible for radioiodine; ablation reduces nodule volume and can restore euthyroidism in many, though recurrence and incomplete biochemical cure can occur, and guidelines advise against thermal ablation as first-line for large AFTNs [^49037eee] [^c7261eaa] [^1f405328].

> But wait, what if the "hot" appearance is misleading? I should double-check exceptions. Rarely, malignancy can present as a hot nodule, including Hürthle cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma with activating TSH receptor mutations; thus, discordant clinical or sonographic features should prompt reconsideration of biopsy or surgical management despite scintigraphic appearance [^9627dff8] [^ed225753] [^f3b49b8c].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Hot nodules function as autonomously secreting thyroid hormone sources that suppress TSH, typically due to somatic TSH receptor or G-protein signaling mutations; clinically, they carry a very low malignancy risk and usually do not require FNA, but they can cause subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism with attendant cardiovascular and skeletal risks, and definitive management is most often radioactive iodine ablation, with surgery or thermal ablation reserved for selected cases [^05504295] [^4d3a3df4] [^cc390a20] [^a0691649] [^49037eee].

Hot nodules are **autonomously functioning thyroid nodules** that produce thyroid hormone independent of TSH, often due to somatic TSH receptor or G-protein signaling mutations [^2f81217a] [^498c27e8]. They typically present with **suppressed TSH and elevated free T4/T3**, causing hyperthyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism [^0f97c37a]. On scintigraphy, they show increased tracer uptake ("hot") with suppression of surrounding tissue, indicating low malignancy risk (~1%) [^4d3a3df4] [^cc390a20]. Management is usually **radioactive iodine ablation** or surgery; thermal ablation is an option for select patients [^a0691649] [^49037eee]. Most patients normalize thyroid function after treatment, though hypothyroidism can occur [^a0691649].

## Physiological function of hot nodules

Hot nodules are **autonomously functioning thyroid nodules** that produce thyroid hormone independent of TSH stimulation [^05504295]. This autonomy arises from somatic mutations in the TSH receptor gene or G-protein signaling pathways, leading to constitutive activation of the cAMP signaling cascade and increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion [^2f81217a] [^498c27e8].

---

## Clinical implications of hot nodules

Hot nodules have several **important clinical implications**:

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Hot nodules can cause overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism, characterized by suppressed TSH levels and elevated free T4 and/or T3 hormones [^0f97c37a]. Symptoms include anxiety, palpitations, weight loss, heat intolerance, and tremor [^eecdc5ac].

- **Low malignancy risk**: Hot nodules have a very low risk of malignancy, approximately 1% or less, making them generally benign entities [^4d3a3df4] [^cc390a20].

- **Suppression of surrounding thyroid tissue**: The autonomous hormone production from hot nodules suppresses TSH secretion, leading to decreased function and atrophy of surrounding thyroid tissue [^05504295].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic evaluation of hot nodules typically includes the following steps:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose and findings** |
|-|-|
| Serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 | Suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and/or T3 indicates hyperthyroidism due to autonomous nodule function [^0f97c37a] |
| Thyroid scintigraphy (radioiodine or technetium-99m) | Increased tracer uptake in the nodule with suppression of surrounding thyroid tissue confirms autonomous function ("hot" nodule) [^05504295] |
| Thyroid ultrasound | Identifies nodule size, location, and characteristics; helps differentiate solid from cystic lesions [^3654f39b] |

---

## Management strategies

Management of hot nodules depends on the presence of hyperthyroidism, nodule size, and patient preference. Options include:

- **Radioactive iodine therapy**: First-line treatment for toxic hot nodules, achieving high rates of cure (85–100%) and significant reduction in nodule size [^a0691649] [^1e01b068].

- **Surgery**: Reserved for large nodules causing compressive symptoms, suspicion of malignancy, or patient preference [^aa728fea].

- **Thermal ablation**: Minimally invasive option for patients who decline or are ineligible for radioactive iodine or surgery; effective in reducing nodule size and restoring euthyroidism in selected cases [^49037eee] [^32c748d1].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis for patients with hot nodules is **generally excellent**. Radioactive iodine therapy effectively restores euthyroidism in most patients, though hypothyroidism may develop in up to 60% over 20 years, necessitating lifelong thyroid hormone replacement [^a0691649]. Surgical management offers definitive cure but carries risks of hypothyroidism and surgical complications [^notfound]. Thermal ablation provides favorable outcomes in selected patients, with low recurrence rates and minimal complications [^32c748d1].

Hot nodules are **autonomously functioning thyroid nodules** that produce thyroid hormone independent of TSH, often causing hyperthyroidism. They have a low malignancy risk and are typically managed with radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, with excellent outcomes.

### Benign thyroid disease: what is the role of nuclear medicine? [^e12b577a]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Nuclear medicine is directly involved in both the diagnosis and treatment of benign thyroid disease, which requires an understanding of the pathophysiology and management of thyroid disorders in addition to expertise in nuclear methodology. Thyroid uptake and imaging, the principal nuclear tests in thyroid disease, may be used as follows: (1) Differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism: A very low thyroid uptake suggests destructive ("subacute") thyroiditis, a self-limited disorder, whereas a normal or elevated uptake is consistent with toxic nodular goiter and Graves' disease. Scintigraphic characteristics also help differentiate between nodular and Graves' disease. (2) Function of thyroid nodules: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytological examination (FNAB) is used routinely to assess for malignancy in thyroid nodules. Scintigraphy may be of assistance before FNAB. "Hot" nodules are generally benign and do not require FNAB, while "cold" nodules may be malignant. (3) Differential diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism: Scintigraphy combined with ultrasound examination may be used to identify such conditions as thyroid agenesis, dyshormonogenesis, and incomplete thyroid descent. Treatment of Graves' disease and toxic nodular disease with (131)I may require greater clinical involvement and decision analysis compared with thyroid uptake and imaging. The following aspects of treatment are particularly important: (1) Risk: Radioiodine treatment may occasionally aggravate hyperthyroidism, Graves' ophthalmopathy, and airway obstruction caused by large, nodular goiters. Alternative treatments, including the temporary use of antithyroid drugs, and surgery for nodular goiters, may be considered. (2) Radioiodine dose: Cure of hyperthyroidism with a single (131)I treatment is desirable, though not always possible. Such factors as a large goiter, severe hyperthyroidism, and prior propylthiouracil therapy, may contribute to treatment failure. (3) Informed consent: A detailed discussion with the patient regarding the clinical risks, outcomes, and side effects of (131)I is a critical component of successful management.

Thyroid nodules — functional assessment and malignancy risk note that thyroid nodules are common incidental findings on clinical examination and/or imaging studies and it is necessary to decide which nodules carry a potential risk of malignancy and require further workup with fine-needle-aspiration (FNA) biopsy for definitive characterization; high-resolution thyroid ultrasound (US) provides an accurate assessment of sono-morphological nodule features used to produce a standardized risk assessment for thyroid malignancy under thyroid imaging and data reporting system (TI-RADS); however, none of the TI-RADS criteria addresses the functional status of thyroid nodules, and a scintigraphically hyperfunctioning ("hot") thyroid nodule has a 96–99% negative predictive value for malignancy.

### Thyrotropin receptor mutations and thyroid hyperfunctioning adenomas ten years after their first discovery: unresolved questions [^2f81217a]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Ten years after the first description of activating mutations in the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) gene in sporadic autonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, there is general agreement in assigning a major pathogenic role of this genetic abnormality, acting via the constitutive activation of the cAMP pathway, in both the growth and functional characteristic of these tumours. From the beginning, however, the pathophysiological and clinical relevance of somatic TSHR mutations has been debated and some arguments still exist against a fully causative role of these mutations and the practical value of detecting these mutations for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of thyroid hot nodules. Some major issues will be examined herein, including (a) the frequency of TSHR alterations in various reports showing that the genetic abnormality underlying the pathogenesis of a substantial subset of thyroid tumours has yet to be identified; (b) the limitations of the present experimental models, which suggest greater caution in the interpretation of in vitro results; (c) the still unresolved question of absence of genotype-phenotype correlation. Clarification of these issues may hopefully provide new and useful tools for improving the clinical management of this disease.

### Autonomous functioning thyroid nodules and 131I in diagnosis and therapy after 50 years of experience: what is still open to debate? [^1e01b068]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Report

Autonomous functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN), defined as "hot nodules" at thyroid scan, are often cured by radioiodine treatment. The aim of our study was to investigate the long-term outcome in patients treated with an 131I calculated dose, to identify a possible "size-tailored" dose, and to simplify follow-up procedures.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective analysis was carried out on 1402 cases, covering a period of 50 years, of AFTN treated with an 131I calculated dose. Our study focused on nodular size and mean administered dose. Concordance between thyroid scan and serum TSH levels at 3–6 months from treatment was considered.

Results

A single 131I dose was effective for the vast majority of patients (93%). The outcome was influenced by nodular size. On the basis of the Italian dose limit for outpatient treatment, our population was divided into subgroups according to administered doses (more or less than 16 mCi) and nodular dimensions: no differences in outcome were observed for each class of nodule size. A dose ≤ 10 mCi was effective on the smaller nodules (50.1% of our population). The agreement between TSH and scan after treatment was 90.3% at 3 months and 94.5% at 6 months.

Conclusions

131I therapy with a calculated dose is an effective treatment of AFTN. If a fixed dose is chosen, 16 mCi is often resolutive and for nodules < 3 cm a dose of 10 mCi can suffice. Nodules > 5 cm are eligible for surgery. TSH is the only parameter required to evaluate the outcome.

### Divergent immune microenvironments in two tumor nodules from a patient with mismatch repair-deficient prostate cancer [^94691623]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We also demonstrate here that a prostate tumor may interact with many forms of immune cells in its microenvironment. Outside of regulatory and helper T-cells, we inferred enrichment of γδ T-cells, M1 macrophages, and activated NK cells in the hot nodule relative to the cold nodule. Studies have shown that NKor γδ T-cells, are able to invade and kill tumors. As compared to T-cells, which have been less effective in driving tumor response in solid tumors, further research should measure the relative infiltration rates of NK and/or γδ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may allow us to consider such cell-based therapies for treating prostate tumors.

There are technical and statistical limitations based on this case study of two nodules. We have made descriptive observations based on thresholds that would typically be considered notable in clinical reports or larger patient cohorts. However, validating function and causality would still require further modeling of the patients' tumors. To generalize our key observations, we would also require validation of key findings in greater cohorts of dMMR tumors.

In conclusion, our case study highlights that complex genomic and transcriptomic alterations can regulate the TME in TMB-high and MSI-high PC tumors. Therefore, in addition to examining mutational burdens and signatures, it is of relevance to interrogate additional immune-regulatory and clonal processes, as well as to consider the types of immune cells that are associated with the tumor and its microenvironment. Finally, the observation of HLA loss in the context of MMR-deficient cancers observed here (and reported elsewhere)may have broader relevance as an immune evasion mechanism in other tumor contexts. In this patient with an ultra-high TMB in both the hot and cold nodules, it is tempting to speculate that the immunogenic effect of accumulating mutations may have been counterbalanced by transcriptional events that dampened immunoreactivity.

Thyroid scintigraphy — indications, classification, and technique: Thyroid scintigraphy is the only technique that allows assessment of regional thyroid function and AFTN detection; based on radionuclide uptake, nodules are classified as hyperfunctioning (hot), hypofunctioning (cold), or indeterminate, and hot nodules almost never represent clinically significant malignant lesions, whereas cold or indeterminate nodules have a reported malignancy risk of 3% to 15%; diagnostic specificity is further decreased in small lesions (< 1 cm). The role of scintigraphy is limited in iodine‑rich regions where serum TSH and thyroid US can correctly diagnose autonomous nodules in most patients, but when thyroid nodules are present in patients with Graves' disease, a radionuclide scan should be used to rule out a cold nodule within a hyperfunctioning gland. In iodine‑deficient regions, scintigraphy is used as part of the evaluation of patients with MNG because it provides functional characterization. Quantitative pertechnetate scintigraphy is described as a sensitive and specific technique for diagnosing and quantitating thyroid autonomy and predicting hyperthyroidism in euthyroid autonomy. Thyroid scintigraphy can be performed with 123I or 99mTcO4- (sodium pertechnetate); for 99mTcO4-, advantages include less expensive, more readily available, and more rapid examination, whereas disadvantages include trapping without organification with risk of false-positive images, potential misinterpretation from esophageal or vascular activity, and poor image quality when uptake is low.

Of note, our GSEA analysis indicated that the hot nodule was interestingly enriched in EMT and WNT signaling, two pathways typically associated with the immune evasion. Our study implicates other pathways may have led to the distinct immune cell phenotypes in these nodules. With respect to ICI implications, our findings indicate that clinical-grade molecular tests should consider reporting immune-regulatory signatures and relative expression levels of HLA and immunoglobulin genes in addition to TMB and MSI status.

Currently, the low response rates of heterogeneous solid tumors, including PC, to single-agent immunotherapies has led to active investigation of combination strategies. Our patient was enrolled in a trial in which ADT was combined with a cellular PC vaccine, GVAX. Interestingly, both the hot and cold nodules shared variants with GVAX based on the variant profiles of PC3 and LNCaP cells found in the DepMap database. While the hot nodule overall shared less variants with these cell lines (Supplementary Table 6), it remains possible that specific highly-immunogenic variant(s) produced antigens that mediated the inflamed response. Previous work has demonstrated that androgens may suppress T-cell function, and that inhibition of AR (via ADT and/or ART) may alter the TME by enhancing T-cell functionThe rationale of the GVAX trial was that ADT would complement the vaccine to promote infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells and ultimately CD8 + T-cells into tumors. In this patient, both nodules underwent the same systemic therapy, which indicates that mechanisms other than ADT drove the significant differences in the TMEs. Stromal cells may also contribute to the divergent immune phenotypes. The cold nodule was visually associated with greater proportions of stromal cells. However, functional mapping with single cell resolution (which was not possible here) is required to determine if specific stromal cells may have contributed to the differences in immune cell infiltration. A more refined understanding, which will require more patient studies, is necessary to identify the recurrent mechanisms that alter the TME in PC patients, which may impact the deployment of immune checkpoint blockade, cell-based therapies, and vaccine therapies in solid tumors.

### Complementary DNA expression array analysis suggests a lower expression of signal transduction proteins and receptors in cold and hot thyroid nodules [^94bc3654]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules are characterized by an increased proliferation and function, which is predominantly caused by constitutively activating TSH receptor mutations leading to an activation of cAMP. In contrast to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, cold thyroid nodules are functionally inactive and less differentiated. Their molecular cause is still unknown. To further investigate the pathophysiological aspects of autonomously functioning thyroid nodules and to elucidate the molecular etiology of cold thyroid nodules, it is essential to identify genes with differential expression in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules and cold thyroid nodules and to compare this expression to that in normal surrounding tissue. The list of possible candidates for differential regulation ranges from growth factors and their receptors to transcription factors or oncogenes. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of cDNA arrays and studied the expression of 588 known genes from 6 different classes of proteins in thyroid nodules characterized for their function. Forty-seven genes showed a differential expression between nodular and surrounding tissue identified by the expression arrays. The differential expression of 15 transcripts was verified by real-time PCR. About 25% of the transcripts determined by LightCycler PCR are considered false positives because data from PCR and array analysis did not agree. This indicates the reliability of cDNA expression arrays to identify differentially expressed genes in thyroid nodules compared with their surrounding tissue. The 15 selected genes were additionally quantified by real-time PCR in 7 additional cold thyroid nodules, autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, and their surrounding tissues. The highest number of differentially expressed genes was in the group of signal transduction proteins (4 of 38 detectable genes) and extracellular cell signaling and communication proteins (2 of 62 detectable genes). In contrast, transcripts of other classes of proteins were unchanged (e.g. DNA-binding molecules and stress responses). Most of the transcripts were down-regulated in autonomously functioning thyroid nodule and cold thyroid nodule compared with the respective surrounding tissue. This finding could be the result of a dominant activation of a signal transduction pathway, with the cAMP pathway being the likely candidate for autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. The qualitatively similar pattern of changes in this limited number of genes in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules and cold thyroid nodules could suggest a similar dominant activation of a specific signaling cascade in cold thyroid nodules as the constitutively activating mutations in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules.

Discussion

TMB-high and MSI-high status in tumors are associated with increased immunogenicity, immune recognition, and elimination of tumor antigens by the immune system. Due to these factors, TMB and MSI status are currently used as clinical biomarkers to deploy ICI treatments in a histology-agnostic fashion. Our study demonstrates that additional features may regulate the TME, and further investigations are required to identify mechanisms that drive immune-cell interaction in the 3–5% of PC tumors that are TMB-high and/or MSI-high. As indicated by two adjacent tumor nodules in this PC patient, the hot nodule had higher expression of HLA and immunoglobulin genes compared to the cold nodule. Or perhaps, viewed alternatively, the cold nodule lost HLA and immunoglobulin gene expression as a means of adaptive immune resistance. An alternative hypothesis is that the lower expression of HLA and immunoglobulin genes could have been the result of a sparser immune-cell infiltrate in the cold nodule due to the bulk RNA sequencing methodology used (rather than single-cell RNA sequencing). Interestingly, some recent studies have indicated that tumors can decrease expression of antigen-presentation genes in order to evade immune-cell surveillance. As another possibility, each nodule also harbored alterations in regulatory genes and epigenetic factors that regulate immune surveillance. This may have contributed to the reduced immune surveillance functions in the cold nodule. We also found that both nodules exhibited largely similar mutational processes, with the exception of a component of HRR, but had distinct numbers of subclones and VAF accumulation rates.

Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for benign thyroid nodules — evidence cited states that PEI "is significantly superior to aspiration alone for inducing volume reduction in cysts and complex nodules with a dominant fluid component", and it "seems especially suitable for medium-sized relapsing lesions that can effectively be treated with a single or few sessions". Safety and logistics are favorable: "The procedure is rapid, safe, and well-tolerated and requires neither posttreatment observation nor medical support", and "Thyroid function is unaltered, and there is no induction of thyroid autoimmunity", leading to the directive that "PEI represents the first-line treatment of relapsing benign cystic lesions". For hyperfunctioning nodules, "PEI is generally not indicated… and should be reserved for hot nodules with compressive symptoms only when more effective alternative treatment options are not possible". In solid cold nodules, "Clinically significant decreases in nodule size after PEI have been reported", but "PEI should be considered for benign solid nodules only when alternative and more efficacious treatment modalities are not available".

Thyroid scintigraphy and radioiodine thyroid uptake (RAIU) — indications include that thyroid scintigraphy is useful for evaluating size and location of thyroid tissue; abnormal thyroid function consistent with over or subclinical hyperthyroidism; differentiation of hypoechogenic thyroids according to low and high thyroid uptake; suspected focal masses or diffuse thyroid disease; function of thyroid nodules detected on clinical examination and/or other imaging examinations; evaluation of multinodular goiter to identify suspicious hypofunctional "cold" areas that require further evaluation with FNA-biopsy; evaluation of multinodular goiter for hyperfunctional "hot" thyroid nodules prior to radioiodine ablation; evaluation of thyroid nodules with indeterminate FNA-biopsy results to identify a benign AFTN (including "compensated" ones); and thyroid ectopia and diagnostic work-up of congenital hypothyroidism, while RAIU is useful for differentiating hyperthyroidism from other forms of thyrotoxicosis and detecting iodine organification defects with the perchlorate discharge test.

Thyroid scintigraphy interpretation — normal patterns and nodule characterization: Adequate interpretation requires knowledge of the current hormonal status, particularly of TSH concentration, comparison with clinical examination, and integration with ultrasonography results. The isthmus may, or may not, be visualized and a pyramidal lobe can be recognized in about 10% of patients, with tracer activity normally evenly distributed in the thyroid; salivary glands and gastric mucosa are also visualized due to NIS expression. Gray-scale documentation is preferable. Thyroid nodules are classified by tracer uptake relative to extranodular tissue: hypofunctioning "cold" nodules show reduced uptake, isofunctioning "warm" nodules show roughly equivalent uptake, and hyperfunctioning "hot" nodules show increased uptake; autonomously functioning thyroid nodules are often termed "hot" because they produce thyroid hormones in the absence of TSH-stimulating activity. Radiotracer uptake (123I- or 99mTcO4−) characterized as less than, equal to, or more than salivary activity offers a rough approximation of overall thyroid function, but accurate assessment of iodine uptake and kinetics can only be obtained by performing a RAIU test; uptake within a thyroglossal duct remnant and/or a pyramidal lobe is frequently seen in Graves' disease.

### HTDS guide-about thyroid disease: section summary… [^eecdc5ac]. archive.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

The thyroid gland, located in the front of the neck just below the Adam's apple, takes iodine from the diet and makes thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone affects a person's physical energy, temperature, weight and mood. Thyroid diseases generally fall into two broad groups of disorders: abnormal function and abnormal growth in the gland. These problems are common in the general population, especially among older people and women. Most thyroid problems can be detected and treated. Functional disorders are usually related to the gland producing too little thyroid hormone or too much thyroid hormone. Benign nodules in the thyroid gland are common and do not usually cause serious health problems. These nodules occur when the cell growth within the nodule is abnormal. Nodules can occasionally put pressure on the neck and cause trouble with swallowing, breathing or speaking if they are too large.

The thyroid usually functions normally even when nodules are present. Thyroid cancers are much less common than benign nodules. With treatment, the cure rate for thyroid cancer is more than 90 percent. Testing for Nodules If a nodule is found during the physical examination, a test called fine needle aspiration biopsy may be done to help find out whether the nodule is cancerous or benign. In addition, a thyroid nuclear scan may help the doctor evaluate thyroid function or nodules. The scan is performed by giving the patient a radioisotope and taking a special picture to see how much of the radioisotope is taken up by the thyroid gland. A thyroid ultrasound scan is a diagnostic test that shows a picture of the anatomy, or structure, of the thyroid gland. Ultrasound is most often used to determine if a nodule is solid or cystic. Cystic nodules, containing only fluid, are usually benign.

Ultrasound is not usually performed as a routine screening test for thyroid nodules in the general population. The reason is that small, nonpalpable ultrasound abnormalities are very common in people without evidence of thyroid disease. Too Much Thyroid Hormone Hyperthyroidism
- Nervousness and anxiety
- Weight loss
- Tremor
- Fast, irregular pulse
- Tiredness
- Feeling hot all the time The treatment of thyroid disease depends on many factors, including the type and severity of the thyroid disorder and the age and overall health of the patient. Treatment must be specific to each individual.

### Management of simple nodular goiter: current status and future perspectives [^799f9294]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The simple nodular goiter, the etiology of which is multifactorial, encompasses the spectrum from the incidental asymptomatic small solitary nodule to the large intrathoracic goiter, causing pressure symptoms as well as cosmetic complaints. Its management is still the cause of considerable controversy. The mainstay in the diagnostic evaluation is related to functional and morphological characterization with serum TSH and (some kind of) imaging. Because malignancy is just as common in patients with a multinodular goiter as patients with a solitary nodule, we support the increasing use of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (cytology). Most patients need no treatment after malignancy is ruled out. In case of cosmetic or pressure symptoms, the choice in multinodular goiter stands between surgery, which is still the first choice, and radioiodine if uptake is adequate. In addition to surgery, the solitary nodule, whether hot or cold, can be treated with percutaneous ethanol injection therapy. If hot, radioiodine is the therapy of choice. Randomized studies are scarce, and the side effects of nonsurgical therapy are coming into focus. Therefore, the use of the optimum option in the individual patient cannot at present be based on evidence. However, we are of the view that levothyroxine, although widely used, should no longer be recommended routinely for this condition. Within a few years, the introduction of recombinant human TSH and laser therapy may profoundly alter the nonsurgical treatment of simple nodular goiter.

### Predictive quantitative sonographic features on classification of hot and cold thyroid nodules [^003a6d58]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study investigated the potentiality of ultrasound imaging to classify hot and cold thyroid nodules on the basis of textural and morphological analysis.

Methods

In this research, 42 hypo (hot) and 42 hyper-function (cold) thyroid nodules were evaluated through the proposed method of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system. To discover the difference between hot and cold nodules, 49 sonographic features (9 morphological, 40 textural) were extracted. A support vector machine classifier was utilized for the classification of LNs based on their extracted features.

Results

In the training set data, a combination of morphological and textural features represented the best performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.992. Upon testing the data set, the proposed model could classify the hot and cold thyroid nodules with an AUC of 0.948.

Conclusions

CAD method based on textural and morphological features is capable of distinguishing between hot from cold nodules via 2-Dimensional sonography. Therefore, it can be used as a supplementary technique in daily clinical practices to improve the radiologists' understanding of conventional ultrasound imaging for nodules characterization.

### Expression of regulators of g protein signaling mRNA is differentially regulated in hot and cold thyroid nodules [^a2146ef8]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Because of their regulatory properties on cellular proliferation and differentiation, regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) have been suggested as potential tumor suppressors. The aim of this study was to describe the normal pattern of RGS transcripts in the thyroid gland systematically and to elucidate their potential role in common thyroid pathologies. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to quantify mRNA expression of RGS transcripts in 10 hot thyroid nodules (HTN), 10 cold thyroid nodules (CTN), and corresponding surrounding tissues (ST). We have found that 9 of 13 tested RGS transcripts were expressed in the human thyroid gland. Expression of several RGS transcripts was altered in thyroid nodules compared to corresponding normal tissue. In HTN and CTN, mRNA transcripts of RGS 2, 9, and 12 were significantly downregulated. In contrast, mRNA expression of RGS 3, 6, 10 was differentially regulated in HTN and CTN compared to corresponding normal tissue. RGS 3 transcripts were significantly upregulated in CTN. RGS 6 transcripts were significantly downregulated in CTN. RGS 10 mRNA was significantly reduced in HTN. We therefore propose that downregulation of several RGS transcripts in thyroid nodules might contribute to tumor growth within the thyroid gland.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of thyroid nodules — efficacy and comparative data: A recent meta-analysis showed a statistically significant improvement, including reduction in nodule size and improvement of both symptoms and cosmetic scores, and improvement in nodule size remained significant in both hot and cold nodule subgroups; twelve adverse events were identified across all studies from a total of 306 treatments. No study has compared RFA with surgical or other nonsurgical treatment modalities. A meta-analysis comparing studies of laser thermal ablation (LTA) and RFA showed higher efficacy in nodule size reduction with RFA, but a recent large scale study with over 1,500 patients demonstrated that LAT induces a volume reduction similar to that reported with RFA.

### Growth factor expression in cold and hot thyroid nodules [^498c27e8]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

Hot thyroid nodules (HTNs) are predominantly caused by constitutively activating thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) mutations leading to an activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-cascade that stimulates growth and function of thyroid epithelial cells and confers growth advantage. In contrast to HTNs, the molecular etiology of szintigraphically cold thyroid nodules (CTNs) is largely unknown. An increased prevalence of toxic multinodular goiters in iodine-deficient regions has been reported. Growth factors increase during early stages of iodine deficiency in rats. These growth factors could modulate the proliferation of thyrocytes. In order to determine if and which growth factors could modulate the increase in thyroid epithelial cell proliferation in late stages of CTNs and HTNs we investigated epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and TGF-beta1 concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) in CTNs (n = 7), HTNs (n = 9), and their normal surrounding tissue (ST). Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was determined in CTNs (n = 5) and HTNs (n = 10) and their surrounding tissues by radioimmunoassay (RIA). We found lower concentrations of all investigated growth factors and iodine in CTNs compared to surrounding normal tissues (ST). Only iodine showed a significant difference. Furthermore, we found significantly lower concentrations of EGF and TGF-beta1 concentration in HTNs compared to their STs. Differences of TGF-alpha and IGF-1 were not significant. In conclusion, low EGF, TGF-alpha, and IGF-1 concentrations in most CTNs in spite of low iodine concentrations argue against a pathophysiologic role of EGF, TGF-alpha, or IGF-1 in late stages of CTNs. The low EGF, TGF-alpha, and IGF-1 concentrations in HTNs irrespective of their clonal origin or the presence or absence of activating mutations argue for increased cAMP as the primary cause for thyroid epithelial cell proliferation in established HTNs. However, the pathophysiologic significance of low TGF-beta1 concentrations in CTNs and HTNs remains to be elucidated. It might be possible that growth factors like EGF, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta1, and IGF-1 play a more prominent role during early clonal expansion and that aberrant intrinsic signaling through a somatic mutation (e.g. TSHR for HTNs) confers the predominant selective growth advantage in later stages of HTNs or CTNs.

### Pathology of the autonomously functioning (hot) thyroid nodule [^f3b49b8c]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We describe the pathologic findings of 73 clinically and scintigraphically confirmed hot nodules. In general, hot nodules from an unselected group primarily treated by surgery were smaller and the sex ratio was closer to equality compared with the ample female predominance in the referral, pre-, and post-prophylaxis groups. Malignancy was observed in six cases (8.2%) (5 follicular, 1 papillary). Of the 67 benign tumors, 48 (71.6%) were adenomas which showed the cytoarchitectural features of hot nodules described previously, and 19 (28.3%) were less well-differentiated adenomas that included a few oxyphil tumors. Intracolloid oxalate crystals from background thyroid tissue were present in 59 assessable cases (83%) overall, the majority showed more than occasional crystals that had a tendency to increase in number with decreasing morphologic activity of the thyroid epithelium. Thyroglobulin protein and mRNA stainings tended to be more pronounced in cell cytoplasm of the tumors than in background thyroid. This study shows that hot nodules may show a wide morphologic spectrum of follicular neoplasms and can be occasionally malignant. It is inferred from the morphologic and other findings that it is likely that some, if not all, of the primary follicular cancers associated with hyperfunction arise by clonal progression from benign hot nodules. This progression is rare, probably because most hot nodules present with the symptoms of hyperfunction and receive early treatment.

Thyroid carcinoma — management of follicular/oncocytic neoplasm with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assessment is described: serum TSH with iodine-123 or technetium-99m scanning may identify an autonomously functioning "hot" nodule, and molecular diagnostic testing may be useful for follicular neoplasms. Patients who are clinically euthyroid with a low TSH and a hot nodule on thyroid imaging should be evaluated and treated for thyrotoxicosis as indicated even when cytology is suspicious for follicular neoplasm. Those with a hypofunctional (cold or warm) nodule and with suspicious clinical and sonographic features should proceed to surgery. For increased or normal TSH with cytology suspicious for follicular or oncocytic neoplasm, patients should undergo diagnostic lobectomy, unless molecular diagnostic testing predicts a low risk of malignancy, while in those selected for surgery with follicular or oncocytic neoplasm on FNA, total thyroidectomy is recommended for bilateral disease, unilateral disease > 4 cm (especially in individuals AMAB), invasive cancer, metastatic cancer, or if the patient prefers this approach. Notably, 5% to 10% of patients with papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma have tumors that aggressively invade structures in the neck or have produced distant metastases.

### Does a leu 512 arg thyrotropin receptor mutation cause an autonomously functioning papillary carcinoma? [^ed225753]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

In the last decade, studies were first done to determine the frequency of Gsalpha and later thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) mutations in benign autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). Different frequencies ranging from 0% to 38% for GSp mutations and from 20% to 86% for TSHR mutations were found. There were only some limited case reports related to TSHR genetic alterations in malignant AFTN. Their role in autonomously functioning thyroid carcinomas is not well established. We present a patient who had thyroidectomy for toxic multinodular goiter and a papillary carcinoma was demonstrated histopathologically. Genomic DNA was isolated from two solid areas in the hot nodule and peripheral leukocytes of the patient. After amplifying the related regions, TSHR and GSalpha genes were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The precise localization of the mutations was identified by automatic DNA sequence analysis. An activating mutation of the TSHR gene (Leu 512 Arg) was found in the autonomously functioning papillary carcinoma. It is believed that this mutation causes constitutive activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction pathway and thereby causes thyrotoxicosis and a hot thyroid nodule in an autonomously functioning papillary carcinoma.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^cc390a20]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

### Meta-and reanalysis of gene expression profiles of hot and cold thyroid nodules and papillary thyroid carcinoma for gene groups [^a7c2a6c1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

There are an increasing number of studies analyzing gene expression profiles in various benign and malignant thyroid tumors. This creates the opportunity to validate results obtained from one microarray study with those from other data sets. This process requires rigorous methods for accurate comparison.

Objective

The ability to compare data sets derived from different Affymetrix GeneChip generations and the influence of intra- and interindividual comparisons of gene expression data were evaluated to build multigene classifiers of benign thyroid nodules to verify a previously proposed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) classifier and to look for molecular pathways essential for PTC oncogenesis.

Methods

Gene expression profile data sets from autonomously functioning and cold thyroid nodules and from PTC were analyzed by support vector machines. GenMAPP analysis was used for PTC data analysis to examine the expression patterns of biologically relevant gene sets.

Results

Only intraindividual reference samples allowed the identification of subtle changes in the expression patterns of relevant signaling cascades, such as the MAPK pathway in PTC. Using an artificial intelligence approach, the autonomously functioning and cold thyroid nodule multigene classifiers were derived and evaluated by cross-comparisons.

Conclusion

We recommend defining classifiers within one generation of gene chips and subsequently checking them across different array generations. Using this approach, we have demonstrated the specificity of a previously reported PTC classifier on an independent collection of benign tumors. Moreover, we propose multigene classifiers for different types of benign thyroid nodules.

### Mechanisms of disease: hydrogen peroxide, DNA damage and mutagenesis in the development of thyroid tumors [^75d0f1f8]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Somatic mutations can be identified in two-thirds of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas and 'hot' thyroid nodules, whereas equivalent mutations relevant for benign 'cold' thyroid nodules are unknown. This Review summarizes current knowledge about early molecular conditions for nodular and tumor transformation in the thyroid gland. We reconstruct a line of events that could explain the predominant neoplastic character (i.e. originating from a single mutated cell) of thyroid nodular lesions. This process might be triggered by the oxidative nature of thyroid hormone synthesis or additional oxidative stress caused by iodine deficiency or smoking. If the antioxidant defense is not effective, this oxidative stress can cause DNA damage followed by an increase in the spontaneous mutation rate, which is a platform for tumor genesis. The hallmark of thyroid physiology — H2O2 production during hormone synthesis — is therefore very likely to be the ultimate cause of frequent mutagenesis in the thyroid gland. DNA damage and mutagenesis could provide the basis for the frequent nodular transformation of endemic goiters.

### Lack of in vitro constitutive activity for four previously reported TSH receptor mutations identified in patients with nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and hot thyroid carcinomas [^f11e24c5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Constitutively activating mutations (CAMs) of the TSHR are the major cause for nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism. Re-examination of constitutive activity previously determined in CHO cell lines recently demonstrated the caveats for the in vitro determination of constitutive TSHR activity, which leads to false positive conclusions regarding the molecular origin of hyperthyroidism or hot thyroid carcinomas.

Design

Mutations L677V and T620I identified in hot thyroid carcinomas were previously characterized in CHO and in 3T3-Vill cell lines, respectively, stably expressing the mutant without determination of TSHR expression. F666L identified in a patient with hot thyroid nodules, I691F in a family with nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and F631I identified in a hot thyroid carcinoma were not characterized for their in vitro function. Therefore, we decided to (re)evaluate the in vitro function of these five TSHR variants by determination of cell surface expression, and intracellular cAMP and inositol phosphate levels and performed additionally linear regression analyses to determine basal activity independently from the mutant's cell surface expression in COS-7 and HEK(GT) cells.

Results and Conclusions

Only one (F631I) of the five investigated TSHR variants displayed constitutive activity for G(α) s signalling and showed correlation with the clinical phenotype. The previous false classification of T620I and L677V as CAMs is most likely related to the fact that both mutations were characterized in cell lines stably expressing the mutated receptor construct without assessing the respective receptor number per cell. Other molecular aetiologies for the nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and/or hot thyroid carcinomas in these three patients and one family should be elucidated.

### Divergent immune microenvironments in two tumor nodules from a patient with mismatch repair-deficient prostate cancer [^f1390538]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When examining the expression of specific individual genes, the hot nodule displayed increased expression of many HLAgenes including HLA-B, B2M, HLA-DRA and CD74 compared to the cold nodule (Fig. 2e). When we examined epigenetic regulators that regulate HLA expression, the hot nodule contained a unique DNMT3B variant while the cold nodule had a unique DNMT3AP1 variant. Based on gene expression patterns, TAP1, TAP2, and B2M were all decreased in the cold nodule compared to the hot nodule. Similarly, the hot nodule was enriched in many immunoglobulin genes, which may be due to differences in relative abundance of B-cells and plasma cells. However, differences between the nodules are not robust when examined by CIBERSORT or IHC and therefore this does not directly explain the enrichment of immunoglobulin genes in the hot nodule (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 3). The hot nodule also had increased levels of ICI target genes such as PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA4. (Fig. 2g). While multiple immune-related genes had seemingly distinct expression patterns, there were limited differences when we examined critical regulators of AR signaling such as FOXA1, HOXB13, and KLK2/3, (Fig. 2h) or neuroendocrine PC regulatory genes such as INSM1 and ASCL1 (Fig. 2i). Altogether, these nuanced transcriptional analyses uncovered key transcriptional differences (characterized by loss of HLA gene expression and reduced immunoglobulin gene expression in the cold nodule) despite a seemingly similar broad transcriptional profile in the two nodules.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^6e70da1b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Based on the course and the clinical presentation of the present case, a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis could be established. The disappearance of the thyroid nodule following prednisone treatment further confirms the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis following presentation with a thyroid hot nodule. Here, the appearance of the hot thyroid nodule was unusual in that it did not show the usual pattern of low uptake during radioisotope scanning. This case demonstrates that subacute thyroiditis may present as a solitary painful hot nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and ESR and should, therefore, be considered in the differential diagnosis of such lesions.

The mechanism of 99 mm-Tc localization in subacute thyroiditis is not known. Tonami et al. reported two cases of subacute thyroiditis in which thyroid scintigrams with 201TI chloride showed increased radionuclide activity in the affected areas but decreased activity in the affected areas following thyroid scintigrams with 99 m-Tc. It was presumed that this is primarily due to increased membrane permeability in the inflammatory lesion without the apparent destruction of the thyroid gland, which is typically indicated by normal thyroglobulin levels and thyroid function in the patient. Therefore, the present case suggests the clinical and pathological heterogeneity of subacute thyroiditis.

In conclusion, this case demonstrates that subacute thyroiditis should be considered as a differential diagnosis following presentation with a solitary painful thyroid hot nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and ESR. Additionally, this case emphasizes the heterogeneous pattern of thyroid imaging in subacute thyroiditis.

### Thyroid suppression test with a single oral dose of levothyroxine in the diagnosis of functional thyroid autonomy [^1ef3d144]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To propose a modified form of thyroid suppression test with use of a single oral dose of levothyroxine (35 mg/kg).

Methods

After a baseline scintigram, 23 patients with nodular goiter suspected of autonomous function (warm or hot nodules, subnormal or undetectable thyrotropin levels, or both findings) and 14 normal subjects underwent a repeated scintigram 4 days after administration of levothyroxine. We evaluated triiodothyronine (T(3)), free thyroxine, and thyrotropin before and on the first, second, third, fourth, and seventh days after administration of the individualized dose of levothyroxine.

Results

The 99th percentile of postsuppression uptake in normal subjects was determined, and an uptake > 12.4%, a 131 I concentration restricted to the nodule, or both factors were adopted as the criteria for diagnosis of an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. Twelve patients were considered to have autonomously functioning nodules, and 11 patients were considered to have nonautonomous nodules. Baseline thyrotropin levels in patients with autonomous nodules did not differ significantly from those in patients with nonautonomous nodules. No signs or symptoms of toxicity were detected during the test, but all study subjects had increased free thyroxine values, and seven had high levels of T(3).

Conclusion

The thyroid suppression test with 35 mg/kg of levothyroxine is an effective method for the diagnosis of an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, is nontoxic, and avoids the inaccurate use of the medication occasionally observed with T(3). Even sensitive methods of thyrotropin determination cannot replace this test in the evaluation of autonomous thyroid function.

### Radiation-related thyroid cancer [^298528e9]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Radiation doses from nuclear medicine procedures targeting the thyroid are noticeably higher than from other examinations. Evaluation of thyroid functional state/physiology examines the sodium iodine symporter–mediated thyroid uptake/metabolism of a radioisotope with or without imaging. Major indications for thyroid uptake examination are evaluation of hyperthyroidism and its causes, and calculation of the 131 I amount for subsequent RAI therapy. Gamma-emitting isotopes are used for this purpose. At present, 123 I is the preferable application because of the possibility of concurrent thyroid imaging and lower radiation exposure of a patient. The effective dose from 200 μCi of 123 I (a typical minimum activity administered to an adult patient) would be expected to be as low as 1.5 mSv. 131 I and 99m Tc-pertechnetate may also be used depending on medical center policies/practices and isotope availability, delivering doses similar or just slightly higher than those from 123 I. During the last several decades, the weighted average absorbed dose from a thyroid uptake procedure (when usage of all 3 isotopes were considered) was estimated to be about 60 mGy. This would result in an effective dose of about 2.4 mSv (given the thyroid tissue weighting factor of 0.04) which is comparable with the above-mentioned effective dose from 123 I-only procedures. Note also that 99m Tc-pertechnetate may not fully reflect thyroid function because it is captured by the gland but is not organified in contrast to sodium iodide.

Thyroid scan or thyroid scintigraphy involves imaging and is used to evaluate thyroid structure and function in various thyroid diseases, to visualize hot or cold thyroid nodules of malignant or benign nature, ectopic thyroid tissue, metastasis or recurrence, and to facilitate a decision on RAI therapy and its radioisotope dosage. 123 I, 99m Tc-pertechnetate, and 131 I are most commonly used, and imaging is performed with a planar gamma-camera or SPECT/CT. Recently, a meta-analysis found 124 I PET/CT to be effective for identifying differentiated thyroid cancer lesions, in some instances overperforming the post-RAI therapy 131 I scan. The activity of radioisotopes for a thyroid scan is usually several fold higher than for uptake examination, which may result in thyroid doses exceeding 100 mGy, which are the highest among all diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures.

### Divergent immune microenvironments in two tumor nodules from a patient with mismatch repair-deficient prostate cancer [^d300cf81]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To this end, we first examined COSMIC mutational signatures in the two tumors including insertion and deletions (InDel), single-base substitutions, and double-base substitutions between the hot and cold nodules (Fig. 1e). In this regard, the two nodules showed a high degree of similarity between their mutational processes at the nucleotide level, providing strong evidence that they were clonally related. We then examined the relative contribution of each signature type in the two nodules (Fig. 1f); again, both nodules showed predominantly MMRd-related mutational patterns. Interestingly, the hot nodule displayed a small relative contribution of defective homologous recombination repair (HRR) that was not observed in the cold nodule, even though comparable variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of BRCA1/2 alterations were observed and none of them were pathogenic. We next sought to examine the landscape of VAFs in both nodules; here, we found unique patterns in the hot nodule. Specifically, the hot nodule exclusively showed unique pathogenic mutations in TP53 and PTEN (Fig. 1g), although both of these mutations were of low variant allele frequency. Further, the hot nodule was composed of a single tumor clone while the cold nodule was composed of two clones (Fig. 1h). We next modeled the order in which mutations accumulated through a pseudo-time analysis using the VAFs of all detectable gene alterations. Based on this approach, the cold nodule initially accumulated mutations quicker and at an earlier time point compared to the hot nodule (Fig. 1l). At a later pseudo-time, the cold nodule exhibited a similar overall rate of variant accumulation as the hot but never acquired the unique pathogenic TP53 and PTEN mutations. While the overarching mutational processes appeared very similar, these nuanced genomics analyses indicated that these tumors exhibited distinct rates of VAF accumulation and harbored certain unique mutations.

### Cost-effectiveness comparison between palpation-and ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies [^1bd9d979]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There are two thyroid nodule management guidelines with global recognition: first is the management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer by American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines Taskforce and the second one is the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules. After identification of a thyroid nodule that is more than 10–15 mm, ATA recommends measuring serum TSH level. If TSH is low, a thyroid scan is next. For a hot thyroid nodule, evaluation and treatment for hyperthyroidism is recommended. If the nodule is not hot, the algorithm points to diagnostic ultrasonography. The flowchart directs again to diagnostic ultrasonography for euthyroid and hypothyroid patients with thyroid nodules. If a nodule is ultrasonographically confirmed, a cytological evaluation is next. ATA recommends ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (USG-FNA) for nodules with more than 50% cystic component and for nodules located in posterior parts of the thyroid gland. Otherwise either palpation-guided (P-FNA) or USG-FNA is next. In contrast, as indicated in the abstract of their guideline, AACE recommends universal application of USG-FNA for all thyroid nodules ≥ 10 mm, except for subjects with a low serum TSH level and a hot nodule, in whom FNA is not indicated. Except for minor changes in the sequence of diagnostic steps, ATA and AACE thyroid nodule management guidelines differ only in the utilization of ultrasound guidance. All previous studies show that USG-FNA has higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy than P-FNA. A barrier for universal recommendation of USG-FNA might be its higher initial cost. The aim of this report is to compare cost-effectiveness between palpation- and ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies from a perspective of ATA versus AACE thyroid nodule management guidelines.

Thyroid nodules are common and often asymptomatic. However, patients may seek treatment for nonfunctional benign nodules that cause compressive symptoms or cosmetic problems. Additionally, many patients with autonomously functioning nodules also seek treatment. As minimally invasive thermal ablation techniques become more wide spread, providers offering these treatments should be familiar with the pathophysiology of thyroid nodules, and with how to work up a patient with nodular thyroid disease.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^cec1fb1b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Subacute thyroiditis is the most common cause of non-autoimmune thyroiditis. In addition to the typical clinical signs, characteristic ultrasound findings of subacute thyroiditis include the presence of an ill-defined hypoechoic area with a nonhomogeneous pattern. Recently, Ruchala et al. demonstrated the usefulness of sonoelastography for the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. The cytological features found during thyroid fine-needle aspiration include the presence of large multinucleated giant cells or epithelioid granulomas, but the absence of these findings does not exclude the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Generally speaking, elevated serum thyroid hormones, a tender enlarged thyroid, and low radioiodine thyroid uptake are characteristic of subacute thyroiditis. Although cases with these typical signs may present little difficulty for a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis, this disorder does not always present in a classic fashion and may lead to difficulties during diagnosis. Sometimes the diagnosis may be less clear, particularly when the primary presenting symptom is a solitary thyroid nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and a normal ESR.

### Radiofrequency ablation for autonomously functioning thyroid nodules: a multicenter study [^32c748d1]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study is to validate the generalizability of the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for treating autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN) in a large population multicenter study.

Methods

This study included 44 patients from 5 institutions who refused or were not suitable for surgery or radioiodine therapy. Twenty-three patients were affected by a toxic nodule and 21 by a pretoxic nodule. RF ablation was performed using an 18-gauge, internally cooled electrode. Nodule volume, thyroid function, scintigraphy, symptom/cosmetic scores, and complications were evaluated before treatment and during each follow-up.

Results

The mean follow-up period was 19.9 ± 12.6 months. The mean nodule volume was initially 18.5 ± 30.1mL and significantly decreased after treatment at 1 month (11.8 ± 26.9mL, p < 0.001) and the last month (4.5 ± 9.8mL, p < 0.001). Significant improvement of triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyrotropin was observed at the last follow-up. Regarding scintigraphy, 35 hot nodules became cold or were normal when scanned and 9 decreased uptake, although they remained hot nodules. The mean symptom and cosmetic scores were significantly reduced at the last follow-up. No major complications were encountered.

Conclusions

This multicenter study validated the efficacy and safety of RF ablation for treating AFTN; RF ablation can be considered an alternative to surgery or radioiodine therapy.

Radioiodine therapy for hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules and toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) — indications, effects, and risks: Radioiodine is indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism caused by a hyperfunctioning nodule or a toxic MNG, and aims include ablation of autonomously functioning areas, restoration of euthyroidism, and reduction of goiter size. Radioiodine therapy normalizes thyroid function in 85 to 100% of patients with hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules or toxic MNGs, and after treatment the thyroid volume generally decreases substantially with a median decrease of 35% at 3 months and 45% at 24 months. However, postradioiodine hypothyroidism may develop in up to 60% of patients after 20 years, and immunogenic hyperthyroidism may occur in up to 5% of patients, typically occurring 3 to 6 months after radioiodine treatment.

### Somatic mutations in thyroid nodular disease [^ad3562ca]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be found in up to 50% of inhabitants of iodine-deficient areas and are classified as hot or cold thyroid nodules according to their scintigraphic characteristics. Studies of hot thyroid nodules with comparable mutation detection methods and screening at least exon 10 of the TSH receptor reported frequencies for somatic TSH-receptor mutations ranging from 20 to 82% in patients with similar iodine supply. We have recently screened 75 hot thyroid nodules for somatic TSH-receptor mutations with the more sensitive DGGE method and found somatic TSH-receptor mutations in 57% and Gsalpha mutations in 3%. As 50% of the mutation-negative nodules from female patients are of monoclonal origin when tested for X-chromosome inactivation somatic mutations in other genes are likely to cause the development of hot thyroid nodules. Scintigraphically nonsuppressible areas have been identified in up to 40% of euthyroid goiters in iodine-deficient areas. We recently identified somatic TSH-receptor mutations in microscopic autonomous areas with increased 125T uptake in euthyroid goiters studied by autoradiography 20 years ago. These constitutively activating somatic TSH-receptor mutations in minute autoradiographically hot areas of euthyroid goiters are very likely starting foci which most likely lead to toxic thyroid nodules in iodine-deficient goiters. Therefore iodine deficiency does not only lead to euthyroid goiters but also to thyroid autonomy. The latter is also suggested by epidemiologic studies. Similar mechanisms induced by iodine deficiency and the subsequent hyperplasia, mutagenesis, and selection of cell clones could also lead to cold thyroid nodules by somatic mutations that only initiate growth but not hyperfunction of the affected thyroid epithelial cell. Somatic ras mutations have frequently been detected in histologically characterized thyroid adenomas or adenomatous nodules. However, they seem to be rare in cold thyroid nodules. Since the majority of these latter nodules and 60% of the cold thyroid nodules are monoclonal other somatic mutations are likely in these nodules.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^f041c2e9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Previously, thyroid nodules have been identified in association with subacute thyroiditis and, in some patients with subacute thyroiditis, only one nodule is present. For example, Liel reported a case that presented with the coexistence of subacute thyroiditis and an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. More often, localized forms of subacute thyroiditis present as painful and tender "cold" thyroid nodules, which disappear following recovery. However, subacute thyroiditis that presents as a painful "hot" nodule is exceedingly rare and has not been reported. In this case, laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, thyroid function, thyroglobin levels, and ESR, were normal and non-diagnostic but the clinical findings (neck pain, thyroid tenderness, and fatigue) led to the consideration of a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, further work-ups were completed including an ultrasound examination of the neck, thyroid scintigraphy with 99 m-Tc, and fine needle aspiration cytology of the nodule. Ultrasound examination demonstrated a dyshomogeneous and hypoechoic mass in the thyroid, which was characteristic of subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid scintigraphy showed a focal accumulation of radiotracer uptake in the thyroid nodule. The histological features of the nodule were also typical of subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, a diagnosis of localized subacute thyroiditis was given and the patient was prescribed prednisone, which resulted in the disappearance of the hot thyroid nodule. The treatment of subacute thyroiditis is essentially symptomatic and includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or, occasionally, glucocorticoids if the symptoms are prolonged or severe. In the current case, treatment with steroids resulted in an amelioration of the patient's symptoms and the disappearance of the thyroid nodule after 2 months.

Thyroid scintigraphy indications and evaluation of hypofunctioning ("cold") nodules — regional guidance and diagnostic implications: A thyroid scan is recommended only when the TSH level is low or low-normal in the USA, whereas in Germany it is recommended in all patients with a nodule > 10 mm regardless of TSH. Although most thyroid cancers are hypofunctioning and appear as cold nodules, the majority of cold nodules are benign (up to 80–90%); therefore, it is recommended that a hypofunctioning nodule be further evaluated with dedicated thyroid ultrasound (US) and managed based on TI-RADS sonographic features. Guideline indications in Table 1 include ATA 2015 (Nodules > 10–15 mm; TSH subnormal), German Endocrine Surgeons 2011 (Thyroid nodules > 10 mm), and AACE/AME/ETA 2010 and 2016 (TSH lower reference limit; iodine deficiency: TSH < 1.0–1.5 mU/L).

Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTNs) — for hyperthyroidism evaluation and treatment, a baseline nodule volume < 10–12 mL has been suggested to optimize the likelihood of achieving euthyroidism; TA is only indicated in subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism caused by an AFTN and there is no evidence that ablation will cure hyperthyroidism from any other cause; radioiodine uptake studies and thyroid autoantibodies can be useful in determining etiology and whether a single nodule is the hormone source; and patients with AFTNs causing subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism can be successfully treated with ablative techniques.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^3654f39b]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) prestimulation with radioiodine for nontoxic goiter — the use of rhTSH is currently off-label; radioiodine uptake is doubled with rhTSH doses as small as 0.03 to 0.1 mg, and an interval of at least 24 hours between rhTSH stimulation and radioiodine administration seems optimal. In combination with radioiodine, rhTSH decreases goiter volume 50 to 56% more than nonstimulated therapy and can improve respiratory function, though patient satisfaction effects are unclear. The main adverse effect is transient, dose-dependent hyperthyroidism starting 4 to 8 hours after injection, peaking after 24 to 48 hours, and normalizing within 3 weeks; with rhTSH doses of ≥ 0.1 mg, thyroid hormone levels are maintained within the reference range in most patients. Acute dose-related thyroid swelling has been shown, with an increase in mean thyroid volume of 35% with 0.9 mg rhTSH, 24% with 0.3 mg rhTSH, and 10% with 0.1 mg rhTSH; therefore, the optimal rhTSH dose seems to be ≤ 0.1 mg.

Imaging

In most cases, the biochemical and immunological findings will be sufficient to diagnose GD. Imaging should, however, be considered in cases where thyroid antibodies are negative or where there is a nodule or nodularity apparent on thyroid gland palpation. Ultrasonography is preferred over scintigraphy to avoid radiation exposure. Thyroid ultrasonography with Doppler blood flow assessment often displays an enlarged, hyperechoic, hypervascular thyroid gland, while scintigraphy shows uniform uptake of isotope and diffuse enlargement of both thyroid lobes. Imaging will also help identify the non-autoimmune causes of hyperthyroidism, such as an autonomous 'hot' nodule.

- Ultrasonography of the thyroid and neck. Common ultrasonographic features of malignancy include hypoechogenicity, invasive margins, increased intranodular blood flow, microcalcifications, and abnormal cervical lymph nodes. Based on ultrasonographic characteristics, scoring systems have been developed to facilitate selection of nodules that require fine-needle aspiration in adults. RETrearrangements are the most common. Thyroid nodule and autoimmune thyroiditis. In a study of 485 nodules in 385 children who underwent fine-needle aspiration, thyroid cancer was present in 108 nodules. Autoimmune thyroiditis, present in 95 patients, was independently associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Histology and Molecular Features of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Tumors of the thyroid are classified as adenomas or carcinomas.

Adenomas are benign, well circumscribed, and encapsulated nodules that may cause notable enlargement of all or part of the gland, which extends to both sides of the neck. Some tumors may secrete hormones. Transformation to a malignant carcinoma may occur in some cells, which may grow and spread to lymph nodes in the neck or to the lungs. Approximately 20% of thyroid nodules in children are malignant. Histological variants of follicular thyroid cancer include Hürthle cell, clear cell, and insular carcinoma. RETfusion–positive carcinomas were associated with aggressive tumor behavior, including high rates of lymph node metastases and distant metastases. These rates were significantly higher than in carcinomas with NTRKfusions, BRAFV600E variants, and RASvariants.

A study correlated the status of hotspot DICER1variants with clinical, histological, and outcome features in a series of 56 pediatric patients with papillary thyroid carcinomas. These patients had no clinical or family history of DICER1-related syndromic manifestations. Fifteen papillary thyroid carcinomas harbored BRAFp. V600E.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^46e679c9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is readily considered when patients present with a particular set of typical clinical characteristics. Subacute thyroiditis sometimes presents as a solitary cold nodule; however, the presence of a hot nodule in patients with subacute thyroiditis is exceedingly rare.

Case presentation

Here, the case of a 57-year-old woman complaining of pain in the left neck and fatigue for two weeks is presented. Physical examination revealed a painful and tender nodule with a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm in the left neck, although all laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid function, and thyroglobin levels, were normal. A neck ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass (1.5 × 0.8 cm) in the left thyroid, and thyroid scintigraphy of the left thyroid with Technetium-99 m (99 m-Tc) demonstrated a focal accumulation of radiotracer. Furthermore, fine-needle aspiration biopsy from the nodule revealed the presence of multinuclear giant cells. The patient was well; there was no cervical mass detected upon palpation following two months of prednisone treatment, and follow-up ultrasound screening and scintigraphy demonstrated the disappearance of the nodule.

Conclusion

This case, presenting with a localized painful hot nodule, normal thyroid function, normal ESR, and normal serum thyroglobulin levels, is a rare case of subacute thyroiditis, which should be considered during differential diagnosis.

### Deiodinases in thyroid tumorigenesis [^c2a9b765]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

What is the role of deiodinases in normal thyroid cells? D1 is constitutively expressed in normal thyroid follicular cells and contributes to thyroidal T3 production, as well as iodide recycling by deiodination of rT3 and sulfated iodothyronines. The D2 activity is closely related to TSH stimulation and is likely to provide a supplemental amount of T3 to the total thyroidal secretion in cooperation with D1. Whether deiodinases-produced T3 contributes to the T3-bound thyroid receptor fraction in thyroid cells is presently unknown. The overall contribution to the T3 secretion by D1 and D2 is reflected by the decrease in the T4/ T3 molar ratio from 15:1 in thyroglobulin-bound hormones to 11:1 in the thyroid output, which is observed in Graves' disease and hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules.

Thyroid nodules — thyrotropin and cytology considerations — Suppressed or low levels of thyrotropin (TSH) are associated with a decreased probability of malignancy, whereas increased levels of serum TSH, even when the levels are still within reference limits, are statistically associated with an increased risk of cancer in thyroid nodular disease; the clinical role of these epidemiologic findings is still controversial and is of little use in individual patient treatment. Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules in adults usually need no cytologic evaluation unless suspicious clinical findings are present.

### Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma presenting as a "hot" nodule [^9627dff8]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an unusual clinical scenario and a rare histopathologic finding of Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma in a patient with an autonomous thyroid nodule.

Methods

We describe the presentation and clinical course leading to the surprising histopathologic diagnosis of Hürthle cell carcinoma in a pediatric patient who was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism presenting as a solitary toxic nodule.

Results

A 13-year-old white girl presented with a recent history of a palpable thyroid nodule during a routine primary care clinic visit. She was asymptomatic, and thyroid function tests revealed a suppressed thyrotropin concentration, high-normal free thyroxine concentration, and elevated triiodothyronine concentration. The patient underwent dedicated thyroid ultrasonography revealing a 3.5-cm complex mass in the left lobe with increased central vascularity. Iodine 123 imaging of the thyroid demonstrated homogenous, hyperintense activity in the left lobe. The right lobe was not visualized. A solitary toxic nodule was diagnosed, and, considering her age, she was referred for surgical management. The patient underwent a left lobectomy with isthmusectomy. Pathologic examination revealed a 5-cm, encapsulated, well-differentiated Hürthle cell carcinoma with negative margins and no lymphovascular invasion. The patient underwent subsequent completion thyroidectomy with no evidence of residual carcinoma in the right thyroid lobe.

Conclusions

Malignancy in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules is rare. Most of the thyroid nodules presenting as "hot" on radioiodine scintigraphy are benign follicular adenomas. However, this case represents a rare clinical entity, and it highlights the need for clinicians to be vigilant and aware that occasionally carcinomas can masquerade as scintigraphic "hot" nodules.

Some patients with autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN) are not suitable for surgery or radioiodine therapy. Therefore, minimally invasive alternative treatments, such as ethanol ablation or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), are necessary.

Methods

This study included nine patients (4 toxic and 5 pretoxic patients; male to female ratio = 1:8; mean age, 47 ± 17 (range, 25–71) years) who were not eligible for surgery or radioiodine therapy. All of the patients showed hot nodule with suppression of normal thyroid gland in (99m)Tc pertechnetate scintigraphy. RFA was performed using a 17- and 18-gauge internally cooled electrode. Nodule volume, thyroid function, scintigraphy, symptom score (visual analogue scale, 0–10 cm), cosmetic grading score (4-point scale), and complications were evaluated before treatment and at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up.

Results

Mean volume of the index nodule was 14.98 ± 25.53 (range, 0.29–82.29) mL. After RFA it decreased at 1 month (12.01 ± 25.97 mL, p = 0.015), 3 months (7.27 ± 15.13 mL, p = 0.011), 6 months (8.27 ± 21.29 mL, p = 0.008), and the last month (7.57 ± 19.99 mL, p = 0.008). Initial mean T3, fT4, and TSH were 156.2 ± 42.1 ng/dL, 1.73 ± 0.40 ng/dL, and 0.052 ± 0.087 mU/mL, respectively. A significant improvement of mean T3, fT4, and TSH were observed at last follow-up (T3: 116.8 ± 20.7 ng/dL, p = 0.015; fT4: 1.37 ± 0.26 ng/dL, p = 0.036; TSH: 1.454 ± 1.756 mU/mL, p = 0.012). After ablation, four patients became a cold or normal scan and five remained as a hot nodule. The mean symptom and cosmetic grading score was reduced from 2.4 ± 1.7 to 0.6 ± 0.7 (p = 0.011) and from 3.1 ± 1.2 to 1.4 ± 1.0 (p = 0.017), respectively. No major complications were encountered.

Conclusions

RFA seems to be effective and safe for the treatment of AFTN.

### The trapping-only nodules of the thyroid gland: prevalence study [^a1cb59a7]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of trapping-only nodules of the thyroid gland. The study was prospectively performed in patients bearing hot or warm thyroid nodules at pertechnetate scan in the presence of circulating thyrotropin (TSH) within the normal range. The study was restricted to these patients because nodules that suppress TSH are certainly autonomous. In 140 patients showing hot or warm nodules at 30-minute pertechnetate scintigraphy, and normal TSH levels, radioiodine scintigraphy was performed at 24 hours. The trapping-only pattern, i.e., the presence of a cold nodule in late radioiodine scintigraphy was observed in seven patients (5%). Five had benign thyroid nodules, one follicular carcinoma, and one extrathyroid metastases of papillary-follicular carcinoma. Despite controversy on this issue, trapping-only nodules of thyroid should be searched because they have risk of malignancy and must be differentiated from autonomous adenomas at the compensated stage. The search may be limited to patients with normal serum TSH.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression after lobectomy — risks and evidence: Adverse effects of TSH suppression include consequences of subclinical thyrotoxicosis, so optimal TSH targets must balance potential benefit with harm, and there is little evidence to guide TSH targets or thyroid hormone use after lobectomy. In a retrospective analysis of low-risk patients who had undergone lobectomy without thyroid hormone therapy, after a mean follow-up of 8.3 years only 13% of 674 patients became overtly hypothyroid.

### Peroxiredoxin 5 expression in the human thyroid gland [^cacab294]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) is a newly discovered thioredoxin peroxidase able to reduce peroxides that is implicated in antioxidant protective mechanisms. We report here its expression in the human thyroid gland. Twenty-seven human thyroid specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry. They included six normal thyroid tissues, five multinodular goiters, nine hot nodules, two Hürthle cell adenomas, and five thyroids from patients with Graves' disease. In the control tissue, PRDX5 expression was heterogeneous, being stronger in cubical functionally active follicular cells than in flat quiescent thyrocytes. It was diffuse in the cytoplasm, occasionally localized in inclusions that most likely corresponded to mitochondria. This feature was particularly marked in the Hürthle cell adenoma case. In multinodular goiters, hot nodules, and Graves' thyroids, the cytosolic labeling was enhanced compared to the control tissue and a signal was also detected in few nuclei. To determine whether the level of expression was different between multinodular goiters and hyperthyroid Graves' thyroids, PRDX5 immunoblotting was performed in these two respective tissues. We observed that PRDX5 expression was higher in the thyroid gland of patients with Graves' disease compared to multinodular goiters. In conclusion, our data show that PRDX5 is expressed in the thyroid gland where it could act as antioxidant. The level of expression is directly correlated with the functional status of epithelial cells, being higher in multinodular goiters, and even more pronounced in hyperthyroid tissues, such as Graves' disease.

Benign thyroid nodules — medical therapy and iodine intake: Routine TSH suppression therapy for benign thyroid nodules in iodine sufficient populations is not recommended, with the guideline noting that the potential harm outweighs benefit for most patients (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Individual patients with benign, solid, or mostly solid nodules should have adequate iodine intake, and a daily supplement (containing 150 μg iodine) is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence), while one randomized trial found that sufficient dietary iodine intake (150 μg daily) also reduced nodule size slightly more than placebo. When used, suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) has modest efficacy, with an average 5%–15% reduction in nodule volume when treated for 6–18 months, and two high-quality meta-analyses indicate that six to eight patients will require suppressive LT4 to achieve one successful treatment response. The TSH suppression in high-quality studies often reached substantial levels — the majority suppressed TSH to < 0.2 mIU/L, with many to < 0.1 mIU/L — which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and osteoporosis.

CLINICAL UTILITY

Most patients with thyroid disease present with a thyroid nodule. Tools utilized to assess thyroid nodules and to rule out thyroid cancer include: serum thyroid function tests (TSH and thyroid hormone level), thyroid ultrasound (US), radionuclide scintigraphy (low activity I-131, I-123 and/or Tc99m), and fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology (cells) examination. High thyroid hormone levels (T4 or T3) and a low TSH level may indicate a nodule is a benign hyperfunctioning nodule (adenoma), thereby tending to rule out thyroid cancer. In such cases, thyroid imaging (US or scintigraphy) determines whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning whereas thyroid cancers appear under-functioning or "cold" on the scan. Graves' disease and Hashimotos' thyroiditis represent thyroid diseases which occur in children who have autoimmune thyroid disease. In these patients, abnormal thyroid function tests reflect underlying thyroid disease but do not exclude thyroid cancer.

The administration of radioiodine has proved to be an excellent method of destruction of over functioning thyroid tissue (either diffuse or toxic nodular goiter). Radioiodine is concentrated in the thyroid, destroying cells that concentrate it.

Surgical removal is the treatment of choice for thyroid carcinomas. At 2 to 4 months post surgery, a whole-body I-131 scan is performed following cessation of thyroxin drug for 4–6 weeks prior to the scan, thereby causing hypothyroidism; TSH then rises and stimulates iodide uptake. Iodine-containing foods and contrast media are avoided. Patients with significant I-131 uptake are given ablative (100–150 mCi) doses of I-131. For minimal uptake, doses of 30–50 mCi I-131 are given on an outpatient basis. Patients with extra thyroidal uptake from metastatic disease may be given larger doses of greater than 100 mCi.

### Radiofrequency ablation for autonomously functioning nodules as treatment for hyperthyroidism: subgroup analysis of toxic adenoma and multinodular goitre and predictors for treatment success [^7b32fa4e]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Solitary toxic adenoma (STA) and toxic multinodular goitre (TMG) can cause hyperthyroidism through the presence of autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). These AFTN produce thyroid hormone independent of regulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Excessive thyroid hormone production of AFTN induces TSH suppression, and may lead to overt hyperthyroidism over time. Hyperthyroidism caused by a STA accounts for approximately 5% of all causes of hyperthyroidism. TMG, harbouring multiple autonomous nodules, accounts for approximately 30% of hyperthyroid patients. On thyroid scintigraphy, these autonomous nodules appear as regions with higher tracer uptake than surrounding thyroid tissue or so called "hot areas". In the case of concurrent hyperthyroidism, these nodules are commonly referred to as "toxic".

Treatment of hyperthyroidism is indicated to reduce symptoms and risk of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis in both overt and subclinical hyperthyroid patients. At present, AFTNs are preferentially treated with radioactive iodine (131 I) or alternatively with surgery. However, this treatment may lead to undesirable iatrogenic hypothyroidism. This leads to lifelong thyroid hormone substitution requiring regular laboratory monitoring. Hypothyroidism is associated with a lower quality of life, even when biochemical euthyroidism is achieved using thyroxine treatment.

Thyroid nodule management — radioiodine therapy: Consider radioiodine therapy for hyperfunctioning and/or symptomatic goiters, especially for patients with previous thyroid surgery or at surgical risk and in those who decline surgery. Perform FNA (fine-needle aspiration) before radioiodine therapy on coexistent cold nodules per the recommendations for nontoxic MNG (multinodular goiter). Avoid the use of iodine contrast agents or iodinated drugs before radioiodine administration.

### Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of benign or… [^1b296c59]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Benign or Low Risk Thyroid Nodule This clinical trial studies the effect of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients with benign or low risk thyroid nodule. Radiofrequency ablation uses a needle to deliver a high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells by heating them. The goal of this research study is to learn if ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation can provide the same treatment result as standard surgical removal of the thyroid nodule, small primary thyroid, or thyroid cancers that have come back. Researchers also want to learn if the procedure can be less invasive and perhaps provide a better recovery response than surgery. Benign nodule is ≥ 2 cm in the largest dimension, and has either solid, or predominantly solid composition without large calcification.

Nodule is confirmed as benign on at least 2 ultrasound guided fine needle aspirations or core needle biopsy or a single benign diagnosis of FNA or CNB when the nodule has benign ultrasound features within 6 months of planned RFA.
- Indeterminate thyroid nodule, papillary thyroid carcinoma without metastasis or locally recurrent thyroid cancer < 2 cm in the largest dimension. Nodule cytology is confirmed on a single FNA or CNB when the nodule has concordant ultrasound features within 6 months of planned RFA.
- Extra-thyroidal invasion of PTC OR local nodal/distant systemic metastatic disease
- Cystic nodules
- Calcified nodules

The following constitutes key background information on thyroid nodules:

- **Definition**: Thyroid nodules are solid growths in the thyroid gland that are radiologically distinct from surrounding thyroid parenchyma.
- **Pathophysiology**: Thyroid nodules may be benign (follicular adenoma, Hurthle cell adenoma, colloid cyst, simple or hemorrhagic cyst, lymphocytic thyroiditis, granulomatous thyroiditis, infectious processes) or malignant (malignancy of follicular or C-cell origin, papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, Hurthle cell carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, or malignancy metastatic to the thyroid).
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is > 65%. The estimated incidence of thyroid nodules in the US is around 0.1% per year.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for thyroid nodules include advanced age, female sex, tobacco use, higher BMI, metabolic syndrome, iodine deficiency, history of radiation exposure, elevated levels of TSH, increased thyroid volume, and autoimmune thyroid diseases.
- **Disease course**: Large thyroid nodules can result in dysphagia, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Thyroid nodules may also become malignant over time.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules is around 4–6.5%.

### Evidence and thoughts about thyroid nodules that grow after they have been identified as benign by aspiration cytology [^e1bcd950]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Coherent management of thyroid nodules that grow after being identified as benign will vary depending on their biology. Some are thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulated, so a dose of levothyroxine that reduces TSH to the lower limits of normal (subsuppression) may prevent or reverse enlargement; others are controlled by poorly understood mechanisms that must be elucidated before effective medical treatment can be designed; a few are autonomous requiring obliteration, and a very few are "missed" malignancies that should be excised.

Apart from the common causes of thyrotoxicosis, such as Graves' disease and functioning nodular goiters, there are more than 20 less common causes of elevated free thyroid hormones that produce the symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis. This review describes these rarer conditions and includes 14 illustrative patients. Thyrotropin and free thyroxine should be measured and, when the latter is normal, the free triiodothyronine level should be obtained. Measurement of the uptake of (123)I is recommended for most patients.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^0f97c37a]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3 and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality.

Observations

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (ie, in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear. Thyrotoxicosis from thyroiditis may be observed if symptomatic or treated with supportive care. Treatment options for overt hyperthyroidism from autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients at highest risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, such as those older than 65 years or with persistent serum thyrotropin level less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults worldwide and is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease, and increased mortality. First-line treatments are antithyroid drugs, thyroid surgery, and radioactive iodine treatment. Treatment choices should be individualized and patient centered.

Recommendations: radionuclide scanning — Indications for thyroid scintigraphy include the following: in a thyroid nodule or multinodular goiter (MNG), when the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is below the lower limit of the reference range or when ectopic thyroid tissue or a retrosternal goiter is suspected [BEL 2, GRADE A]; in iodine-deficient regions, to exclude autonomy of a thyroid nodule or MNG even when the TSH level is low-normal [BEL 2, GRADE B]; and independent of the TSH level and whether in iodine-deficient or -sufficient regions, to evaluate eligibility for radioiodine therapy [BEL 2, GRADE B]. For performance, use of 123I or 99mTcO4− can be considered for thyroid scintigraphy [BEL 3, GRADE C], and sodium iodide 131I thyroid uptake is not recommended for routine diagnostic use unless low-uptake thyrotoxicosis is suspected [BEL 3, GRADE C].

Pulmonary nodules > 8 mm — functional imaging and PET: In an individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule > 8 mm in diameter and moderate (5–60%) probability of malignancy, consider functional imaging, preferably with PET, to characterize the nodule before surgical resection or continued radiological surveillance, and consider caveats to PET screening. In an individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule > 8 mm in diameter with high (> 60%) probability of malignancy, functional imaging has a greater role in preoperative staging than in characterizing the nodule, and PET scans are useful for disease staging to rule out previously undetected metastases before surgical intervention.
