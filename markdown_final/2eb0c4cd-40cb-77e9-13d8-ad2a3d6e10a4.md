## Question

Teething symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about teething symptoms in infants, specifically which symptoms are truly associated with tooth eruption, which are not, and how to manage them safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence to anchor the symptom profile. Then, I should verify the strength of association for local versus systemic symptoms. Next, I will review management options, including what to avoid and what to recommend. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, clinically actionable takeaway with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions based on anecdote. The most reliable data come from prospective cohorts and a meta-analysis, with the FDA and AAP providing authoritative safety guidance on treatments, so I should prioritize those sources and weigh them accordingly [^f7d0c74e] [^ad038e7a].

> I will now examine the core symptom profile. Prospective studies consistently show that local oral symptoms are the most reliably associated with eruption: irritability, increased drooling, a desire to bite or chew, gum-rubbing, and mild temperature elevations, with a meta-analysis reporting gingival irritation, irritability, and drooling as the most frequent findings, and a large prospective cohort showing these symptoms cluster around an 8-day window spanning 4 days before to 3 days after eruption [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa].

> Wait, let me verify the temperature claim because many parents report "teething fever". The best prospective data indicate that while mean temperatures may rise slightly, true fever above 38.9°C is not associated with teething, and any temperature elevation is typically mild and transient, so persistent or high fevers should not be attributed to teething without evaluation for other causes [^38dde1aa] [^f6a4135b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systemic symptoms. I initially thought diarrhea might be linked, but I should double-check that. One cohort found a weak association between parent-reported loose stools and eruption that disappeared with sensitivity analyses, and other prospective studies did not find significant associations with diarrhea, cough, congestion, or vomiting, so attributing these to teething risks delaying care for real illness [^8cd3b1a5] [^38dde1aa] [^f6a4135b].

> Next, I should review sleep disruption claims because caregivers frequently report it. A large auto-videosomnography study found no objective differences in total sleep time, awakenings, or parental crib visits on teething versus non-teething nights, despite frequent subjective reports, so sleep complaints during this period likely reflect caregiver perception or concurrent issues rather than eruption itself [^ece9b15d].

> I need to ensure safe management guidance is explicit. The FDA warns against benzocaine and lidocaine gels for teething due to methemoglobinemia risk, and the AAP recommends nonpharmacologic measures first: gentle gum massage, a firm rubber teething ring (not frozen), and if needed, weight-based acetaminophen or ibuprofen with careful attention to dosing limits and contraindications; topical anesthetics should be avoided in infants and young children [^ad038e7a] [^2f0d56c3] [^504fa3d5] [^df506254].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. For children with developmental disabilities, the same conservative principles apply, with extra caution to avoid benzocaine and to monitor for pain behaviors that may be atypical; eruption cysts can occur and usually resolve spontaneously, but persistent or large lesions may need dental evaluation and intervention [^f9c779c7] [^f9809a71].

> But wait, what if the infant has natal or neonatal teeth? I should confirm management. Most are prematurely erupted primary teeth and may be mobile with underdeveloped roots, posing aspiration risk; if they interfere with feeding or are markedly mobile, extraction is reasonable, whereas stable, asymptomatic teeth can be observed with close follow-up and parental counseling [^a8bf82d8] [^5f16b0bb].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing harmful cultural practices. Infant oral mutilation to "treat" teething or illness is dangerous and carries high morbidity and mortality; clinicians should screen for this risk in relevant populations and provide culturally sensitive education to prevent harm [^06690e03] [^02e5aca3].

> Let me synthesize a practical, clinically actionable takeaway. True teething symptoms are local and mild: irritability, drooling, a desire to chew, gum discomfort, and occasionally a slight temperature rise, typically lasting a few days around eruption; systemic symptoms like fever, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, or rash are not reliably linked and warrant evaluation for other causes; management should be conservative and safety-focused, avoiding benzocaine and lidocaine and using gum massage, firm rubber teethers, and weight-appropriate acetaminophen or ibuprofen if needed, with clear return precautions for red flags [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa] [^ad038e7a] [^2f0d56c3].

---

Teething is associated with **mild, local symptoms** such as irritability, drooling, gum rubbing, and a slight temperature rise, but not with fever, diarrhea, or significant sleep disruption [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa] [^ece9b15d]. Most symptoms are **transient and self-limited**, peaking around the day of eruption and resolving within a few days [^38dde1aa]. Persistent or severe symptoms (fever ≥ 38°C, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, or marked sleep disturbance) should prompt evaluation for other causes, not teething [^f6a4135b]. Management is supportive: gentle gum massage, chilled (not frozen) teething rings, and acetaminophen or ibuprofen if needed; avoid benzocaine, lidocaine, and amber necklaces due to safety risks [^ad038e7a] [^2f0d56c3].

---

## Common teething symptoms

Several symptoms are **consistently associated** with teething:

- **Irritability and fussiness**: Commonly reported and temporally linked to tooth eruption [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa].

- **Drooling**: Increased salivation is a hallmark symptom [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa].

- **Gum rubbing and biting**: Infants frequently rub their gums or bite objects to relieve discomfort [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa].

- **Mild temperature elevation**: A slight rise in temperature (not fever) may occur around eruption day [^f7d0c74e] [^654a722a].

- **Decreased appetite**: Temporary reduced interest in solid foods is common [^f7d0c74e] [^38dde1aa].

---

## Symptoms not associated with teething

Certain symptoms are **not reliably linked** to teething and should prompt evaluation for other causes:

- **Fever**: Temperatures ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) are not associated with teething and warrant evaluation for infection or other causes [^f6a4135b] [^38dde1aa].

- **Diarrhea and vomiting**: Gastrointestinal symptoms are not causally related to teething [^f6a4135b] [^38dde1aa].

- **Significant sleep disruption**: Objective studies show no consistent sleep changes during teething [^ece9b15d].

- **Rash**: Generalized rashes are not associated with teething [^f6a4135b] [^38dde1aa].

---

## Duration and severity of symptoms

Symptoms typically occur in a **short window** around eruption — about 4 days before to 3 days after the tooth emerges — and are generally mild and self-limited [^38dde1aa]. Severe or persistent symptoms beyond this window should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses [^f6a4135b].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management focuses on **comfort and safety**:

- **Non-pharmacologic measures**: Gentle gum massage, chilled (not frozen) teething rings, and cold washcloths are recommended [^ad038e7a].

- **Pharmacologic measures**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used for significant discomfort, following weight-based dosing and safety guidelines [^504fa3d5] [^df506254].

- **Avoidance of harmful products**: Benzocaine and lidocaine gels are contraindicated due to methemoglobinemia risk; amber necklaces should be avoided due to choking and strangulation hazards [^ad038e7a] [^2f0d56c3].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical evaluation is indicated if any of the following occur:

- Fever ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) [^f6a4135b].

- Persistent diarrhea or vomiting [^f6a4135b].

- Significant sleep disturbance or behavioral changes [^ece9b15d].

- Signs of illness (e.g. lethargy, poor feeding, respiratory symptoms) [^f6a4135b].

---

Teething is associated with **mild, local symptoms** and is not a cause of systemic illness. Persistent or severe symptoms should prompt evaluation for other causes, and management should prioritize safety and comfort.

### Teething and Tooth eruption in infants: a cohort study [^8cd3b1a5]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

Many symptoms are attributed to teething in infants. There is little evidence to support these beliefs, despite their implications for clinical management. We investigated relationships between tooth eruption, fever, and teething symptoms.

Methods

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

Twenty-one children 6 to 24 months old attending 3 suburban long-day care centers ≥ 3 days/week. Measures. 1) Daily temperature recording and examination of alveolar ridges for tooth eruption (dental therapist). 2) Daily questionnaires-symptoms over preceding 24 hours (staff and parents independently). 3) Final questionnaire-beliefs/experiences related to teething (parents). Definitions. Eruption day-the first day a tooth could be seen or felt. Non-toothdays-more than 28 days clear of any eruption day. Toothdays-the 5 days preceding eruption days.

Results

Data were collected for 236 toothdays and 895 non-toothdays pertaining to 90 teeth. Child temperatures were similar on toothdays and non-toothdays (36.21 vs 36.18, paired t test). Logistic regression adjusted for age did not show an association between toothdays and temperature (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80, 2.27 for high fever; OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.48, 3.77 for low fever). Logistic regression models allowing for within-child cluster effects and age were fitted to daily staff and parent reports of mood, wellness/illness, drooling/dribbling, sleep, diarrhea, strong diapers, red cheeks, and rashes/flushing. Only parent-reported (but not staff-reported) loose stools were significantly associated with tooth eruption (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1. 26, 2.73). When the toothday definition was varied to 10 days preceding or 5 days surrounding tooth eruption, this single significant association was no longer apparent (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.98, 2.05 and OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.97, 2.21, respectively). All parents retrospectively reported that their own children had suffered a range of teething symptoms.

Conclusions

This study did not confirm the expected strong associations between tooth eruption and a range of teething symptoms in children 6 to 30 months old, although we cannot rule out the possibility that weak associations may exist (Type II error). These findings contrast with strong parent and professional beliefs to the contrary. Such beliefs may preclude optimal management of common patterns of illness and behavior in young children.teething, infants, symptoms, tooth eruption, illness.

### Prospective longitudinal study of signs and symptoms associated with primary Tooth eruption [^654a722a]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between primary tooth eruption and the manifestation of signs and symptoms of teething in infants.

Methods

An 8-month, longitudinal study was conducted with 47 noninstitutionalized infants (ie, receiving care at home) between 5 and 15 months of age in the city of Diamantina, Brazil. The nonrandomized convenience sample was based on the registry of infants in this age range provided by the Diamantina Secretary of Health. Eligible participants were infants with up to 7 erupted incisors and no history of chronic disease or disorders that could cause an increase in the signs and symptoms assessed in the study. Tympanic and axillary temperature readings and clinical oral examinations were performed daily. A daily interview with the mothers was conducted to investigate the occurrence of 13 signs and symptoms associated with teething presented by the infants in the previous 24 hours.

Results

Teething was associated with a rise in tympanic temperature on the day of the eruption (P = 0.004) and with the occurrence of other signs and symptoms. Readings of maximal tympanic and axillary temperatures were 36.8°C and 36.6°C, respectively. The most frequent signs and symptoms associated with teething were irritability (median: 0.60; P < .001), increased salivation (median: 0.50; P < .001), runny nose (median: 0.50; P < .001), and loss of appetite (median: 0.50; P < .001).

Conclusions

Irritability, increased salivation, runny nose, loss of appetite, diarrhea, rash, and sleep disturbance were associated with primary tooth eruption. Results of this study support the concept that the occurrence of severe signs and symptoms, such as fever, could not be attributed to teething.

### Does teething disrupt infant sleep? A longitudinal auto-videosomnography study [^ece9b15d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine prospectively the relationship between teething and infant sleep using objective sleep measurements.

Study Design

Over a 4-week period, 849 infants aged 3–18 months (mean = 8.4 ± 1.8) from the US and Canada were monitored using auto-videosomnography, based on computer-vision technology to decode video footage from crib camera monitors. Parents also provided reports of tooth eruption timing, symptoms, and management strategies. Objective sleep metrics, including total sleep time, night-time awakenings, and parental crib visits, were compared between teething and nonteething nights using generalized estimating equations and changepoint analysis.

Results

Both analytic approaches showed no significant differences in sleep metrics between teething and nonteething nights. Although over one-half of the parents reported sleep disturbances during teething, these subjective reports were not corroborated by the objective data.

Conclusions

These findings challenge the widely held belief that teething disrupts sleep and highlight the need for pediatric health care professionals to consider alternative explanations for infant sleep problems. Educating parents with evidence-based information may prevent potentially harmful management strategies for teething (eg, excessive use of analgesics and local anesthetics) and improve sleep problem management. Future research should explore these relationships using multiple objective measures and more diverse populations.

### Signs and symptoms of primary Tooth eruption: a meta-analysis [^f7d0c74e]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms associated with the primary tooth eruption have been extensively studied but it is still controversial.

Objective

To assess the occurrence of local and systemic signs and symptoms during primary tooth eruption.

Data Sources

Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. A partial gray literature search was taken by using Google Scholar and the reference lists of the included studies were scanned.

Study Selection

Observational studies assessing the association of eruption of primary teeth with local and systemic signs and symptoms in children aged 0 to 36 months were included.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently collected the information from the selected articles. Information was crosschecked and confirmed for its accuracy.

Results

A total of 1179 articles were identified, and after a 2-phase selection, 16 studies were included. Overall prevalence of signs and symptoms occurring during primary tooth eruption in children between 0 and 36 months was 70.5% (total sample = 3506). Gingival irritation (86.81%), irritability (68.19%), and drooling (55.72%) were the most frequent ones.

Limitations

Different general symptoms were considered among studies. Some studies presented lack of confounding factors, no clear definition of the diagnostics methods, use of subjective measures and long intervals between examinations.

Conclusions

There is evidence of the occurrence of signs and symptoms during primary tooth eruption. For body temperature analyses, eruption could lead to a rise in temperature, but it was not characterized as fever.

### Lidocaine hydrochloride (lidocaine viscous) [^941ee66c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: Life-threatening and fatal events in infants and young children

Postmarketing cases of seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in patients under the age of 3 years have been reported with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2% when it was not administered in strict adherence to the dosing and administration recommendations. In the setting of teething pain, Lidocaine Viscous 2% should generally not be used. For other conditions, the use of the product in patients less than 3 years of age should be limited to those situations where safer alternatives are not available or have been tried but failed.

To decrease the risk of serious adverse events with use of Lidocaine Viscous 2%, instruct caregivers to strictly adhere to the prescribed dose and frequency of administration and store the prescription bottle safely out of reach of children.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Medication cautions and dosing principles — According to the US Food and Drug Administration, codeine and tramadol are contraindicated in children younger than 12 years and topical benzocaine should not be used in infants or young children owing to the high risk of methemoglobinemia; the FDA also warns that over-the-counter oral benzocaine products should not be used to treat infants and children younger than 2 years, and that benzocaine oral drug products should only be used in adults and children 2 years and older if they contain certain warnings on the drug facts label because these products carry serious risks and provide little to no benefit for the treatment of oral pain including teething. Parents, guardians, and caregivers should be advised to carefully follow instructions on the medication label or prescription for appropriate dosage, and to minimize adverse effects, analgesic prescriptions should follow the principle of minimum effective dosage to achieve pain relief.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^ef0c465c]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical management of methemoglobinemia in neonatal/childhood period

Management of methemoglobinemia in infancy and childhood is based on several factors including whether the patient is symptomatic, the total amount of methemoglobin, the cause of the methemoglobinemia, and the patient's age. Of note, the cyanosis is determined not by percentage of methemoglobin but the total amount of methemoglobin. MetHb levels > 70% are considered potentially lethal. In acquired methemoglobinemia, treatment is indicated at levels of 20% in symptomatic patients and 30% in asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic or those with additional factors compromising oxygen delivery such as congenital heart disease, lung disease, significant anemia, or carbon monoxide poisoning should be treated at levels between 10% and 30%. In hereditary methemoglobinemia, higher levels of MetHb are better tolerated, with some patients asymptomatic even up to levels of 30%‐40%.

Infants are at greater risk of developing methemoglobinemia, attributed to lower levels of erythrocyte CYB5R activity estimated to be around 50%‐60% of adult values. In addition, infants have higher levels of HbF which is more readily oxidized to MetHb than adult hemoglobin.

In critically ill hospitalized infants, inhaled nitric oxide therapy for pulmonary hypertension may lead to methemoglobinemia, necessitating regular monitoring. Methemoglobinemia may occur in the first few months of life in infants with marked metabolic acidosis, typically associated with sepsis or diarrhea and dehydration. It is speculated that infants' higher intestinal pH promotes growth of Gram‐negative organisms such as Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni that convert dietary nitrates to nitrites, which in turn induce methemoglobinemia. Infants who ingest well water contaminated with nitrates are also susceptible to methemoglobinemia. So too are infants and young children exposed to local anesthetics such as lidocaine for circumcision, or to benzocaine, an analogue of aniline, in teething gels.

### Through the lens: insights into sudden death [^51014024]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a rare but devastating complication, estimated to occur in approximately 1 per 1000 person-years in children and adults with epilepsy. While the exact mechanisms are unknown, evidence suggests that a generalized seizure results in failure of central mechanisms of cardiorespiratory function resulting in apnea, bradyarrhythmia, and eventual circulatory collapse. While SUDEP is at the forefront of our minds when it comes to epilepsy, there are other syndromes associated with sudden death; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), and sudden unexplained death (SUD). The dearth of research into these entities leaves many unanswered questions; however, from studies into SIDS and SUDC we know that these events are most likely to occur from sleep and more commonly happen to infants, especially with prone positioning. There is increased incidence in winter months, in males, and in those with recent or intercurrent illness. There may be a febrile seizure history. Given commonalities in patients with sudden unexplained death, are there other features that link these sudden death syndromes?

In their study utilizing the Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood Registry, Gould and colleagues looked at terminal video footage from monitoring devices in 8 patients within their cohort of 301 patients. Seven cases with terminal video were included (one excluded due to poor video quality), with ages ranging from 13 to 27 months, including 4 males, with prior normal development and benign past medical histories. All deaths were sleep-related and all but one child was discovered with their face prone in bedding. Four had symptoms such as cough, fever, cold symptoms, and teething in the 72 hours prior to death with postmortem analysis finding mild signs of infection in 6 which were not felt to be causative. Six cases were ultimately ruled "Unexplained Sudden Death" with the remaining case considered asphyxia from airway obstruction in the setting of viral/bacterial infection. Whole exome sequencing was unrevealing.

### Is my baby normal? A review of seemingly worrisome but normal newborn signs, symptoms and behaviors [^21ef76df]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Infant patients are a unique challenge to emergency department (ED) physicians as the spectrum of normal infant signs, symptoms and behaviors are often difficult to differentiate from abnormal and potentially life-threatening conditions. In this article, we address some common chief complaints of neonates and young infants presenting to the ED, and contrast reassuring neonatal and young infant signs and symptoms against those that need further workup and intervention.

### Infant oral health [^16792e88]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

It may be easy to discount oral health in infancy because most infants are not born with teeth and only a few teeth erupt during the first year of life. Infancy, however, is a critical time for formation of habits. Positive habits, such as twice-daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste starting at first teeth eruption, provides topical fluoride, which is important for remineralization of the tooth and helps establish a lifelong healthy practice. Negative habits, such as bottle propping and frequent juice consumption, reinforce behaviors that promote caries and obesity. This article reviews normal dental development and eruption. Congenital anomalies affecting the mouth as well as acquired conditions, primarily dental caries, are reviewed. Oral health preventive modalities, including professionally applied products and home-based strategies, are discussed.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^6f50a90a]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain

What are indicators of pain, particularly at the later stages of disease?

Pain may occur due to dystonia, gastrointestinal issues (reflux, constipation), and orthopedic complications. In the later stages when individuals have more difficulty with communication, it may be more difficult to know if they are experiencing pain. Although not specific to PLAN, studies have identified common pain behaviors in children with severe neurologic impairment including crying, grimacing, grinding or clenching teeth, irritability, agitation, sleep disruption, increased movements, pulling away when touched, stiffening, sweating, and breath-holding. As children with infantile PLAN become less mobile, facial expressions, vital sign changes (increased heart rate or blood pressure), and disruptions of sleep may be the best indicators of pain. If pain is identified, the individual's physician should do a search for the source of pain which may include a careful skin exam, evaluation for corneal abrasion, hair tourniquet, or occult fracture, constipation evaluation and dental exam.

What is the recommended treatment for pain?

Treatment should be directed at the source of pain, if identified. In a child with reflux or constipation, ensure these are adequately treated. If no source is identified, empiric treatment for neurologic pain should be considered. Nonpharmacologic approaches may help with mild discomfort (eg, massage, music, repositioning, removing orthotics, use of a fan, vibratory therapy). Medications directed at neurologic pain such as gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), or clonidine may be considered (Figure 3). Some individuals also benefit from an as-needed medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen (see "CBD" section for comment on cannabinoids). A pain or palliative care specialist may be a helpful care team member.

### Management of an infant having natal teeth [^5f16b0bb]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Eruption of teeth at or immediately after birth is a relatively rare phenomenon. These teeth are known as 'natal' teeth if present at birth and 'neonatal' teeth if they erupt during the first 30 days of life. Natal teeth might resemble normal primary dentition in size and shape; however, the teeth are often smaller, conical and yellowish and have hypoplastic enamel and dentin with poor or absent root formation. Complications include difficulty and discomfort during suckling, sublingual ulceration, laceration of the mother's breasts and aspiration of the teeth. These situations would warrant extraction. If the tooth does not interfere with breast feeding and is otherwise asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Negative cultural attitudes towards natal teeth demand good parental counselling and vigilant management in relation to child protection. Both general practice dentists and paediatric dental specialists may be involved in the supervision or treatment of patients with natal and neonatal teeth.

### Oral health care for children and youth with developmental disabilities: clinical report [^f9c779c7]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Physiologic teething pain in children and youth with developmental disabilities (CYDD) can be addressed with conservative measures and specific safety cautions. Management options include chewing on hard or chilled teething rings, massaging the gingiva, or, if pain persists, over-the-counter analgesics like acetaminophen. The use of topical anesthetics, such as benzocaine, is contraindicated because of the risk of methemoglobinemia, and the use of amber teething necklaces is discouraged because of the risk of strangulation.

### Interventions with pregnant women, new mothers and other primary caregivers for preventing early childhood caries [^aecb274e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dental caries, a common chronic disease of childhood, is associated with adverse health and economic consequences for infants and their families. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children have a higher risk of early childhood caries (ECC). This review updates one published in 2019.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions undertaken with pregnant women, new mothers or other primary caregivers of infants in the first year of life, for preventing ECC (from birth to six years).

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL EBSCO, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (clinicaltrials.gov) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). The latest searches were run on 3 January, 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions with pregnant women, or new mothers and other primary caregivers of infants in the first year of life, against standard care, placebo or another intervention, reporting on a primary outcome: caries presence in primary teeth, dmfs (decayed, missing, filled primary surfaces index), or dmft (decayed, missing, filled teeth index), in children up to six years of age. Intervention types include clinical, oral health promotion/education (hygiene education, breastfeeding and other dietary advice) and policy or service.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed certainty of evidence (GRADE).

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs (5 cluster-randomised), involving 25,953 caregivers (mainly mothers) and their children. Fifteen trials assessed oral health education/promotion interventions against standard care. Six trials assessed a clinical intervention for mother dentition, against placebo, or a different type of clinical intervention. Two trials assessed oral health/education promotion plus clinical intervention (for mother's dentition) against standard care. At most, five trials (maximum of 1326 children and 130 mothers) contributed data to any comparison. Enamel-only caries were included in the diagnosis of caries in some studies. For many trials, the risk of bias was unclear due to lack of methodological details reported. In thirteen trials, participants were socioeconomically disadvantaged. No trial indicated receiving funding that was likely to have influenced their results. Oral health education/promotion interventions Child diet and feeding practice advice versus standard care: We observed a probable 15 per cent reduced risk of caries presence in primary teeth with the intervention (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 3 trials; 782 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be a slightly lower mean dmfs (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.58 to 0; 2 trials; 757 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, the evidence is very uncertain regarding the difference between groups in mean dmft (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.85 to 0.05; 1 trial; 340 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Breastfeeding promotion and support versus standard care: We observed little or no difference between groups in the risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 2 trials; 1148 participants; low-certainty evidence) and in mean dmft (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.36; 2 trials; 652 participants; low-certainty evidence). dmfs was not reported. Child diet advice compared with standard care: We are very uncertain about the effect on the risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.37; 1 trial; 148 participants; very low-certainty evidence). dmfs and dmft were not reported. Oral hygiene, child diet and feeding practice advice versus standard care: The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on the risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.07; 5 trials; 1326 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and there maybe little to no difference in mean dmfs (MD -0.87, 95% CI -2.18 to 0.43; 2 trials; 657 participants; low-certainty evidence) and mean dmft (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.36; 1 trial; 187 participants; low-certainty evidence). High-dose versus low-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy: We are very uncertain about the effect on risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.41; 1 trial; 496 participants; very low-certainty evidence). dmfs and dmft were not reported. Clinical interventions (for mother dentition) Chlorhexidine (CHX, a commonly prescribed antiseptic agent) or iodine-NaF application and prophylaxis versus placebo: We are very uncertain regarding the difference in risk of caries presence in primary teeth between antimicrobial and placebo treatment for mother dentition (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; 3 trials; 479 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported dmfs or dmft. Xylitol compared with CHX antimicrobial treatment: We are very uncertain about the effect on caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.39; 1 trial, 96 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but we observed there may be a lower mean dmft with xylitol (MD -2.39; 95% CI -4.10 to -0.68; 1 trial, 113 participants; low-certainty evidence). No trial reported dmfs. Oral health education/promotion plus clinical interventions (for mother dentition) Diet and feeding practice advice for infants and young children plus basic dental care for mothers compared with standard care: We are very uncertain about the effect on risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.05 to 3.95; 2 trials, 324 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or on mean dmft (1 study, not estimable). No trial reported dmfs. No trials evaluated policy or health service interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that providing advice on diet and feeding to pregnant women, mothers or other caregivers with children up to the age of one year probably leads to a slightly reduced risk of early childhood caries (ECC). The remaining evidence is low to very-low certainty and is insufficient for determining which, if any, other intervention types and features may be effective for preventing ECC, and in which settings. Large, high-quality RCTs of oral health education/promotion, clinical, and policy and service access interventions, are warranted to determine the effects and relative effects of different interventions and inform practice. We have identified 13 ongoing studies. Future studies should consider if and how effects are modified by intervention features and participant characteristics (including socioeconomic status).

### Natal and neonatal teeth: early diagnosis and management [^a8bf82d8]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The eruption of teeth in newborns is a rare disorder of the oral cavity and are called 'natal teeth' when they are present at birth or 'neonatal teeth' when they erupt within the first month of life. In most of these cases, they are prematurely erupted deciduous teeth or supernumerary teeth. Supportive management should be given, to facilitate child's feeding and to prevent further complications, such as aspiration as the tooth could be mobile. This study describes a series of cases that were reported to our department, involving teeth located in the mandibular anterior region either at birth or within a few days after birth. The choice of treatment for each child was based on individual assessment of the case, considering options such as monitoring and extraction along with their associated complications.

### Management of prematurely erupted teeth in newborns [^a0905a46]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The majority of natal and neonatal teeth are prematurely erupted primary teeth, whereas few are supernumerary in origin. They most commonly occur in mandibular central incisor region and often can lead to difficulty to the mother during breast feeding and tongue ulceration in newborn. Moreover, since majority of these have poorly developed roots and are mobile, there is always a fear of aspiration into respiratory passage. Extraction therefore is the most commonly rendered treatment for these teeth. This paper comprises cases of natal and neonatal teeth describing about their clinical characteristics and sequel. This paper has also highlighted the factor which needs to be considered during the management of natal/neonatal teeth and protocol followed at our centre.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^91a8962e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Use of Emollients

Clinical evidence derived from controlled studies of healthy infants 19, 49, 50 combined with evidence from studies demonstrating the positive effect of emollients in patients with AD (or at high risk of AD) and impaired barrier function 51, 52, 53, 54 supports the theoretical rationale for the use of emollients 55. Appropriately formulated emollients can be used to maintain or enhance skin barrier function after bathing and at least twice‐weekly application of emollients, as in the Garcia Bartels et al study 19, should be considered (Table 8). Longer‐term studies designed to evaluate the clinical benefits of emollients in healthy infants — potentially to prevent the onset of the typical progression of allergic diseases that often begins early in life — are warranted 56 and would strengthen the evidence for these recommendations.

Table 8
New Recommendations on Topical Use of Emollients and Oils

Given that environmental factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the skin, it was strongly recommended that the choice of emollient be adapted to geographic location and season 57, 58. Richer (higher proportion of emollient than water) emollients may be required in cold climates and less rich emollients in warmer climates or times of the year.

Emollients should be applied in a thin layer to avoid occlusive effects, and care should be taken to avoid the trapping of emollients in folds, which may lead to dysregulation of evaporation or heat dysregulation and bacterial colonization 59, 60. Special attention should be paid to the perioral area to protect infants from the irritating effects of saliva, particularly during periods of teething. If neonatal or infantile acne is present, application of emollients to the affected area should be avoided to prevent follicular occlusion, which could exacerbate the condition.

Highlighting the importance of design, certain emollients containing SLS and no humectants may contribute to skin barrier breakdown (SLS solubilizes SC lipids, denatures keratin, and raises skin surface pH 32), so health care professionals should be aware of the suitability of emollients, and those containing SLS should be avoided.

### The need for global safeguards for fundamental rights of children at risk of infant oral mutilation (IOM) [^06690e03]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Not long ago in Kenya: A four month-old boy was admitted into Emergency Department of a local hospital with severe haemorrhage and shock after a traditional gouging out, by a faith healer, of healthy primary canine tooth-germs without antisepsis, sedative or anaesthesia. The faith healer believed that he was offering a cure for non-specific childhood illnesses, with symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Efforts to resuscitate the child failed and he died within 6 hours of admission to hospital and 24 hours after the procedure was performed.

This scenario highlights a traditional practice called infant oral mutilation (IOM), which is commonly affiliated with many communities from the East and Central African regions. It is a practice with unproven benefits but with very harmful consequences. The practice involves the gouging out of developing primary canine teeth, as a panacea for non-specific childhood illnesses. The bulges in a child's gums, representing developing primary canines, are perceived to be 'tooth worms' responsible for childhood illness and must be removed to prevent the child from dying.

### Diagnosis and management in rubinstein-taybi syndrome: first international consensus statement [^c7c625de]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroenterology

Malformations of the gastrointestinal tract such as a duodenal web and malrotation occur at a low frequency in newborns with RTS, although the frequency of the malrotation may be higher than in the general population. Symptomatology is similar to in newborns without RTS and should be managed as in the general population.

Feeding problems are very frequently present at birth and may remain present for a prolonged period of time. Oral feeding is preferred if it is safe and feasible, while tube feeding may be needed and a gastrostomy for long-term use. The involvement of dieticians is often helpful (online supplemental R14). Although feeding problems are in part explained by recurrent respiratory infections and hypotonia, also gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) may play a role. Limited GOR occurs in all healthy infants and children; if causing excessive symptoms it is referred to as GOR disease (GORD). The symptomatology of GORD may vary widely, from feeding problems, dental enamel erosions and recurrent pneumonias to restlessness and poor sleep. The pathogenesis remains uncertain.GOR(D) should be differentiated from excessive regurgitation after feeds in otherwise asymptomatic infants, which is usually indicated as infant rumination syndrome. Extremely rarely, oeosinophilic oesophagitis may develop. Given the lack of evidence for the management of GORD specifically in RTS, management of GORD should be as in the general population,: thickening of food and reassurance of parents as a first step. If symptoms persist, an initial trial with PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitors) treatment can be considered. If problems continue, further evaluation should be considered. If a PPI trial improves symptomatology, this does not conclusively prove acid-related GORD. Long-term use of PPI may cause side-effects, thus in successful PPI trials individuals should undergo weaning trials regularly (eg, after 6 months and yearly thereafter) to evaluate the utility of continuing PPI treatment, while mitigating rebound effects by dose tapering. If symptoms persist or recur, additional testing, such as pH-impedance testing and/or endoscopy can be considered (online supplemental R15). Fundoplication and other surgical interventions are not recommended in an early phase of management, as these have a relatively high failure rate, commonly cause complications and can induce dysphagia and subsequent feeding problems; it should be reserved for patients with proven GORD unresponsive to optimal nutritional and medical therapy. Fortunately, complications of long-term GORD such as Barrett's oesophagus are rare in RTS, and oesophageal cancer has not been reported.

### Oral health care for children and youth with developmental disabilities: clinical report [^e9e2572f]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Risk factors and pain-related triggers for self-injurious behavior (SIB) are outlined, including that individual risk factors for SIB include severe to profound IDD, physical or sensory-related disability, communication challenges, genetic disorders, and severe ASD, that low adaptive skills, poor sleep hygiene, gastrointestinal disorders, behavioral challenges, and avoidance of a patient's previously favorite activities are also commonly associated with SIB, that rarely is there a single cause or a consistent, identifiable antecedent triggering the behavior and pain elsewhere in the body may trigger SIB to the mouth and face, that SIB negatively impacts the quality of life for the individual, family, and caregivers, and that when SIB occurs suddenly and without an identifiable antecedent or change in environment, it may be related to pain, including pain in the oral facial area attributable to lesions on the lips, gums, tongue, or teeth or due to biting, scratching at the face, mouthing objects, head banging, excessive drooling, self-extraction of teeth, or infection; intraoral lesions include ulcerations of the mucosa and hematomas, and pain and subsequent SIB can also occur alongside gastroesophageal reflux disease with related tooth erosion with chronic hand mouthing.

### Anencephalic infant with cleft palate and natal teeth: a case report [^10bb46f6]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Natal/neonatal teeth are very common in children with complete unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate. This article outlines a patient with intrauterine growth retardation, anencephaly, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, two maxillary first natal incisor teeth, cleft palate, short neck, low-set ears, hypertelorism, retrognathia, and simian-line on the right hand. There is no conclusive evidence of a correlation between these findings and a known syndrome, suggesting that this case may be a hitherto undefined clinical combination with neonatal teeth.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^6923f36d]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — updates prior guidance and frames key risks and system needs. More than 80% of newborn infants will have some degree of jaundice, and careful monitoring of all newborn infants and the application of appropriate treatments are essential, because high bilirubin concentrations can cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. Kernicterus is a permanent disabling neurologic condition characterized by some or all of the following: choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, upward gaze paresis, enamel dysplasia of deciduous teeth, sensorineural hearing loss or auditory neuropathy or dyssynchrony spectrum disorder, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Central to this guideline is having systems in place including policies in hospitals and other types of birthing locations to provide the care necessary to minimize the risk of kernicterus. This article updates and replaces the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the management and prevention of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and states that this clinical practice guideline addresses issues of prevention, risk assessment, monitoring, and treatment.

### Fruit juice in infants, children, and adolescents: current recommendations [^845c2f77]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Infants — The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that human milk be the only nutrient fed to infants until approximately 6 months of age, and there is no nutritional indication to give fruit juice to infants younger than 6 months. It is optimal to completely avoid the use of juice in infants before 1 year of age; when juice is medically indicated for an infant older than 6 months, it is prudent to give the juice in a cup. Dental caries have been associated with juice consumption and prolonged exposure of teeth to sugars in juice is a major contributing factor; recommendations state that juice should be offered to toddlers in a cup, not a bottle, and that infants not be put to bed with a bottle in their mouth. Infants can be encouraged to consume whole fruit that is mashed or pureed. After 1 year of age, fruit juice may be used as part of a meal or snack and should not be sipped throughout the day or used as a means to calm an upset child; because infants consume < 1600 kcal/day, 4 ounces of juice per day, representing half of the recommended daily serving of fruit, is more than adequate.

### Teething: facts and fiction… [^ad97a744]. publications.aap.org (2009). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Teething is a process that all children experience. Most children get their first tooth around 6 months of age and have a complete set of 20 deciduous teeth by 30 months of age. Parental perceptions and beliefs about teething often influence the symptomatology a child experiences with tooth eruption. From medical professionals to grandmothers, everyone seems to have a list of symptoms they believe are linked to teething. "Teething, like colic, is an ill-defined nonevidence-based entity for which parents receive much advice. " It is important to remember that during this same time period of an infant's life, passive immunity due to maternal antibodies wanes and exposure to a wide variety of childhood illnesses occurs. Due to this temporal relationship, teething often is blamed for symptoms such as changes in sleep and eating patterns, rhinorrhea, drooling, rash, fussiness,… Comments

A thorough examination of the oral mucosa can provide helpful clues toward making a diagnosis in a number of developmental, neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. A number of oral lesions seen in infants and children are benign and of no medical significance. In these instances, the ability of the physician to confidently identify the diagnosis, and reassure parents that a lesion is not worrisome, carries significant value. Likewise, the ability to recognize an underlying systemic illness or genetic disease based on an oral examination can also be of tremendous value, particularly when oral involvement is the presenting feature.

### Human monkeypox outbreak caused by novel virus belonging to Congo basin clade, Sudan, 2005 [^02d4e0e8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

In Sudan, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, extracting incisors (and sometimes canine milk teeth) occurs just after eruption of permanent dentition. This practice is associated with achieving adulthood, beauty, and tribal identity and is necessary for emitting specific linguistic sounds and consuming softer food textures. In addition, it is a common belief that canine milk teeth adversely affect the health of infants, causing diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. These teeth are often removed by a traditional healer when symptoms develop in the child. Because these practices are avenues for disease transmission, an educational campaign aimed at reducing the prevalence of this practice should be implemented. Culturally sensitive education could help implement change for safer practices and discourage this harmful ritual practice.

The low CFR observed during this outbreak could not be attributed to treatment, as most case-patients were admitted to the MSF-F hospital very late in the course of disease. Virulence differences between MPXV isolates from West Africa and the Congo Basin have been shown to be caused by genetic differences. The low CFR observed in Sudan could be linked to the MPXV circulating in Unity State and its genetic difference with West Africa and Congo Basin isolates. In this regard, our preliminary results showed that the MPXV strain isolated during this outbreak is a novel virus. Alternatively, the low CFR could be related to the transmission of the virus or dose of the virus exposure, and the relatively older ages of affected persons.

### Natural history and familial relationships of infant spilling to 9 years of age [^00dc7064]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the natural history of infant spilling (regurgitation/vomiting) during the first 2 years of life and to determine the relationship between infant spilling and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) symptoms at 9 years of age.

Methods

A prospective birth cohort was followed with daily symptom diaries during the first 2 years of life and reviewed at 9 years of age (range: 8–11 years). The prevalence of infant spilling during the first 2 years of life, the prevalence of GER symptoms between 8 and 11 years of age (mean age: 9.7 years), relative risk of infant spilling predisposing to GER symptoms at 9 years of age, and prevalence of maternal GER symptoms and relationship with infant spilling and GER at 9 years of age were measured.

Results

A total of 693 children who represented 83% of an original sample of 836 children and were followed for 2 years from birth with daily symptom diaries were contacted at 9 (8–11) years of age. Spilling of most feeds each day was common in infancy and reached a peak prevalence of 41% between 3 and 4 months of age and thereafter declined to < 5% between 13 and 14 months of age. Infants with spilling on 90 days or more during the first 2 years of life (classified as frequent spilling) were more likely to have GER symptoms at 9 years of age. Children with frequent infant spilling, compared with those with no spilling, had a relative risk of 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–4.0) of 1 or more GER symptoms at 9 years of age, 4.6 (95% CI: 1.5–13.8) for heartburn, 2.7 (95% CI: 1.4–5.5) for vomiting, and 4.7 (95% CI: 1.6–14.0) for acid regurgitation. Gender, breastfeeding, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure were not significant factors related to infant spilling. Prepregnancy smoking and smoking in the same room as the child at the 9-month and 18-month follow-ups had a significant effect on GER symptoms at 9 years of age. Infant spilling and GER at 9 years of age were significantly related to maternal GER symptoms but not to paternal GER symptoms.

Conclusions

Spilling in infancy is very common, but the majority of children settle by 13 to 14 months of age. However, those with frequent spilling (> 90 days) are more likely to have GER symptoms at 9 years of age. In addition, a maternal history of GER was significantly related both to infant spilling and to GER at 9 years, suggesting that a genetic component may be involved. Physicians should consider studying children with a history of frequent infant spilling to determine whether this group is at increased risk for GER disease.

### Are one or two dangerous? Lidocaine and topical anesthetic exposures in children [^aabd858b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Topical anesthetics are found in a variety of prescription and non-prescription preparations, from teething gels to hemorrhoid creams. In 2003, there were 8576 exposures to local/topical anesthetics reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, with 67% of cases in the age group younger than 6 years old. This report reviews the available literature involving topical anesthetic exposures in children younger than 6 years old, including the National Library of Medicine's Pub Med database (limited to English language) and data from POISINDEX. Additionally, we reviewed the American Association of Poison Control Centers' annual reports from 1983 to 2003. There were 7 deaths in this age range from topical anesthetics. Although the number of deaths is low, the fact that there have been deaths reveals the serious nature of the toxicity that can result from these readily available non-prescription analgesics. Toxicity may result from topical absorption, ingestion, or aspiration. Additionally, toxicity can result from unintentional as well as therapeutic mishaps. Although the number of cases is limited, these medications can be toxic at low doses-which, in children younger than 6 years of age, may amount to as little as a teaspoon.

### Screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^bd15585c]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the US. According to the 2011–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 23% of children aged 2 to 5 years had dental caries in their primary teeth. Prevalence is higher in Mexican American children (33%) and non-Hispanic Black children (28%) than in non-Hispanic White children (18%). Dental caries in early childhood is associated with pain, loss of teeth, impaired growth, decreased weight gain, negative effects on quality of life, poor school performance, and future dental caries.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years.

Population

Asymptomatic children younger than 5 years.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with oral fluoride supplementation at recommended doses in children 6 months or older whose water supply is deficient in fluoride. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with fluoride varnish application in all children younger than 5 years. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient on performing routine oral screening examinations for dental caries by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians prescribe oral fluoride supplementation starting at age 6 months for children whose water supply is deficient in fluoride. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians apply fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening examinations for dental caries performed by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years.

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^b4e927b8]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system (SNI) is described as pain attributable to peripheral nerve or central nervous system injury, with descriptors including burning, shocklike, shooting, prickling, or needlelike pain; it can be persistent or recurrent and may be difficult to treat but is often managed with antidepressants and anticonvulsants, and benefit from neuropathic pain medications may provide indirect evidence of this source in children with SNI. Neuropathic pain can reflect allodynia or hyperalgesia and is suggested in children with SNI by higher baseline pain ratings when they are not considered to be in pain and by significant intensity and duration of symptoms attributed to routine problems; examples include constipation with an average intensity of 6.2 out of 10 and a duration of 24.5 hours, and teething with an average intensity of 5.2 out of 10 and a duration of 18.5 hours. Surgery is a risk factor, with persistent pain reported in 10% to 50% of adults after common surgeries and severe pain in 2% to 10%, and a case series of 6 children with cerebral palsy identified neuropathic pain after lower-extremity orthopedic surgery. Central neuropathic pain can develop with thalamic or spinothalamic tract involvement, and symptoms can be constant with sudden bursts of intense pain; other symptoms include visceral pain with gastrointestinal or bladder distention, described by 1 adult as feeling "like my bowels will explode."

### Challenges in managing drooling in children [^2263dd57]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Drooling is the unintentional loss of saliva from the mouth, either anteriorly (visible) or posteriorly (with a risk of coughing, vomiting, aspiration and chronic respiratory disorders).(1,2) Anterior drooling is normal in infancy, but is considered neuro-developmentally abnormal if it occurs in children over the age of 4 years old, and is commonly seen in those with physical, intellectual and learning disability, and poor neuromuscular coordination and oral control.(1,3–7) For example, drooling occurs in 10–38% of children with cerebral palsy.(6,8) Drooling is usually due to failure to clear saliva rather than hyper-salivation (sialorrhoea), and a head-down posture and sucking on fingers or clothing may be contributory factors.(1,2,5–7) Here we review the challenges associated with the management of drooling in children.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for oral health in children with cleft lip and palate [^0fe25ede]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital anomalies, defined as abnormalities of structure, function, or metabolism that are present at birth, are a major public health concern due to their life-threatening nature or potential to result in disability or death. Worldwide, it is estimated that 303 000 newborn infants die within 4 weeks of birth every year due to congenital anomalies. Clefting of the lip with or without palate is the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly, with the global prevalence estimated at 1 in 700 live births, and it is estimated that a child with a cleft is born somewhere in the world approximately every 2 minutes. The prevalence of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) differs according to gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Boys are more affected with CL/P than are girls, with a reported ratio of 2:1, while females have a slightly higher risk for cleft palate only. Literature reports the presence of 3 different types of cleft based on their location: cleft palate (CP), cleft lip with cleft palate (CLP), and cleft lip (CL). A cleft of the lip and/or palate has serious consequences, affecting feeding, speech, and hearing. As well as appearance, it negatively affects an individual's self-esteem, social skills, behavior, and quality of life. Studies have reported that children with CLP often display fear of toothbrushing due to limited access of cleft areas, making oral hygiene difficult. The scarring of tissue in the cleft region after surgical repair, crowded dentition, and reduced oral clearance by saliva and tongue accelerate the incidence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) in children with CLP. A meta-analysis by Worth and colleagues, published in 2017, found a higher prevalence rate of dental caries in children with clefts when compared with noncleft children in both the primary and permanent dentition.

### Symptoms associated with infant teething: a prospective study… [^38dde1aa]. publications.aap.org (2000). Low credibility.

Studies of infant teething have been retrospective, small, or conducted on institutionalized infants. To conduct a large, prospective study of healthy infants to determine which symptoms may be attributed to teething and to attempt to predict tooth emergence from an infant's symptoms. Prospective cohort. Clinic-based pediatric group practice. One hundred twenty-five consecutive well children of consenting Cleveland Clinic employees. Parents daily recorded 2 tympanic temperatures, presence or absence of 18 symptoms, and all tooth eruptions in their infants, from the 4-month well-child visit until the child turned 1 year old. Daily symptom data were available for 19 422 child-days and 475 tooth eruptions. Symptoms were only significantly more frequent in the 4 days before a tooth emergence, the day of the emergence, and 3 days after it, so this 8-day window was defined as the teething period.

Increased biting, drooling, gum-rubbing, sucking, irritability, wakefulness, ear-rubbing, facial rash, decreased appetite for solid foods, and mild temperature elevation were all statistically associated with teething. Congestion, sleep disturbance, stool looseness, increased stool number, decreased appetite for liquids, cough, rashes other than facial rashes, fever over 102°F, and vomiting were not significantly associated with tooth emergence. Although many symptoms were associated with teething, no symptom occurred in > 35% of teething infants, and no symptom occurred > 20% more often in teething than in nonteething infants. No teething child had a fever of 104°F and none had a life-threatening illness. Many mild symptoms previously thought to be associated with teething were found in this study to be temporally associated with teething. However, no symptom cluster could reliably predict the imminent emergence of a tooth.

Before caregivers attribute any infants' signs or symptoms of a potentially serious illness to teething, other possible causes must be ruled out. teething, tooth eruption, teeth, deciduous dentition. Comments.

### Alterations in Tooth structure and associated systemic conditions [^c7d43241]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

A variety of factors can affect the normal development of tissues and may lead to variation in the normal compliment of teeth and development of alterations in the shape and size of teeth. These anomalies can be congenital, developmental, or acquired. Dental anomalies can present as isolated traits or be associated with systemic conditions and syndromes for which early diagnosis and genetic testing may result in better treatment outcomes and quality of life. Dentists play an essential role in the multidisciplinary management of these abnormalities. This article discusses some of these tooth alterations and associated systemic and genetic conditions.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^3554b17c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — evaluation emphasis and risk cues are outlined as follows: Because "choking and gagging usually indicate common diagnoses such as GER or respiratory infection," their presence "suggests an event was not a BRUE," and the use of "altered level of responsiveness" is identified as "a new criterion." For infants who have experienced a BRUE, "a careful history and physical examination are necessary to characterize the event, assess the risk of recurrence, and determine the presence of an underlying disorder," with recommendations focusing on "infants with a lower risk of a subsequent event or serious underlying disorder," and noting that in the absence of identifiable risk factors, "laboratory studies, imaging studies, and other diagnostic procedures are unlikely to be useful or necessary." If the clinical history or physical examination "reveals abnormalities, the patient may be at higher risk and further evaluation should focus on the specific areas of concern," with examples including that "possible child abuse may be considered" when the history is inconsistent with development or there is unexplained bruising or torn frenulum, "a cardiac arrhythmia may be considered" with a family history of sudden unexplained death in first-degree relatives, and "infection may be considered" with fever or persistent respiratory symptoms.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) in children — clinical features and course: Children with DCM exhibit generalized erythema with pachydermia, their skin color usually appears darker than normal, and a pronounced persistent dermographism is seen after minimal mechanical irritation; DCM may initially present with large blisters elicited by rubbing or scratching and triggered by viral infections or teething, and infants with DCM often present initially with large blisters; the tendency to blister usually improves within 3 to 4 years, and some patients show prolonged bleeding from skin wounds probably because of local release of heparin; serum tryptase levels are usually increased at presentation although most patients do not have systemic organ involvement; cutaneous lesions often resolve by adolescence; some families have mastocytosis inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and these patients typically have persistently increased tryptase levels, mast cell infiltrates in extracutaneous organs, and a chronic course; the term DCM refers only to patients with generalized thickened and dark skin and not to those with extensive and sometimes even confluent MPCM.

### Interventions for the cessation of non-nutritive sucking habits in children [^ac512e4d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Comforting behaviours, such as the use of pacifiers (dummies, soothers), blankets and finger or thumb sucking, are common in babies and young children. These comforting habits, which can be referred to collectively as 'non-nutritive sucking habits' (NNSHs), tend to stop as children get older, under their own impetus or with support from parents and carers. However, if the habit continues whilst the permanent dentition is becoming established, it can contribute to, or cause, development of a malocclusion (abnormal bite). A diverse variety of approaches has been used to help children with stopping a NNSH. These include advice, removal of the comforting object, fitting an orthodontic appliance to interfere with the habit, application of an aversive taste to the digit or behaviour modification techniques. Some of these interventions are easier to apply than others and less disturbing for the child and their parent; some are more applicable to a particular type of habit.

Objectives

The primary objective of the review was to evaluate the effects of different interventions for cessation of NNSHs in children. The secondary objectives were to determine which interventions work most quickly and are the most effective in terms of child and parent- or carer-centred outcomes of least discomfort and psychological distress from the intervention, as well as the dental measures of malocclusion (reduction in anterior open bite, overjet and correction of posterior crossbite) and cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 8 October 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 8 October 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 8 October 2014), PsycINFO via OVID (1980 to 8 October 2014) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 8 October 2014), the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (Clinical Trials.gov) (to 8 October 2014) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 8 October 2014). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We screened reference lists from relevant articles and contacted authors of eligible studies for further information where necessary.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in children with a non-nutritive sucking habit that compared one intervention with another intervention or a no-intervention control group. The primary outcome of interest was cessation of the habit.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Three review authors were involved in screening the records identified; two undertook data extraction, two assessed risk of bias and two assessed overall quality of the evidence base. Most of the data could not be combined and only one meta-analysis could be carried out.

Main Results

We included six trials, which recruited 252 children (aged two and a half to 18 years), but presented follow-up data on only 246 children. Digit sucking was the only NNSH assessed in the studies. Five studies compared single or multiple interventions with a no-intervention or waiting list control group and one study made a head-to-head comparison. All the studies were at high risk of bias due to major limitations in methodology and reporting. There were small numbers of participants in the studies (20 to 38 participants per study) and follow-up times ranged from one to 36 months. Short-term outcomes were observed under one year post intervention and long-term outcomes were observed at one year or more post intervention. Orthodontics appliance (with or without psychological intervention) versus no treatmentTwo trials that assessed this comparison evaluated our primary outcome of cessation of habit. One of the trials evaluated palatal crib and one used a mix of palatal cribs and arches. Both trials were at high risk of bias. The orthodontic appliance was more likely to stop digit sucking than no treatment, whether it was used over the short term (risk ratio (RR) 6.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 25.53; two trials, 70 participants) or long term (RR 5.81, 95% CI 1.49 to 22.66; one trial, 37 participants) or used in combination with a psychological intervention (RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 41.96; one trial, 32 participants). Psychological intervention versus no treatmentTwo trials (78 participants) at high risk of bias evaluated positive reinforcement (alone or in combination with gaining the child's co-operation) or negative reinforcement compared with no treatment. Pooling of data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the psychological interventions in the short term (RR 6.16, 95% CI 1.18 to 32.10; I(2) = 0%). One study, with data from 57 participants, reported on the long-term effect of positive and negative reinforcement on sucking cessation and found a statistically significant difference in favour of the psychological interventions (RR 6.25, 95% CI 1.65 to 23.65). Head-to-head comparisonsOnly one trial demonstrated a clear difference in effectiveness between different active interventions. This trial, which had only 22 participants, found a higher likelihood of cessation of habit with palatal crib than palatal arch (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found low quality evidence that orthodontic appliances (palatal arch and palatal crib) and psychological interventions (including positive and negative reinforcement) are effective at improving sucking cessation in children. There is very low quality evidence that palatal crib is more effective than palatal arch. This review has highlighted the need for high quality trials evaluating interventions to stop non-nutritive sucking habits to be conducted and the need for a consolidated, standardised approach to reporting outcomes in these trials.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^4a138afa]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Feeding difficulties are almost universally present in neonates and infants with CdLS and often in children and adults as well. Oral feeding is preferred if it is safe and stress-free and if feeding time does not exceed 3 hours per day, otherwise enteral feeding is recommended. Involvement of dieticians is essential (R12, R13). Gastrostomies are the preferred option if tube feeding is needed for a prolonged period of time. Cleft palate, micrognathia and dental issues may contribute to feeding difficulties. Cleft palate, including submucous cleft palate, occurs in 20% of individuals with CdLS. Isolated cleft lip is not related to CdLS. Dental problems consist of delayed secondary tooth eruption, small or absent teeth, malposition, malocclusion, overcrowding of teeth, dental caries on the perilingual maxillary surface (due to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD)), periodontal disease and bruxism. Dental problems are worsened by poor oral hygiene, especially in those with marked intellectual disability, and owing to limited patient compliance(R14, R15), which may lead to early-onset dental decay and periodontal disease. Dental treatment by an interdisciplinary health-care team, a healthy diet, topical fluoride application and periodic dental check-ups are crucial in optimal management.

Motor development is invariably delayed. Reliable data for a large series of individuals with molecularly confirmed diagnoses are not available. In a small series (n = 51), children with SMC1A variants reached several milestones (sitting, walking and first words) at a younger age than children with NIPBL variants. In the latter group, at 5 years of age, 99% were able to sit, 63% could walk independently and 38% had started to speak (R16).

Vaccinations should be given according to national schemes (R17). Recurrent respiratory infections are common and are thought to be secondary to altered anatomy, hypotonia and coordination of swallowing and coughing. Immunological anomalies occur occasionally; if unusually frequent or severe infections are present, further studies are indicated. Thrombocytopenia has been reported but is usually non-progressive and asymptomatic, and specific testing is not needed.

### Hypophosphatasia [^92df877f]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a group of inherited disorders characterised by the impaired mineralisation of bones and/or teeth and low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. It is caused by a mutation in the ALPL gene encoding the tissue-non-specific isoenzyme of ALP (TNSALP) resulting in a loss of function. The disease is highly heterogenous in its clinical expression ranging from stillbirth without mineralised bone to the mild form of late adult onset with symptoms and signs such as musculoskeletal pain, arthropathy, lower-extremity fractures, premature loss of teeth or an incidental finding of reduced serum ALP activity. A classification based on the age at diagnosis and the presence or absence of bone symptoms was historically used: perinatal, prenatal benign, infantile, childhood, adult and odontohypophosphatasia. These subtypes are known to have overlapping signs and complications. Three forms of HPP distinguishable by their genetic characteristics have been described: severe, moderate and mild. Severe forms of HPP (perinatal and infantile severe) are recessively inherited, whereas moderate HPP may be dominantly or recessively inherited. The biochemical hallmark of HPP is persistently low serum ALP for age and increase in natural substrates of TNSALP, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and phosphoethanolamine supported by radiological findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by ALPL sequencing. A multidisciplinary team of experts is essential for the effective management. Calcium restriction is recommended in infants/children to manage hypercalcaemia. A targeted enzyme replacement therapy for HPP has become available and correct diagnosis is crucial to allow early treatment.

### Impacted wisdom teeth [^0bb77e43]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of impacted wisdom teeth is high, with some 72% of Swedish people aged 20–30 years having at least one impacted third molar. Impacted wisdom teeth occur owing to a lack of space, obstruction, or abnormal position, and can cause pain, swelling, and infection, and may destroy adjacent teeth and bone.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: Should asymptomatic and disease-free impacted wisdom teeth be removed prophylactically? What are the effects of different surgical methods of removing impacted wisdom teeth? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Results

We found 29 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: prophylactic extraction; different surgical methods of removing impacted wisdom teeth.

### Mothers' facebook posts about infant health: findings from the grow2Gether study [^8f42ebda]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Social media is a common way for mothers to seek advice about their infants. However, little is known about how low-income urban mothers use social media to obtain infant health information and whether this information is consistent with expert pediatric recommendations.

Objectives

(1) identify the types of health questions asked by low-income mothers of infants in a social media parenting group; (2) describe whether peer answers are consistent with or contradict AAP guidelines; (3) identify the practices that mothers post about that are inconsistent with AAP guidelines.

Methods

Forty-three low-income mothers were enrolled in Grow2Gether, a private Facebook group intervention focused on infant care and moderated by a psychologist. All health questions posted by mothers were coded thematically; answers to questions from the group were assessed for consistency with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines related to infant feeding, sleep, screen time, and safety. Additionally, all unique posts that contained practices inconsistent with these AAP guidelines were thematically coded.

Results

In total, 215 posts were coded. Participants posted 61 questions related to infant health, most commonly solid food introduction (8/61), teething (8/61), and breastfeeding (7/61). Of the 77 answers given by peers, 6 contradicted guidelines. Separately, mothers had 73 posts demonstrating practices inconsistent with AAP guidelines [safe sleep (43/73) and screen time (21/73)].

Conclusions

Mothers' Facebook group interactions in the context of an infant care intervention revealed that when mothers posed direct questions regarding infant health, their peers generally gave answers that did not contradict AAP guidelines. In contrast, mothers' posts simply describing sleep and screen time practices commonly contradicted guidelines.

### The need for global safeguards for fundamental rights of children at risk of infant oral mutilation (IOM) [^02e5aca3]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Infant oral mutilation practice

IOM is undertaken either unilaterally or bilaterally in the dental jaws by traditional healers/herbalists, religious leaders, traditional birth attendants/other healthcare providers or family members using crude and non-sterile instruments. The instruments include sharpened stones, broken glass, bicycle spokes, umbrella spokes, knives, needles, nails, fingernails and razors. Two IOM surgical approaches have been used based on the individual tribal community's preference. The first approach is non-destructive and involves lancing the gums over the bulge, representing developing primary canines, with a sharp, heated instrument until bleeding occurs, thus relieving non-specific symptoms of childhood illnesses. The second approach is more destructive and involves incising the developing primary canine bulge before enucleating/removing the whole healthy tooth bud. In some communities, mothers initially apply specific local herbs on their breast and their children's gum pad for a week prior to the IOM procedure, and additional herbs and honey are rubbed into the tooth socket after performing the IOM, to aid in wound healing. Nonetheless, the two methods used in the practice of IOM are not only traumatic, but are also undertaken in unhygienic/non-sterile environments, which expose the child to unnecessary infections and injuries to the soft tissues, developing primary and succedaneous canine teeth, and also to the adjacent primary and other permanent teeth.

Infant oral mutilation-related morbidity and mortality

Short-term complications

In the short term, IOM leads to the affected child not only being denied the necessary medical treatment for undiagnosed childhood illness, but also experiencing psychological trauma, pain, haemorrhage, soft tissue swelling, inflammation, trismus, tissue laceration, infections (tetanus, osteomyelitis, septicaemia) and even death, aside from upper respiratory infections, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, meningitis, otitis media, febrile convulsions, wheezy bronchitis, irritability and submandibular abscess. A study in Sudan indicated that 97% of children who had undergone IOM had been dehydrated and 11% had malaria, pneumonia and gastroenteritis, and in Uganda several hospital admissions for IOM cases showed the children had suffered from malaria, pneumonia, or gastroenteritis and malnutrition.

### Interventions for managing halitosis [^0d49f4c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Halitosis or bad breath is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present due to an underlying oral or systemic disease. 50% to 60% of the world population has experienced this problem which can lead to social stigma and loss of self-confidence. Multiple interventions have been tried to control halitosis ranging from mouthwashes and toothpastes to lasers. This new Cochrane Review incorporates Cochrane Reviews previously published on tongue scraping and mouthrinses for halitosis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of various interventions used to control halitosis due to oral diseases only. We excluded studies including patients with halitosis secondary to systemic disease and halitosis-masking interventions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 8 April 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 8 April 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 April 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 April 2019). We also searched LILACS BIREME (1982 to 19 April 2019), the National Database of Indian Medical Journals (1985 to 19 April 2019), OpenGrey (1992 to 19 April 2019), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 19 April 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (8 April 2019), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 April 2019), the ISRCTN Registry (19 April 2019), the Clinical Trials Registry - India (19 April 2019), were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the cross-references of included studies and systematic reviews published on the topic. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults over the age of 16, and any intervention for managing halitosis compared to another or placebo, or no intervention. The active interventions or controls were administered over a minimum of one week and with no upper time limit. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, trials comparing the results for less than one week follow-up, and studies including advanced periodontitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 44 trials in the review with 1809 participants comparing an intervention with a placebo or a control. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 77 years. Most of the trials reported on short-term follow-up (ranging from one week to four weeks). Only one trial reported long-term follow-up (three months). Three studies were at low overall risk of bias, 16 at high overall risk of bias, and the remaining 25 at unclear overall risk of bias. We compared different types of interventions which were categorised as mechanical debridement, chewing gums, systemic deodorising agents, topical agents, toothpastes, mouthrinse/mouthwash, tablets, and combination methods. Mechanical debridement: for mechanical tongue cleaning versus no tongue cleaning, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported organoleptic test (OLT) scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07; 2 trials, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Chewing gums: for 0.6% eucalyptus chewing gum versus placebo chewing gum, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.11; 1 trial, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Systemic deodorising agents: for 1000 mg champignon versus placebo, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome patient-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (MD -1.07, 95% CI -14.51 to 12.37; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for dentist-reported OLT score or adverse events. Topical agents: for hinokitiol gel versus placebo gel, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.72; 1 trial, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Toothpastes: for 0.3% triclosan toothpaste versus control toothpaste, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -3.48, 95% CI -3.77 to -3.19; 1 trial, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Mouthrinse/mouthwash: for mouthwash containing chlorhexidine and zinc acetate versus placebo mouthwash, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18; 1 trial, 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Tablets: no data were reported on key outcomes for this comparison. Combination methods: for brushing plus cetylpyridium mouthwash versus brushing, the evidence was uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.24; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions for managing halitosis compared to placebo or control for the OLT and patient-reported outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of any intervention or concentration. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising the interventions and concentrations.

### Sodium fluoride (sodium fluoride 1.1%) [^39722e52]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Prolonged daily ingestion may result in various degrees of dental fluorosis in pediatric patients under age 6 years, especially if the water fluoridation exceeds 0.6 ppm, since younger pediatric patients frequently can not perform the brushing process without significant swallowing. Use in pediatric patients under age 6 years requires special supervision to prevent repeated swallowing of dental gel, which could cause dental fluorosis. Read directions carefully before using.

### Natal teeth in premature dizygotic twin girls [^70597d41]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Presence or eruption of teeth immediately at or after birth is a rarely reported phenomenon. This condition is referred to as natal teeth, neonatal teeth, congenital teeth, fetal teeth, predeciduous teeth and dentitia praecox. The most affected teeth are lower primary central incisors with the incidence of 1:2000 for natal and 1:3500 for neonatal teeth. The aetiology of this anomaly is still not clear, however, attributes have been reported in relation to congenital teeth, multiple factors and some syndromes. The management of such cases depends on clinical characteristics of natal or neonatal teeth, as well as complications that they might cause. The aim of this paper is to discuss a rare case of occurrence of two natal teeth in both premature dizygotic twin female babies with specific emphasis on the literature review related to concerns regarding prevalence, aetiology, clinical characteristics, differential diagnosis, complications and management.

Local anesthetics safety in dental pain management — cumulative dosing and benzocaine cautions: "Dosing and toxicity of injectable local anesthetics are cumulative." The discussion notes that "Sometimes 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine is administered postoperatively after administration of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine intraoperatively," and in this scenario "it is critical to consider the amount of lidocaine with epinephrine that is administered before bupivacaine to avoid the potential local anesthetics overdose." Regarding topical agents, "with respect to benzocaine, its overzealous use (typically overdose) can trigger methemoglobinemia," and "topical benzocaine is no longer approved for teething pain in children younger than 2 years in the United States."

WARNINGS:

Prolonged daily ingestion may result in various degrees of dental fluorosis in pediatric patients under age 6 years, especially if the water fluoridation exceeds 0.6 ppm, since younger pediatric patients frequently can not perform the brushing process without significant swallowing. Use in pediatric patients under age 6 years requires special supervision to prevent repeated swallowing of the dental cream, which could cause dental fluorosis. Read directions carefully before using.

 Keep out of reach of infants and children.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^16c7d953]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pacifiers have accompanied humanity for more than 3000 years, as evidenced by excavations in Italy, Cyprus, and Greece. Pacifiers are now used across the world to soothe fussy or colicky babies, reduce the pain of teething, and promote restful sleep. Widespread popularity of pacifiers is reflected in empirical evidence documenting the benefits of non-nutritive sucking, including pain management in neonates, shorter duration of hospital stays, and greater readiness for bottle feeding in preterm infants. Despite these benefits, pacifier use remains a controversial parental practice. While pacifier use is recommended for preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it has also been linked with acute otitis media and other infections, – dental malocclusion, and excessive weight gain.

In addition to the mixed health consequences, the psychological consequences of pacifier use remain poorly understood. – Niedenthal and colleaguessuggest that the diurnal use of pacifiers in infancy decreases infants' spontaneous imitation of others' facial expressions (i.e. facial mimicry) as well as their empathy and emotional intelligence at later developmental stages. However, the correlational nature of this research makes it challenging to tease apart the causes and consequences of this parental practice. For example, pacifiers could be used by caregivers with children considered more difficult (i.e. children whose negative emotions are challenging to manage). Alternatively, seeing the pacifier in an infant's mouth could reduce the extent to which adults imitate the baby's facial expressions. This behavior is involved in the development of babies' own facial mimicry and emotional competence.

In addition to infant temperament, the characteristics of parents may also play a role in pacifier adoption. For example, stressed caregivers might be more inclined to introduce pacifiers. Moreover, existing research shows associations between pacifier use and maternal anxiety and rigid breastfeeding styles. Beyond these traits, little is known about the characteristics of parents giving pacifiers to their infants. Here we recruited a large sample of British parents to examine demographic profiles of pacifier users versus non-users. Among these groups, we compared the frequency and circumstances of pacifier use and relations between the use of pacifiers and parenting stress as well as infant temperament. We also examined beliefs about pacifiers among users and non-users.

### Diagnosis and management in rubinstein-taybi syndrome: first international consensus statement [^cf4b2b1c]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Intraoral characteristics

The main non-dental oral characteristic of RTS is the narrow, highly arched palate, which may rarely show clefting of either the complete palate (sometimes submucous), the soft palate or only the uvula, which may or may not be accompanied by a cleft lip. A careful evaluation of the palate is indicated in every newborn or child with RTS (online supplemental R39). The treatment of clefting is as in the general population. Other, less frequent characteristics are a relatively large tongue, the bifid tip of the tongue, a short frenulum, and wide alveolar ridges.

Dental characteristics are almost universally present and may exist as abnormalities in tooth number (15–30%; hyperdontia, hypodontia, mesiodens), structure (23–29%; enamel hypoplasia, discolouration), eruption (5%; neonatal teeth, persistence of primary teeth, delayed eruption), position (62–64%; malocclusion, malalignment, crowded teeth, crossbite) and abnormal tooth shape including talon cusps, a diagnostic hallmark for RTS. Talon cusps are accessory cusps on the lingual side of incisors. CREBBP and EP300 are strongly expressed in both incisors and molarsand influence the formation of the secondary and (to a lesser extent) primary enamel knots, allowing, if mutated, for talon cusp formation in 27% of primary incisors and 70–92% of permanent (upper) incisors. Sealing the fissures around the talon cusps may prevent caries. Treatment is only needed if it interferes with mouth closure and occlusion or leads to marked caries (online supplemental R40).

Dental anomalies may also be secondary, that is, difficulties in maintaining adequate oral health leading to caries and periodontal disease, and also to enamel demineralisation due to gastro-oesophageal reflux. Children and adults with RTS often demonstrate also anxieties when facing dental assessments and treatments, stressing the need for early intervention. Informing parents and other caregivers of the importance of early adequate oral hygiene, and subsequent advice, is paramount. Regular dental evaluation and treatment, preferably by a dentist with experience in caring for individuals with special needs, can prevent further problems, and treatment may be aided with sedation or general anaesthesia,(online supplemental R41). Orthodontic assessments and treatments are as in the general population. However, some procedures may not be well tolerated and should be considered in close collaboration with the individual and family.

### Assessment of evidence about common infant symptoms and cow's milk allergy [^ed30a933]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Sales of specialized formula for managing cow's milk allergy (CMA) have increased, triggering concern that attribution of common infant symptoms, such as crying, vomiting, and rashes, to CMA may be leading to overdiagnosis, which could undermine breastfeeding.

Objective

To understand whether CMA guideline recommendations might promote CMA overdiagnosis or undermine breastfeeding.

Evidence Review

We reviewed recommendations made in CMA guidelines and critically appraised 2 key recommendations. First, we reviewed relevant literature summarizing whether maternal or infant dietary exclusion of cow's milk is effective for managing common infant symptoms. Second, we reviewed published data on breastmilk composition and thresholds of reactivity in CMA to estimate the probability that cow's milk protein in human breastmilk can trigger symptoms in infants with CMA. We also documented the level of commercial involvement in CMA guidelines.

Findings

We reviewed 9 CMA guidelines published from 2012 to 2019. Seven suggest considering CMA as a cause of common infant symptoms. Seven recommend strict maternal cow's milk exclusion for managing common symptoms in breastfed infants. We found CMA proven by food challenge affects approximately 1% of infants, while troublesome crying, vomiting, or rashes are each reported in 15% to 20% of infants. We found clinical trials do not provide consistent support for using maternal or infant cow's milk exclusion to manage common symptoms in infants without proven CMA. We estimated that for more than 99% infants with proven CMA, the breastmilk of a cow's milk-consuming woman contains insufficient milk allergen to trigger an allergic reaction. Three CMA guidelines were directly supported by formula manufacturers or marketing consultants, and 81% of all guideline authors reported a conflict of interest with formula manufacturers.

Conclusions and Relevance

Recommendations to manage common infant symptoms as CMA are not evidence based, especially in breastfed infants who are not directly consuming cow's milk. Such recommendations may cause harm by undermining confidence in breastfeeding.

### Timeline of amelogenesis imperfecta management [^16987cbb]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of > 100 different entities among the 7,000 rare genetic diseases identified. – Its prevalence was estimated to range from 1/700 to 1/14,000 individuals, but these figures do not reflect the diversity of AI nor the recent understanding of their genetic etiology. The average time of diagnostic wandering in rare diseases is nowadays estimated to range from 4 to 5 years. However, disorders affecting the oral cavity, such as AI, are often poorly recognized and diagnosed. AI affects enamel development, a process known as amelogenesis, in both primary and permanent dentitions or in permanent dentition only. These diseases can exist as an isolated trait, ie, with clinical manifestations limited to the oral cavity or associated with other symptoms in syndromes. Individuals with AI may experience various dental issues, including tooth and enamel dysplasia, discoloration and structure post-eruptive breakdown, dentin sensitivity, and progressive loss of occlusal vertical dimension (OVD). They may also be more susceptible to cavities, chronic gingivitis or gingival hyperplasia, and malocclusions like anterior open bite. – Other dental/jaw anomalies may include missing teeth, taurodontism, pathologic crown and root resorption, delayed tooth eruption, and transverse discrepancies in the maxillary dental arch. In addition, there is a higher tendency for impacted permanent teeth and follicular cysts, as seen in enamel renal syndrome.

Children with AI require long-term management and follow-up to improve and maintain good oral hygiene and overall oral health. Simple tasks such as brushing may be really challenging due to hypersensitivity and pain. Teeth desensitization will be a long-term achievement. Orthodontic treatment will often be necessary to address functional and esthetic concerns.

Early diagnosis, tailored therapy, and an appropriate follow-up are critical for favorable outcomes. The severity of AI, patient age, level of oral hygiene, amount and quality of the remaining tooth structure, the condition of the periodontal tissues, and orthodontic factors will influence prosthodontic treatment. The treatment must be tailored to the patient's needs. The goals of AI treatment are to enhance oral health, preserve the dental structures, restore function, and normalize the smile esthetics. Patients and parents need to be guided through this long-term course of treatment, including the adoption of coping strategies.

### Orthodontic treatment for crowded teeth in children [^629113df]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Crowded teeth develop when there is not enough space in the jaws into which the teeth can erupt. Crowding can affect baby teeth (deciduous dentititon), adult teeth (permanent dentition), or both, and is a common reason for referral to an orthodontist. Crowded teeth can affect a child's self-esteem and quality of life. Early loss of baby teeth as a result of tooth decay or trauma, can lead to crowded permanent teeth. Crowding tends to increase with age, especially in the lower jaw.

Objectives

To assess the effects of orthodontic intervention for preventing or correcting crowded teeth in children. To test the null hypothesis that there are no differences in outcomes between different orthodontic interventions for preventing or correcting crowded teeth in children.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 January 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any active interventions to prevent or correct dental crowding in children and adolescents, such as orthodontic braces or extractions, compared to no or delayed treatment, placebo treatment or another active intervention. The studies had to include at least 80% of participants aged 16 years and under.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, extracted information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, harms and results. We resolved any disagreements by liaising with a third review author. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias in the studies. We calculated mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous data. We undertook meta-analysis when studies of similar comparisons reported comparable outcome measures, using the random-effects model. We used the I 2 statistic as a measure of statistical heterogeneity.

Main Results

Our search identified 24 RCTs that included 1512 participants, 1314 of whom were included in analyses. We assessed 23 studies as being at high risk of bias and one as unclear. The studies investigated 17 comparisons. Twenty studies evaluated fixed appliances and auxiliaries (lower lingual arch, lower lip bumper, brackets, archwires, lacebacks, headgear and adjunctive vibrational appliances); two studies evaluated removable appliances and auxiliaries (Schwarz appliance, eruption guidance appliance); and two studies evaluated dental extractions (lower deciduous canines or third molars). The evidence should be interpreted cautiously as it is of very low certainty. Most interventions were evaluated by a single study. Fixed appliances and auxiliaries One study found that use of a lip bumper may reduce crowding in the early permanent dentition (MD -4.39 mm, 95% CI -5.07 to -3.71; 34 participants). One study evaluated lower lingual arch but did not measure amount of crowding. One study concluded that coaxial nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires may cause more tooth movement in the lower arch than single-stranded NiTi archwires (MD 6.77 mm, 95% CI 5.55 to 7.99; 24 participants). Another study, comparing copper NiTi versus NiTi archwires, found NiTi to be more effective for reducing crowding (MD 0.49 mm, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63, 66 participants). Single studies did not show evidence of one type of archwire being better than another for Titinol versus Nitinol; nickel-titanium versus stainless steel or multistrand stainless steel; and multistranded stainless steel versus stainless steel. Nor did single studies find evidence of a difference in amount of crowding between self-ligating and conventional brackets, active and passive self-ligating brackets, lacebacks added to fixed appliances versus fixed appliances alone, or cervical pull headgear versus minor interceptive procedures. Meta-analysis of two studies showed no evidence that adding vibrational appliances to fixed appliances reduces crowding at 8 to 10 weeks (MD 0.24 mm, 95% CI -0.81 to 1.30; 119 participants). Removable appliances and auxiliaries One study found use of the Schwarz appliance may be effective at treating dental crowding in the lower arch (MD -2.14 mm, 95% CI -2.79 to -1.49; 28 participants). Another study found an eruption guidance appliance may reduce the number of children with crowded teeth after one year of treatment (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.68; 46 participants); however, this may have been due to an increase in lower incisor proclination in the treated group. Whether these gains were maintained in the longer term was not assessed. Dental extractions One study found that extracting children's lower deciduous canines had more effect on crowding after one year than no treatment (MD -4.76 mm, 95 CI -6.24 to -3.28; 83 participants), but this was alongside a reduction in arch length. One study found that extracting wisdom teeth did not seem to reduce crowding any more than leaving them in the mouth (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.70; 77 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Most interventions were assessed by single, small studies. We found very low-certainty evidence that lip bumper, used in the mixed dentition, may be effective for preventing crowding in the early permanent dentition, and a Schwarz appliance may reduce crowding in the lower arch. We also found very low-certainty evidence that coaxial NiTi may be better at reducing crowding than single-stranded NiTi, and that NiTi may be better than copper NiTi. As the current evidence is of very low certainty, our findings may change with future research.

### The need for global safeguards for fundamental rights of children at risk of infant oral mutilation (IOM) [^9b641991]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Medium-term/long-term infant oral mutilation-associated complications

IOM has been associated with bloodborne diseases such as HIV and AIDS and up to 7%–87% of nutrition-related conditionssuch as Noma or cancrum oris. Other conditions associated with IOM include dental hypoplasia (up to 35%), trauma, malformation and dilaceration of both deciduous canines and succedaneous canines, missing permanent canines and ectopic eruption of primary and permanent canines, and unnecessary loss of the targeted primary tooth/teeth (figure 1). Additionally, collateral loss/failure to develop/defective development/malposition or transpositions of the permanent canines, midline dentition shift, development of peg-shaped permanent teeth, occlusal discrepancies, and early eruption of permanent teeth have been reported. Conditions such as dentoalveolar complications with malformed primary teeth, retention of primary teeth, development of odontoma-like structures, and displacement and impaction of permanent teeth have also been associated with IOM.

Figure 1
An illustration of a child who has lost 73 and 83 as a result of IOM practice.

Infant oral mutilation-associated fatalities

In Kenya, a study of 115 infants/children attending a hospital after undergoing IOM showed that 58.3% required urgent admission for management of IOM-related complications: dehydration and shock (47.8%), pneumonia (40.3%), meningitis (26.9%) and generalised sepsis (17.9%). The study also reported mortality in seven children (6.1%; 3 dead on arrival and 4 died on the paediatric ward). In Uganda, past hospital studies reported that children admitted for treatment after undergoing IOM had fatalities of 21% and 22%. We believe that these figures are grossly underestimated due to non-existence of a reliable reporting process for child death in most low-income countries.

### Safely soothing teething pain in infants and children… [^ad038e7a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Teething is a normal experience for infants and children, but it can be painful. Many well-meaning parents and caregivers who want to ease a child's pain might turn to products that could be harmful. Soothing children's gums with prescription or nonprescription medicines containing benzocaine or lidocaine – or homeopathic tablets and other products – might seem like good options. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration warns that these products can be dangerous to children and can lead to serious injury, and even death. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends alternative ways for treating teething pain, including rubbing infants' gums with a clean finger, or providing a teething ring made of firm rubber to chew on. On average, infants begin teething around age 4 to 7 months and have a total of 20 "baby teeth" by 3 years of age. According to the AAP, occasional symptoms of teething include mild irritability, a low-grade fever, drooling, and an urge to chew something hard.

Topical Drugs and Teething Jewelry Used for Teething Have Risks Topical medications containing benzocaine or lidocaine offer little to no benefit and are associated with serious risks when used for teething pain in children. These include creams, gels, and homeopathic teething tablets. Benzocaine, a local anesthetic, is the active ingredient in several nonprescription oral health care products, including Anbesol, Cepacol, Chloraseptic, HurriCaine, Orabase, Orajel, and Topex. These products should not be used for teething pain in children because they can be dangerous. Using benzocaine products can lead to a serious, and sometimes fatal, condition called methemoglobinemia, in which the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is greatly reduced.

What You Can Do to Ease Teething Pain If a child's gums are swollen and tender, gently rub or massage the gums with your finger, or give the child a firm teether made of rubber to chew on. Make sure the teething ring is not frozen. If the object is too hard, it can hurt the child's gums. Be sure to supervise children so they don't accidentally choke on the teething ring.

### Feed thickeners in gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants [^9ba2ba53]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the involuntary retrograde passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus with or without regurgitation. This is a common physiological, self-limiting condition in healthy infants with a prevalence peaking at 3–4 months of age, occurring more than once a day in 50% of healthy infants. As infants achieve upright posture with neurodevelopment maturation and acquire a more solid diet with age, symptoms usually improve by 6 months old with resolution by 12–14 months old. Transient inappropriate relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter and delayed gastric emptying are common mechanisms leading to GOR. This is further exaggerated in preterm infants who have shorter and immature oesophagus with non-peristaltic motility.

How is gastro-oesophageal reflux disease diagnosed?

With increasingly frequency and severity, GOR becomes pathological. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is defined as 'reflux of gastric contents causing troublesome symptoms or complications or both' by the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. Rather than distinct entities, GOR and GORD are commonly seen as a continuum and non-invasive distinction of GOR and GORD is difficult. The term 'troublesome symptoms' in infants is vague due to the non-specific and pervasive nature of GOR symptoms. The lack of gold-standard objective measures and reliance on symptom reporting by caregiver complicate the diagnostic process. Diagnosis is usually inferred when infants display frequent reflux episodes with clear association between symptoms and reflux without an alternate diagnosis.

### Non-specificity of symptoms in infantile-onset Pompe disease may delay the diagnosis and institution of treatment [^de4e07f0]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Presentation with respiratory symptoms common during infancy, absence of alarming symptoms such as hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis or encephalopathy, and relative rarity of PD can contribute to lapses in the early diagnosis of IoPD as observed in the index patients. Thus, these cases emphasise the importance of vigilant assessment of common paediatric presentations, which may be masking serious underlying pathologies.

Patient's perspective

Given below is the English translation of the narrations in Sinhala by the parents of infant B.

'We understand that this is a genetic disease, so there is no complete cure for it. But it was heart-wrenching to see our beloved child suffer. We wonder if this disease was diagnosed earlier, before it became worse, would he have had less pain and suffering. We understand that there is a chance of our next child also being affected by this disease. Although a complete cure is not possible, it is a relief to know that a treatment is available to reduce the disability. We have only one child and wish to have a few more children. Therefore, we shall bring our next baby during the first week itself for the genetic testing'.
Learning points

Common paediatric presentations should undergo vigilant assessment not to miss any underlying pathologies, especially when recurrent.
Delayed diagnosis is a major determinant of the overall outcome in infantile-onset Pompe disease.
Creatine kinase can be used as a cost-effective screening tool for Pompe disease in infants presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms associated with hypotonia.
Pompe disease should be primarily considered in infants presenting with respiratory symptoms, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy and elevated creatine kinase in the absence of hypoglycaemia.

### Impacted wisdom teeth [^9750a97b]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of impacted wisdom teeth (third molars) is high, with some 72% of Swedish people aged 20 to 30 years having at least one impacted wisdom tooth. Impacted wisdom teeth occur because of a lack of space, obstruction, or abnormal position. They can cause inflammatory dental disease manifested by pain and swelling of infected teeth and may destroy adjacent teeth and bone.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: Should asymptomatic, disease-free impacted wisdom teeth be removed prophylactically? What are the effects of different operative (surgical) techniques for removing impacted wisdom teeth? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Results

We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: prophylactic extraction, active surveillance, and different operative (surgical) techniques for extracting impacted wisdom teeth.

### Oral health care for children and youth with developmental disabilities: clinical report [^f9809a71]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Assessment and control of pain in CYDD emphasizes evaluation steps and physiologic tooth-eruption pain timelines. Oral pain can significantly impact health-related quality of life, and identifying the source, measuring the intensity, and finding relief is important though it may be difficult for CYDD; a thorough oral examination is the first step to identifying the pain's etiology because oral pain may be physiologic or pathologic. Physiologic oral pain from tooth eruption occurs as primary teeth erupt between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and pain may also occur as the adult dentition emerges from ages 6 to 13 years; rarely, eruption cysts may form over emerging teeth and may develop into hematomas, most resolve on their own but some may need surgical intervention by a dentist.

### Premastication-review of an infant feeding practice and its potential impact on allergy and microbiome development [^d06a460d]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Reasons for Practicing Premastication

One reason for premastication is mechanical in nature, bridging the mismatch between child (teeth) development and growing nutritional needs. As a whole, the development of the "mastication apparatus", including the bones (maxilla and mandible), muscles (including tongue control) as well as teeth/teeth eruption (the central incisors erupt between 8 and 12 months of age; the lateral incisors erupt between 9 and 18 months) and soft tissue, influence the ability to chew and the stage of the chewing patterns. Mastication kinematics over time show that "at 4–6 months of age, jaw movements are simple elevations, assisted by actions of the lips and tongue. The next stage in the development of chewing is marked by the emergence of lateral jaw motion to finally reach a rotary jaw movement, which is the sign of mature mastication at the age of 24–30 months." In accordance to this, Pelto et al. argue that premastication was an important mechanism to bridge the gap between the halting of breastfeeding and the development of teeth ‐ and correspondingly of mature chewing patterns in infants. The authors argue that it allowed infants to consume a great variety of nutrients that they would otherwise not be able to eat due to the delayed tooth development in humans compared to other mammals, thereby preventing malnutrition and giving humans an evolutionary advantage. In a survey on the topic, Pelto et al. further describe that "the most frequently premasticated food was meat (authors' note: providing an iron supply), followed by rice, other grains, other 'tough foods' and nuts." Additionally, the act of chewing adds saliva to food, which acts as a lubricant for the digestive tract, but is also important in adding amylases to foods which aids digestion and nutrient absorption. Further reasons for premastication include allowing the uptake of food that is otherwise too hot or too dry or poses a choking hazard for infants (Figure 3).

### Which symptoms are actually associated with teething?… [^f6a4135b]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Parents and physicians have debated for years about whether there are symptoms associated with tooth eruption. Macknin and colleagues conducted a prospective study to determine if there are symptoms associated with tooth eruption and, if so, which ones could reliably predict such eruption in infants. Families were recruited at an infant's four-month-old well-child check if at least one parent worked at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Although about 500 families were eligible, parents were told that completion of the study would be difficult. Consequently, only 125 families enrolled. Each family was asked to check an aural temperature twice daily and complete a daily questionnaire about 18 symptoms. A teething period was defined as the period from four days before to three days after a tooth eruption. The study lasted eight months. Of the 125 families, results from only 111 were available for analysis.

At enrollment, the infants were between three and 5. 6 months of age. Data were available for a median of 212 days per child. Eighty-nine children experienced 475 tooth eruptions during the study period; in 22 children, no teeth erupted. No one symptom occurred in more than 35 percent of children who had a tooth eruption, although a number of symptoms were significantly associated with the eruptions. The symptoms that were significantly related to eruption were drooling, gum-rubbing, irritability, decreased appetite for solids and a temperature higher than mean plus one standard deviation. Tooth eruption was not associated with infection, diarrhea, cough or temperatures higher than 38. 9°C.

The authors conclude that tooth eruption in infants is not associated with severe symptoms and that severe symptoms should not be attributed to teething.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: best care practice guidelines [^b4faaa2b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Topical treatments

Oral ulceration, blistering and mucositis are the most frequent gastrointestinal complications in patients with EB. While oral ulceration can occur in all types of EB, it is most common and problematic in patients with the severe types of this disease. Oral ulceration can be extremely painful and lead to difficulties in feeding and maintaining dental hygiene. Apart from oral analgesics, topical preparations are available. Sucralfate suspension has been used to prevent and manage oral blisters in five children, 6- to 11-years-old, with RDEB when applied four times a day for six months. The number of blisters reduced within three weeks and pain reduced within one week (see Box 5).

Polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel (Gelclair®) either used as a mouth rinse or applied directly to a mouth lesion in children, has been used anecdotally in EB. Secondary evidence comes from two recent reviews which showed that Gelclair® may be useful as an adjunctive therapy in decreasing the painful lesions of oral mucositis in cancer patients. Chlorhexidine gluconate and benzydamine hydrochloride mouth spray is used regularly in EB patients at the London centers with reported benefit but has not been evaluated systematically. Secondary evidence for the potential efficacy of this intervention exists for treating the pain of acute viral pharyngitis in adults.

Gastroesophageal reflux

Patients with EB are at high risk for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - especially infants with generalized EBS, JEB and patients with severe generalized RDEB who can develop esophagitis. While children with GERD may not complain of dyspeptic symptoms until they are older, crying and sleep disturbance are commonly associated with this symptom. Management is guided by standard treatment in non-EB patients, and may involve treating the reflux with antacids, histamine H 2 -blockers and proton pump inhibitors and, rarely, surgery, (see Box 5).

### Current practices in monitoring children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia: a global survey of expert experience [^703f9434]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview of XLH and Dental Monitoring

Dental complications are commonly seen in XLH and include spontaneous dental infections (abscesses, pulp necrosis, tooth loss, and, less frequently maxillofacial cellulitis) and, in adults, frequent periodontal disease. These infections are a direct consequence of the impaired mineralization of dental and periodontal tissues. Dental complications negatively affect the patient's QoL.

Current Monitoring Tools for Dental Complications

Clinical assessment

A history of dental infections in patients with XLH should be recorded at all clinic visits as well as a review of the patient's preventative dental hygiene including avoiding culprit drinks, method and frequency of tooth brushing and flossing, and type of toothpaste. At the time of diagnosis, a baseline dental examination should be performed by a dentist on all patients (above 1 year of age in children). During patient follow-up, dental visits should be performed at least annually or biannually, or more frequently if necessary, depending on the severity of dental manifestations.

Radiological assessment

At the time of diagnosis, a dental orthopantomogram (radiograph of the upper and lower jaw and teeth) should be performed in all patients above 6 years old in order to obtain a global view of the patient's dentition and to detect any periapical bone infection. This exam should be repeated based on individual needs during follow-up.

### Caregiver-reported presentation of severe food-induced allergic reactions in infants and toddlers [^b22dc3b1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recognizing anaphylaxis in infants and toddlers can be challenging for health care providers and caregivers, and current diagnostic criteria and anaphylaxis action plans do not specifically address this younger population.

Objective

To describe symptoms and signs observed by primary caregivers of infants and toddlers during severe food-induced allergic reactions.

Methods

We conducted a national online survey among primary caregivers of children who experienced a severe food-induced allergic reaction when less than 36 months of age. Respondents who were present during the child's most severe reaction were asked to report symptoms and signs observed. The survey asked about infant- and toddler-specific symptoms and signs in lay language for caregivers. Data were compared with patient-reported data from past studies to identify distinct patterns among the younger population.

Results

The survey was completed for 374 children (193 infants, 181 toddlers). The most common symptoms and signs reported were skin reactions (90%), facial and extremity swelling (59%), gastrointestinal issues (51%), and coughing/wheezing (45%). Infants (aged < 12 months) more frequently experienced skin reactions, skin mottling, and ear pulling/scratching or putting fingers in ears, as compared with toddlers (aged 12–35 months). Toddlers experienced throat itching and coughing/wheezing more frequently than infants.

Conclusions

Anaphylaxis presentation demonstrates similarities and differences in infants and toddlers. Modifying the terminology used in the current criteria allowed for reporting of symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis that are more common in infants and toddlers. Diagnostic criteria, clinical guidelines, and anaphylaxis action plans may be enhanced to address this young, often nonverbal, population.

### Excessive infant crying: definitions determine risk groups [^b7c56a65]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

We assessed risk groups for excessive infant crying using 10 published definitions, in 3179 children aged 1–6 months (response: 96.5%). Risk groups regarding parental employment, living area, lifestyle, and obstetric history varied by definition. This may explain the existence of conflicting evidence on the occurrence and cause of excessive crying.

### Evaluation and management of apparent life-threatening events in children [^793069b9]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Apparent life-threatening event syndrome predominantly affects children younger than one year. This syndrome is characterized by a frightening constellation of symptoms in which the child exhibits some combination of apnea, change in color, change in muscle tone, coughing, or gagging. Approximately 50 percent of these children are diagnosed with an underlying condition that explains the apparent life-threatening event. Commonly, the problems are digestive (up to 50 percent), neurologic (30 percent), respiratory (20 percent), cardiac (5 percent), and endocrine or metabolic (less than 5 percent). Fifty percent of these events are idiopathic, which causes great concern to parents and physicians. The evaluation of an affected infant involves a thorough description of the event as well as prenatal, birth, medical, social, and family history. The physical examination, including careful neurologic examination and notation of any apparent anatomic abnormalities, helps diagnose congenital problems, infection, and conditions contributing to respiratory compromise. The laboratory evaluation is driven by historical and physical findings. Inpatient evaluation and monitoring are recommended in virtually all cases unless investigations are normal. Should the history reflect a severe episode, or should the child require major interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, inpatient observation and monitoring are recommended, even if physical examination and laboratory findings are normal. Once a presumptive diagnosis is made, events should cease after appropriate intervention. If not, reviewing the history, performing another physical examination, and reassessing the need for laboratory and imaging studies are the next steps. Although consensus statements by the National Institutes of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics support home monitoring, the relationship of apparent life-threatening event syndrome to sudden infant death syndrome is controversial.

### Correlation of cleft type with incidence of perioperative respiratory complications in infants with cleft lip and palate [^c2258a1f]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A retrospective survey of 339 infants who had undergone primary plastic surgery for cleft lip and palate was performed to evaluate the concomitant preoperative assessment based on severity grading of the common cold and the correlation of cleft type with the incidence of perioperative respiratory complications.

Methods

We assessed the severity of common cold symptoms in the preoperative period using the Common Cold Score, which comprises 10 symptoms and findings. We then determined the association of the incidence of perioperative respiratory complications with the increasing severity of common cold symptoms and also compared the complication incidence in the three cleft types in healthy infants without a common cold.

Results

The incidence of perioperative respiratory complications was greater in the group with a suspected presence of a common cold. Infants with severer cleft, who had bilateral cleft lip and palate, even without common cold symptoms, had a significantly higher incidence of perioperative respiratory complications (8.9%) than infants with simple cleft lip (1.7%, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Clinicians should consider postponing primary plastic surgery for cleft lip and palate in infants with a suspected presence of a common cold. Our results also suggest that the presence of a wide cleft is a risk factor for causing perioperative respiratory complications in infants with cleft lip and palate. We believe that a careful preoperative assessment of common cold symptoms in these infants can decrease the incidence of perioperative respiratory complications.

### Natal teeth: a potential impediment to nasoalveolar molding in infants with cleft lip and palate [^3933d34d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to describe two cases of bilateral cleft lip and palate with natal/neonatal teeth. Clinical features, prevalence, possible complications, and treatment modalities are discussed. Two patients with cleft lip and palate and natal/neonatal teeth are described. The first patient was a 4-week-old infant with bilateral cleft lip and palate. On initial inspection an odontogenic vestige was noticed on the right lateral border of the premaxillary segment, bordering the cleft. The second patient was a newborn with a vestige on the right side of the premaxilla. At 20 days, another swelling representing a neonatal tooth on the left side was found. Because the teeth interfered with the fabrication and application of the nasoalveolar molding (NAM) appliance, they were removed from both patients. In the first patient, at 1 week after extraction, the NAM device was placed without difficulty. At 8 months, the infant had adapted well to the NAM device and nursed without problems. The second patient did not follow-up for the placement of the NAM device. In patients with cleft lip and palate with natal/neonatal teeth who require NAM, the tooth must be removed to facilitate the fabrication and placement of the device. Natal/neonatal teeth must be extracted with caution because the tooth buds of neighboring teeth may be damaged and remnants of the dental papillae may be left behind. Although general anesthesia is not always indicated for the removal of these teeth, in cases in which the premaxilla is loose, such as the current cases, general anesthesia is warranted.

### Apparent life-threatening event: a review [^23269437]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

An "apparent life-threatening event" (ALTE) refers to an episode that is of concern to the caregiver and is associated with a combination of apnea, color change, change in tone, choking, or gagging. Although the natural history of ALTE is most often benign, there is a risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality. The provider must stabilize the infant as needed, obtain key history, identify and address any underlying causes, educate the caregivers, and provide a safe disposition. This article summarizes the body of literature concerning ALTE, with specific attention to the diagnosis and management of these cases.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^6cc22d33]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Infant/toddler anaphylaxis — symptom presentation: Recommendation 11 (CBS) states, We suggest clinicians be aware that parents of infants and toddlers may report age-specific symptoms that are less often reported by older children and adults, with Strength of Recommendation: Conditional and Certainty of Evidence: Very Low. Supporting observations note that infants and young children more often have skin symptoms as compared with older children whereas infants less often have respiratory symptoms, that parents reported skin symptoms and subtle behavioral signs more frequently in children aged below 12 months as compared with older toddlers, and that infant behavioral manifestations may include withdrawal, inconsolable crying, irritability, or whining.

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^a376777c]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Pain assessment approach and behaviors in nonverbal children with SNI emphasize observation-based tools. The goals of pain assessment are to identify the presence of pain and to track the response to interventions for pain, and pain-assessment tools have been developed for use in children with SNI who cannot communicate their pain experience. The observation of pain behaviors is considered a valid approach to pain assessment in those unable to self-report, with examples from Table 3 including Vocalizations (Crying, whimpering, moaning, gasping, sharp intake of breath) and Facial expression (Grimacing, frowning, furrowed brow, squinting, eyes wide open, clenched teeth, teeth grinding, distressed look).
