## Question

How frequently should the RSV vaccine be administered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often the RSV vaccine should be administered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which populations and product types we are talking about. Then, I should verify labeled dosing for each specific product and align that with ACIP and ACOG recommendations. Next, I need to check seasonal timing nuances and special circumstances like cardiopulmonary bypass that can change the number of doses. Finally, I will synthesize frequencies by population, explicitly distinguishing active vaccination from passive monoclonal antibody prophylaxis and noting any areas where evidence or guidance is still evolving.

> Let me first confirm the population-product framework, because if I mix "vaccine" with "monoclonal antibody", I could misstate frequency. Older adults receive active RSV vaccines, pregnant individuals receive active maternal RSV vaccination, and infants and young children receive passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies, not vaccines, which is the key determinant of administration frequency [^113u1Hg4] [^115wnmhF] [^113uYoLe] [^116Du5DQ] [^116amhoG] [^116amhoG].

> I will now examine the available products and their mechanisms because the mechanism drives how often they must be given. Active vaccines like adjuvanted recombinant RSV vaccines for adults are single-dose schedules by label and recommendation, maternal RSV vaccination is also a single dose in late pregnancy, and monoclonal antibodies for infants include nirsevimab, which is long-acting and given as a single dose per season, and palivizumab, which is shorter-acting and requires monthly dosing through the season [^1127x1zq] [^1153FpBU] [^115Tkz9s] [^11155iDL] [^116sJhBG].

> Next, I should review adult recommendations to pin down frequency. For adults aged 60 years and older, ACIP recommends a single dose of an RSV vaccine under shared clinical decision-making, and updated 2024 guidance clarifies strong recommendations for those ≥ 75 years and for 60–74 years with risk factors; there is no recommended revaccination schedule at this time and postmarketing data will inform any future boosters. Let me correct that: there is insufficient evidence to determine the need for revaccination at this time, and clinicians should give one dose and await further guidance [^113u1Hg4] [^113uYoLe] [^115wnmhF].

> Hold on, I should verify labeling for younger high-risk adults, because practice and policy can diverge. FDA labeling includes a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose for certain high-risk adults aged 18–59 years, but ACIP population-level recommendations currently focus on adults ≥ 60 years, with prioritization for ≥ 75 years and 60–74 years with risk factors, so clinicians should align with both FDA labeling and ACIP guidance in their jurisdiction; either way, the frequency remains a single dose at this time [^116WLHrZ] [^114m57yf] [^115wnmhF].

> Let me consider maternal vaccination next, because timing in gestation also affects frequency. Maternal RSV vaccination is a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose given at 32–36 weeks' gestation, typically during the RSV season, with the intent of passive antibody transfer to protect the infant; this is one dose per pregnancy, not a series across the season, and shared decision-making should account for seasonality and local circulation patterns when scheduling [^116Du5DQ] [^115Tkz9s] [^116Du5DQ].

> I need to check infant passive prophylaxis with nirsevimab, the newer long-acting monoclonal antibody, because this is where "one dose per season" is often misunderstood. For infants in their first RSV season, nirsevimab is administered as a single intramuscular dose using weight-based dosing; for children 8–19 months at increased risk entering a second season, a single 200 mg intramuscular dose is recommended, and ACIP notes some AI/AN communities for whom second-season use is also recommended; if cardiopulmonary bypass occurs within 90 days of a dose, an additional dose is advised to restore protective serum levels [^116amhoG] [^113yQUKN] [^11155iDL].

> But wait, I should contrast this with palivizumab, the legacy short-acting monoclonal antibody for select high-risk infants, because its frequency is very different. Palivizumab is dosed at 15 mg/kg intramuscularly every month throughout the RSV season, typically totaling five monthly doses, beginning just before the season; if a child undergoes cardiopulmonary bypass, an additional dose should be given as soon as possible afterward, and monthly dosing continues on schedule for the remainder of the season [^111eW3Ek] [^116sJhBG] [^112fQVQZ].

> I should double-check seasonal timing and geographic variability, since "how often" sometimes implicitly asks "when". For nirsevimab, ACIP advises administration shortly before the RSV season, generally October through March in most of the continental U.S., with flexibility to adjust to local epidemiology; infants born during the season should receive nirsevimab within the first week of life, and seasonality can differ in Alaska and tropical jurisdictions, warranting local adjustments; adult vaccination is ideally given before the onset of seasonal circulation but can be offered when vaccine becomes available or as opportunities arise [^116amhoG] [^113yQUKN] [^113u1Hg4] [^112QjXHz].

> Hold on, I should verify special circumstances that can modify dose counts so I don't miss exceptions. After cardiopulmonary bypass, an extra dose of nirsevimab or palivizumab is recommended to re-establish protective levels if the surgery occurred within approximately 90 days of administration; infants with prolonged birth hospitalization should receive nirsevimab shortly before or promptly after discharge; nirsevimab is not recommended solely for prevention of hospital-acquired RSV, so inpatient timing should be individualized to balance risk and access [^11155iDL] [^116amhoG] [^111eW3Ek].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Adults receive one vaccine dose with no booster schedule yet, maternal immunization is one dose per pregnancy at 32–36 weeks, infants receive a monoclonal antibody rather than a vaccine, with nirsevimab given as one dose per RSV season and palivizumab, when used for eligible high-risk children, requiring monthly dosing across the season, typically five doses; critically, the term "RSV vaccine" should be reserved for active adult or maternal immunization, whereas infant products are antibodies with very different dosing frequencies, and local seasonality plus special surgical situations can necessitate additional dosing only in defined scenarios [^113u1Hg4] [^115wnmhF] [^116Du5DQ] [^115Tkz9s] [^116amhoG] [^113yQUKN] [^11155iDL] [^111eW3Ek] [^116sJhBG].

---

RSV vaccination is given as a **single dose** for each target group, timed to maximize protection during the RSV season. In older adults, administer one dose before the season, with **no routine revaccination** at this time [^115wnmhF] [^113u1Hg4]. In pregnant individuals, give one dose at **32–36 weeks' gestation** [^116Du5DQ] [^115Tkz9s], ideally September–January, to protect infants through age 6 months [^116Du5DQ]. In infants and young children, give a single dose of nirsevimab before the first RSV season [^113yQUKN]; a second dose is reserved for high-risk children entering a second season [^11155iDL]. Palivizumab is reserved for select high-risk infants and is administered monthly [^111eW3Ek] during the RSV season.

## Current recommendations for RSV vaccination frequency

### Older adults (≥ 60 years)

For older adults (≥ 60 years), the **recommendation** is one dose of an approved RSV vaccine [^1127x1zq] for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease (e.g. chronic medical conditions, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or nursing home residents) [^115wnmhF]. For **revaccination**, there is no current recommendation for routine revaccination; the need will be determined as more data become available [^113u1Hg4].

---

### Pregnant individuals

For pregnant individuals, the **recommendation** is one dose of an approved RSV vaccine at 32–36 weeks of gestation [^116Du5DQ] [^115Tkz9s], ideally administered seasonally (e.g. September–January in most of the continental US) to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants through age 6 months [^113izciN]. For **revaccination**, there is no current recommendation in subsequent pregnancies; each pregnancy is considered independently, and vaccination is recommended if it occurs during the RSV season.

---

### Infants and young children

For infants and young children, a single dose of **Nirsevimab (Beyfortus)** is recommended for neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season [^113yQUKN]. For children up to 24 months who remain at increased risk for severe RSV disease, a second dose is recommended for their second RSV season [^11155iDL]. For **Palivizumab (Synagis)**, monthly injections (15 mg/kg) [^111eW3Ek] are recommended for high-risk infants and young children throughout the RSV season, typically from November to April in the northern hemisphere [^112fQVQZ].

---

## Duration of immunity and need for booster doses

- **Older adults**: Clinical trials have demonstrated sustained immunity for at least one RSV season (approximately 6–12 months) following a single dose [^116k7oZp]. The need for booster doses in subsequent seasons is currently under evaluation [^113u1Hg4].

- **Pregnant individuals**: Maternal vaccination provides passive immunity to infants, protecting them through the first 6 months of life [^113izciN]. No booster doses are currently recommended for mothers or infants.

- **Infants and young children**: Nirsevimab provides protection for a single RSV season [^116amhoG]. Palivizumab requires monthly dosing throughout the RSV season due to its shorter duration of protection [^111eW3Ek].

---

## Factors influencing vaccination frequency

- **Age and health status**: Older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions or immunocompromise [^115wnmhF] may require more frequent vaccination or booster doses as more data become available [^113u1Hg4].

- **Geographic location and seasonality**: RSV seasonality varies geographically [^112QjXHz], influencing the timing and frequency of vaccination. Local epidemiology and surveillance data guide vaccination schedules [^116amhoG].

- **Vaccine type and formulation**: Different vaccines have varying durations of immunity, influencing the need for booster doses or repeated administration.

## Summary of RSV vaccination frequency recommendations

| **Population** | **Vaccine** | **Frequency** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Older adults (≥ 60 years) | RSV vaccine | Single dose [^115wnmhF] | Before RSV season |
| Pregnant individuals | RSV vaccine | Single dose | 32–36 weeks gestation [^116Du5DQ] |
| Infants (first RSV season) | Nirsevimab [^113yQUKN] | Single dose | Before RSV season |
| High-risk infants (second RSV season) | Nirsevimab | Single dose | Before RSV season [^11155iDL] |
| High-risk infants | Palivizumab | Monthly doses [^111eW3Ek] | Throughout RSV season |

---

## Conclusion and future considerations

RSV vaccination is currently recommended as a **single dose** for older adults [^115wnmhF], pregnant individuals [^116Du5DQ], and infants [^113yQUKN], with timing based on RSV seasonality. Palivizumab remains the only intervention requiring monthly administration for high-risk infants [^111eW3Ek]. The need for booster doses or revaccination in subsequent seasons is under evaluation [^113u1Hg4]; future recommendations will depend on emerging data regarding vaccine efficacy, duration of immunity, and RSV epidemiology.

Infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and are entering their second RSV season are recommended to receive nirsevimab. Replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab is expected to be cost-saving, and ACIP recommends nirsevimab for eligible children entering their second RSV season, similar to groups of children recommended by AAP for palivizumab during their second RSV season.

Research suggests that some American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) children experience high rates of severe RSV disease. A recent study found that the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization among some AI/AN children aged 12–23 months was four to ten times that of similar-aged children across seven sites in the United States. These studies have been limited to specific populations and might not be broadly representative of risk in all AI/AN children. Some AI/AN communities live in remote regions, making transportation of children with severe RSV more challenging. Given the available evidence, ACIP also recommends nirsevimab for AI/AN children entering their second RSV season.

- **Precautions and contraindications**: When administering nirsevimab to children with an increased risk for bleeding, providers should follow ACIP's general best practice guidelines for immunization. Nirsevimab is contraindicated in persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) following a previous dose.

### Beyfortus [^11155iDL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage**:

	**First RSV season for neonates and infants**: For neonates and infants born during the RSV season, administer Beyfortus starting from birth. For those born outside the RSV season, administer Beyfortus once prior to the start of the RSV season, considering the duration of protection provided by Beyfortus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The recommended dosage of Beyfortus for neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season is based on body weight (see Table 1) and is administered as a single intramuscular (IM) injection.

	**Second RSV season for children who remain at increased risk for severe RSV disease**: For children up to 24 months of age, regardless of body weight, who remain at increased risk for severe RSV disease in their second RSV season, refer to Table 2 below for the recommended dosage.

	**First and second RSV season for children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass**: For children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, an additional dose of Beyfortus is recommended as soon as the child is stable after surgery to ensure adequate nirsevimab-alip serum levels. The recommended dosage of Beyfortus is administered as an IM injection.

	- **First RSV season**: If surgery is within 90 days after receiving Beyfortus, the additional dose should be based on body weight at the time of the additional dose. Refer to Table 1 for weight-based dosing. If more than 90 days have elapsed since receiving Beyfortus, the additional dose should be 50 mg regardless of body weight.

	- **Second RSV season**: If surgery is within 90 days after receiving Beyfortus, follow the same guidelines as the first season for dosage adjustments.

### Maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^116Du5DQ]. ACOG (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, specifically with respect to maternal immunization, the ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend offering a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine to pregnant individuals at 32–36 weeks of gestation. This seasonal administration is suggested for September-January in most of the continental U.S. to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants up to the age of six months.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113u1Hg4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

RSV vaccination is currently approved and recommended for administration as a single dose; sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to determine the need for revaccination. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the RSV season; however, typical RSV seasonality was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to prepandemic patterns. For the 2023–24 season, clinicians should offer RSV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making as early as vaccine supply becomes available and should continue to offer vaccination to eligible adults who remain unvaccinated.

- **Vaccine administration, including coadministration with other vaccines**: Coadministration of RSV vaccines with other adult vaccines during the same visit is acceptable. Available data on the immunogenicity of coadministration of RSV vaccines and other vaccines are currently limited. Coadministration of RSV and seasonal influenza vaccines met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity, with the exception of the FluA/Darwin H3N2 strain when the GSK RSV vaccine was coadministered with adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. RSV and influenza antibody titers were somewhat lower with coadministration; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Administering the RSV vaccine with one or more other vaccines at the same visit might increase local or systemic reactogenicity. Data are only available for coadministration of RSV and influenza vaccines, and evidence is mixed regarding increased reactogenicity.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years: Updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, 2024 [^115wnmhF]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, specifically with respect to immunization in adults, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend offering a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine to all adults aged ≥ 75 years. Additionally, this recommendation applies to adults aged 60–74 years who are at an increased risk for severe RSV disease, such as those with certain chronic medical conditions, with moderate or severe immunocompromise, and persons living in nursing homes.

### Synagis [^111eW3Ek]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The recommended dose of Synagis is 15 mg per kg of body weight, administered monthly by intramuscular injection. The first dose should be given prior to the commencement of the RSV season, with the remaining doses administered monthly throughout the RSV season. Children who develop an RSV infection should continue to receive monthly doses during the RSV season. In the northern hemisphere, the RSV season typically begins in November and lasts through April, although it may start earlier or persist later in certain communities.

Synagis serum levels decrease after cardio-pulmonary bypass [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Children undergoing this procedure should receive an additional dose of Synagis as soon as possible afterward, even if it is sooner than a month from the previous dose. Subsequent doses should continue to be administered monthly as scheduled.

The efficacy of Synagis at doses less than 15 mg per kg or with dosing less frequently than monthly during the RSV season has not been established.

### Use of nirsevimab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease among infants and young children: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^116amhoG]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Clinical guidance: Providers should administer nirsevimab to infants aged less than 8 months and to infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, beginning shortly before the start of the RSV season. Based on pre–COVID-19 pandemic patterns, nirsevimab could be administered in most of the continental United States from October through the end of March. Infants born shortly before or during the RSV season should receive nirsevimab within one week of birth. Nirsevimab administration can occur during the birth hospitalization or in the outpatient setting. Optimal timing for nirsevimab administration is shortly before the RSV season begins; however, nirsevimab may be administered to age-eligible infants and children who have not yet received a dose at any time during the season. Only a single dose of nirsevimab is recommended for an RSV season. Infants with prolonged birth hospitalizations related to prematurity or other causes should receive nirsevimab shortly before or promptly after hospital discharge. No evidence is available to support the use of nirsevimab for prevention of hospital-acquired RSV infection, and nirsevimab is not recommended for this indication.

Because the timing of the onset, peak, and decline of RSV activity might vary geographically, providers can adjust administration schedules based on local epidemiology. RSV seasonality in tropical climates (including southern Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands) might differ from that of other regions in the United States.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVPreF3) candidate vaccine in older adults: Phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial [^115yhEiu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In parts A and B, the exposed set (ES) was used for safety and demographic analyses, while the per-protocol set (PPS) was used for primary immunogenicity analyses. Since more than 10% of participants in part B were excluded from the PPS due to protocol deviations, vaccine immunogenicity was also analyzed on the ES for day 91, month 8, and month 14. Missing or invalid data were not considered. See further details on study sample size determination and ES- and PPS-based analyses in the Supplementary Information.

- **Categorical demographic variables**: Computed using frequencies (number/percentage). Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, range) were calculated for continuous variables. Frequency of adverse events (AEs) was reported with numbers, percentages, and 95% confidence interval, per vaccine dose and overall. Humoral immune responses were evaluated as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs; for RSVPreF3-specific IgG) and geometric mean titers (GMTs; for nAb) of RSV-specific antibodies.

- **Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses**: Evaluated by descriptive statistics (median with minimum and maximum [min, max]) at each designated timepoint: geometric mean frequency (GMF) of RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and geometric mean ratio (GMR) of frequency of RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T cells, at each postvaccination timepoint over prevaccination.

- **Statistical comparisons**: Conducted between groups in part B in terms of RSV-A nAb and CD4+ T-cell responses. For more details, refer to the Supplementary Information.

### Recommendations for the prevention of RSV disease in infants and children: Policy statement [^116mzcmK]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, specifically in the context of immunization for infants and children, the AAP 2025 guidelines recommend offering RSV immunization for:

- **Infants under 8 months of age**: Born during or entering their first RSV season if the pregnant parent did not receive the RSV vaccine during pregnancy, the vaccination status of the pregnant parent is unknown, or the infant was born less than 14 days after the pregnant parent's vaccination.

- **Infants and children aged 8 through 19 months**: At high risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season, regardless of the vaccination status of the pregnant parent or the child's prior receipt of nirsevimab or clesrovimab when under 8 months of age in their first RSV season.

### Lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus: current management and new therapeutics [^116wwwXB]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age. Evidence-based management guidelines suggest that there is no effective treatment for RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and that supportive care, i.e. hydration and oxygenation, remains the cornerstone of clinical management. However, RSV treatments developed in the past decade include 10 vaccines and 11 therapeutic agents in active clinical trials. Maternal vaccination is particularly relevant because the most severe disease occurs within the first 6 months of life when children are unlikely to benefit from active immunisation.

We must optimise the implementation of novel RSV therapeutics by understanding the target populations, ensuring safety, and striving for acceptable pricing in the context of this worldwide health problem. In this review, we outline the limitations of RSV LRTI management, the drugs in development, and the remaining challenges related to study design, regulatory approval, and implementation.

### Disagreement FDA and EMA on RSV maternal vaccination: Possible consequence for global mortality [^114vC5UV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration have recently approved a maternal vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus. The US Food and Drug Administration limits vaccination to later in pregnancy. Mathematical modeling demonstrates that this vaccination window may reduce the global mortality impact of the vaccine by 12%. Policymakers should carefully consider vaccine risks and benefits to safeguard vulnerable infants effectively.

### Summer 2023 ACIP update: RSV prevention and updated recommendations on other vaccines [^115PV3N1]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that provides advice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, normally meets three times per year to develop US vaccine recommendations. The ACIP met June 21–23, 2023, to discuss respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, influenza vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, and COVID-19 vaccines. The ACIP also held a special meeting on August 3, 2023, to discuss RSV prophylaxis in infants. This update summarizes the proceedings of these meetings that are most relevant to the pediatric population. Major updates for pediatric clinicians include a new recommendation for the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab for prevention of RSV disease in all infants, recommendations regarding use of the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and discussion of potential forthcoming changes to meningococcal and COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^112fQVQZ]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of palivizumab prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first published in a policy statement in 1998. AAP recommendations have been updated periodically to reflect the most recent literature regarding children at greatest risk of severe RSV disease. Since the last update in 2014, which refined prophylaxis guidance to focus on those children at greatest risk, data have become available regarding the seasonality of RSV circulation, the incidence and risk factors associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations, and the potential effects of the implementation of prophylaxis recommendations on hospitalization rates of children with RSV infection.

This technical report summarizes the literature review by the Committee on Infectious Diseases, supporting the reaffirmation of the 2014 AAP policy statement on palivizumab prophylaxis among infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for RSV infection. Review of publications since 2014 did not support a change in recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis and continues to endorse the guidance provided in the 2021 Red Book.

### Immunological lessons from respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development [^116ubscz]. Immunity (2019). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has eluded active vaccination efforts for more than five decades and continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in infants, the immunocompromised, and older adults. Although newer approaches of passive antibody-mediated protection show promise, vaccines aimed at eliciting fusion protein (F)-targeting antibodies have repeatedly failed to meet pre-established, modest-efficacy goals.

Newer candidates, including protein-based vaccines, live-attenuated viruses, and gene-based delivery platforms, incorporate structurally defined and stabilized versions of the prefusion form of the F glycoprotein and are advancing rapidly into critical efficacy studies in susceptible target populations. This review discusses the storied history of RSV vaccine development, immunological lessons learned along the way, and critical findings about protein structure that remodeled our understanding of protective immunity to this important pathogen.

### Reduced-dose schedule of prophylaxis based on local data provides near-optimal protection against respiratory syncytial virus [^116f65Br]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections among young children and can lead to severe disease among some infants. Infants at high risk for severe RSV infection receive monthly injections of a prophylactic monoclonal antibody during the RSV season based on national guidelines. We considered whether a reduced-dose schedule tailored to the local RSV season in the continental United States would provide adequate protection.

- **Methods**: Hospitalization data for 1,942 counties across 38 states from 1997 to 2009 were obtained from the State Inpatient Databases (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). We assessed the timing of RSV epidemics at the county and state levels using a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian change point model. A simple summation approach was used to estimate the fraction of RSV cases occurring during the window of protection provided by initiating RSV prophylaxis during different weeks of the year.

- **Results**: The timing of RSV epidemic onset varied significantly at the local level. Nevertheless, the national recommendations for initiation of prophylaxis provided near-optimal coverage of the RSV season in most of the continental United States. Reducing from five to four monthly doses (with a later initiation) provides near-optimal coverage (< 5% decrease in coverage) in most settings. Earlier optimal dates for initiating four doses of prophylaxis were associated with being farther south and east, higher population density, and having a higher percentage of the population that was Black or Hispanic.

- **Conclusions**: A 4-dose schedule…

### Immunogenicity and safety of 3 formulations of a respiratory syncytial virus candidate vaccine in nonpregnant women: A phase 2, randomized trial [^11557q5P]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a member of the Pneumoviridae family, is a highly contagious human pathogen. RSV causes respiratory tract infections in all age groups, with hospitalizations primarily reported in infants and the elderly, representing a major global health and economic burden. Most children have been infected with RSV by the age of 2 years, with severe lower respiratory tract illness being most common in infants under 6 months of age.

Although a monoclonal antibody (palivizumab [Synagis], MedImmune) is indicated for the prevention of severe RSV lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in high-risk infants, no vaccine is available, and treatment of RSV disease remains largely symptomatic. The development of an RSV vaccine for neonates and infants has been challenging, mainly because natural infection does not induce sterile immunity, and RSV is able to temporarily evade innate immune responses.

### SPL drug information for respiratory syncytial virus protein vaccine (recombinant) [^1153FpBU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of the respiratory syncytial virus protein vaccine (recombinant) for intramuscular (IM) injection to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in adults, specifically patients aged 60 and above with lower respiratory tract disease, is 0.5 mL IM administered once.

### Expert consensus on palivizumab use for respiratory syncytial virus in developed countries [^1113ofNH]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of hospitalisation in early childhood, and palivizumab is the only licensed intervention for prevention. Palivizumab guidelines should reflect the latest evidence, in addition to cost-effectiveness and healthcare budgetary considerations. RSV experts from Europe, Canada, and Israel undertook a systematic review of the evidence over the last five years and developed recommendations regarding prophylaxis in industrialised countries. Almost 400 publications were reviewed.

This group recommended palivizumab for:

- **Preterm infants**: Less than 29 and less than or equal to 31 weeks gestational age (wGA) and less than or equal to 9 and 6 months of age, respectively; high-risk 32–35 wGA.
- **Former preterm children**: Less than or equal to 24 months with chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
- **Children with significant congenital heart disease**: Less than or equal to 24 months.
- **Other high-risk populations**: Children less than or equal to 24 months with Down syndrome, pulmonary/neuromuscular disorders, immunocompromised, and cystic fibrosis.

Up to five monthly doses should be administered over the RSV season. It is our impression that the adoption of these guidelines would help reduce the burden of RSV.

### Phase 1/2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^116k7oZp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) neutralizing geometric mean titers were measured before and one month post-vaccination 1 for RSV subgroups A and B among expanded cohort participants aged 18–49 years and 65–85 years. Neutralizing titer geometric mean fold rises from prevaccination to one month postvaccination are indicated above each pair of bars, with a total number of participants ranging from 38–41 per group (18–49 years) and 38–43 per group (65–85 years). Abbreviations include Al(OH)₃, aluminum hydroxide; GMFR, geometric mean fold rise; GMT, geometric mean titer; m, month; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; and SIIV, seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine.

Serum RSV neutralizing titers in the older adult expanded cohort remained above baseline through 12 months postvaccination, with GMFRs of 3.0–4.5 for RSV A and 2.9–4.3 for RSV B; corresponding GMFRs for placebo recipients were 1.2 for each RSV subgroup. Findings were similar for older adults in the sentinel cohort. GMFRs were also above baseline through 12 months postvaccination in younger adults in the expanded cohort. A similar trend was observed for prefusion F-binding IgG. Neither dose nor formulation had a major impact on the durability of antibody responses.

### Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in US preterm infants after the 2014 change in immunoprophylaxis guidance by the American Academy of Pediatrics [^116HewF4]. Journal of Perinatology (2020). Low credibility.

Palivizumab is the only FDA-licensed intervention available for the prevention of serious LRTI caused by RSV in children. It is indicated for high-risk infants with a history of premature birth (≤ 35 weeks gestational age) who are ≤ 6 months of age at the beginning of RSV season; those with chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who required medical treatment within the previous 6 months and who are aged ≤ 24 months at the beginning of RSV season; and those with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD) who are aged ≤ 24 months at the beginning of RSV season. Although multiple vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical testing, it is likely that a safe and effective vaccine for RSV disease is years away from licensure. This is particularly true for preterm and younger infants, as they would have a longer window before vaccines might be extended to their ages, since additional safety studies will need to be performed in this population.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^113inCgV]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

RSV immunoprophylaxis dosing recommendations reveal that most neonatologists (98.0%), pediatricians (73.2%), pediatric pulmonologists (89.7%), and pediatric cardiologists (80.8%) report their primary hospital provides the first dose of RSV immunoprophylaxis before discharge from birth hospitalization during RSV season. However, for eligible infants remaining hospitalized for extended periods in neonatal intensive care before birth discharge, fewer than half of these neonatologists (34.7%) and pediatricians (43.6%) indicated that their primary hospital provides additional monthly doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis throughout RSV season.

- **Administration of RSV immunoprophylaxis: Location where doses are provided**: All specialists reported that subsequent doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis given in the outpatient setting were administered at various locations, including the respondent's office or clinic, through primary care providers or pediatricians, and at the patient's home via a home health agency.

Most neonatologists (98.0%) identified themselves as primarily responsible for prescribing hospital-administered doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis. This view was affirmed by most pediatricians (85.1%), who also reported neonatologists as the primary prescribers of hospital-administered doses, followed by themselves (8.9%), pediatric pulmonologists (1.9%), and infectious disease specialists (1.9%). Pediatric pulmonologists also most frequently identified neonatologists as primarily responsible.

### Improved outcomes with home-based administration of palivizumab: Results from the 2000–2004 Palivizumab Outcomes Registry [^117XPjkU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Palivizumab Outcomes Registry data collected over four years were examined to assess compliance and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization rates in high-risk children receiving palivizumab prophylaxis at home compared with an outpatient setting.

- **Methods**: Prospective observational registry enrolling high-risk infants who received one or more doses of palivizumab throughout the 2000–2001 to 2003–2004 RSV seasons at participating U.S. pediatric sites.

- **Results**: Registry data were analyzed for compliance and RSV hospitalization outcomes in 19,548 infants receiving doses at home versus an outpatient setting. Compliance with the injection regimen was determined by comparing the number of palivizumab injections received versus the projected number of anticipated doses and by comparing infants receiving all injections within a 35-day interval. Compliance was significantly greater for infants who received palivizumab at home (n = 1226) as compared with those who received palivizumab in a clinic or office (n = 17,641), whether measured by the number of doses received (88% versus 81%, P < 0.0001) or by the timing of doses (73% versus 66%, P < 0.0001). Infants who received palivizumab at home also had fewer RSV-associated hospitalizations compared with those who received palivizumab in a clinic or office [0.4% (5/1226) versus 1.2% (207/17,641), P = 0.0139].

- **Conclusions**: Home administration of palivizumab was associated with a significantly higher rate of compliance and lower hospitalization rate for RSV illness in high-risk infants.

### Use of clesrovimab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2025 [^113Gfnh9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Eligible infants born during the seasonal administration window for RSV monoclonal antibody products (October 1–March 31 in most of the continental United States) should receive the RSV antibody within one week after birth, ideally during the birth hospitalization. Any eligible infant or young child born outside the seasonal administration window (April–September) who has not yet received a recommended dose should receive the RSV antibody at the earliest opportunity beginning in October to optimize protection during the peak RSV season. For infants eligible for RSV antibody with prolonged hospitalizations shortly before or during the RSV season, providers may consider administering the RSV antibody during the birth hospitalization to prevent health care–associated RSV disease. This decision should be based on clinical judgment considering the potential risks and benefits.

RSV monoclonal antibody should be administered from October through the end of March in most of the continental United States. However, ACIP recommendations on the timing of RSV antibody administration are intentionally flexible to optimize patient access, including reimbursement. For example, in Alaska, RSV circulation patterns are less predictable, and the duration of the RSV season is often longer than the national average. Tropical climates might also have RSV circulation patterns that differ from most of the continental United States or that are unpredictable. In addition, because the timing of RSV activity varies geographically in other regions of the United States, public health authorities may elect to provide RSV antibody according to local epidemiological insights.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113uYoLe]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### Revised indications for the use of palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections [^112yokNk]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in high-risk infants, children younger than 24 months with chronic lung disease (formerly called bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and certain preterm infants. This report summarizes the clinical trial information on which the guidance in the accompanying policy statement for administering RSV prophylaxis to certain children with a history of preterm birth, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease is based.

On the basis of results from a recently completed clinical trial, palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of the ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Due to the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if two or more risk factors are present.

### Implications of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on the epidemiology of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infection [^115bRRyC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Since 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended RSV immunoprophylaxis for infants born at less than 29 weeks gestational age, those born at less than 32 weeks gestational age with chronic lung disease, and those less than 12 months old with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Indeed, the risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization during "protected periods", meaning during the RSV season (November to March), when palivizumab is administered and up to 30 days after the last dose of immunoprophylaxis, is lower than during "unprotected periods" (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% confidence interval, 0.46–1.0]), and the benefit is greatest among infants with chronic lung disease. Evidence from a recent Cochrane systematic review confirms that palivizumab significantly reduces RSV infections and hospitalizations, which, along with cost-effectiveness considerations, justifies the AAP's restrictive criteria for palivizumab eligibility.

In response to an evolving epidemic within a pandemic, special national and regional task forces were formed to reassess criteria for palivizumab administration and implement new policies for public health benefit. The shifting RSV epidemiology during COVID-19 has caused delayed and prolonged RSV seasons. This led the AAP to revise its guidance in 2021. Specifically, the AAP supported consideration of palivizumab use in eligible patients outside the typical fall-winter season, especially in areas experiencing high interseasonal spread.

RSV immunoprophylaxis programs have also changed in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where the number of doses…

### Respiratory syncytial virus burden in premature infants: The role of season with and without RSV immunoprophylaxis in a multicenter study [^114oeEtE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). High credibility.

Several real-world studies, employing different methodologies, have generated conflicting results concerning the impact of the changes in the 2014 AAP RSV immunoprophylaxis guidance on the burden of RSVH among preterm infants. A retrospective US study reported no difference in RSVH rates following the introduction of the restrictive AAP 2014 policy (pre: 5.37/1000 vs. post: 5.78/1000; p = 0.622). In Italy, a similar restrictive policy was implemented in 2016, resulting in a decrease in the rate of RSVH from 6.3/1000 to 5.5/1000. However, in these studies, the adoption of the restricted guidelines was reported to be partial, with limited reduction in palivizumab utilization. Additionally, some of these studies lacked laboratory confirmation of RSV, while others lacked the power to detect differences among preterm subgroups. Albeit, the design of our study and the high level of compliance with palivizumab recommendations in Israel allowed a clear distinction between "in-season" RSV periods, with a high level of compliance to palivizumab use, and "off-season RSV periods", in which palivizumab was not used.

Indeed, in accordance with our findings, other studies reported at least a twofold increase in RSVH rates following implementation of a more restrictive policy. Rajah et al. found a significant increase in the proportion of RSVH among 29–34 wGA infants aged < 6 months in 2014–2015 (7.1%) compared to 2013–2014 (3.5%; p = 0.01). Similarly, Kong et al.'s retrospective analysis showed that a significant 45%−95% decrease in palivizumab administration to 29–34 wGA infants in the…

### New interventions to prevent respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants-time for equitable global access [^112T5mj8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

An effective preventive strategy against RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) disease in infants has taken decades to develop. At least two products will be available soon, and several others are in late-stage development (e.g. accessed March 9, 2023). The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that rapid global upscaling and implementation of vaccination is possible, including in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access and affordability in LMICs are essential, where the impact will be greatest given the severity, number of cases, and mortality. If this does not occur, health inequities will be exacerbated. Now is the time for a concerted global effort to urgently fund and deliver effective RSV prevention strategies to all infants, especially those in LMICs.

### Navigating parental hesitancy in public health: The case for RSV immunization in newborns [^112FnmQD]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). High credibility.

In light of this ongoing challenge, the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) issued a recommendation for prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies. This aims to mitigate the severe consequences of RSV infection and reduce the burden on the healthcare system during peak seasons. As of June 27, 2024, all newborns and infants should receive the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (trade name: Beyfortus®) as a single dose before their first RSV season, typically between October and March. Infants born between April and September should, if possible, receive it in the fall before the start of their first RSV season. Newborns born during the RSV season should receive nirsevimab as soon as possible after birth, ideally upon discharge from the birthing center. In Germany, the STIKO recommends the administration of nirsevimab at the standard pediatric well-child visit during birth hospitalization (3rd to 10th day of life), similar to statements given by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in August 2023.

Nirsevimab's safety profile is well-established, building on decades of clinical experience with the related monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis®), which has been safely administered to neonates at high risk of severe RSV disease since 1998. Unlike palivizumab, nirsevimab has been engineered to provide extended efficacy, lasting up to five months and covering an entire RSV season with a single dose.

The STIKO's recommendation serves as a pivotal anchor in the conversation about RSV prevention.

### Adherence to immunoprophylaxis regimens for respiratory syncytial virus infection in insured and Medicaid populations [^113Wuw3m]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Immunoprophylaxis is the only pharmaceutical intervention for mitigating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Patient-level data on adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) immunoprophylaxis recommendations are limited. This study characterizes adherence to AAP guidelines in privately insured and Medicaid populations.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective birth cohort study of 211,174 privately insured children in Northern California and 458,837 publicly insured children in Tennessee born between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2008. Adherence to the AAP guideline was defined for eligible infants as the number of doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis administered over the number recommended for four mutually exclusive eligibility groups: chronic lung disease, prematurity < 29 weeks, prematurity < 32 weeks, and other eligibility.

- **Results**: We identified 3,456 California (Kaiser Permanente Northern California [KPNC]) and 12,251 Tennessee (Tennessee Medicaid [TennCare]) infants meeting AAP eligibility criteria. Immunoprophylaxis administration increased over the study period, from 15% for all eligible groups in 1998 to 54% in 2007. Adherence was highest among babies with chronic lung disease (KPNC 67% and TennCare 55%). Nonadherence (0% adherence) was greatest among infants of African American mothers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .98–1.78); those with mothers with less than a high school education (AOR = 1.58; CI = 1.09–2.30) in KPNC; and in infants of Hispanic mothers in TennCare (AOR = 1.65; CI = 1.24–2.20). In KPNC, 0% adherence rates were observed in specific demographics.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^111iXPgu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

In the present study, respondents reported that subsequent outpatient doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis are administered by a variety of health care providers, most commonly by primary care providers or pediatricians. However, a large proportion of young children with CLDP and HS-CHD receive their doses in the pediatric pulmonologists' and pediatric cardiologists' offices or clinics. The varied providers and settings in which immunoprophylaxis is administered underscore the importance of ongoing collaborative efforts to coordinate patient care. Regular communication and partnership among specialists will help ensure that all eligible preterm infants and young children at high risk for severe RSV disease receive immunoprophylaxis throughout the entire RSV season without gaps in the monthly dosing schedule.

Parental understanding of the importance of immunoprophylaxis is essential to ensure that each recommended monthly dose is administered in a timely manner. It has been previously shown that the strongest association of compliance with the receipt of all doses is parents' perception of the benefits of RSV immunoprophylaxis. Therefore, counseling parents on the purpose of RSV immunoprophylaxis, how it works, and the importance of adherence is also critical. Parents should be educated about the fact that RSV immunoprophylaxis provides passive immunization rather than eliciting an active immune response against RSV; therefore, immunoprophylaxis must be administered monthly throughout the RSV season for it to be most effective. Furthermore, providing re-education at each follow-up is crucial.

### Priorities for developing respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in different target populations [^113Cxv43]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The development of an effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been hampered by significant difficulties encountered in the 1960s when a formalin-inactivated vaccine resulted in increased severity of RSV disease after acquisition of the virus during the RSV season following vaccination. Recent efforts to develop a vaccine have led to approximately 38 candidate vaccines and monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical development. The target populations for effective vaccination are diverse and include neonates, young children, pregnant women, and older adults. The reasons for susceptibility to infection in each of these groups may differ, potentially necessitating different vaccine types to induce protective immune responses, adding further challenges to vaccine development. Here, we review the current knowledge of RSV vaccine development for these target populations and propose a perspective and rationale for prioritizing RSV vaccine development.

The dosage of palivizumab for intramuscular (IM) use in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children, specifically in patients aged 6 months or younger at the beginning of the RSV season, and those with preterm birth-related lower respiratory tract disease, is 15 mg/kg IM every month. The first dose should be administered before and continued through the RSV season.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^114qgj21]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to survey US pediatric specialists about the administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis, communication patterns among physicians and parents, and barriers to access. Separate surveys were sent to neonatologists, pediatricians, pediatric pulmonologists, and pediatric cardiologists. Most physicians (≥ 93.5%) routinely recommended immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. Most respondents (≥ 71.8%) reported that more than 50.0% of eligible infants and young children received each monthly dose throughout the RSV season, with the first dose most commonly administered before discharge from the birth hospitalization.

To ensure receipt of subsequent doses, specialists frequently scheduled a follow-up visit at the end of the appointment. All specialists reported insurance denials as the biggest obstacle to the administration of immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. These findings may be used to improve adherence to immunoprophylaxis by enhancing education and physician-parent communications about severe RSV disease prevention, and by reducing known barriers to the use of this preventive therapy.

### Recent trends in RSV immunoprophylaxis: Clinical implications for the infant [^115N3RCf]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the leading cause of hospitalizations in infants worldwide, resulting in a significant health and financial burden. Since 1998, the humanized monoclonal antibody palivizumab has been the only available option licensed for the prevention of severe RSV disease in high-risk children, namely premature infants and those with chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics modified the recommendations on the use of RSV prophylaxis in these high-risk children, limiting its use to premature infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestational age (wGA). Following this guidance update, studies have confirmed that premature infants of 29 to 34 wGA remain at high risk for severe RSV disease, especially those of younger chronologic age. New, more cost-effective strategies are being developed that could help alleviate both the health and financial burden associated with severe RSV disease.

MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

- **Timing of RSV monoclonal antibody administration**: Administration to the general infant population should consider the eligible infants born during the seasonal administration window for RSV antibody (October 1–March 31 in most of the continental United States). These infants should receive the RSV antibody dose within one week after birth, ideally during the birth hospitalization. Eligible infants born outside the seasonal administration window (i.e. during April–September) who have not yet received the recommended dose should receive the RSV antibody at the earliest opportunity beginning in October to optimize protection during the peak of the RSV season.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVPreF3) candidate vaccine in older adults: Phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial [^117QL2SW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Immunogenicity results for the phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial show that all tested participants had detectable baseline RSV-specific antibodies (RSVPreF3-specific IgG, RSV-A- and RSV-B-specific nAb) due to previous RSV exposure(s). Baseline RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies were below the lower limit of quantification (Figures 5 and 6; Supplementary Figures 3, 5, and 6). RSVPreF3 vaccination robustly increased antibody levels and CD4+ T-cell frequencies compared to prevaccination. Results from analyses on ES and PPS were comparable for all immunogenicity parameters (data not shown).

### A truncated pre-F protein mRNA vaccine elicits an enhanced immune response and protection against respiratory syncytial virus [^114usTuu]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vaccines designed by GSK, Pfizer, and Moderna to protect high-risk populations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These vaccines employ the pre-fusion F (pre-F) protein as the immunogen. In this study, we explored an mRNA vaccine based on a modified pre-F protein called LC2DM-lipid nanoparticle (LC2DM-LNP). This vaccine features a truncated version of the pre-F protein that is anchored to the cell membrane.

Our experiments in young and old female mice revealed that the LC2DM-LNP vaccine elicited robust neutralizing antibody titers. Moreover, LC2DM-LNP prompted a Th1-skewed T-cell immune response in female rodent models. Female cotton rats immunized with LC2DM-LNP demonstrated strong immunity to RSV without signs of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VERD), even in cases of breakthrough infection. Importantly, when administered to pregnant female cotton rats, LC2DM-LNP ensured the transfer of pre-F-specific antibodies to the offspring and provided protection against RSV without increasing lung inflammation. Our findings suggest that LC2DM-LNP could serve as an alternative RSV vaccine candidate for high-risk groups.

### Respiratory syncytial virus vaccination during pregnancy for improving infant outcomes [^113izciN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants. Maternal RSV vaccination is a preventive strategy of great interest, as it could have a substantial impact on infant RSV disease burden. In recent years, the clinical development of maternal RSV vaccines has advanced rapidly.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination for preventing RSV disease in infants.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register and two other trials registries on 21 October 2022. We updated the search on 27 July 2023, when we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and two trials registries. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and conference proceedings. There were no language restrictions on our searches.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing maternal RSV vaccination with placebo or no intervention in pregnant women of any age. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation with clinically confirmed or laboratory-confirmed RSV disease in infants. The secondary outcomes covered adverse pregnancy outcomes (intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, and maternal death) and adverse infant outcomes (preterm birth, congenital abnormalities, and infant death).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included six RCTs (25 study reports) involving 17,991 pregnant women.

### June 2024 ACIP meeting update: Influenza, COVID-19, RSV, and other vaccines [^113rYMfd]. Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that provides advice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, normally meets three times per year to develop U.S. vaccine recommendations. The ACIP met from June 26 through June 28, 2024. This update summarizes the proceedings of this meeting, with an emphasis on topics that are most relevant to the pediatric population.

Major updates for pediatric clinicians include COVID-19 and influenza vaccine recommendations for the 2024 to 2025 season, meningococcal vaccination considerations, information regarding preferred Haemophilus influenzae type B containing vaccines for American Indian and Alaskan Native infants, and updates regarding implementation and effectiveness of RSV immunization in pregnant people and infants.

### Evaluating the next generation of RSV intervention strategies: A mathematical modelling study and cost-effectiveness analysis [^113rA98B]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We tracked the number of infants protected by long-acting monoclonal antibodies, Vₘ, who remain protected after birth for an average of [1/ωₘₐb] = 250 days, after which they return to S₀ (Additional file 1: Section 4). However, we relaxed this assumption in an uncertainty analysis.

We evaluated three seasonal programmes that administer a single dose of long-acting monoclonal antibodies at birth:

- **MAB-VHR-S**: Administered to those currently eligible for Palivizumab.
- **MAB-HR-S**: Administered to both VHR infants and infants who are at heightened risk (HR) of developing complications due to respiratory disease.
- **MAB-ALL-S**: Administered to all infants regardless of risk.

Additional seasonal programmes extend administration:

- **MAB-HR-S+**: To all VHR and high-risk infants under 6 months.
- **MAB-ALL-S+**: To all infants under 6 months, but throughout October only.

We assume these programmes would replace the existing Palivizumab programme, achieving the same coverage as Palivizumab, with an efficacy per course of 70.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 52.3–81.0%).

To measure the real-world effectiveness of palivizumab immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-confirmed infection before age 2 years in a population-cohort of high-risk infants, palivizumab is funded for high-risk infants in Western Australia. We used probabilistically linked administrative data encompassing RSV laboratory-confirmed infections, hospital admissions, and palivizumab dispensing records for a cohort of 24,329 high-risk infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units, born between 2002 and 2013 with follow-up to 2015. A traditional cohort method with Cox proportional hazards regression and a self-controlled case series analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of palivizumab in reducing RSV-confirmed infection by number of doses.

From the cohort of 24,329 infants, 271 (1.1%) received at least 1 dose of palivizumab, and 1,506 (6.2%) had at least 1 RSV-confirmed infection before age 2 years. Using the traditional cohort approach, we found no protective association of palivizumab receipt with RSV detection (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.99; 95% CI 0.5, 1.9 for 1 dose). However, using a self-controlled case series to eliminate confounding by indication, a protective association was seen with a 74% lower RSV incidence (relative incidence = 0.26; 95% CI 0.11, 0.67) following any dose of palivizumab compared with control (non-exposed) periods.

After accounting for confounding by indication through a self-controlled analysis, palivizumab appeared effective for reducing virologically confirmed RSV in this high-risk cohort.

### Seasonality, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus disease by subtype among children aged < 5 years: New Vaccine Surveillance Network, United States, 2016–2020 [^113sy6qq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory illnesses in children. RSV can be broadly categorized into two major subtypes: A and B. These subtypes are known to cocirculate with variability across different regions of the world. Clinical associations with viral subtypes have been studied among children, yielding conflicting findings such that no conclusive relationships between RSV subtype and severity have been established.

- **Methods**: During 2016–2020, children aged < 5 years were enrolled in prospective surveillance in emergency department or inpatient settings at seven US pediatric medical centers. Surveillance data collection included parent/guardian interviews, chart reviews, and the collection of midturbinate nasal and/or throat swabs for RSV (RSV-A, RSV-B, and untyped) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Among 6,398 RSV-positive children aged < 5 years, 3,424 (54%) had subtype RSV-A infections, 2,602 (41%) had subtype RSV-B infections, and 272 (5%) were not typed, inconclusive, or mixed infections. In both adjusted and unadjusted analyses, RSV-A-positive children were more likely to be hospitalized, particularly when restricted to those < 1 year old. By season, RSV-A and RSV-B cocirculated at varying levels, with one subtype dominating proportionally.

- **Conclusions**: Findings indicate that RSV-A and RSV-B may only be marginally clinically distinguishable; however, both subtypes are associated with medically attended illness in children aged < 5 years. Furthermore, circulation of RSV subtypes varies substantially each year, seasonally.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, 2023 [^113mC1rg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### A randomized phase 1/2 study of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine [^111aQ4L8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants and an important cause of disease in older adults. In the United States, most infants are infected during their first winter, with RSV-associated hospitalization rates of approximately 1%–2%, with rates highest in the first months of life.

Over 50 years of vaccine development efforts have not produced a licensed RSV vaccine. The only available preventive is palivizumab (Synagis; MedImmune LLC), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting RSV fusion glycoprotein (F). Palivizumab reduces RSV-related high-risk infant hospitalizations, supporting the ability of neutralizing antibodies to protect against severe disease. However, its practicality is limited by high cost and the need for up to 5 monthly injections each season. Thus, an effective RSV vaccine remains a significant unmet medical need.

Pediatric RSV vaccine development has been impeded since the 1960s, when RSV-naive infants immunized with a formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate experienced enhanced disease upon subsequent natural RSV infection. This phenomenon was linked to the vaccine eliciting predominantly non-neutralizing antibodies and a T helper 2 (Tᴴ₂)-biased helper T-cell response. In contrast, RSV infection elicits neutralizing antibodies and Tᴴ₁ phenotype T-cell responses that are unassociated with disease enhancement upon RSV reexposure. Disease enhancement was not observed in individuals previously infected with RSV, regardless of subsequent immunization.

### Identifying gaps in respiratory syncytial virus disease epidemiology in the United States prior to the introduction of vaccines [^1154obGg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) frequently causes lower respiratory tract illness. No effective antivirals or vaccines for RSV are approved for use in the United States; however, there are at least 50 vaccines and monoclonal antibody products in development, with those targeting older adults and pregnant women (to protect young infants) in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Unanswered questions regarding RSV epidemiology need to be identified and addressed prior to RSV vaccine introduction to guide the measurement of impact and future recommendations.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a technical consultation to gather input from external subject matter experts on their individual perspectives regarding evidence gaps in RSV epidemiology in the United States, potential studies and surveillance platforms needed to fill these gaps, and prioritizing efforts. Participants articulated their individual views, and CDC staff synthesized individuals' input into this report.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^115Ax4Co]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to survey US pediatric specialists about the administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis, communication patterns among physicians and parents, and barriers to access. Separate surveys were sent to neonatologists, pediatricians, pediatric pulmonologists, and pediatric cardiologists.

Most physicians (≥ 93.5%) routinely recommended immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. Most respondents (≥ 71.8%) reported that more than 50.0% of eligible infants and young children received each monthly dose throughout the RSV season, with the first dose most commonly administered before discharge from the birth hospitalization. To ensure receipt of subsequent doses, specialists frequently scheduled a follow-up visit at the end of the appointment.

All specialists reported insurance denials as the biggest obstacle to the administration of immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. These findings may be used to improve adherence to immunoprophylaxis by enhancing education and physician-parent communications about severe RSV disease prevention, and by reducing known barriers to the use of this preventive therapy.

### Respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab: 12-year observational study of usage and outcomes in Canada [^116dLJy3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

Adherence to treatment was defined as follows: (1) expected number of doses versus actual number of doses for the respective RSV season, and (2) interdose interval. For the first definition, the number was calculated assuming monthly injections from the first dose to the end of the RSV season. For the second definition, 30 ± 5 day intervals were considered as adherent. Some centers used an interval of 20 ± 4 days between the first and second injections to possibly yield higher trough levels after the first dose and avoid breakthrough RSV infection. Therefore, an interval of 16 to 35 days between the first and second injection was considered adherent. Hospitalizations were defined by two primary endpoints: RIH and RSVH. We compared hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients to identify potential risk factors for hospitalization.

The RIH rate was determined by the number of children hospitalized for respiratory-related illnesses divided by the total number of children in the study population. The RSVH rate was calculated by multiplying the RIH by the number of RSV-positive children divided by the number of children tested for RSV infection.

- **Statistical analysis**: All data were examined using SPSS v. 17.0. The statistical tests employed were Student t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables, and Pearson Chi-square test for nominal variables. A p-value of 0.05 was considered the limit of significance. To examine any factors that may affect time to hospitalization, a Cox proportional analysis was conducted.

### Effectiveness and safety of palivizumab for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus: A systematic review [^113X2JXe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Treatment-related adverse events**: The frequency of adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of palivizumab was low in both clinical trial (0–12% of patients) and real-world settings (0–7% of patients). In clinical trials, no serious adverse events (SAEs) attributable to palivizumab were reported, and the rates of AEs were not statistically different between patients who received palivizumab or placebo for all indications: 11% versus 10% in patients with a history of premature birth (< 35 weeks of gestation) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and 7.2% versus 6.9% in patients with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (hs-CHD). Overall, the most common AEs were fever, injection site reaction, diarrhea, and rash.

	- In the real-world setting, rates of AEs associated with palivizumab were 2.1%, 4.0%, 6.4%, and 7%, and the rates of SAEs were 0.3% and 1.4%. The most common events were local erythema, systemic fever, local pain, irritability, vomiting, and diarrhea. Based on one study, serious events — defined as any AE resulting in death, a life-threatening situation, inpatient hospitalizations, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other medically important events — that were possibly related to palivizumab were reported in two patients. These included infection and bronchiolitis in one patient, and pneumonia and conjunctivitis in the other.

	- In a retrospective cohort study of 2,018 children aged ≤ 2 years with hs-CHD, there was no increased risk of serious infection or serious arrhythmia associated with the use of palivizumab compared with unmatched controls, with odds ratios of 0.95 and 1.64, respectively, for each SAE.

### Initial palivizumab dose administration in outpatient clinic after hospital discharge [^1144K5Ke]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Palivizumab provides passive immunity for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but poor adherence compromises protection. A hospital initiative promoted the administration of the first palivizumab doses at an outpatient clinic immediately after discharge. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of the initiative on the location and timing of the first palivizumab dose, patient adherence, reimbursement, acquisition cost, and RSV-positive hospital readmissions.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients who received palivizumab from 2012 to 2016. Three groups were compared: "before initiative", "transition", and "after initiative". Patients who did not qualify for palivizumab or who were eligible for palivizumab in previous RSV seasons were excluded. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions adjusted for patients' characteristics were used in outcome analysis.

- **Results**: After adjusting for patients' characteristics, there was a 13.5-fold (95% confidence interval: 5.9–30.5, P < 0.0001) increase in the odds that patients would receive outpatient administration of palivizumab and a 2.7-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.3–5.7, P = 0.0103) increase in the odds of receiving the second dose within 35 days after initiative implementation compared with before. Although there was no significant difference in reimbursement percentage after initiative implementation (32% ± 30% after initiative and 31% ± 22% before), calculated palivizumab acquisition costs were 20.8% lower. RSV readmissions were not significantly different.

- **Conclusions**: Implementation of an initiative focused on administering palivizumab doses in outpatient settings post-discharge appears to improve adherence and reduce acquisition costs without significantly affecting RSV readmissions.

### The journey to a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine [^115nSW8K]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The high burden associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has made the development of RSV vaccines a global health priority. This review summarizes the journey to an RSV vaccine, the various strategies and challenges related to the development of preventive measures for RSV, and the diverse products that are undergoing clinical testing.

- **Data sources**: Studies on RSV biology, immunology, epidemiology, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines were searched using MEDLINE. Additionally, we searched PATH.org and ClinicalTrials.gov for updated information regarding the status of RSV vaccines and mAbs undergoing clinical trials.

- **Study selections**: We selected relevant studies conducted in infants and young children, pregnant women, and the elderly population for the prevention of RSV infection.

- **Results**: Identification of a safe and immunogenic vaccine has been an important but elusive goal for more than 60 years due to several reasons, including the legacy of formalin-inactivated vaccines, our limited understanding of the immune response to RSV and its relation to clinical disease severity, and the need for different endpoints according to the various vaccine platforms. Nevertheless, there are currently 39 vaccines and mAbs under development, with 19 undergoing clinical trials.

- **Conclusion**: Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in our knowledge of RSV molecular and structural biology and in understanding the human immune response to RSV. Despite the barriers, several promising mAbs and RSV vaccines are undergoing clinical evaluations.

### Substantial variability in community respiratory syncytial virus season timing [^112QjXHz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended the prevention of RSV disease in children in certain high-risk groups through the use of immunoglobulin preparations since 1998. A more precise understanding of the timing of annual RSV epidemics should assist providers in maximizing the benefit of these preventive therapies. This study aimed to determine whether national RSV surveillance data could be used to define the timing of seasonal outbreaks.

- **Methods**: Weekly RSV testing data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Surveillance System for the period between July 1990 and June 2000 were analyzed. RSV season onset week, peak week, and duration were calculated for the entire United States, Census regions, and select local laboratories. Season variability was estimated by comparing calculations for individual RSV seasons to median measurements for the entire surveillance period.

- **Results**: RSV seasons in the South region began significantly earlier (P < 0.05) and lasted longer (P < 0.05) than seasons for the rest of the nation. RSV seasons in the Midwest region began significantly later (P < 0.01) and were shorter (P < 0.05) than those for the rest of the nation. Local RSV seasons varied substantially by year and by laboratory. The variability between laboratories generally increased with distance between laboratories.

- **Conclusions**: Onset weeks and durations of RSV seasons vary substantially by year and location. Local RSV data are needed for more accurate predictions and planning.
