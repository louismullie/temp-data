## Question

- ⁠comparison between nephrotic & nephritic syndrome ?!

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison between nephrotic and nephritic syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology and histopathology. Next, I will compare clinical presentations and complications. After that, I need to review etiologies and epidemiology. I will then examine diagnostic approaches, including when to biopsy and what labs to order. Finally, I should contrast management principles and prognosis, and close with a concise synthesis that highlights the key distinguishing features and overlaps, making sure I double-check any points that might be misleading or incomplete along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and diagnostic thresholds so I don't anchor on outdated criteria. Nephrotic syndrome is defined by nephrotic-range proteinuria, typically a first-morning urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 2 g/g in children, accompanied by hypoalbuminemia and edema; complete remission is generally defined as UPCR ≤ 0.2 g/g on at least three consecutive days, which operationalizes response tracking in practice [^116e8DAv] [^111mmo9a]. In contrast, nephritic syndrome is defined primarily by hematuria with dysmorphic red cells and RBC casts, often with proteinuria below nephrotic range, hypertension, and reduced GFR, reflecting an inflammatory glomerular process rather than a pure permeability defect; I should confirm that the presence of hematuria with RBC casts is the most reliable distinguishing feature at the bedside.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I verify the histopathology. Nephrotic syndromes are fundamentally podocytopathies with injury to the glomerular filtration barrier, classically showing minimal change disease with diffuse foot process effacement on electron microscopy, or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with segmental sclerosis and podocyte loss; emerging data support circulating permeability factors and, in some cases, autoantibodies such as anti-nephrin, reinforcing an immune–podocyte axis in idiopathic disease [^1124Nwzw] [^1164vFry] [^114mYSnB]. By contrast, nephritic syndromes reflect endocapillary inflammation with immune complex deposition, complement activation, and inflammatory cell infiltration, producing hematuria and variable proteinuria; I need to ensure I emphasize that the inflammatory milieu is the key driver rather than primary podocyte injury per se [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype to avoid conflating overlapping features. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with marked edema, often periorbital and dependent, frothy urine, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia; gross hematuria is uncommon in minimal change disease, though microscopic hematuria may be seen, and complications include infection due to immunoglobulin loss, thrombosis from loss of anticoagulants and hypercoagulability, and AKI in the setting of hypovolemia or sepsis, so I need to check for these at onset and relapse [^1124Nwzw] [^116SYQwc]. Nephritic syndrome, on the other hand, features hematuria with RBC casts, hypertension, oliguria, and reduced GFR; edema can occur but is less prominent than in nephrotic syndrome, and the clinical tempo is often more acute, which helps distinguish it at presentation [^notfound].

> I will now examine etiologies and epidemiology, but wait, I should verify pediatric versus adult patterns. In children, most nephrotic syndrome is idiopathic and steroid-sensitive, with minimal change disease predominating; secondary causes include infections, drugs, and systemic diseases, and monogenic forms are enriched in steroid-resistant cohorts, particularly with infantile or congenital onset, which shifts diagnostic strategy toward early genetic testing in those phenotypes [^112Gf2zh] [^111uor5w]. In adults, membranous nephropathy and FSGS are more common primary causes, and diabetes is a leading secondary etiology; I should confirm that adult MCD remains a minority of cases and that steroid responsiveness guides prognosis and management decisions [^116njoBU] [^115JRJSc]. For nephritic syndromes, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and vasculitides such as ANCA-associated GN are frequent, with age and geography influencing prevalence; Henoch–Schönlein purpura nephritis clusters in childhood and carries a risk of both nephritic and nephrotic features in severe cases [^113n761P] [^113HqmNZ].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach, and I should double-check when to avoid or pursue biopsy. In typical pediatric nephrotic syndrome, guidelines advise against initial biopsy and recommend empiric corticosteroids, reserving biopsy for steroid resistance, atypical features, or older age; first-morning spot UPCR is preferred for quantifying proteinuria, and a basic workup includes urinalysis, CBC, creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, and albumin, with complement and autoantibodies reserved for atypical presentations or suspected secondary causes [^113TZpDU] [^112noTrn] [^116n7kXf]. In contrast, nephritic features such as macroscopic hematuria, RBC casts, hypocomplementemia, or systemic symptoms should prompt early biopsy and targeted serologies because the histology directs immunosuppressive therapy; I need to ensure I emphasize that complement levels and ANCA/ANA testing are critical in this context [^114iutav] [^1143QDQj] [^116vC4rL].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of genetics and biomarkers so I don't overgeneralize. Genetic testing is indicated in congenital or infantile-onset nephrotic syndrome, family history, or steroid-resistant disease, and comprehensive podocytopathy gene panels are recommended as first-line in congenital cases; emerging biomarkers such as anti-nephrin antibodies and urinary NGAL may help stratify disease and predict steroid resistance, though I should note that NGAL data are still evolving and require validation before routine adoption [^115G1M4X] [^115q5fam] [^114mYSnB] [^112UxcVB]. For nephritic syndromes, complement profiles and ANCA/ANA are central, and biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy establishes patterns such as mesangial IgA deposition in IgA nephropathy or pauci-immune necrotizing GN, which immediately changes management [^116vC4rL].

> Next, I should review management principles and make sure I don't conflate pediatric and adult strategies. In children with typical nephrotic syndrome, corticosteroids are first-line; most respond within 4 weeks, and steroid responsiveness is the strongest prognostic factor, with calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide reserved for frequent relapsers, steroid dependence, or steroid resistance; I should confirm that recent high-quality evidence shows no benefit to extending initial steroid therapy beyond 2–3 months in first episodes, which corrects older assumptions favoring longer courses [^112Gf2zh] [^114KULCy] [^114gAeZR]. Supportive care includes sodium restriction, judicious diuretics, and RAAS blockade; albumin infusions are not routinely recommended for edema due to limited and low-certainty evidence, so I need to be cautious about their use outside specific contexts [^114xhdaP] [^113B8aVV]. In adults with MCD, steroids remain standard but response is slower and less predictable, and CNIs or other agents are often used to minimize steroid exposure; evidence quality is limited, so shared decision-making is essential [^117AB8HY] [^115JRJSc].

> But wait, what if the presentation is nephritic rather than nephrotic. In nephritic syndromes, management pivots to treating the underlying inflammatory glomerulonephritis: supportive care for AKI and hypertension, and immunosuppression tailored to the histologic diagnosis, such as high-dose corticosteroids with cytotoxic agents for lupus nephritis, rituximab or cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated GN, and supportive therapy for IgA nephropathy with consideration of steroids in high-risk phenotypes; I should confirm that biopsy-directed therapy is the rule here, not the exception [^notfound].

> I should now appraise prognosis and make sure I separate steroid-sensitive from steroid-resistant trajectories. In children, steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome generally has an excellent renal prognosis but a high relapse rate, whereas steroid-resistant disease carries a substantial risk of progression to ESRD and post-transplant recurrence; monogenic forms and FSGS portend worse outcomes, reinforcing the value of early genetic evaluation in resistant cases [^112Gf2zh] [^111uor5w]. In adults, MCD usually responds to steroids with favorable long-term outcomes, but FSGS and membranous nephropathy have more variable courses; spontaneous remission occurs in a minority of membranous cases, and immunosuppression reduces ESKD risk at the cost of adverse events, so risk–benefit discussions are crucial [^1124Nwzw] [^112SuzmB]. For nephritic syndromes, prognosis varies widely by etiology and severity, with combined nephritic–nephrotic presentations in diseases like HSP carrying the highest risk of chronic impairment, which I should explicitly highlight [^113n761P].

> Let me reconsider the key distinguishing features to ensure internal consistency. Nephrotic syndrome is defined by heavy proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia and edema, driven by podocyte injury with minimal inflammation, whereas nephritic syndrome is defined by hematuria with RBC casts, hypertension, and reduced GFR, driven by endocapillary inflammation and immune complex deposition; this pathophysiologic divergence underpins different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, even though overlap syndromes can blur the bedside picture [^116e8DAv].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically actionable: nephrotic syndrome reflects a permeability disorder with protein loss and edema, managed primarily with steroids and steroid-sparing agents in children, guided by response and relapse pattern; nephritic syndrome reflects an inflammatory glomerulonephritis with hematuria and impaired filtration, requiring early biopsy and disease-specific immunosuppression; recognizing these axes and their overlaps enables timely diagnosis, appropriate escalation, and improved outcomes while avoiding unnecessary interventions [^112Gf2zh] [^113TZpDU].

Nephrotic and nephritic syndromes are distinct glomerular disorders with different pathophysiology, clinical features, and management. The key difference is that **nephrotic syndrome** features heavy proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia, typically without hematuria or hypertension, and is managed with corticosteroids and supportive care [^112Gf2zh] [^116e8DAv]. In contrast, **nephritic syndrome** presents with hematuria, hypertension, and oliguria due to inflammatory glomerular injury, requiring immunosuppression and strict blood pressure control [^notfound]. Accurate differentiation is essential for **targeted therapy and prognosis** [^notfound].

| **Feature** | **Nephrotic syndrome** | **Nephritic syndrome** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | Podocyte injury causing increased glomerular permeability and protein loss [^1164vFry] | Immune-mediated glomerular inflammation with complement activation [^notfound] |
| Clinical features | - Heavy proteinuria <br/> - Hypoalbuminemia <br/> - Edema <br/> - Hyperlipidemia <br/> - Minimal hematuria or hypertension [^116e8DAv] | - Hematuria (RBCs/casts) <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Oliguria <br/> - Azotemia [^notfound] |
| Common causes | - Minimal change disease <br/> - FSGS <br/> - Membranous nephropathy <br/> - Diabetes [^116njoBU] | - Post-infectious GN <br/> - IgA nephropathy <br/> - Lupus nephritis <br/> - ANCA vasculitis [^notfound] |
| Laboratory findings | - Proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/day <br/> - Serum albumin < 3.0 g/dL <br/> - Normal complement [^116e8DAv] | - Proteinuria < 3.5 g/day <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Low C3/C4 <br/> - Elevated creatinine [^notfound] |
| Management | - Corticosteroids <br/> - Immunosuppressants <br/> - ACEi/ARBs <br/> - Supportive care [^112Gf2zh] | - Immunosuppression <br/> - Blood pressure control <br/> - Dialysis if AKI [^notfound] |
| Prognosis | Generally favorable with treatment; risk of relapse and complications [^112Gf2zh] | Variable; risk of chronic kidney disease and progression [^notfound] |

In brief, **nephrotic syndrome** is characterized by heavy proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia with minimal inflammation, whereas **nephritic syndrome** is defined by hematuria and hypertension from inflammatory glomerular injury.

### Immune-mediated renal disease [^115ieuwR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Immune-mediated renal diseases can be classified by the clinical syndromes they produce, by the attendant renal pathology, or by the dominant immune effector mechanism of renal injury. The major clinical syndromes produced by immune-mediated renal injury include the nephrotic syndrome, the nephritic syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and acute renal failure. The notion of clinical syndromes facilitates diagnosis and treatment, but does not accurately define disease pathogenesis. In this summary, we discuss pathologically defined immune-mediated renal diseases under the clinical syndrome with which they are most frequently associated. There is overlap between the clinical syndromes, but the syndromes provide a useful framework. Relevant information regarding the proposed pathogenesis of disease entities is included under specific disease entities.

### Current understanding of nephrotic syndrome in children [^113G7KPb]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome in children is mostly idiopathic in origin. About 90% of patients respond to corticosteroids; 80–90% have at least one relapse and 3–10% become corticosteroid resistant after the initial response. A kidney biopsy is seldom indicated for diagnosis except in patients with atypical presentation or corticosteroid resistance. For those in remission, the risk of relapse is reduced by the administration of daily low dose corticosteroids for 5–7 days at the onset of an upper respiratory infection. Some patients may continue having relapses through adult life. Many country-specific practice guidelines have been published, which are very similar with clinically insignificant differences.

PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES

NEPTUNE has developed a broad multi-omics approach for a mechanism-based categorization of primary glomerular diseases that lends itself to precision medicine therapeutic initiatives, a key advance in nephrology.
In NEPTUNE Match, noninvasive biomarker profiles have been developed to identify patients with distinct mechanisms of kidney injury based on assessment of the kidney status. This is a key step in translating basic science discoveries about glomerular diseases into practical application for patient care.
With Match, a framework has been created to evaluate the unique molecular profile in individual patients in a comprehensive and efficient manner.
In partnership with academic clinical trialists and industry sponsors, molecular targeted therapies are being developed in NEPTUNE to expand the stratification approaches within the Match program.
The NEPTUNE network has been trained and certified to communicate the state-of-the-art research findings that emerge from the Match evaluation to patients to ensure understanding of the results and thoughtful use as they consider enrollment in prospective clinical trials.

Challenges

Lack of robust model systems recapitulating human disease processes to evaluate targets in clinical development in NS. We are addressing this problem by incorporating newer technologies, such as organoids to model nephrotic syndrome in vitro and to assess the effects of proposed therapies. Increased data sharing among clinical investigators will promote better understanding of the natural history of the primary glomerular disorders and complement efforts underway in Match to delineate discrete subtypes of each glomerulopathy.
Educating the nephrologists in academic centers and community practice about the potential impact of precision medicine initiatives in nephrology in general and glomerular diseases in particular. We plan to establish regional networks of community nephologists to promote awareness of Match and to facilitate referral of patients to NEPTUNE sites for potential participation in this cutting-edge research activity.
Creating an infrastructure for outreach to patients to increase their understanding of precision medicine in nephrology and to provide meaningful answers to their key questions, including: What is my disease doing to my kidney? What will happen to my kidney? What can be done to help my kidney disease? Efforts are underway to partner with patient advocacy groups to foster engagement with Match.
Coordinating preclinical and clinical programs so that Match activity profiles can be generated in advance of clinical trial deployment.

### Rationale and design of the nephrotic syndrome study network (NEPTUNE) match in glomerular diseases: designing the right trial for the right patient, today [^115jsFrR]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) comprises focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy, which are rare glomerular diseases associated with debilitating complications, including possible progression to kidney failure. Despite similar and overlapping symptoms (e.g. edema, proteinuria, and loss of kidney function), individual clinical courses can vary markedly. The only US Food and Drug Administration–approved medical treatments are corticosteroid-based immunosuppressive agents (i.e. prednisone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone) that cause severe adverse effects. Off-label use of second-line immunosuppressive medications is currently part of guideline-based clinical care.

The clinical, histopathology-based taxonomy of NS fails to capture the underlying molecular drivers of these diseases (Figure 1). Consequently, current diagnostic categories have limited use in either predicting the disease course or responding to therapy, frequently putting patients at risk of adverse effects from treatments that prove ineffective. In addition, clinical trials in NS enroll an unstratified, biologically diverse group of individuals. This underlying mechanistic heterogeneity often results in inconclusive trial outcomes, even though the intervention may successfully target a subset of susceptible patients.

### Molecular stratification of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [^1164vFry]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) describes a group of pathologies of the renal glomerulus that result in the classic triad of heavy proteinuria, oedema and hypoalbuminaemia. The disease has historically been defined by evidence of distinctive histological changes in the absence of clinical evidence of a distinct pathological driver. However, the current classification is not based on any systematic mechanistic understanding of biological processes, and therefore current treatment regimens are broad, iterative and nonspecific. Over the past 20 years delineation of the underlying biology of the target cell in INS - the glomerular podocyte - has transformed our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier and the development of INS. It is increasingly clear that nephrotic syndrome caused by monogenic mutations is distinct from immune-driven disease, which in some cases is mediated by circulating factors that target the podocyte. The combination of systems biology and bioinformatics approaches, together with powerful laboratory models and ever-growing patient registries has potential to identify disease 'signatures' that reflect the underlying molecular mechanism of INS on an individual basis. Understanding of such processes could lead to the development of targeted therapies.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111mmo9a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^116hqaHB]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on nephrotic syndrome in children:

- **Definition**: Nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerular disease in childhood, characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The majority of pediatric cases are idiopathic and steroid-sensitive, falling under the umbrella of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis involves increased glomerular permeability due to podocyte dysfunction, resulting in severe protein loss, hypoalbuminemia, and compensatory hepatic lipid production. Most children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, if biopsied, are found to have minimal change disease, which may show podocyte foot process effacement or mild mesangial proliferation with IgM deposition. Less frequently, FSGS may be present, particularly in steroid-resistant cases. Congenital and infantile-onset nephrotic syndrome, presenting within the first 3 months of life, is typically caused by genetic mutations affecting podocyte proteins and is often steroid-resistant. These forms are associated with poor response to immunosuppressive therapy and a high risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease.
- **Epidemiology**: Nephrotic syndrome has an incidence ranging from 1.15 to 16.9 per 100,000 children, with variability across ethnic and geographic populations. It primarily affects children between the ages of 2 and 6 years and is more common in males.
- **Risk factors**: A family history of nephrotic syndrome or other glomerular diseases may increase susceptibility. Environmental triggers such as recent viral infections, particularly upper respiratory tract infections, are frequently reported at disease onset. Genetic mutations affecting podocyte structure and function are more often associated with steroid-resistant forms but may occasionally be present in steroid-sensitive cases.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome typically begins with edema, often periorbital, and may follow an upper respiratory infection. As the disease progresses, generalized edema may develop, including ascites, pleural effusions, and scrotal or labial swelling. Edema may be accompanied by fatigue, decreased urine output, and nonspecific abdominal discomfort. Around 85% of children achieve remission with standard glucocorticoid therapy within 4–6 weeks. However, 70–80% experience at least one relapse, and up to 50% develop frequent relapses or steroid dependence. Kidney function is preserved in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome when appropriately managed, but prolonged glucocorticoid exposure and second-line therapies can contribute to treatment-related morbidity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: While the disease often resolves spontaneously after puberty, 10–30% of children may have persistent relapses into adulthood, and a small subset (< 5%) may develop secondary steroid resistance with increased risk of progression to kidney failure and post-transplant recurrence.

### Long term tapering versus standard prednisolone treatment for first episode of childhood nephrotic syndrome: phase III randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^115Tj8Yk]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The PREDNOS trial recruited UK children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome and compared an initial extended 16 week course of prednisolone treatment with the standard eight week course described by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children. The results did not show any clinical benefit on key primary and secondary clinical endpoints. We found no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in the outcome measures: time to first relapse of nephrotic syndrome; incidence of any relapse or the number of relapses experienced; the proportion of participants who went on to develop frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome; or the requirement for alternative non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive treatment. Confidence intervals for the incidence of any relapse excluded clinically important benefit. Subgroup analyses showed no clear evidence that the treatment effect differed according to ethnicity or age, although the trial was not powered to detect differences in subgroups.

Although there is no evidence that an extended course of prednisolone treatment statistically significantly reduces clinical endpoints, the direction of the effect was to delay the time to relapse. We found some evidence that an extended course of prednisolone reduced healthcare resource use in the first two years and resulted in a small improvement in quality of life. Combined in a cost effectiveness analysis, these findings provide evidence that an extended course of treatment is a cost effective use of healthcare resources.

### Provider perspectives on treatment decision-making in nephrotic syndrome [^1131hT2r]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Managing patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) remains difficult for the practicing nephrologist. This often young patient population is faced with a debilitating, relapsing and remitting disease with non-specific treatment options that are often poorly tolerated. Clinicians managing these complex patients must attempt to apply disease-specific evidence while considering the individual patient's clinical and personal situation.

Methods

We conducted qualitative interviews to ascertain the provider perspectives of NS, treatment options and factors that influence recommendations for disease management, and administered a survey to assess both facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.

Results

When making treatment recommendations, providers considered characteristics of various treatments such as efficacy, side effects and evaluation of risk versus benefit, taking into account how the specific treatment fit with the individual patient. Time constraints and the complexity of explaining the intricacies of NS were noted as significant barriers to care. Although the availability of guidelines was deemed a facilitator to care, the value of the KDIGO guidelines was limited by the perception of poor quality of evidence.

Conclusions

The complexity of NS and the scarcity of robust evidence to support treatment recommendations are common challenges reported by nephrologists. Future development and use of shared learning platforms may support the integration of best available evidence, patient/family preferences and exchange of information at a pace that is unconstrained by the outpatient clinic schedule.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to classification, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following classification for nephrotic syndrome in children:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome|- Complete remission within 4 weeks of prednisone or prednisolone at standard dose|
|Infrequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome|- < 2 relapses in the 6 months following remission of the initial episode or < 3 relapses in any subsequent 12-month period|
|Frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome|- ≥ 2 relapses in the first 6 months following remission of the initial episode or ≥ 3 relapses per 12 months in any subsequent 12-month period|
|Steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome|- 2 consecutive relapses during recommended prednisone or prednisolone therapy for first presentation or relapse (either at full-dose or during tapering) or within 14 days of prednisone or prednisolone discontinuation|
|Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome|- Lack of complete remission within 4 weeks of therapy with daily prednisone or prednisolone at standard dose|
|Confirmation period|- Time period between 4 and 6 weeks from prednisone or prednisolone initiation during which response to further oral prednisone or prednisolone and/or pulses of IV methylprednisolone and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are ascertained in patients achieving only partial remission at 4 weeks <br/> - Define a patient achieving complete remission at 6 weeks as a late responder <br/> - Define a patient not achieving complete remission at 6 weeks, although achieving partial remission at 4 weeks, as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome|
|Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome late responder|- A patient with new-onset nephrotic syndrome achieving complete remission during the confirmation period (between 4 and 6 weeks of prednisone or prednisolone therapy)|
|Calcineurin inhibitor-responsive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome|- Partial remission with 6 months of treatment and/or complete remission with 12 months of treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor at adequate doses and/or levels|
|Calcineurin inhibitor-resistant steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome|- Absence of partial remission with at least 6 months of treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor at adequate doses and/or levels|
|Multi-drug resistant steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome|- Absence of complete remission with 12 months of treatment with 2 mechanistically distinct steroid-sparing agents at standard doses|
|Secondary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome|- A patient with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome at disease onset who at a subsequent relapse fails to achieve remission within 4 weeks of therapy with daily prednisone or prednisolone at standard dose.|

### Nephrotic syndrome [^116SYQwc]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) encompasses a variety of disease processes leading to heavy proteinuria and edema. Minimal change disease (MCD) remains the most common primary cause of NS, as well as the most responsive to pharmacologic treatment with often minimal to no chronic kidney disease. Other causes of NS include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which follows MCD, and secondary causes, including extrarenal or systemic diseases, infections, and drugs. Although initial diagnosis relies on clinical findings as well as urine and blood chemistries, renal biopsy and genetic testing are important diagnostic tools, especially when considering non-MCD NS. Moreover, biomarkers in urine and serum have become important areas for research in this disease. NS progression and prognosis are variable and depend on etiology, with corticosteroids being the mainstay of treatment. Other alternative therapies found to be successful in inducing and maintaining remission include calcineurin inhibitors and rituximab. Disease course can range from recurrent disease relapse with or without acute kidney injury to end-stage renal disease in some cases. Given the complex pathogenesis of NS, which remains incompletely understood, complications are numerous and diverse and include infections, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and thrombosis. Pediatricians must be aware of the presentation, complications, and overall long-term implications of NS and its treatment.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of nephrotic syndrome in children [^1143QDQj]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to kidney biopsy, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to perform a kidney biopsy in children with nephrotic syndrome in the following circumstances:

- age ≥ 12 years

Minimal change disease represents a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in both pediatric and adult patients. Although much remains to be discovered, there have been significant recent advancements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of minimal change disease, including the discovery of antinephrin antibodies as a marker for diagnosis of disease. Here we will review what is known about the pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis of minimal change disease and the differences between pediatric and adult patients. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of disease will be noted. We will discuss how this may change the treatment of minimal change disease going forward and what remains to be studied.

### Nephrotic syndrome in adults: diagnosis and management [^116njoBU]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome may be caused by primary (idiopathic) renal disease or by a variety of secondary causes. Patients present with marked edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and often hyperlipidemia. In adults, diabetes mellitus is the most common secondary cause, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous nephropathy are the most common primary causes. Venous thromboembolism is a possible complication; acute renal failure and serious bacterial infection are also possible, but much less common. There are no established guidelines on the diagnostic workup or management of nephrotic syndrome. Imaging studies are generally not needed, and blood tests should be used selectively to diagnose specific disorders rather than for a broad or unguided workup. Renal biopsy may be useful in some cases to confirm an underlying disease or to identify idiopathic disease that is more likely to respond to corticosteroids. Treatment of most patients should include fluid and sodium restriction, oral or intravenous diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Some adults with nephrotic syndrome may benefit from corticosteroid treatment, although research data are limited. Intravenous albumin, prophylactic antibiotics, and prophylactic anticoagulation are not currently recommended.

### Emerging roles of non-coding RNAs in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome: a narrative review [^114mYSnB]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common clinical presentation of nephrology in both developed and developing countries, which is caused by the disrupted function of glomerular filtration barrier. It always presents as massive proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, along with multiple complications, including infection, hypercoagulability and even acute kidney disease. Nephrotic syndrome can be divided into primary and secondary NS according to the etiology. Idiopathic NS presents with different types of pathological changes, including minimal change disease (MCD), membranous nephropathy (MN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). In addition, nephrotic syndrome can be secondary to diabetic nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, tumors and other diseases, which need to be carefully differentiated during diagnosis and treatment. Currently, immunosuppression, especially steroid is the mainstay of therapy for idiopathic NS, while the efficacy varies leaning on the different types of pathology. Despite decades of research into the molecular mechanisms underlying INS, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. In addition to genetic factors, growing evidence implicates circulating factors may act as key players in INS development. Several circulating mediators have been implicated, including cytokines such as IL-13 and TNFα, as well as cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (an IL-6 family member), hemopexin, and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Additionally, clonal expansion of CD8-positive T cells has been observed in INS patients compared to healthy controls. The efficacy of rituximab in steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome highlights a potential role for B lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, there is ongoing debate regarding the potential of anti-nephrin and anti-slit diaphragm antibodies as emerging biomarkers for MCD and FSGS. A multicenter study by Hengel et al. demonstrated that circulating anti-nephrin autoantibodies were frequently detected in both adult and pediatric patients with MCD and primary FSGS, suggesting their role as markers of disease activity. Pre-transplant screening for anti-nephrin autoantibodies has been shown to identify patients at risk for recurrent FSGS. In addition, autoantibodies targeting slit diaphragm proteins have been identified in patients with MCD and FSGS. Detection of anti-slit diaphragm antibodies in kidney biopsies allows for stratification of pediatric patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, identifying those most likely to benefit from second-line immunosuppressive therapies, which is associated with improved clinical outcomes. In membranous nephropathy, serum titers of antibodies to PLA2R are used for both diagnosis and monitoring of disease remission and relapse following treatment. Newly identified target antigens, including THSD7A, NELL1, EXT1/EXT2, NCAM1, PCDH7, and SEMA3B, may be linked to distinct clinical and pathological manifestations. Although serologic tests for these antigens are not yet widely available except for THSD7A, their potential therapeutic and prognostic significance worths further investigation. All these conclusions remind us that circular factors may target podocytes and then participate in the progression of INS, thus may act as an ideal non-invasive biomarker for accurate diagnosis and reflecting the response to treatment.

### The difference between patients with nephrotic syndrome and nephrotic-range proteinuria in IgA nephropathy: a propensity score matched cohort study [^113ejprw]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common primary glomerular diseases in the world. The disease typically follows a slow but relentless clinical course that will develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 30–40% of patients within 20 years after the diagnosis. The typical clinical manifestations of IgAN are hematuria and/or proteinuria. IgAN patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) are rare and account for about 5–10%. To date, NS has not been well characterized in patients with IgAN. Although hypoalbuminemia is a fundamental characteristic of NS, there are some patients that do not develop hypoalbuminemia despite with massive proteinuria. Few studies focused on patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and normal serum albumin. Whether decline in serum albumin is an ominous sign in IgAN patients with massive proteinuria remains unknown.

Therefore, in the present study, we intend to evaluate clinical and pathological features of IgAN with NS. And the differences for these features and long-term outcomes between patients with nephrotic syndrome and nephrotic-range proteinuria were also compared by propensity score matching method.

### Minimal change disease and idiopathic FSGS: manifestations of the same disease [^1112c6em]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

Minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are the key histological findings in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). Although MCD and idiopathic FSGS are often considered to represent separate entities based on differences in their presenting characteristics, histology and outcomes, little evidence exists for this separation. We propose that MCD and idiopathic FSGS are different manifestations of the same progressive disease. The gradual development of FSGS in patients with non-remitting or relapsing INS has been well documented. Moreover, FSGS is the uniform result of substantial podocyte loss in animal models, and a common feature of virtually all progressive human glomerulopathies. As evidence suggests a common aetiology, the pathogenesis of MCD and idiopathic FSGS should be studied together. In clinical trials, idiopathic FSGS should be considered to represent an advanced stage of disease progression that is less likely to respond to treatment than the earlier stage of disease, which is usually defined as MCD.

### The rationale and design of insight into nephrotic syndrome: investigating genes, health and therapeutics (INSIGHT): a prospective cohort study of childhood nephrotic syndrome [^114PMY7S]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is a commonly diagnosed kidney disease in childhood and treatment resistant forms can result in scarring of the kidney, eventually progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Nephrotic syndrome occurs when changes in the permselectivity barrier of the glomerular capillary wall can no longer restrict the loss of protein to a minimal level, thus resulting in massive protein loss through the urine. Nephrotic syndrome can result in lethal infections, thrombosis, and pulmonary edema as a result of the significant protein loss. The estimated incidence of nephrotic syndrome is between 2–7 per 100,000 children worldwide, with higher rates reported among those with African and South Asian ancestry. The specific causes of nephrotic syndrome are disputed, but are considered to be immune-mediated based on the evidence that steroids treat the underlying disease, and on observed associations of nephrotic syndrome with atopy. Prior to the initiation of steroid treatment in the 1960s, the risk of morbidity and mortality was extremely high. Most common clinical protocols provide at least 12–16 weeks of steroid therapy at diagnosis, followed by second line agents if the child is deemed steroid resistant, steroid dependant, or a frequent relapser. Current clinical convention is that the initial response to steroids will determine the long-term risk of disease progression; however, approximately 20% of children with nephrotic syndrome will not respond to steroids among those with European ancestry, and the rates of steroid treatment resistance are reported to be significantly higher among those with African (≈16–27%) and Asian (≈27–54%) ancestry (Table 1).

### Immunosuppressive treatment for primary membranous nephropathy in adults with nephrotic syndrome [^112SuzmB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Without treatment, approximately 30% of patients will experience spontaneous remission and one third will have persistent proteinuria. Approximately one-third of patients progress toward end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive treatment aims to protect kidney function and is recommended for patients who do not show improvement of proteinuria by supportive therapy, and for patients with severe nephrotic syndrome at presentation due to the high risk of developing ESKD. The efficacy and safety of different immunosuppressive regimens are unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review, first published in 2004 and updated in 2013.

Objectives

The aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different immunosuppressive treatments for adult patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 April 2021 with support from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating effects of immunosuppression in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data synthesis were performed using Cochrane-recommended methods. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Sixty-five studies (3807 patients) were included. Most studies exhibited a high risk of bias for the domains, blinding of study personnel, participants and outcome assessors, and most studies were judged unclear for randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment. Immunosuppressive treatment versus placebo/no treatment/non-immunosuppressive treatment In moderate certainty evidence, immunosuppressive treatment probably makes little or no difference to death, probably reduces the overall risk of ESKD (16 studies, 944 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99; I² = 22%), probably increases total remission (complete and partial) (6 studies, 879 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.97; I² = 73%) and complete remission (16 studies, 879 participants: RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.75; I² = 43%), and probably decreases the number with doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (9 studies, 447 participants: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.80; I² = 21%). However, immunosuppressive treatment may increase the number of patients relapsing after complete or partial remission (3 studies, 148 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.86; I² = 0%) and may lead to a greater number experiencing temporary or permanent discontinuation/hospitalisation due to adverse events (18 studies, 927 participants: RR 5.33, 95% CI 2.19 to 12.98; I² = 0%). Immunosuppressive treatment has uncertain effects on infection and malignancy. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids versus placebo/no treatment/steroids Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids had uncertain effects on death but may reduce the overall risk of ESKD (9 studies, 537 participants: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.74; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Total (9 studies, 468 participants: RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82; I² = 70%) and complete remission (8 studies, 432 participants: RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.38; I² = 37%) may increase, but had uncertain effects on the number of patients relapsing, and decreasing the number with doubling of SCr. Alkylating agents may be associated with a higher rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation or hospitalisation (8 studies 439 participants: RR 6.82, 95% CI 2.24 to 20.71; I² = 0%). Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids had uncertain effects on infection and malignancy. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) with or without steroids versus placebo/no treatment/supportive therapy/steroids We are uncertain whether CNI with or without steroids increased or decreased the risk of death or ESKD, increased or decreased total or complete remission, or reduced relapse after complete or partial remission (low to very low certainty evidence). CNI also had uncertain effects on decreasing the number with a doubling of SCr, temporary or permanent discontinuation or hospitalisation due to adverse events, infection, or malignancy. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) with or without steroids versus alkylating agents with or without steroids We are uncertain whether CNI with or without steroids increases or decreases the risk of death or ESKD. CNI with or without steroids may make little or no difference to total remission (10 studies, 538 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15; I² = 53%; moderate certainty evidence) or complete remission (10 studies, 538 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.56; I² = 56%; low certainty evidence). CNI with or without steroids may increase relapse after complete or partial remission. CNI with or without steroids had uncertain effects on SCr increase, adverse events, infection, and malignancy. Other immunosuppressive treatments Other interventions included azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions on these treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review strengthened the evidence that immunosuppressive therapy is probably superior to non-immunosuppressive therapy in inducing remission and reducing the number of patients that progress to ESKD. However, these benefits need to be balanced against the side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. The number of included studies with high-quality design was relatively small and most studies did not have adequate follow-up. Clinicians should inform their patients of the lack of high-quality evidence. An alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) combined with a corticosteroid regimen had short- and long-term benefits, but this was associated with a higher rate of adverse events. CNI (tacrolimus and cyclosporin) showed equivalency with alkylating agents however, the certainty of this evidence remains low. Novel immunosuppressive treatments with the biologic rituximab or use of adrenocorticotropic hormone require further investigation and validation in large and high-quality RCTs.

RATIONALE FOR MOLECULAR DISEASE DEFINITIONS IN NS

Defining NS in molecular terms is essential in precision medicine to identify appropriate therapeutic targets and improve clinical trial design. NEPTUNE investigators have had early success using multiple data domains to identify disease mechanisms activated in discrete subgroups of NS, and in identifying variability in specific molecular pathway signals in patients with FSGS and IgA nephropathy. These have served as starting points for matching patients for targeted therapies and resulted in the first molecular stratified phase 2 trial active in NS (/).

The therapeutic approach to childhood nephrotic syndrome is based on a series of studies that began with an international collaborative effort sponsored by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children in 1967. The characteristics of children presenting with nephrotic syndrome have changed over recent decades with greater frequency of the challenging condition focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and a greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, which may be resistant to glucocorticoids in the former and exacerbated by long-term glucocorticoid therapy in the latter 2 conditions. The Children's Nephrotic Syndrome Consensus Conference was formed to systematically review the published literature and generate a children's primary nephrotic syndrome guideline for use in educational, therapeutic, and research venues.

### Rationale and design of the nephrotic syndrome study network (NEPTUNE) match in glomerular diseases: designing the right trial for the right patient, today [^116zkr27]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Glomerular diseases are classified using a descriptive taxonomy that is not reflective of the heterogeneous underlying molecular drivers. This limits not only diagnostic and therapeutic patient management, but also impacts clinical trials evaluating targeted interventions. The Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) is poised to address these challenges. The study has enrolled > 850 pediatric and adult patients with proteinuric glomerular diseases who have contributed to deep clinical, histologic, genetic, and molecular profiles linked to long-term outcomes. The NEPTUNE Knowledge Network, comprising combined, multiscalar data sets, captures each participant's molecular disease processes at the time of kidney biopsy. In this editorial, we describe the design and implementation of NEPTUNE Match, which bridges a basic science discovery pipeline with targeted clinical trials. Noninvasive biomarkers have been developed for real-time pathway analyses. A Molecular Nephrology Board reviews the pathway maps together with clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic data assembled for each patient to compile a Match report that estimates the fit between the specific molecular disease pathway(s) identified in an individual patient and proposed clinical trials. The NEPTUNE Match report is communicated using established protocols to the patient and the attending nephrologist for use in their selection of available clinical trials. NEPTUNE Match represents the first application of precision medicine in nephrology with the aim of developing targeted therapies and providing the right medication for each patient with primary glomerular disease.

Initial corticosteroid regimen history and duration evidence — pediatric nephrotic syndrome: In the 1960s and 1970s, a consensus initial corticosteroid regimen was 60 mg/m²/d for 4 weeks followed by +40 mg/m²/d for 3 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks, with the follow-up dose later changed to every other day corticosteroids for ease of administration and no head-to-head comparisons available. While some early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a benefit of longer corticosteroid treatment (12–24 weeks) versus 8 weeks on risk of relapse, more recent studies have not consistently shown a benefit for extending the initial treatment course beyond 12 weeks.

### Design of the nephrotic syndrome study network (NEPTUNE) to evaluate primary glomerular nephropathy by a multidisciplinary approach [^116hKeSk]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) is a North American multicenter collaborative consortium established to develop a translational research infrastructure for nephrotic syndrome. This includes a longitudinal observational cohort study, a pilot and ancillary study program, a training program, and a patient contact registry. NEPTUNE will enroll 450 adults and children with minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy for detailed clinical, histopathological, and molecular phenotyping at the time of clinically indicated renal biopsy. Initial visits will include an extensive clinical history, physical examination, collection of urine, blood and renal tissue samples, and assessments of quality of life and patient-reported outcomes. Follow-up history, physical measures, urine and blood samples, and questionnaires will be obtained every 4 months in the first year and biannually, thereafter. Molecular profiles and gene expression data will be linked to phenotypic, genetic, and digitalized histological data for comprehensive analyses using systems biology approaches. Analytical strategies were designed to transform descriptive information to mechanistic disease classification for nephrotic syndrome and to identify clinical, histological, and genomic disease predictors. Thus, understanding the complexity of the disease pathogenesis will guide further investigation for targeted therapeutic strategies.

### Rationale and design of the nephrotic syndrome study network (NEPTUNE) match in glomerular diseases: designing the right trial for the right patient, today [^112NT1KP]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

On the basis of several assumptions, we can provide power to assess the comparison of binary treatment responses (e.g. proportion of participants with FSGS partial remission at 4 months, based on proteinuria, between trial participants with trial match alignment to those with no match alignment). We assume that all FSGS trials participating in the Match study, regardless of whether phase 2 or phase 3 with long- or short-term primary end points, capture proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate measurements at a common time point, allowing us to pool clinical outcome data. Our current data suggest that a sample size of 300 participants is relatively conservative. With this sample size, assuming a 2-sided type I (false-positive) error of 5%, that 50% of participants are on therapies for which their molecular profile is matched, and that participants are randomized 1:1 to active therapy and placebo, and using a 2-sample Fisher exact test, we would have at least 80% power to detect absolute group differences of 25% between outcome response frequency in patients who are assigned a matching trial treatment to nonmatched treatment responses of 20% to 30%; for example, we have 86% power to detect a difference of 25% treatment response in nonmatched participants versus 50% treatment response in matched participants. Because the pooled effect size will be mitigated by trials with ineffective therapies, we also assessed effect sizes for individual trials involved in the Match study. Taking a 75-patient phase 2 study as an example and using the same assumptions, we would have at least 80% power to detect absolute group differences of 50% with nonmatched treatment response of 20% to 30%; for example, we have 82% power to detect a difference of 25% treatment response for nonmatched participants and 75% treatment response for matched participants in a trial of 75 participants. Our power would likely be considerably greater if we were to compare continuous treatment differences, such as the change from baseline in urine protein/creatinine ratio, that we will be able to assess more completely as we gain more experience with the Match study.

### Corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children [^114QctqX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In nephrotic syndrome protein leaks from the blood to the urine through the glomeruli resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. Children with untreated nephrotic syndrome frequently die from infections. The majority of children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids. However about 70% of children experience a relapsing course with recurrent episodes of oedema and proteinuria. Corticosteroid usage has reduced the mortality rate in childhood nephrotic syndrome to around 3%, with infection remaining the most important cause of death. However corticosteroids have known adverse effects such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and adrenal suppression. The original treatment schedules for childhood nephrotic syndrome were developed in an ad hoc manner. The optimal doses and durations of corticosteroid therapy that are most beneficial and least harmful have not been clarified.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in preventing relapse in children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), Cochrane Renal Group Specialised Register (July 2002), MEDLINE (1966 - July 2002) and EMBASE (1980 - July 2002) without language restriction, reference lists of articles, abstracts from proceedings and contact with known investigators in the area.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children (aged three months to 18 years) in their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, if they compared different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using prednisone or other corticosteroid agent and if they had outcome data at six months or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently reviewed all eligible studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. The principle outcome measure was the number of children with and without relapse after six and 12–24 months. Secondary outcomes sought included the number of children who developed frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and adverse events. A random effects model was used to estimate summary effect measures (relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD)) after testing for heterogeneity. Meta-regression was used to explore potential between-study differences due to the baseline risk of relapse, study quality and types of interventions used.

Main Results

Five additional trials were included in the review for a total of 17 trials. A meta-analysis of six trials, which compared two months of prednisone with three months or more in the first episode, showed that the longer duration significantly reduced the risk of relapse at 12–24 months (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84) without an increase in adverse events. There was an inverse linear relationship between the duration of treatment and risk of relapse (RR = 1.26–0.112 duration; r² = 0.56; p = 0.03). The number of children who became frequent relapsers and the mean relapse rate/patient/year were also significantly reduced without increase in serious adverse events. In children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, deflazacort was significantly more effective in maintaining remission than prednisone (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Children in their first episode of SSNS should be treated for at least three months with an increase in benefit being demonstrated for up to seven months of treatment. In a population with a baseline risk for relapse following the first episode of 60% with two months of prednisone, daily prednisone for four weeks followed by alternate day therapy for six months would be expected to reduce the number of children experiencing a relapse by about 33%. In children who relapse frequently, deflazacort deserves further study.

### Rationale and design of the nephrotic syndrome study network (NEPTUNE) match in glomerular diseases: designing the right trial for the right patient, today [^116s5kQL]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

VISION FOR THE FUTURE

NEPTUNE Match represents an organized multidisciplinary effort to apply precision medicine approaches for the prioritization of clinical trials for patients with kidney disease, specifically primary glomerular disorders. It represents the first steps toward the goal of providing the right treatment in the optimal sequence for each individual patient. Match is in the formative stages and has achieved key objectives that are vital for the long-term success of this initiative. Looking to the future, we anticipate further innovation to improve the program and facilitate expansion across nephrology centers with a focus on precision medicine. Harmonization of sample collection, processing, and storage of biospecimens collected during routine medical care and clinical trial visits will ensure that patients can be evaluated for active, precision medicine–based clinical trials in a timely manner. It will enable prospective testing for matching with new trials that will be implemented in the future. Expanding the scope of collaboration with academic and industry partners will help sustain the discovery pipeline needed to define therapeutic targets and valid biomarker signatures in individual patients. In addition, it will expand the number of therapeutic options available to patients and provide them with additional decision support on potential efficacy, adverse effects, and feasibility of novel therapies being evaluated in clinical trials. NEPTUNE Match offers an opportunity to create an infrastructure of highly qualified sites that have the interest, personnel, institutional resources, and experience required to conduct trials of innovative precision medicine–based therapies. We anticipate that NEPTUNE Match will act as a catalyst for the design and implementation of novel trial designs, such as platform trials, adaptive trials, and SMART and n + 1 designsthat will facilitate the efficient evaluation of emerging therapeutic agents. In collaboration with regulatory agencies, suitable end points may be defined to expedite early-phase assessment of targeted therapies for susceptible patients and advance these agents into successively larger phase 2 and 3 studies. Finally, partnerships with patient support groups and regional and national nephrology societies can help all stakeholders appreciate the promise and limitation of precision medicine therapy for kidney disease. Such a clinical translational program can help roll out precision medicine trials in an ethical manner to meet the needs of the full range of patients, from pediatric to geriatric, affected by primary glomerular diseases. The challenge confronting the nephrology community to bring novel therapeutic modalities to glomerular disease clinics is substantial. Because of the commitment of research participants in our studies, we have a rich resource of samples, data, and knowledge in place to bring novel treatments to our patients.

### Childhood nephrotic syndrome [^112Gf2zh]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerular disease in children. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of its treatment, and steroid response is the main prognostic factor. Most children respond to a cycle of oral steroids, and are defined as having steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Among the children who do not respond, defined as having steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, most respond to second-line immunosuppression, mainly with calcineurin inhibitors, and children in whom a response is not observed are described as multidrug resistant. The pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome remains elusive. In cases of immune-mediated origin, dysregulation of immune cells and production of circulating factors that damage the glomerular filtration barrier have been described. Conversely, up to a third of cases of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome have a monogenic origin. Multidrug resistant nephrotic syndrome often leads to kidney failure and can cause relapse after kidney transplant. Although steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome does not affect renal function, most children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome have a relapsing course that requires repeated steroid cycles with significant side-effects. To minimise morbidity, some patients require steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents, including levamisole, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, and cyclophosphamide. Close monitoring and preventive measures are warranted at onset and during relapse to prevent acute complications (eg, hypovolaemia, acute kidney injury, infections, and thrombosis), whereas long-term management requires minimising treatment-related side-effects. A subset of patients have active disease into adulthood.

### Protein energy-wasting associated with nephrotic syndrome-the comparison of metabolic pattern in severe nephrosis to different stages of chronic kidney disease [^1155yB3p]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a rare clinical condition caused by glomerular filtration barrier damage due to glomerulopathy and is characterized by proteinuria exceeding 3.5 g/day, resulting in hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and oedema.

Pathophysiological studies have indicated that nephrotic syndrome is associated with a hypercatabolic state expressed as an exacerbated degradation of muscle mass, however, the clinical significance of this phenomenon has not yet been investigated.

Pathophysiology of protein metabolism and its regulation in nephrotic syndrome has been studied in detail since the 1950s. It has been found that aside from urinary loss of albumin, an increased fraction of this protein is catabolized in renal tubular cells. The intensified hepatic synthesis is insufficient to counterbalance the overall deficit and the hypoalbuminemia is present until the proteinuria ameliorates. Thus, it has been established that due to a loss of a large amount of protein, a decrease in the general body protein pool is observed in nephrotic patients. As muscles are the main source of amino acids, necessary substrates for hepatic synthesis of lost plasma proteins, the catabolic state existing in nephrotic patients is manifested by a reduction in lean tissue. However, the problem of hypercatabolism and malnutrition seems to be neglected in this population. This is probably due to the low incidence of glomerulopathies, estimated at 1–2 people per 100,000 (for primary glomerulopathies) with only about 50% of them displaying clinical signs of nephrotic syndrome and an even lower frequency with a severe course of the disease.

Main text

Renal manifestations in IGAV/HSP

Renal involvement occurs in a variable proportion (20–60%) of children suffering from IGAV/HSP. Vast majority of children with IGAV/HSP (97%) develop features of renal involvement within 6 months of disease onset, but sometimes HSPN may occur later. The renal disease spectrum ranges from urinary abnormalities (including hematuria or/and proteinuria) through nephritic and nephrotic syndrome to chronic renal failure. Renal involvement is typically mild and manifested only by pathological urine findings. The greatest number of patients with HSPN, about 50% of them, develop simultaneous hematuria and proteinuria. Nephritic or nephrotic syndrome occurs in about 20% of HSPN patients. Chronic renal failure in children was noted to occur in a wide range of proportions of patients, from 1 to 15%. Patients with both nephritic and nephrotic syndrome have the highest risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD): more than 50% of them will develop long-term renal impairment, compared to about 5% of patients with urinary abnormalities (hematuria and/or proteinuria).

### Minimal change disease [^1124Nwzw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on minimal change disease:

- **Definition**: MCD is a glomerular disorder characterized by nephrotic syndrome and minimal histologic changes on light microscopy, with diffuse podocyte foot process effacement visible on electron microscopy. It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and can also occur in adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of MCD is not fully understood, but it is thought to T-cell-mediated immune dysregulation leading to the release of a circulating permeability factor. This factor causes podocyte injury and widespread effacement of foot processes, resulting in increased glomerular permeability and massive proteinuria.
- **Epidemiology**: MCD accounts for approximately 70–90% of nephrotic syndrome cases in children and 10–15% in adults. The incidence is higher in boys during childhood but becomes more balanced in adulthood. It may occur at any age, with peaks in early childhood and a smaller peak in late adulthood. The estimated incidence in children is 2–7 cases per 100,000.
- **Risk factors**: The risk factors for MCD are primarily young age, family history of nephrotic syndrome.
- **Disease course**: Patients with MCD typically present with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by periorbital, lower extremity, and genital edema, frothy urine, and in severe cases, anasarca with ascites and pleural or pericardial effusions. Presentation may follow an upper respiratory infection and is occasionally complicated by intravascular volume depletion and oliguria. Infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, and peritonitis are common, particularly in children, due to immunoglobulin loss and impaired T-cell function. AKI is more common in adults but may occur in children, especially when accompanied by diarrhea, diuretic use, or sepsis. Gross hematuria is rare, occurring in roughly 3% of cases, but microhematuria may be seen in up to 20%. Laboratory findings include 3+/4+ proteinuria on dipstick and nephrotic-range proteinuria on quantification. Serum albumin is typically < 2 g/dL, with accompanying hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, elevated α₂-globulin, and reduced γ-globulin. Immunoglobulin profile shows decreased IgG and IgA, and elevated IgM and IgE. Hypercoagulability is common due to urinary loss of antithrombin III, hemoconcentration, thrombocytosis, and elevated fibrinogen and clotting factors, increasing the risk of venous thrombosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of MCD is generally favorable, with excellent long-term kidney survival in patients who respond to corticosteroids. Most patients respond well to corticosteroids, with remission rates exceeding 90% in children and 80% in adults. However, relapses are common, especially in children, with approximately 60–70% experiencing at least one relapse. A minority develop frequent relapses or steroid dependence. Progression to CKD or end-stage kidney disease is rare, particularly in steroid-responsive cases.

### Interventions for minimal change disease in adults with nephrotic syndrome [^117AB8HY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Steroids have been used widely since the early 1970s for the treatment of adult-onset minimal change disease (MCD). Recently, newer agents have been used in adult MCD aiming to reduce the risk of adverse effects. The response rates to immunosuppressive agents in adult MCD are more variable than in children. The optimal agent, dose, and duration of treatment for the first episode of nephrotic syndrome, or for disease relapse(s) have not been determined. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.

Objectives

We aimed to 1) evaluate the benefits and harms of different agents, including both immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive agents, in adults with MCD causing the nephrotic syndrome; and 2) evaluate the efficacy of interventions on 'time-to-remission' of nephrotic syndrome, in adults with MCD causing the nephrotic syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 21 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention for MCD with nephrotic syndrome in adults over 18 years were included. Studies comparing different types, routes, frequencies, and duration of immunosuppressive agents and non-immunosuppressive agents were assessed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Fifteen RCTs (769 randomised participants) were identified; four studies evaluated different prednisolone regimens, eight studies evaluated the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (tacrolimus or cyclosporin), two studies evaluated enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) and one study evaluated levamisole. In all but two studies of non-corticosteroid agents, reduced-dose prednisolone was given with the treatment agent and the comparator was high-dose prednisolone. In the risk of bias assessment, 11 and seven studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. No studies were at low risk of performance bias and eight studies were at low risk of detection bias. Thirteen, 10 and six studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively. Compared with no specific treatment, it is uncertain whether prednisolone increases the number with complete remission (1 study, 28 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.19), complete or partial remission (1 study, 28 participants: RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.95), subsequent relapse (1 study, 28 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.17), or reduces the adverse effects because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Compared with oral prednisolone alone, it is uncertain whether intravenous methylprednisolone and prednisolone increase the number with complete remission (2 studies, 35 participants: RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 18.32; I² = 90%), relapse (two studies, 19 participants. RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.15; I² = 0%) or adverse events because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Compared with prednisolone alone, CNIs with reduced-dose prednisolone or without prednisolone probably make little or no difference to the number achieving complete remission (8 studies; 492 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05; I² = 0%), complete or partial remission (4 studies, 269 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; I² = 0%), or relapse (7 studies; 422 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.03; I² = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of obesity or Cushing's Syndrome (5 studies; 388 participants: RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.59; I² = 45%) and the risk of acne (4 studies; 270 participants: RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.67; I² = 0%) (low certainty evidence); and had uncertain effects on diabetes or hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and acute kidney injury (AKI) (low certainty evidence). Compared with prednisolone alone, EC-MPS with reduced-dose prednisolone probably make little or no difference to the number undergoing complete remission at 4 weeks (1 study, 114 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50), and at 24 weeks probably make little or no difference to the number undergoing complete remission (2 studies, 134 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.38; I² = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), complete or partial remission (2 studies 134 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; I² = 0%), relapse (2 studies, 83 participants: RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.74; I² = 56%) (low certainty evidence); or to the adverse events of new-onset glucose intolerance, death, or AKI (low certainty evidence). One study (24 participants) compared levamisole and prednisolone with prednisolone in patients with relapsing disease. The authors identified no differences in mean relapse rate or adverse effects but no standard deviations were provided.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review has identified evidence for the efficacy and adverse effects of CNIs and EC-MPS with or without reduced-dose prednisolone compared with prednisolone alone for the induction of remission in adults with MCD and nephrotic syndrome with some reductions in steroid-associated adverse events. RCT data on the efficacy and adverse effects of rituximab in adults with MCD are awaited. Further, adequately powered RCTs are required to determine the relative efficacies of CNIs and EC-MPS and to evaluate these medications in patients with relapsing or steroid-resistant disease.

### Childhood nephrotic syndrome – current and future therapies [^117DLb6d]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

The introduction of corticosteroids more than 50 years ago dramatically improved the prognosis of children with nephrotic syndrome. Corticosteroids remain the standard initial treatment for children with this disease, but a considerable proportion of patients do not respond and are therefore at risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease. Because of this risk, new therapeutic strategies are needed for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. These strategies have historically focused on identifying effective alternative immunosuppressive agents, such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus, yet evidence now indicates that nephrotic syndrome results from podocyte dysfunction. Even conventional immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and ciclosporin, directly affect podocyte structure and function, challenging the 'immune theory' of the pathogenesis of childhood nephrotic syndrome in which disease is caused by T cells. This Review summarizes the currently available treatments for childhood nephrotic syndrome, and discusses selected novel pathways in podocytes that could be targeted for the development of next-generation treatments for children with this syndrome.

### Human albumin infusion for treating oedema in people with nephrotic syndrome [^113B8aVV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Oedema is a common clinical symptom in people with nephrotic syndrome and human albumin has been widely used in the treatment of oedema by increasing vascular volume and this inducing diuresis. It may be used with or without diuretics such as furosemide. However, the quantitative contribution of human albumin in treating oedema is not fully understood. If human albumin were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of oedema, it could help clinicians to develop therapeutic strategies to improve the management of diuretic resistance associated with nephrotic syndrome.

Objectives

This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of human albumin infusion for treating oedema associated with nephrotic syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 June 2019 through contact with the Information Specialists using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effect of human albumin infusion compared with placebo or no intervention, human albumin with diuretics compared with diuretic alone, human albumin compared with diuretics and other treatments, clinical outcomes, death, quality of life, kidney function and adverse effects in people with nephrotic syndrome. We excluded cross-over studies but data for the first period was to be included if available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias, study quality and extracted data. We calculated mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

One study met our inclusion criteria (26 children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome) and 11 were excluded (nine cross-over studies, one where albumin was not used for nephrotic syndrome and one where authors did not state whether the children had oedema). Risk of bias for the included study was unclear for selection bias, high for performance and detection bias, low for attrition bias, and high for selective reporting. The included study compared albumin plus furosemide with an equal volume of dextrose. Of our prespecified outcomes, the authors reported clinical improvement as weight change, serum sodium and adverse outcomes (blood pressure). The authors reported a greater weight loss in the albumin treated group initially but no difference overall at 10 days. However, the data in the text and the figures were inconsistent so we could not confirm the authors statements (very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether albumin infusion improves serum sodium when compared with an equal volume of dextrose (MD 2.00 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 4.09), systolic blood pressure (MD 2.00 mmHg, 95% CI -3.52 to 7.52) or diastolic blood pressure (MD 2.00 mmHg, 95%CI -4.29 to 8.29). Death, quality of life, and kidney function were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified only one small study that was relevant to our review, therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the use of human albumin with or without diuretics in nephrotic syndrome. More RCTs are needed.

### Nephrotic syndrome: components, connections, and angiopoietin-like 4-related therapeutics [^115Bvqhr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome is recognized by the presence of proteinuria in excess of 3.5 g/24 h along with hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia), and lipiduria. Each component has been investigated individually over the past four decades with some success. Studies published recently have started unraveling the molecular basis of proteinuria and its relationship with other components. We now have improved understanding of the threshold for nephrotic-range proteinuria and the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia. These studies reveal that modifying sialylation of the soluble glycoprotein angiopoietin-like 4 or changing key amino acids in its sequence can be used successfully to treat proteinuria. Treatment strategies on the basis of fundamental relationships among different components of nephrotic syndrome use naturally occurring pathways and have great potential for future development into clinically relevant therapeutic agents.

### The immune system and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [^114FWp3a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome often responds to immunosuppressive treatment. Nevertheless, this syndrome-and the drugs used to treat it-remain important causes of patient morbidity. Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is usually caused by minimal change disease or FSGS, diseases that primarily affect the podocytes. In spite of decades of research, the underlying causes of both diseases remain incompletely understood. There is, however, a large body of observational and experimental data linking the immune system with both minimal change disease and FSGS, including associations with systemic infections and hematologic malignancies. Perhaps most compellingly, many different immunomodulatory drugs are effective for treating idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, including biologic agents that have well-defined immune targets. In fact, the unexpected efficacy of targeted therapeutic agents has provided important new insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases. Given the large number of drugs that are available to deplete or block specific cells and molecules within the immune system, a better understanding of the immunologic causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome may lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

### Use of urinary NGAL in steroid-resistant vs. steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112UxcVB]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Urinary NGAL demonstrated significant potential as an early, non-invasive marker for identifying steroid resistance in nephrotic syndrome. The diagnostic accuracy, biological plausibility, and relevance across populations support its inclusion in clinical assessment protocols. With further validation, NGAL could play a central role in personalizing treatment strategies, minimizing unnecessary steroid exposure, and improving outcomes in pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders presenting with massive proteinuria within the first 3 months of life almost inevitably leading to end-stage kidney disease. The Work Group for the European Reference Network for Kidney Diseases (ERKNet) and the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) has developed consensus statement on genetic aspects of CNS diagnosis and management. The presented expert opinion recommends genetic diagnostics as the key diagnostic test to be ordered already during the initial evaluation of the patient, discusses which phenotyping workup should be performed and presents known genotype–phenotype correlations.

### Approach to diagnosis and management of primary glomerular diseases due to podocytopathies in adults: core curriculum 2020 [^112urY1m]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Podocyte injury is the initiating step in the pathway toward clinically evident forms of nephrotic syndrome known as podocytopathies, represented as either minimal change disease (MCD) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). There are hallmark differences in the histologic appearances of MCD and FSGS, which in turn represent distinct pathogenic models after initial podocyte injury (eg, no change in podocyte number in MCD vs podocyte detachment and death in FSGS). However, MCD and FSGS also share a number of common causes, supporting the theory that these diseases lie along a shared podocytopathy spectrum. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we demonstrate how the podocytopathies can be classified according to pathogenesis and treatment response as an alternative to histologic description. Using case examples, we show how these alternative classification schemes can assist not only diagnosis, but also long-term management of podocytopathies.

### Nephrotic syndrome in childhood [^112yptVM]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Childhood nephrotic syndromes are most commonly caused by one of two idiopathic diseases: minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). A third distinct type, membranous nephropathy, is rare in children. Other causes of isolated nephrotic syndrome can be subdivided into two major categories: rare genetic disorders, and secondary diseases associated with drugs, infections, or neoplasia. The cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome remains unknown, but evidence suggests it may be a primary T-cell disorder that leads to glomerular podocyte dysfunction. Genetic studies in children with familial nephrotic syndrome have identified mutations in genes that encode important podocyte proteins. Patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are initially treated with corticosteroids. Steroid-responsiveness is of greater prognostic use than renal histology. Several second-line drugs, including alkylating agents, ciclosporin, and levamisole, may be effective for complicated and steroid-unresponsive MCNS and FSGS patients. Nephrotic syndrome is associated with several medical complications, the most severe and potentially fatal being bacterial infections and thromboembolism. Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is a chronic relapsing disease for most steroid-responsive patients, whereas most children with refractory FSGS ultimately develop end-stage renal disease. Research is being done to further elucidate the disorder's molecular pathogenesis, identify new prognostic indicators, and to develop better approaches to treatment.

### What is the difference between IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis? [^113HqmNZ]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are considered to be related diseases since both can be encountered consecutively in the same patient, they have been described in twins, and bear identical pathological and biological abnormalities. Apart from the presence of extrarenal clinical signs found only in HSPN, other differences are noticed between the two diseases. The peak age ranges between 15 and 30 years for a diagnosis of IgAN, whereas HSPN is mainly seen in childhood. Nephritic and/or nephrotic syndromes are more often seen at presentation in HSPN. In contrast to IgAN, HSPN has been described in association with hypersensitivity. Endocapillary and extracapillary inflammations as well as fibrin deposits in the glomerulus are more frequent in HSPN. No major biological differences have been found between the two illnesses, except for a larger size of circulating IgA-containing complexes (IgA-CC) and a greater incidence of increased plasma IgE levels in HSPN. As tissue infiltration by leukocytes is a major feature of HSPN vasculitis, a possible role of a more potent activation of the latter cells by IgA-CC and/or circulating chemokines in HSPN should be considered. Further studies are required to elucidate this possible mechanism as well as the role of hypersensitivity in HSPN.

### The autoimmune architecture of childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [^113PChho]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, the most common glomerular disorder in children, has long been considered an immune-mediated disease based on the efficacy of glucocorticoids at inducing remission. Nevertheless, the immune processes leading to podocytopathy have largely remained elusive. The success of B-cell depletion with rituximab, descriptions of B-cell dysregulation during active disease, and the most recent discovery of autoantibodies targeting the major podocyte antigen nephrin point to an autoimmune humoral etiology for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Investigations of the immune factors involved in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome pathogenesis have uncovered common features with other autoimmune disorders that will aid in prognostication and in guiding the expansion of our glucocorticoid-sparing therapeutic arsenal. In this review, we discuss the emerging autoimmune architecture of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, with a specific focus on pediatric steroid-sensitive disease, including the podocyte-reactive B-cell response that causes anti-podocyte antibodies, the predisposing genetic factors that shape the podocyte-reactive immune landscape, and the immune triggers driving active disease.

### Genetics of nephrotic syndrome presenting in childhood: core curriculum 2019 [^111uor5w]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most challenging conditions to manage and treat, partly because we lack a specific molecular understanding of its pathogenesis and progression. This limits our ability to provide targeted therapy or precise prognostications. Fortunately, genomic discovery in NS and its translation to genomic-informed medicine is allowing us to improve our understanding of the molecular anatomy of NS and our ability to care for patients with NS. In this Core Curriculum, we review the specific genes and loci discovered in childhood NS, specifically NS of Mendelian origin, APOL1-associated NS in black patients, HLA region variants associated with steroid-sensitive NS, their biological impacts, prevalence across populations, and clinical correlates. We also review the fundamentals of genetic architecture of human disease, technologies, and analytic strategies that currently exist to discover disease-related genetic variations. A facility with the concepts and vocabulary of modern genomics and ability to interpret results of genetic studies are essential skills for nephrologists caring for children with NS. As such, we hope to empower them to understand the literature in this area, appropriately order genetic tests and accurately interpret the results, and consider how they may participate in or drive the next wave of genomic discoveries in NS.

### Thromboembolic complications in the nephrotic syndrome: pathophysiology and clinical management [^115eftH5]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with the nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of developing venous and arterial thromboembolism, the most common of which is renal vein thrombosis. There are several unanswered or controversial issues relating to the nephrotic syndrome and thromboembolism, which include the mechanism of thromboembolism, and optimal diagnostic and anticoagulant management strategies. This review will discuss several of these issues: the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of thromboembolic disease occurring in patients with the nephrotic syndrome; the pathophysiology of the hypercoagulable state associated with the nephrotic syndrome; the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in the nephrotic syndrome; and the evidence for prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation strategies in such patients.

### Interventions for minimal change disease in adults with nephrotic syndrome [^115z3zYV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Steroids have been used widely since the early 1970s for the treatment of adult-onset minimal change disease. The response rates to immunosuppressive agents in adult minimal change disease, especially steroids, are more variable than in children. The optimal agent, dose, and duration of treatment for the first episode of nephrotic syndrome, or for disease relapse(s) has not been determined.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of interventions for the nephrotic syndrome in adults caused by minimal change disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference articles and abstracts from conference proceedings, without language restriction. Search date: January 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention for minimal change disease in adults over 18 years with the nephrotic syndrome were included. Studies comparing different routes, frequencies, and duration of immunosuppressive agents were selected. Studies comparing non-immunosuppressive agents were also assessed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results were expressed as a relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, or mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Three RCTs (68 participants) were identified. All treatment comparisons contained only one study. No significant difference was found between prednisone compared with placebo for complete (RR 1.44, CI 0.95 to 2.19) and partial remission (RR 1.00, CI 0.07 to 14.45) of the nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease. There was no difference between intravenous methylprednisolone plus oral prednisone compared with oral prednisone alone for complete remission (RR 0.74, CI 0.50 to 1.08). Prednisone, compared with short-course intravenous methylprednisolone, increased the number of subjects who achieved complete remission (RR 4.95, CI 1.15 to 21.26). The lack of statistical evidence of efficacy associated with prednisone therapy was based on data derived from a single study that compared 'alternate-day prednisone' to no immunosuppression' with only a small number of participants in each group. No RCTs were identified comparing regimens in adults with a steroid-dependent or relapsing disease course or comparing treatments comprising alkylating agents, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levamisole, or mycophenolate mofetil.

Authors' Conclusions

Further comparative studies are required to examine the efficacy of immunosuppressive agents for achievement of sustained remission of nephrotic syndrome caused by minimal change disease. Studies are also needed to evaluate treatments for adults with steroid-dependent or relapsing disease.

### Corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children [^114KULCy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In nephrotic syndrome protein leaks from blood into the urine through the glomeruli resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the death rate to around 3%. However, corticosteroids have well recognised potentially serious adverse effects such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2015.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS, and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 May 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (one to 18 years) in their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this 2020 review update 16 new included studies were identified providing a total of 48 included studies with 3941 randomised participants. Risk of bias methodology was often poorly performed with only 25 studies and 22 studies respectively assessed to be at low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Only nine studies (19%) were at low risk of bias for performance (blinding of participants and personnel) and 11 studies were at low risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); nine of these studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. Twenty-two studies (fewer than 50%) were at low risk for attrition bias and 23 studies were at low risk for reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). In seven studies, which evaluated children in their initial episode of SSNS and were at low risk of bias for selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with frequent relapses when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.19; 585 participants, 4 studies; I2 = 0%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 376 participants, 3 studies; I2 = 35%; high certainty evidence). In analyses of eight studies at low risk of selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with any relapse by 12 to 24 months when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 637 participants; 5 studies; I2 = 47%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11; 377 participants, 3 studies; I2 = 53%). Little or no difference was noted in adverse effects between the different treatment durations. Among children with relapsing SSNS, two small studies showed that time to remission did not differ between prednisone doses of 1 mg/kg compared with the conventional dose of 2 mg/kg (MD 0.71 days, 95% CI -0.43 to 1.86; 79 participants) and that the total prednisone dose administered was lower (MD -20.60 mg/kg, 95% CI -25.65 to -15.55; 20 participants). Two studies found little or no difference in the number with relapse at six months when comparing dosing by weight with dosing by surface area (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49; 146 participants). One study found a reduced risk of relapse with low daily dosing compared with alternate daily dosing (MD -0.90 number of relapses/year, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.47). Four studies found that in children with frequently relapsing disease, daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment reduced the risk of relapse.

Authors' Conclusions

There are now four well designed studies randomising 823 children which have clearly demonstrated that there is no benefit of prolonging prednisone therapy beyond two to three months in the first episode of SSNS. Small studies in children with relapsing disease have identified no differences in the times to remission using half the conventional induction dose of 2 mg/kg or 60 mg/m². It is imperative that a much larger study be carried out to confirm these findings. Lower dose prednisone therapy administered daily during an upper respiratory infection or other infection reduces the risk of relapse compared with continuing alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone based on four small studies. The results of a much larger RCT enrolling more than 300 children are awaited to determine the relative efficacies and adverse effects of using alternate-day compared with daily prednisone to prevent relapse in children with intercurrent infections.

### Interventions for idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children [^116Goyx7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The majority of children who present with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome achieve remission with corticosteroid therapy. Children who fail to respond to corticosteroids in the first episode of nephrotic syndrome (initial resistance) or develop resistance after one or more responses to corticosteroids (delayed resistance) may be treated with immunosuppressive agents including calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (cyclosporin or tacrolimus) and with non-immunosuppressive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). However, response to these agents is limited so newer agents are being assessed for efficacy. This is an update of a review first published in 2004 and updated in 2006, 2010 and 2016.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of different interventions used in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, who do not achieve remission following four weeks or more of daily corticosteroid therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies to 17 September 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were included if they compared different immunosuppressive agents or non-immunosuppressive agents with placebo, prednisone or other agent given orally or parenterally in children aged three months to 18 years with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Studies, which enrolled children and adults but in which paediatric data could not be separated from adult data, were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, results were expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. Data were pooled using the random effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Twenty-five studies (1063 participants) were included. Fourteen studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. Five and 19 studies were at low risk of performance and detection bias. Fourteen, 14 and 13 studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias respectively. Cyclosporin compared with placebo or no treatment may increase the number of participants who achieve complete remission (4 studies, 74 participants: RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.09 to 11.20) or complete or partial remission (4 studies, 74 children: RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 9.57) by 6 months (low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether cyclosporin increases the likelihood of worsening hypertension or reduces the likelihood of end-stage kidney disease (very low certainty evidence). CNI compared with IV cyclophosphamide (CPA) may increase the number of participants with complete or partial remission at 3 to 6 months (2 studies, 156 children: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.13) (low certainty evidence) and probably reduces the number with treatment failure (non response, serious infection, persistently elevated creatinine (1 study, 124 participants: RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58) (moderate certainty evidence) with little or no increase in serious infections (1 study, 131 participants: RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.56) (moderate certainty evidence). Tacrolimus compared with cyclosporin may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete or partial remission (2 studies, 58 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25) (low certainty evidence) or in the number with worsening hypertension (2 studies, 58 participants: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.15) (low certainty evidence). Cyclosporin compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and dexamethasone probably makes little or no difference to the number who achieve complete or partial remission (1 study, 138 participants: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24) (moderate certainty evidence) and makes little or no difference to the number dying (1 study, 138 participants: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24) or with 50% reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1 study, 138 participants: RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.46 to 11.41) (low certainty evidence). Among children, who have achieved complete remission, tacrolimus compared with MMF may increase the number of children who maintain complete or partial response for 12 months (1 study, 60 children: RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.07) (low certainty evidence). Oral CPA with prednisone compared with prednisone alone may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete remission (2 studies, 84 children: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87) (low certainty evidence). IV CPA compared with oral CPA (2 studies, 61 children: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.85) and IV compared with oral CPA plus IV dexamethasone (1 study, 49 children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.96) may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete remission (low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether rituximab and cyclosporin compared with cyclosporin increases the likelihood of remission because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether adalimumab or galactose compared with conservative therapy increases the likelihood of remission because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Two studies reported that ACEi may reduce proteinuria in children with SRNS. One study reported that the dual angiotensin II and endothelin Type A receptor antagonist, sparsentan, may reduce proteinuria more effectively than the angiotensin receptor blocker, irbesartan.

Authors' Conclusions

To date RCTs have demonstrated that CNIs may increase the likelihood of complete or partial remission compared with placebo/no treatment or CPA. For other regimens assessed, it remains uncertain whether the interventions alter outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is low. Further adequately powered, well designed RCTs are needed to evaluate other regimens for children with idiopathic SRNS. Since SRNS represents a spectrum of diseases, future studies should enrol children from better defined groups of patients with SRNS.

Adult minimal change disease epidemiology and steroid response — In contrast to children, MCD accounts for only 10%-15% of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults. The majority of adult patients (> 80%) respond within 8 weeks and often more quickly, although there are reports of patients responding after nearly 16 weeks of therapy. No randomized trials have been done to identify optimal dose or duration of steroid therapy for MCD in adults, and a randomized trial comparing high-dose intravenous and oral steroid versus oral steroid alone found no difference in complete remission between the groups.

### Genetic testing in nephrotic syndrome – challenges and opportunities [^115Pr4uc]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Monogenic nephrotic syndrome (nephrotic syndrome caused by a single gene defect) is responsible for only a small percentage of cases of nephrotic syndrome, but information from studies of the unique cohort of patients with this form of the disease has dramatically improved our understanding of the disease pathogenesis. The use of genetic testing in the management of children and adults with nephrotic syndrome poses unique challenges for clinicians in terms of who to test and how to use the information obtained from testing in the clinical setting. In our view, not enough data exist at present to justify the routine genetic testing of all patients with nephrotic syndrome. Testing is warranted, however, in patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (onset at 0–3 months), infantile nephrotic syndrome (onset at 3–12 months), a family history of nephrotic syndrome, and those in whom nephrotic syndrome is associated with other congenital malformations. The family and/or the patient should be given complete and unbiased information on the potential benefits and risks associated with therapy, including the reported outcomes of treatment in patients with similar mutations. Based on the data available in the literature so far, intensive immunosuppressive treatment is probably not indicated in monogenic nephrotic syndrome if complete or partial remission has not been achieved within 6 weeks of starting treatment. We advocate that family members of individuals with genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome undergo routine genetic testing prior to living-related kidney transplantation. Prospective, multicentre studies are needed to more completely determine the burden of disease caused by monogenic nephrotic syndrome, and randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the presence or absence of clinical responses of monogenic nephrotic syndrome to available therapies.

### Corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children [^114gAeZR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In nephrotic syndrome, protein leaks from the blood into the urine through the glomeruli, resulting in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. While most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, 80% experience a relapsing course. Corticosteroids have reduced the death rate to around 3%; however, corticosteroids have well-recognised potentially serious adverse events such as obesity, poor growth, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma and behavioural disturbances. This is an update of a review first published in 2000 and updated in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2015 and 2020.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different corticosteroid regimens in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). The benefits and harms of therapy were studied in two groups of children: 1) children in their initial episode of SSNS and 2) children who experience a relapsing course of SSNS.

Search Methods

We contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in children (one to 18 years) during their initial or subsequent episode of SSNS, comparing different durations, total doses or other dose strategies using any corticosteroid agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

In this 2024 update, we included five new studies, resulting in 54 studies randomising 4670 children. Risk of bias methodology was often poorly performed, with only 31 studies and 28 studies respectively assessed to be at low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Ten studies were at low risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), and 12 studies were at low risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment); nine of these studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. Twenty-seven studies (fewer than 50%) were at low risk for attrition bias, and 26 studies were at low risk for reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). In studies at low risk of selection bias evaluating children in their initial episode of SSNS, there is little or no difference in the number of children with frequent relapses when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 755 children, 5 studies; I² = 0%; high certainty evidence) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 376 children, 3 studies; I² = 35%; high certainty evidence). In analyses of studies at low risk of selection bias, there is little or no difference in the number of children with any relapse by 12 to 24 months when comparing two months of prednisone with three months or more (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06; 808 children; 6 studies; I² = 47%) or when comparing three months with five to seven months of therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11; 377 children, 3 studies; I² = 53%). Little or no difference was noted in adverse events between the different treatment durations. Amongst children with relapsing SSNS, four small studies (177 children) utilising lower doses of prednisone compared with standard regimens found little or no differences between groups in the numbers with relapse (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20; I² = 0%). A fifth study (117 children) reported little or no difference between two weeks and four weeks of alternate-day prednisone after remission with daily prednisone. A recent large, well-designed study with 271 children found that administering daily prednisone compared with alternate-day prednisone or no prednisone during viral infection did not reduce the risk of relapse. In contrast, four previous small studies in children with frequently relapsing disease had reported that daily prednisone during viral infections compared with alternate-day prednisone or no treatment reduced the risk of relapse.

Authors' Conclusions

There are four well-designed studies randomising 823 children, which have demonstrated that there is no benefit of prolonging prednisone therapy beyond two to three months in the first episode of SSNS. Small studies in children with relapsing disease have identified no differences in efficacy using lower induction doses or shorter durations of prednisone therapy. Large, well-designed studies are required to confirm these findings. While previous small studies had suggested that changing from alternate-day to daily prednisone therapy at the onset of infection reduced the likelihood of relapse, a much larger and well-designed study found no reduction in the number relapsing when administering daily prednisone at the onset of infection.

To date, nephrotic syndrome (NS) has not been well characterized in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Whether decline in serum albumin is an ominous sign in IgAN patients with massive proteinuria remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated clinical and pathological features of IgAN with NS and compared the differences for these features and long-term outcomes between patients with nephrotic syndrome and nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted, enrolling 1013 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN. The primary endpoint was the composite of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine, 50% reduction in eGFR, ESKD (eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²) or death.

Results

A total of 59 patients were presented with NS (5.8%). The patients with NS showed lower levels of hemoglobin, albumin and higher levels of serum creatinine, serum uric acid and urinary protein than patients without NS. As for pathological parameters, more patients with NS showed a higher prevalence of E1 lesions, T1/2 and C1/2 lesions. Furthermore, we used the propensity score matching method to select 57 patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and normal serum albumin (NR group) who were comparable to 59 patients with NS. Patients with NS had lower levels of hemoglobin, albumin and IgG and higher levels of TC, LDL, FIB and D-dimer as well as more severe E1 and C1/2 lesions than those in NR group. The S1 lesion was more severe in the NR group than that in the NS group. There was no significant difference in long-term outcome between the two groups. In addition, we found that serum albumin level or the presence of hypoalbuminemia was not a risk factor affecting long-term outcome in patients with massive proteinuria.

Conclusions

A prevalence of 5.8% of NS was presented in IgAN adult patients in our study. IgAN with NS patients had low levels of hemoglobin, albumin, high levels of serum creatinine, serum uric acid, urinary protein and more acute lesions. The prognosis of NS in patients with IgAN was not inferior to that of patients with nephrotic range proteinuria and normal serum albumin.

### Diagnosis and management of nephrotic syndrome in… [^113oXevN]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome consists of peripheral edema, heavy proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia, often with hyperlipidemia. Patients typically present with edema and fatigue, without heart failure or severe liver disease. Although there is limited evidence to guide management decisions, recent expert consensus guidelines and systematic reviews provide updated recommendations. This article focuses on diagnosis and management of NS in adults, which is different from that in children. Complications Various systemic complications are commonly associated with NS. These are thought to result from overproduction of hepatic proteins and loss of low-molecular-weight proteins in the urine, although the specific mechanisms have not been fully described. 5 It is generally not necessary to screen otherwise asymptomatic patients for these complications. Figure 1 is an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of NS.

INFECTION Bacterial infections, especially cellulitis, are a potential complication of NS. A Cochrane review found no relevant studies of infections in adults with NS. 8 There are no reliable data on the incidence of infection as a complication of NS and no current guidelines for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in adults with NS. RENAL FAILURE Acute kidney injury is considered a rare spontaneous complication of NS. It can coexist with NS when it is caused by the same factors that lead to edema and proteinuria, such as lupus nephritis and drug-induced interstitial nephritis. 1, 9 Although acute kidney injury is uncommon in NS, tests for renal function, quantification of proteinuria, serum chemistry, and lipid profile are appropriate to assess renal function and determine the degree of hyperlipidemia. Table 3 shows the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury in patients with NS.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA Elevated lipid levels are a common feature of NS. Any subtype of lipoprotein concentrations can be elevated. There are no recent epidemiologic data to indicate how common or severe this complication is, and no recent data regarding the impact of treatment for dyslipidemia associated with NS. However, resolving proteinuria and any underlying disease process is believed to improve or resolve the dyslipidemia. 1, 10. TREATING DYSLIPIDEMIA A recent Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine if lipid-lowering agents are helpful in managing dyslipidemia in adults with NS and no other indications for treatment based on previously obtained lipid levels. 10.

### Nephrotic syndrome… [^116xnGsn]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome encompasses a variety of disease processes leading to heavy proteinuria and edema. Minimal change disease remains the most common primary cause of NS, as well as the most responsive to pharmacologic treatment with often minimal to no chronic kidney disease. Other causes of NS include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which follows MCD, and secondary causes, including extrarenal or systemic diseases, infections, and drugs. Although initial diagnosis relies on clinical findings as well as urine and blood chemistries, renal biopsy and genetic testing are important diagnostic tools, especially when considering non-MCD NS. Moreover, biomarkers in urine and serum have become important areas for research in this disease. NS progression and prognosis are variable and depend on etiology, with corticosteroids being the mainstay of treatment.

Other alternative therapies found to be successful in inducing and maintaining remission include calcineurin inhibitors and rituximab. Disease course can range from recurrent disease relapse with or without acute kidney injury to end-stage renal disease in some cases. Given the complex pathogenesis of NS, which remains incompletely understood, complications are numerous and diverse and include infections, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and thrombosis. Pediatricians must be aware of the presentation, complications, and overall long-term implications of NS and its treatment. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments.
