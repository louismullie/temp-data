## Question

Bempedoic acid in statin intolerant patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to use bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and the clinical problem. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale that makes bempedoic acid plausible in statin intolerance. Next, I will examine LDL-C lowering efficacy, followed by hard cardiovascular outcomes. After that, I need to scrutinize safety, tolerability, and drug interactions. I will then integrate guideline positioning and a practical, stepwise treatment algorithm. Finally, I should address special populations and close with a concise clinical recommendation and shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and target population. Statin intolerance affects a meaningful proportion of patients and is most often due to muscle-related symptoms; many remain above LDL-C targets, carrying elevated cardiovascular risk and a persistent need for effective oral alternatives, which sets the stage for considering bempedoic acid in this group [^114eeKya] [^1156bjQE].

> I need to check the mechanistic rationale next. Bempedoic acid is a hepatically activated prodrug that inhibits ATP citrate lyase upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis without activation in skeletal muscle, which helps explain why it avoids statin-associated muscle toxicity while still lowering LDL-C meaningfully [^114eeKya] [^111MPiL3].

> Now, I will examine LDL-C lowering efficacy. In pooled phase 3 analyses, bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C by about 18% on a background of maximally tolerated statins and by about 24–25% in statin-intolerant patients, with absolute reductions of roughly 20 mg/dL and 37 mg/dL, respectively. These effects are durable through 24–52 weeks and are consistent across most subgroups, including women and those with diabetes [^116r7DrS] [^1125uaEQ] [^113gQZkq]. Wait, let me verify the combination data: when added to ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients, LDL-C falls by about 28–30% versus placebo, and the fixed-dose combination achieves approximately 38–40% reductions, which can approach moderate-intensity statin territory in some patients [^111ArZLd] [^111iFAV9] [^111k7k9A].

> Next, I should review hard cardiovascular outcomes. The CLEAR Outcomes trial in 13,970 statin-intolerant patients showed a significant reduction in the primary MACE composite (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization) with bempedoic acid versus placebo (11.7% vs 13.3%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.96), driven largely by fewer myocardial infarctions and revascularizations; stroke and cardiovascular death were not significantly reduced in the overall cohort, though a prespecified analysis of total events suggested broader risk attenuation [^116JhWpC] [^112woJhY]. Hold on, I should verify subgroup effects: in primary prevention patients, the relative risk reduction was larger (about 30%), and in those with diabetes, MACE fell by about 17%, with no signal for increased new-onset diabetes, which is clinically reassuring [^116SYKxw] [^115sRSnp].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability. Muscle-related adverse events were not increased versus placebo in CLEAR Outcomes, aligning with the hepatic-only activation and consistent with earlier trials; however, gout and hyperuricemia occurred more frequently, and cholelithiasis and tendon rupture were modestly more common, so I need to ensure caution in patients with prior gout or tendon disorders and to monitor uric acid and liver enzymes during therapy [^116JhWpC] [^1151Gh2Y]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought discontinuation rates were markedly higher with bempedoic acid; in CLEAR Outcomes, overall adverse events were similar, but gout-related events and small lab shifts explain most of the imbalance, and discontinuations were not dramatically higher, which corrects my earlier impression from smaller studies with higher dropout rates [^116JhWpC] [^111zsgz1].

> Let me consider drug interactions and monitoring. Bempedoic acid is not metabolized by CYP450 to a clinically meaningful extent, reducing interaction risk, but I should double-check for concomitant use with high-dose simvastatin or gemfibrozil, which were avoided in trials; baseline and periodic uric acid, liver enzymes, and renal function are prudent, especially in patients with prior gout or hepatic disease [^115S3PiU] [^111j4ykq] [^1151Gh2Y].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to anchor practice. The 2022 ACC Expert Consensus places bempedoic acid as a reasonable option for patients with documented statin intolerance, typically after ezetimibe, and suggests it as an add-on when additional LDL-C lowering is needed on top of maximally tolerated statins. The 2024 ESC chronic coronary syndromes guideline recommends adding bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients who fail to reach goals on ezetimibe, and the 2025 AACE guideline supports its use in statin-intolerant adults with or at high risk for ASCVD while noting limited primary prevention evidence and advising shared decision-making [^112udoiA] [^113PhTzK] [^117B8fDF]. I should confirm that diabetes standards align: the ADA 2025 Standards endorse bempedoic acid for statin-intolerant patients, including older adults, reflecting CLEAR Outcomes data and pragmatic risk reduction goals [^114mBft7].

> I will now translate this into a practical algorithm. First, confirm true statin intolerance with a structured approach, including attempts at different statins and doses, and document symptom resolution with dechallenge. If LDL-C remains above threshold, start with ezetimibe, then add bempedoic acid if goals are unmet. In very high-risk patients, consider earlier combination therapy or PCSK9 inhibitor referral when available, with bempedoic acid as an oral alternative when injectables are not preferred or accessible [^1156bjQE] [^112udoiA] [^113PhTzK]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for sequencing: while head-to-head sequencing trials are limited, the ACC pathway and ESC CCS guidance converge on ezetimibe-first due to efficacy, safety, and cost, followed by bempedoic acid as the next oral agent, which is consistent with trial data and real-world feasibility [^112udoiA] [^113PhTzK].

> But wait, what about special populations. In adults older than 75 years, expert consensus supports considering bempedoic acid for statin-intolerant primary prevention when a decision is made to lower LDL-C, given the 30% relative risk reduction observed in the primary prevention subgroup and no age-treatment interaction signal, albeit with wide confidence intervals and limited subgroup granularity [^113WoyMW] [^116T638u]. In diabetes, prespecified analyses show consistent MACE benefit without excess new-onset diabetes, supporting use in statin-intolerant patients with diabetes; in women, who are overrepresented among statin-intolerant individuals, outcomes and LDL-C responses appear comparable to men, reinforcing equitable consideration [^115sRSnp] [^115one9e].

> I should double-check real-world effectiveness and access issues. Observational cohorts show clinically meaningful LDL-C reductions of about 20–30% with bempedoic acid, but cost and prior authorization hurdles are common and discontinuations can be higher outside trials, often due to non-specific musculoskeletal complaints; these realities argue for proactive adverse event management, patient education, and cost-mitigation strategies to sustain adherence [^113oHHCa] [^112fKprh].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical value proposition. Bempedoic acid provides an oral, once-daily, mechanism-distinct LDL-C lowering option with proven cardiovascular risk reduction in statin-intolerant patients, a safety profile that avoids muscle toxicity but requires vigilance for gout and cholelithiasis, and a cost and access profile that is generally more favorable than PCSK9 inhibitors, making it a key bridge therapy in this population [^116JhWpC] [^112LfiY5] [^113vGm4o].

> Final clinical recommendation: For adults with documented statin intolerance and elevated LDL-C who remain above risk-stratified thresholds, initiate bempedoic acid 180 mg daily, ideally layered onto ezetimibe for additive LDL-C lowering, monitor uric acid, liver enzymes, and renal function, and counsel on gout precautions. Use shared decision-making to discuss modest absolute risk reduction in primary prevention and to align with patient preferences, comorbidities, and access constraints, recognizing that the strongest outcomes evidence exists for secondary prevention and high-risk primary prevention subgroups [^116JhWpC] [^116SYKxw] [^111ArZLd] [^1151Gh2Y] [^112udoiA] [^117B8fDF].

Bempedoic acid is a first-line oral, non-statin option for statin-intolerant patients, lowering LDL-C by ~21% and **reducing major adverse cardiovascular events by 13%** in CLEAR Outcomes [^116JhWpC]. It is well tolerated with low muscle-related adverse events, but increases gout and cholelithiasis risk; **monitor uric acid and liver enzymes** [^1151Gh2Y]. Bempedoic acid is appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate statins, especially with ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, and can be combined with ezetimibe for greater LDL-C lowering [^1167Zmer] [^111ArZLd]. It is **not recommended for primary prevention** without ASCVD risk factors due to limited evidence [^115xzkV4].

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile

Bempedoic acid is a **hepatically activated prodrug** that inhibits ATP citrate lyase, upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis and upregulating LDL receptors to lower LDL-C [^1141C6m4]. It is not activated in skeletal muscle, which likely explains the low rate of muscle-related adverse effects [^114eeKya].

---

## Clinical efficacy in statin-intolerant patients

- **LDL-C reduction**: In CLEAR Outcomes, bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C by 21.1% (29.2 mg/dL) at 6 months vs placebo in statin-intolerant patients [^116JhWpC].
- **Cardiovascular outcomes**: Bempedoic acid reduced MACE by 13% (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.96) vs placebo, driven by fewer myocardial infarctions and coronary revascularizations [^116JhWpC].
- **Primary prevention**: In the primary prevention subgroup, MACE fell by 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.89) [^116SYKxw].

---

## Safety and tolerability profile

- **Muscle-related adverse events**: Low and similar to placebo in CLEAR Outcomes, consistent with hepatic-only activation [^111RnnqF].
- **Gout and hyperuricemia**: Higher incidence with bempedoic acid (3.1% vs 2.1% for gout; 10.9% vs 5.6% for hyperuricemia) [^116JhWpC] [^112vdiay].
- **Cholelithiasis**: More frequent with bempedoic acid (2.2% vs 1.2%) [^116JhWpC].
- **Liver enzymes**: Small increases in hepatic enzymes occurred; monitor liver function periodically [^1151Gh2Y].

## Comparison with other non-statin therapies

| **Attribute** | **Bempedoic acid** | **Ezetimibe** | **Pcsk9 inhibitors** |
|-|-|-|-|
| LDL-C reduction | ~21% | ~15–20% | ~50–70% |
| Cardiovascular outcomes | Reduced MACE in CLEAR Outcomes | Limited outcome data | Robust MACE reduction |
| Route of administration | Oral | Oral | Injectable |
| Muscle-related adverse events | Low | Low | Low |
| Cost | Moderate | Low | High |

---

Bempedoic acid offers a **moderate LDL-C reduction** with favorable tolerability, especially for patients who cannot tolerate statins, though PCSK9 inhibitors provide greater LDL-C lowering at higher cost and injection burden [^114o9YgR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACC/AHA 2022**: Consider bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients who require additional LDL-C lowering, particularly with ASCVD or high risk [^113S3UuC].
- **ESC 2024**: Add bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients not achieving goals on ezetimibe [^113PhTzK].
- **AACE 2025**: Suggests bempedoic acid for statin-intolerant patients with ASCVD or high risk; use shared decision-making given modest effect sizes and adverse events [^115xzkV4].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from bempedoic acid

- **ASCVD or high-risk patients**: Particularly those with established disease or multiple risk factors who cannot tolerate statins [^116JhWpC].
- **Primary prevention**: Patients with high LDL-C and elevated cardiovascular risk who are statin-intolerant may benefit, though evidence is less robust [^116SYKxw].
- **Combination therapy**: With ezetimibe for additive LDL-C lowering in statin-intolerant patients [^111ArZLd].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Gout risk**: Avoid or use cautiously in patients with a history of gout or hyperuricemia [^113S3UuC].
- **Primary prevention**: Limited evidence; use shared decision-making in patients without ASCVD risk factors [^115xzkV4].
- **Long-term safety**: Continued post-marketing surveillance is warranted [^notfound].

---

Bempedoic acid is a **valuable oral, non-statin therapy** for statin-intolerant patients, providing meaningful LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction with a tolerability profile that minimizes muscle-related adverse effects. It is most appropriate for patients with ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk who cannot tolerate statins, and can be combined with ezetimibe for greater LDL-C lowering. Clinicians should monitor for gout, cholelithiasis, and liver enzyme elevations and use shared decision-making, especially in primary prevention settings [^116JhWpC].

The study CLEAR Harmony was published by Kausik K Ray and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia and Coronary artery disease. In the CLEAR Harmony study, the trial question was: what is the role of bempedoic acid in patients with increased LDL-C levels? In the CLEAR Harmony study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR Harmony study, the population was: 2230 patients (602 female, 1628 male). The inclusion criteria were patients taking the maximum tolerated dose of statin therapy with ASCVD. The key exclusion criteria were use of gemfibrozil or simvastatin at doses > 40 mg/day; total fasting triglyceride ≥ 500 mg/dL; BMI ≥ 50 kg/m²; use of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 within the past 4 weeks. In the CLEAR Harmony study, the interventions were: n = 1488 bempedoic acid (at an oral dose of 180 mg once daily) n = 742 placebo (matching placebo tablet taken PO once daily). In the CLEAR Harmony study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in adverse events (78.5% vs. 78.7%; ARD -0.2, 95% CI -3.39 to 2.99). In the CLEAR Harmony study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in change in the LDL-C level at week 12 (-16.5% vs. 1.6%; ARD -18.1, 95% CI -20 to -16.1) Significant decrease in change in the LDL-C level at week 24 (-14.9% vs. 1.2%; ARD -16.1, 95% CI -18.2 to -14) Significant decrease in total cholesterol level elevation at week 12 (-10.3% vs. 0.8%; ARD -11.1, 95% CI -12.5 to -9.8). In the CLEAR Harmony study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in adverse events leading to discontinuation of trial agent (10.9% vs. 7.1%), gout (1.2% vs. 0.3%), new-onset or worsening diabetes (3.3% vs. 5.4%). In the CLEAR Harmony study, the conclusion was: in patients taking the maximum tolerated dose of statin therapy with ASCVD, bempedoic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to adverse events.

### Clinical benefit of bempedoic acid in randomized clinical trials [^117Su2db]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Bempedoic acid is a selective inhibitor of the adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase that reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) levels by 17% to 28%. Although the Evaluation of Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients With, or at High Risk for, Cardiovascular Disease Who Are Statin Intolerant Treated With Bempedoic Acid (CLEAR-OUTCOMES) trials demonstrated the efficacy on cardiovascular outcomes there is a controversy related to the possible net clinical benefit. Thereafter, we performed an intention-to-treat meta-analysis in line with recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcome of the metanalysis was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined by each study protocol. Secondary outcomes for the analyses were myocardial infarction, stroke, myocardial revascularization, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death. Results of 4 clinical trials evaluated contained a total of 17,324 patients; 9,236 received bempedoic acid for a median of 46.6 months. The mean baseline LDLc was 129.4 (22.8) mg/100 mL and treatment was associated with a mean LDLc reduction of 26.0 (12.6) mg/100 ml. Treatment with bempedoic acid significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 0.96), myocardial infarction (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.89) and myocardial revascularization (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92); the crude incidence of stroke, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality were lower in patients in the bempedoic acid groups although no significant risk reduction was observed. No heterogeneity was observed in any of the end points. In conclusion, the metanalysis of the 4 clinical trials currently available with bempedoic acid provides reliable evidence of its clinical benefit with no signs of heterogeneity or harm.

Discussion

The main finding of the CLEAR Serenity trial is that bempedoic acid significantly reduces both LDL‐C and hsCRP compared with placebo and is well tolerated in patients with statin intolerance. Similar to statins, bempedoic acid is an inhibitor of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. It targets an enzyme, ATP‐citrate lyase, upstream of β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase, the target for statins. However, unlike statins, bempedoic acid is a prodrug that is not activated in skeletal muscle. 13 The results of the trial demonstrate the potential for bempedoic acid as a novel treatment option for the large number of individuals who have difficulty tolerating statin treatment due to muscle‐related side effects.

Patients with statin intolerance are at increased cardiovascular risk because of ongoing atherogenic lipid elevations. 8, 9, 10 Nonstatin alternatives that are currently available, such as bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, and ezetimibe, reduce LDL‐C to a lesser extent than statins and may, therefore, be insufficient alone to adequately lower LDL‐C and mitigate cardiovascular event risk. 1, 3, 7 Furthermore, although anti–proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 antibodies have demonstrated large reductions in LDL‐C and a good safety profile in clinical trials, these injectable agents are expensive, are not available everywhere, and their use in countries where they are available is most often restricted to patients with proven familial hypercholesterolemia or coronary artery disease, and thus have had limited uptake in clinical practice. 21, 22 Therefore, there is an ongoing need for nonstatin, oral options that can be used alone or as an adjunct to other lipid‐lowering therapies such as ezetimibe.

### Association of bempedoic acid administration with atherogenic lipid levels in phase 3 randomized clinical trials of patients with hypercholesterolemia [^117CyuPx]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

In the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, a greater percentage of patients in the bempedoic acid group (28.9%) achieved LDL-C levels lower than 70 mg/dL at week 12 compared with placebo (8.0%) (P < .001). The proportion of patients with LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL was consistently higher in the bempedoic acid group (week 24, 28.7%; week 52, 26.2%) than in the placebo group (week 24, 9.3%; week 52, 9.1%) (P < .001 for both comparisons). Patients who received bempedoic acid experienced significant placebo-corrected decreases in total cholesterol, non–HDL-C, apoB, and hsCRP levels at week 12, whereas patients in the placebo group experienced increases from baseline for most parameters (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).

Subgroup analyses (Figure 2) indicated greater decreases in LDL-C levels associated with bempedoic acid vs placebo treatment for most demographic, disease-related, and background therapy subgroups. The only nonsignificant result was in the small subgroup of Hispanic patients in the pool of patients with statin intolerance. In the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, the results were consistent within subgroup categories based on age, race, ethnicity, geographic region, history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C category, HeFH status, prior ASCVD status, baseline statin intensity, baseline statin medication, background ezetimibe use, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate category (Figure 2). Heterogeneity was observed when patients were grouped by sex, with a greater LS mean difference for women vs men, and by BMI category. In the pool of patients with statin intolerance, the results were also consistent within subgroup categories (Figure 3), with heterogeneity observed when patients were grouped by ethnicity, history of diabetes, or baseline statin use.

### Safety of bempedoic acid in patients at high cardiovascular risk and with statin intolerance [^1151Gh2Y]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bempedoic acid is an oral adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) blood levels. The Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes study demonstrated that bempedoic acid reduced cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients at high risk for CV events who were unwilling or unable to take guideline-recommended doses of statins.

Objective

To describe detailed safety information from CLEAR Outcomes, including events in the United States (US) prescribing information based on previous phase 3 hyperlipidemia studies.

Methods

CLEAR Outcomes was a double-blind trial conducted in 13,970 patients randomized to oral bempedoic acid 180 mg daily or placebo and followed for a median of 3.4 years.

Results

In patients who received at least one dose (7,001 bempedoic acid, 6,964 placebo), treatment emergent adverse events (AE) occurred in 86.3% and 85% of patients, respectively. COVID-19 was the most frequently reported AE in both groups. Changes in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, aminotransaminases, and uric acid were consistent with the known safety profile of bempedoic acid. Gout or gouty arthritis occurred in 3.2% of bempedoic acid and 2.2% of placebo patients. AE associated with tendinopathies, including tendon rupture, occurred in 2% of patients in both treatment groups. Cholelithiasis occurred in 2.2% of bempedoic acid and 1.2% of placebo patients; AE related to gallbladder disease were similar between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Bempedoic acid was well-tolerated compared with placebo. Safety data from the long-term CLEAR Outcomes study reinforce the positive benefit-risk profile of bempedoic acid.

### Safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112Bt7Ba]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Bempedoic Acid (BA) is a novel Lipid-Lowering Therapy (LLT). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of BA in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library databases were searched for randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of BA compared with placebo. Trials investigating dosages other than 180 mg/die were excluded. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were the primary efficacy endpoint. LDL-cholesterol reduction was the primary laboratory endpoint. Pre-specified safety endpoints included muscle-related adverse events, new-onset diabetes, and gout. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (temporary ID:399,867).

Results

Study search identified 275 deduplicated results. 11 studies, encompassing 18,315 patients (9854 on BA vs 8461 on placebo/no treatment) were included. BA was associated with a reduced risk of MACE (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79–0.95), myocardial infarction (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.88) and unstable angina (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54–0.88) compared to control, over a median follow up of 87 (15–162) weeks. BA was associated with a reduction of LDL-Cholesterol (mean difference [MD]–22.42,95% CI − 24.02% to − 20.82%), total cholesterol (− 16.50%,95% − 19.21% to − 13.79%), Apo-B lipoprotein (− 19.55%, − 22.68% to − 16.42%) and high-sensitivity CRP (− 27.83%, − 31.71% to − 23.96%) at 12 weeks. BA was associated with a higher risk of gout (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27–1.90) as compared with placebo. Efficacy on laboratory endpoints was confirmed, with a variable extent, across patients on statin or ezetimibe background therapy.

Conclusions

The improved cholesterol control achieved with BA translates into a reduced risk of MACE, including myocardial infarction and coronary revascularisation. The drug has a satisfactory safety profile except for an increased risk of gout.

Results

A summary of the screening process and reasons for exclusion is provided in a PRISMA flow diagram (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). A total of 274 records were identified from the electronic databases with an additional 23 records through manually searching journals and clinical trials registries. After removing duplicates, 275 records were screened for the titles and abstracts. Of these, we assessed 20 full-text articles for eligibility and 11 studies were included in the data extraction and quantitative synthesis. The 11 studies globally included 18,315 participants, of whom 10,189 (55.6%) were male and 8126 (44.4%) were female. A summary of features of included studies is reported in Table 1, while full baseline lipid profile and clinical features of patients enrolled are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1. Briefly, study size ranged from 58 to 13,970 participants. 5 studies enrolled statin-intolerant patients, 2 studies enrolled patients with ASCVD and/or FH on stable statin background therapy, one multi-arm trial included patients with ASCVD and/or FH and/or multiple CV risk factors, 3 trials enrolled patients with hypercholesterolemia. Among the latter, two trials enrolled patients on stable or maximally tolerated statin therapy, while the remaining one was a multi arm trial randomising hypercholesterolemic and diabetic patients on wash-out from statins to BA + ezetimibe vs ezetimibe alone vs placebo. For the main analysis the placebo arm served as control, while the ezetimibe arm served as control for the sensitivity analysis investigating the efficacy of BA on top of ezetimibe. 3 studies had a follow up of at least 1 year, whereas the others had follow-up periods less than 1 year (from 4 weeks to 60 months). All trials included used individual patient randomization. The overall risk of bias was low for 7 trials, while 4 trials had an unclear risk of bias in at least one of the explored domains (see Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The definition of main clinical outcomes of each included trial is summarized in Additional file 2: Table S2.

Bempedoic Acid

Bempedoic acid is an oral, once‐daily, hypolipidemic prodrug that targets cholesterol synthesis in the liver by inhibiting ATP‐citrate lyase. As bempedoic acid is not activated in skeletal muscle, it is thought to have a lower potential for myotoxic effects than statins. In early 2020, bempedoic acid received US Food and Drug Administration approval as an adjunct treatment to maximally tolerated statins, and a fixed‐dose combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe is recommended for the treatment of HeFH or established ASCVD. Practical points on the use of bempedoic acid are summarized in Figure 3.

In the CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL [ATP‐Citrate Lyase]‐Inhibiting Regimen) Harmony trial of patients with ASCVD, HeFH, or both, bempedoic acid added to statin therapy reduced LDL‐C levels by 18.1% (95% CI, 16.1%–20.0%; P < 0.001) versus placebo. Incidence of adverse events, including muscle related, was similar between treatment arms, except for gout, which was increased in patients receiving bempedoic acid (1.2% versus 0.3%; P = 0.03). In patients at high risk of ASCVD on background statin therapy, the bempedoic acid and ezetimibe fixed‐dose combination added to background statin therapy significantly reduced LDL‐C by 38% (95% CI, 29.6%–46.5%; P < 0.001) compared with placebo. The fixed‐dose combination also significantly lowered LDL‐C levels versus bempedoic acid and ezetimibe monotherapies. Recently, the CLEAR Outcomes study reported significantly decreased incidence of MACE in patients with statin intolerance (including 30% without a history of established ASCVD) treated with bempedoic acid compared with placebo (11.7% versus 13.3%; HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79–0.96]; P = 0.004). At 6 months, compared with placebo, bempedoic acid reduced LDL‐C by 29.2 mg/dL or 21.1% (95% CI, 20.3%–21.9%). The study enrolled 48% women, for whom the HR for the primary end point was similar to that for men. Clinical studies of bempedoic acid are summarized in Table 2.

### CLEAR serenity trial: more clarity for the future of bempedoic acid in patients unable to take statins? [^113vGm4o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

There is clinical need and potential for additional nonstatin LDL‐C–lowering options for patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy, especially in the primary prevention setting, where there is currently less evidence on the efficacy that favors any of the nonstatin medications and where the cost‐benefit would likely preclude use of PCSK9 inhibitors. Meanwhile, the pairing of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe remains an intriguing regimen. Although LDL‐C lowering in both medications is modest, their combined effect may, in theory, approach that of high‐intensity statins and, thus, may also be an option in secondary prevention patients and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia unable to tolerate high‐intensity statin therapy or those in whom further LDL‐C reduction is desired. 16 Furthermore, both bempedoic acid and ezetimibe have been shown to lower high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein. 7, 11, 13 The additional anti‐inflammatory property could be advantageous when compared with PCSK9 inhibitors, which are powerful LDL‐C–lowering agents but lack significant effect on inflammation. Thus, results of the CLEAR Serenity trial by Laufs et al 15 suggest that bempedoic acid has the potential to fill this niche. This potential, however, is built on the assumption that bempedoic acid can demonstrate efficacy and acceptable safety in its ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial: CLEAR Outcomes (Identifier: NCT02993406). A shared target pathway and mechanism of action between bempedoic acid and statin leads some credence to this assumption. Yet, outcome trial evidence will be invaluable to establish bempedoic acid as an effective, stand‐alone, nonstatin agent.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients not receiving statins in phase 3 clinical trials [^111iFAV9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the high incidence of patients with statin tolerance problems, randomized evaluations of nonstatin oral treatment options for lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in this population are sparse.

Objective

To assess the LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic acid in patients not taking statins.

Methods

This was a pooled analysis of data from patients enrolled in four phase 3 bempedoic acid studies (12 to 52 weeks in duration) who were not taking concomitant statins (Phase 3 No Statin Cohort) and a phase 3 bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe fixed-dose combination study (BA+EZE FDC No Statin Cohort). The primary endpoint for all studies was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C levels. Safety and tolerability were assessed by laboratory values and adverse events.

Results

In the Phase 3 No Statin Cohort, bempedoic acid (n = 394) lowered LDL-C levels at week 12 significantly more than placebo (n = 192; -26.5% [95% CI, -29.7%, -23.2%]; P < 0.001). The fixed-dose combination of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe lowered LDL-C by 39.2% (95% CI, -51.7% to -26.7%; P < 0.001). Muscle-related disorders occurred at a rate of 26.4 and 28.6 per 100 person-years with bempedoic acid and placebo, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with hypercholesterolemia unable to take statins, bempedoic acid lowered LDL-C levels by a mean of 26.5% vs placebo and bempedoic acid + ezetimibe fixed-dose combination lowered LDL-C by 39.2%. The treatments were generally well tolerated, suggesting that bempedoic acid may be efficacious and well tolerated in this challenging-to-treat patient population.

Table 2
Percent Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Lipid Parameters and Biomarkers

Significant reductions in LDL‐C at week 12 with bempedoic acid versus placebo were observed in all subgroups, including baseline LDL‐C, history of diabetes mellitus, age, race, sex, body mass index, background lipid‐modifying therapy, and cardiovascular disease risk category (P ≤ 0.01; Figure 5). Heterogeneity was statistically significant only in the history of diabetes mellitus subgroup (P value for interaction, 0.012). In addition to the planned subgroup analysis, a post hoc analysis was conducted to analyze LDL‐C percent change from baseline by background lipid‐modifying therapy. Reductions in LDL‐C with bempedoic acid versus placebo were greater among patients receiving no background lipid‐modifying therapy (−22.1% at week 12) or nonstatin background therapy (−23.3%) compared with patients receiving background therapy with a very‐low‐dose statin (−17.4%). In the on‐treatment analysis set, the difference in LDL‐C reduction at week 12 between bempedoic acid (−25.6%) and placebo (−1.7) was −23.9% (95% CI, −27.5% to −20.2%; P < 0.001; Table 3). Results of sensitivity analyses for efficacy end points were consistent with the primary analyses.

### Safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid to reduce LDL cholesterol [^111j4ykq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Short-term studies have shown that bempedoic acid, an inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase, reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid treatment in long-term studies involving patients with hypercholesterolemia who are receiving guideline-recommended statin therapy.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or both. Patients had to have an LDL cholesterol level of at least 70 mg per deciliter while they were receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without additional lipid-lowering therapy. (Maximally tolerated statin therapy was defined as the highest intensity statin regimen that a patient was able to maintain, as determined by the investigator.) Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive bempedoic acid or placebo. The primary end point was safety, and the principal secondary end point (principal efficacy end point) was the percentage change in the LDL cholesterol level at week 12 of 52 weeks.

Results

The trial involved 2230 patients, of whom 1488 were assigned to receive bempedoic acid and 742 to receive placebo. The mean (± SD) LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 103.2 ± 29.4 mg per deciliter. The incidence of adverse events (1167 of 1487 patients [78.5%] in the bempedoic acid group and 584 of 742 [78.7%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (216 patients [14.5%] and 104 [14.0%], respectively) did not differ substantially between the two groups during the intervention period, but the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the regimen was higher in the bempedoic acid group than in the placebo group (162 patients [10.9%] vs. 53 [7.1%]), as was the incidence of gout (18 patients [1.2%] vs. 2 [0.3%]). At week 12, bempedoic acid reduced the mean LDL cholesterol level by 19.2 mg per deciliter, representing a change of -16.5% from baseline (difference vs. placebo in change from baseline, -18.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -20.0 to -16.1; P < 0.001). Safety and efficacy findings were consistent, regardless of the intensity of background statin therapy.

Conclusions

In this 52-week trial, bempedoic acid added to maximally tolerated statin therapy did not lead to a higher incidence of overall adverse events than placebo and led to significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^113gH52P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In the CLEAR Serenity study, bempedoic acid reduced LDL‐C significantly more than placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of statin intolerance without inducing side effects commonly attributed to statin treatment. Myalgia and muscular weakness were numerically less frequent with bempedoic acid compared with placebo. Lipid lowering was consistent across patient subgroups and was observed when bempedoic acid was administered as monotherapy or when added to stable background lipid‐modifying therapy. A difference in LDL‐C reduction was observed among patients with a history of diabetes mellitus versus those with no history of diabetes mellitus; however, this was likely attributable to the play of chance in a subgroup analysis with a limited sample size, as LDL‐C reduction with bempedoic acid was comparable in patients with and without diabetes mellitus in previous phase 3 clinical trials. 19, 20 Patients in the bempedoic acid treatment group also experienced significant reductions in non–HDL‐C, total cholesterol, apoB, and hsCRP, which were maintained throughout the 24‐week study. CLEAR Serenity expands on the existing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness and favorable safety profile of bempedoic acid for atherogenic lipid reduction in patients with statin intolerance 16, 18, 19 by providing longer‐term data in a population meeting defined intolerance criteria and who were receiving treatment as monotherapy or on a background of lipid‐modifying therapy for primary or secondary prevention indications.

Importance

Additional treatment options are needed for patients who do not achieve sufficient reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level with available lipid-lowering therapies.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of bempedoic acid vs placebo in patients at high cardiovascular risk receiving maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at 91 clinical sites in North America and Europe from November 2016 to September 2018, with a final date of follow-up of September 22, 2018. A total of 779 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or both met randomization criteria, which included LDL-C level 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or greater while receiving maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with bempedoic acid (180 mg) (n = 522) or placebo (n = 257) once daily for 52 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change from baseline in LDL-C level at week 12. Secondary measures included changes in levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and biomarkers.

Results

Among 779 randomized patients (mean age, 64.3 years; 283 women [36.3%]), 740 (95.0%) completed the trial. At baseline, mean LDL-C level was 120.4 (SD, 37.9) mg/dL. Bempedoic acid lowered LDL-C levels significantly more than placebo at week 12 (-15.1% vs 2.4%, respectively; difference, -17.4% [95% CI, -21.0% to -13.9%]; P < .001). Significant reductions with bempedoic acid vs placebo were observed at week 12 for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-10.8% vs 2.3%; difference, -13.0% [95% CI, -16.3% to -9.8%]; P < .001), total cholesterol (-9.9% vs 1.3%; difference, -11.2% [95% CI, -13.6% to -8.8%]; P < .001), apolipoprotein B (-9.3% vs 3.7%; difference, -13.0% [95% CI, -16.1% to -9.9%]; P < .001), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (median, -18.7% vs -9.4%; difference, -8.7% [asymptotic confidence limits, -17.2% to -0.4%]; p = 0.04). Common adverse events included nasopharyngitis (5.2% vs 5.1% with bempedoic acid and placebo, respectively), urinary tract infection (5.0% vs 1.9%), and hyperuricemia (4.2% vs 1.9%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease receiving maximally tolerated statins, the addition of bempedoic acid compared with placebo resulted in a significant lowering of LDL-C level over 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the durability and clinical effect as well as long-term safety.

A planned subgroup analysis of percentage change in LDL-C level from baseline to week 12 was conducted in both pools. The subgroups varied between pools owing to differences in patient populations and background therapy. The covariates in the pool of patients with statin intolerance included age, sex, race, ethnicity, geographic region (North America compared with Europe), baseline body mass index (BMI) calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (< 25, 25 to < 30, and ≥ 30), history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C level (< 130, 130 to < 160, and ≥ 160 mg/dL), baseline statin use (yes or no), baseline ezetimibe use, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (≥ 90, 60 to < 89, and ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m²). Race/ethnicity designations were self-reported by patients. For the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, additional parameters included baseline LDL-C level (< 100, 100 to < 130, and ≥ 130 mg/dL), HeFH status, prior ASCVD, baseline statin regimen intensity (no, low to moderate, and high), and baseline statin medication (atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and other). Forest plots were generated to summarize the associated treatment effects as LS mean differences by subgroup. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

### PCSK9 inhibitor, ezetimibe, and bempedoic acid: evidence-based therapies for statin-intolerant patients [^111JHUXp]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Statins are first-line therapy for treating dyslipidemia because of their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering efficacy, superior event-reduction data and unrivaled cost-effectiveness. Yet, many people are intolerant of statins, whether due to true adverse events or the nocebo effect, so within one year about two-thirds of primary prevention patients and one-third of secondary prevention patients are no longer taking their prescription. Statins still dominate this landscape, but other agents, often used in combination, potently reduce LDL-C levels, regress atherosclerosis and lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Ezetimibe lowers LDL-C by reducing intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) lower LDL-C by increasing the number and durability of hepatic LDL receptors. Bempedoic acid reduces hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Ezetimibe, PCSK9i and bempedoic are evidence-based, non-statin therapies that synergistically lower LDL-C and reduce risk of MACE; they also have benign side-effect profiles and are generally well tolerated.

Findings In this pooled analysis of 3623 patients included in 4 pivotal randomized clinical trials, bempedoic acid administration was associated with decreased mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 18% vs placebo when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or both and by 24% vs placebo in patients with a history of statin intolerance. Increased uric acid levels and gout occurred more frequently among patients treated with bempedoic acid than with placebo. As a sensitivity analysis for LDL-C level decrease across 52 weeks, an on-treatment analysis was performed for the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin that included only those patients who were still receiving assigned study treatment within 7 days before LDL-C level measurement.

A z test was used to compare differences between LS mean LDL-C level decrease in the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin and the pool of patients with statin intolerance. The P values for all analyses were 2-sided but nominal and should be considered descriptive. In both the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin and the pool of patients with statin intolerance, the prevalence rates of diabetes and hypertension were high. Compared with placebo, treatment with bempedoic acid was associated with significantly lower LDL-C levels at week 12 in both pools.

The absolute mean decrease from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C level was greater in patients treated with bempedoic acid vs placebo in patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin and in patients with statin intolerance.

### Bempedoic acid and cardiovascular outcomes in statin-intolerant patients [^112vdiay]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study CLEAR Outcomes was published by Steven E Nissen and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia, Hypertriglyceridemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia, Coronary artery disease and Statin-induced myopathy. In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the trial question was: what is the role of bempedoic acid in patients with statin-intolerant patients? In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the population was: 13970 patients (6740 female, 7230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who were unable or unwilling to take statins owing to unacceptable adverse effects and had or were at high risk for CVD. The key exclusion criteria were fasting blood triglycerides > 500 mg/dL; recent history of major cardiovascular events, TIA, or unstable or symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia; history of severe HF; uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes. In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the interventions were: n = 6992 bempedoic acid (an oral dose of 180 mg daily) n = 6978 placebo (matching placebo). In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in major adverse cardiovascular events (11.7% vs. 13.3%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.96). In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial infarction (8.2% vs. 9.5%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) Significant decrease in fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.7% vs. 4.8%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91) Significant decrease in coronary revascularization (6.2% vs. 7.6%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92). In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. significant difference in hyperuricemia (10.9% vs. 5.6%). In the CLEAR Outcomes study, the conclusion was: in patients who were unable or unwilling to take statins owing to unacceptable adverse effects and had or were at high risk for CVD, bempedoic acid was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid for prevention of cardiovascular events and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127fppD]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bempedoic acid is an oral, once-daily, first-in-class drug being developed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. However, evidence of bempedoic acid use for the prevention of cardiovascular events and diabetes is lacking. Thus, we aim to evaluate the benefit and safety of bempedoic acid use for the prevention of cardiovascular events and diabetes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with no language restriction from inception until March 3, 2020. Pairs of reviewers independently identified randomized controlled trials comparing the use of bempedoic acid with placebo or no treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in statin-intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiac events, and percent change in LDL-C.

Results

We identified 11 trials including a total of 4391 participants. Bempedoic acid use was associated with a reduction in composite cardiovascular outcome (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56–0.99; I² = 0%). Bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C levels (MD - 22.91, 95% CI - 27.35 to - 18.47; I² = 99%), and similarly reduced CRP levels (MD -24.70, 95% CI - 32.10 to - 17.30; I² = 53%). Bempedoic acid was associated with a reduction in rates of new-onset or worsening diabetes (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44–0.96; I² = 23%).

Conclusions

Bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes.

### Novel therapeutic targets and agents for pediatric dyslipidemia [^115S3PiU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Bempedoic acid

Mechanism: Bempedoic acid is a pro-drug which when selectively activated in the liver, inhibits ATP citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of HMG-CoA reductase. It primarily lowers LDL-C by competitively inhibiting conversion of mitochondrial-derived citrate to cytosolic acetyl CoAcreating less substrate for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. It does not utilize the cytochrome P 450 enzyme pathway and is considered relatively safe.

Clinical data: Thus far, five clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid/ezetimibe combination therapy and its efficacy in lowering LDL-C in adults with ASCVD, HeFH and those who are statin intolerant. – Overall, it lowered LDL-C levels by 15–25% when used alone and up to 38% when combined with ezetimibe. In one of the pivotal studies, patients who received bempedoic acid in addition to a statin experienced a dose-dependent LDL-C reduction of 17–24% compared with placebo. Bempedoic acid also decreased apoB, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC) levels to a greater extent than placebo. The anticipated results of the CLEAR OUTCOMES trial in 2022 (NCT02993406) will determine if treatment with bempedoic acid decreases the ASCVD in adults who are statin intolerant. Bempedoic acid was approved in February 2020 in the United States for treatment of adults with HeFH or established ASCVD who require additional LDL-C lowering. It is administered orally, with or without food, at a dose of 180 mg once daily. Bempedoic acid-ezetimibe combination therapy has also been approved.

Hyperuricemia has been reported with the use of bempedoic acid, secondary to inhibition of renal tubular secretion of uric acid. Adverse events included nasopharyngitis, myalgia, upper respiratory tract infections, dizziness, and diarrhea. In the CLEAR HARMONY trial, adverse events occurred with similar frequency in those who received bempedoic acid and placebo. In addition to uric acid, bempedoic acid was associated with mild increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and decreases in hemoglobin. The risk of myotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis is considered low since the drug is not activated in skeletal muscles.

Pediatric data: Safety and effectiveness have not been established in youth < 18 years-of-age.

Efficacy and Safety of Bempedoic Acid in Association With Anti-PCSK9 and Ezetimibe in Statin-intolerant Patients ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Statin intolerance occurs in up to 15–20% of treated patients. The combined use of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 inhibitors with ezetimibe is commonly performed in these patients, and has been associated with an estimated LDL-C reduction of 65–70%. The CLEAR Harmony trial demonstrated that bempedoic acid in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy did not lead to a higher incidence of adverse events compared to placebo and significantly lowered LDL-C levels. In the CLEAR Serenity study, bempedoic acid showed a safe and effective profile compared with placebo in patients with statin intolerance.

In the CLEAR Tranquility, it provided an oral therapeutic option complementary to ezetimibe in patients intolerant to high-dose statins who required additional LDL-C lowering. The synergistic effect of bempedoic acid plus PCSK9 inhibitors has been investigated by one phase 2 trial, which showed a statistical superiority of bempedoic acid plus evolocumab strategy versus placebo plus evolocumab in terms of percent change in LDL-C up to 2 months. To date, no randomized phase 3 clinical trial have evaluated the effect of bempedoic acid in association with anti-PCSK9 and ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients not attaining the recommended LDL-C target. The investigators hypothesized that the association of bempedoic acid with PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe may be safe and effective in reducing LDL-C in statin-intolerant patients.
- Patients treated with PCSK9 inhibitors plus ezetimibe for at least 12 weeks
- Patients with statin intolerance, defined as inability to tolerate at least two statins, one at the lowest starting daily dose and another at any daily dose, either due to objectionable symptoms or abnormal laboratory analysis, temporally related to statin treatment, reversible upon statin discontinuation, reproducible by rechallenge, and excluding other known factors).

In people 40–75 years of age, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in those without ASCVD risk factors, and use a high-intensity statin in those with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factor, with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L); it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant. In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

Lipid‐Lowering Intensification: Bempedoic Acid

Bempedoic acid is an oral prodrug that is only converted to its active thioester in hepatocytes, the only cell to express the relevant acyl coenzyme A synthetase (ie, no conversion in skeletal muscle), and which then inhibits the ATP citrate lyase, a key enzyme of the cholesterol‐biosynthesis pathway. 67 The CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an adenosinetriphosphate citrate lyase (ACL)‐Inhibiting Regimen) and CLEAR wisdom phase 3 trials recently demonstrated that a regimen of 180 mg once‐a‐day bempedoic acid, in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy, led to an additional 15% to 20% reduction of LDL‐C plasma levels, with a good safety profile. 68, 69 The results of these trials were further confirmed by a meta‐analysis of 7 studies comprising 4236 patients. 70 The Food and Drug Administration recently approved bempedoic acid for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established cardiovascular disease and LDL‐C > 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statins. Nonetheless, the impact of bempedoic acid on outcomes remains to be determined and is being investigated in the ongoing CLEAR OUTCOMES trial, which recently completed enrollment of 14 014 patients with statin intolerance and high cardiovascular risk or established cardiovascular disease (NCT02993406). Of note, specific data on the impact of bempedoic acid on LDL‐C level reduction and outcomes following a recent ACS are lacking as the dedicated trials have so far excluded patients with a recent ACS.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^113WoyMW]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Bempedoic acid among statin-intolerant primary prevention patients — subgroup analysis from the CLEAR Trial reported that bempedoic acid reduced the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events by 30% (absolute risk reduction 2.3% (5.3% vs. 7.6%)); the mean age among primary prevention patients was 68 years, and in the overall trial, 15% of participants were aged 75 years or older, with no interaction of treatment by age; thus, among statin intolerant individuals older than 75 years when a decision is made to lower LDL-C to reduce ASCVD risk, bempedoic acid may be considered.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without statin-associated muscle symptoms treated with bempedoic acid in the CLEAR outcomes trial [^111RnnqF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cholesterol Lowering via bEmpedoic Acid Regimen (CLEAR) outcomes, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial, and the largest prospective database of patients with statin intolerance (SI), demonstrated that bempedoic acid reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular risk in patients at high cardiovascular risk.

Objective

Assess baseline differences in SI symptoms and whether these influenced the clinical course during CLEAR outcomes.

Methods

Symptoms and impact of SI on daily living were recorded prior to randomization. This posthoc analysis grouped patients as reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms only (SAMS), nonmuscle adverse effects only (nonSAMS), or BOTH.

Results

Of the 13,970 patients at baseline, 49% reported SAMS, 18% nonSAMS, and 33% BOTH. Moderate/severe impact on daily living was recorded for 62% SAMS, 48% nonSAMS, and 69% BOTH. Baseline lipid modifying treatment (LMT) was used in 43% SAMS, 36% nonSAMS, and 42% BOTH. Drop-in use of moderate/high-intensity statin at any time during the study was higher in the placebo group in all SI groups and higher in SAMS and BOTH vs nonSAMS, but was not generally maintained at study end. SAMS and BOTH groups had more muscle symptoms and higher rates of treatment discontinuation vs. nonSAMS but there was no difference between treatments.

Conclusion

Patients who reported SAMS, regardless of randomization to bempedoic acid or placebo, had higher rates of discontinuation, higher rates of skeletal muscle symptoms, and a greater percentage of patients to attempt statin rechallenge. These findings indicate patients with history of SAMS may have background factors impacting their tolerance to LMT and may require more focused clinical management.

### Impact of bempedoic acid on total cardiovascular events: a prespecified analysis of the CLEAR outcomes randomized clinical trial [^112woJhY]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The ATP citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor, bempedoic acid, reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 13% in patients at high cardiovascular risk with intolerance of statin and high-intensity statin medications. The effects of bempedoic acid on total cardiovascular events remain unknown.

Objective

To determine the impact of bempedoic acid on the total incidence of MACE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Included in this prespecified analysis of the Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes trial were patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease, with hypercholesterolemia and inability to take guideline-recommended statins. Study data were analyzed from December 2016 to November 2022.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with bempedoic acid or placebo daily.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the time to first event for a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization (MACE-4). The key secondary end point was time to first event for cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (MACE-3). This prespecified analysis compared the total number of cardiovascular events in the treatment groups.

Results

A total of 13 970 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [9] years; 7230 male [51.8%]) were included in the study. A total of 9764 participants (69.9%) had prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C level of 139 mg/dL; treatment with bempedoic acid resulted in a 21% reduction in LDL-C level and a 22% reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level at 6 months. Median (IQR) follow-up was 3.4 (3.1–3.9) years. A total of 1746 positively adjudicated first MACE-4 events and 915 additional MACE events in 612 patients were recorded, with coronary revascularization representing 32.8% (573 of 1746) of first events and 69.4% (635 of 915) of additional events. For the total incidence of cardiovascular events, treatment with bempedoic acid was associated with a reduction in risk of MACE-4 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.89; P < .001), MACE-3 (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.93; p = 0.002), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58–0.83; P < .001), and coronary revascularization (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.89; P < .001), although no statistically significant difference was observed for stroke (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63–1.03). A lower HR for protection with bempedoic acid was observed with increasing number of MACE events experienced by patients.

Conclusion and Relevance

Lowering LDL-C level with bempedoic acid reduced the total number of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk, statin therapy intolerance, and elevated LDL-C levels.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113h13op]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Two studies 25, 27 enrolled patients with statin intolerance receiving no statin, low‐dose statin, or maximally tolerated statin therapy. Fasting LDL‐C required at randomization was ≥ 100 mg/dL for Ballantyne et al, 27 whereas for Laufs et al, 25 it was ≥ 100 mg/dL for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ≥ 130 mg/dL for primary cardiovascular prevention patients.

Two studies 28, 29 enrolled patients with hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated statin therapy, with a required LDL‐C of 115 to 220 mg/dL for Ballantyne et al 29 and 130 to 220 mg/dL for Thompson et al. 28 The study by Ballantyne et al 24 provided separate data for patients receiving BA and those receiving BA plus ezetimibe. The 2 populations were analyzed as separate data sets.

All the 7 studies were randomized controlled trials, and major characteristics of study populations are shown in Table 1 and Table S2. Changes in triglycerides and high‐density lipoprotein were only reported by 2 phase 2 studies, 28, 29 and were expressed as median values for triglycerides. Thus, no meta‐analytic analysis was performed for these 2 outcomes.

Table 1
Characteristics of Included Studies

Efficacy Outcomes

The 7 studies included in the analysis 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 showed a more significant reduction in LDL‐C after 12 weeks of treatment with BA compared with control treatment (MD, −17.5%; 95% CI, −22.9% to −12.0%; P < 0.001; Figure 1). Heterogeneity among these studies was statistically significant (I 2 = 80.3%; P < 0.001), and no reduction in the overall heterogeneity was found after excluding one study at time. Two studies enrolling high‐risk patients 24, 26 showed that an LDL‐C target < 70 mg/dL was achieved by 30.3% of BA‐treated patients and 8.6% of controls (OR, 4.65; 95% CI, 3.6–6.0; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; P = 0.631).

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^111i19Vu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The CLEAR Serenity trial enrolled patients with either a primary or secondary indication for lipid‐lowering therapy, which, if not for demonstrated intolerance, would typically include a statin. The high baseline mean LDL‐C, frequent absence of any lipid‐lowering therapy at baseline, and marked prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities reflect both the high cardiovascular risk of this population and the paucity of treatment options for these patients. The CLEAR Serenity study is also notable for the large proportion of women, a group that is often underrepresented in clinical trials of pharmaceutical agents for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 33 The greater percentage of women versus men in the study may be related to the observed increased risk for statin intolerance among women. 3, 34 Overall, the enrollment criteria of the study allowed for assessing bempedoic acid in the diversity of patients and background therapies that are encountered in clinical practice.

The efficacy and safety data presented herein must be interpreted with an understanding of the study's limitations, such as its comparatively short duration (24 weeks). The durability of effect and safety of extended bempedoic acid use is currently being evaluated in a long‐term, open‐label extension study, during which all patients will receive bempedoic acid for up to 78 weeks.

The results from the CLEAR Serenity study demonstrate that bempedoic acid significantly reduces LDL‐C and hsCRP in patients with statin intolerance, regardless of baseline LDL‐C or concomitant lipid‐lowering therapy. Treatment with bempedoic acid was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk for muscle‐related adverse events. These findings show that bempedoic acid offers an oral therapeutic alternative that lowers LDL‐C and is complementary to statins and other nonstatin therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^112CkuK9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inability to tolerate statins because of muscle symptoms contributes to uncontrolled cholesterol levels and insufficient cardiovascular risk reduction. Bempedoic acid, a prodrug that is activated by a hepatic enzyme not present in skeletal muscle, inhibits‐citrate lyase, an enzyme upstream of β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.

Methods and Results

The phase 3, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL‐Inhibiting Regimen) Serenity study randomized 345 patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of intolerance to at least 2 statins (1 at the lowest available dose) 2:1 to bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary end point was mean percent change from baseline to week 12 in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. The mean age was 65.2 years, mean baseline low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol was 157.6 mg/dL, and 93% of patients reported a history of statin‐associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid treatment significantly reduced low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline to week 12 (placebo‐corrected difference, −21.4% [95% CI, −25.1% to −17.7%]; P < 0.001). Significant reductions with bempedoic acid versus placebo were also observed in non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (−17.9%), total cholesterol (−14.8%), apolipoprotein B (−15.0%), and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (−24.3%; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Bempedoic acid was safe and well tolerated. The most common muscle‐related adverse event, myalgia, occurred in 4.7% and 7.2% of patients who received bempedoic acid or placebo, respectively.

Conclusions

Bempedoic acid offers a safe and effective oral therapeutic option for lipid lowering in patients who cannot tolerate statins.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid among patients with and without diabetes: prespecified analysis of the CLEAR outcomes randomised trial [^115sRSnp]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events among those with or without diabetes but have been reported to increase new-onset diabetes. The CLEAR Outcomes trial demonstrated that bempedoic acid reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among statin-intolerant patients at high cardiovascular risk. In this prespecified analysis, our dual aims were to evaluate the cardiovascular benefits of bempedoic acid, an ATP-citrate lyase inhibitor, in individuals with diabetes, and to evaluate the risk of new-onset diabetes and HbA₁c among those without diabetes in the CLEAR Outcomes trial.

Methods

CLEAR Outcomes was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 1250 primary care and outpatient sites in 32 countries. Patients with or without cardiovascular disease who were unwilling or unable to take guideline-recommended doses of statins and an LDL cholesterol of 2·59 mmol/L or more were randomly assigned (1:1) in a double-blinded manner to either bempedoic acid 180 mg once per day or placebo. In this prespecified analysis, the efficacy endpoint was a time-to-event analysis of four-component major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE-4), which is the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularisation, using the intention-to-treat population stratified by baseline glycaemia status. The prespecified analysis of risk of new-onset diabetes and HbA 1c increase was evaluated in patients without diabetes at baseline. The CLEAR Outcomes trial was completed on Nov 7, 2022, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02993406).

Findings

Between Dec 22, 2016, and Nov 7, 2022, 13970 patients were screened and randomly assigned; 6373 (45·6%) with diabetes, 5796 (41·5%) with prediabetes, and 1801 (12·9%) with normoglycaemia. Over a median of 3·4 years follow up, patients with diabetes had significant relative and absolute cardiovascular risk reductions in MACE-4 endpoints with bempedoic acid (HR 0·83; 95% CI 0·72–0·95; absolute risk reduction of 2·4%) compared to placebo, with no statistical evidence of effect modification across glycaemic strata (interaction p = 0·42). The proportion of patients who developed new-onset diabetes were similar between the bempedoic acid and placebo groups, with 429 of 3848 (11·1%) with bempedoic acid versus 433 of 3749 (11·5%) with placebo (HR 0·95; 95% CI 0·83–1·09). HbA₁c concentrations at month 12 and the end of the study were similar between randomised groups in patients who had prediabetes and normoglycaemia. Placebo-corrected LDL cholesterol concentrations and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at 6 months were reduced in each glycaemic stratum (diabetes, prediabtes, and normoglycaemia) for patients randomly assigned to bempedoic acid (all p < 0·001).

Interpretation

Among patients with diabetes, bempedoic acid reduces LDL cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and risk of cardiovascular events. Patients without diabetes had no increase in new-onset diabetes or worsening HbA₁c with bempedoic acid. The efficacy and cardiometabolic safety profile of bempedoic acid makes it a clinical option for those with and without diabetes.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112LfiY5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

More in detail, the 2 studies specifically enrolling patients with statin intolerance 25, 27 suggested that BA with or without ezetimibe may be a valuable therapeutic option for patients unable to tolerate statins because of adverse effects. By a clinical point of view, this is of great relevance considering that statin intolerance has been linked to a lower likelihood of achieving LDL‐C goals, increased risk for nonfatal cardiovascular events with related disability, and higher healthcare costs. 33, 34

Furthermore, on the basis of obtained results, BA can be considered also as an intriguing option in high‐risk patients. Several lines of data 5 suggest that despite adequate lipid‐lowering treatment, many patients fail to achieve target LDL‐C and remain at elevated cardiovascular risk. This is significant mainly in patients with high LDL‐C levels (familial hypercholesterolemia) and in those requiring low LDL‐C targets (previous vascular events or multiple vascular risk factors). 1, 11 Data from the Voyager study 5 showed that, despite a treatment with high‐intensity statins, patients with high LDL‐C at baseline fail to achieve an LDL‐C target < 100 and < 70 mg/dL in 25% to 30% and 70% to 80% of cases, respectively. Moreover, only 22% of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia taking lipid‐lowering treatments reached the therapeutic target of LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL. 35 This therapeutic concern is even more stringent considering most recent guidelines suggesting a further reduction in LDL‐C target levels. 36 This evidence suggests the need for further therapeutic options on top of standard treatments. Although in the past years proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors have been licensed for use in hypercholesterolemic patients and demonstrated a high efficacy rate (≈60% LDL‐C reduction), 37 not all patients have criteria for eligibility to this treatment and, in some cases, problems with compliance to a subcutaneous treatment are reported. On this hand, BA can be considered a valuable therapeutic option with a good safety and efficacy profile. Indeed, a separate analysis on 2 studies enrolling high‐risk patients 24, 26 showed that the addition of BA on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without other lipid‐lowering therapies, leads to an achievement of an LDL‐C target < 70 mg/dL in ≈30% of cases. Moreover, although the LDL‐C reduction is less significant compared with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, BA is characterized by an oral formulation and has anticipated lower costs than the monoclonal antibody inhibitors.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^111zsgz1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety

Treatment‐emergent adverse events occurred in 64.1% and 56.8% of patients in the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups, respectively (Table 4). The majority of adverse events in both groups were mild or moderate in intensity. The most frequent adverse events by system‐organ class were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (22.2% bempedoic acid, 25.2% placebo), infections and infestations (17.5% bempedoic acid, 22.5% placebo), and gastrointestinal disorders (10.7% bempedoic acid, 11.7% placebo). Serious adverse events were reported by 5.2% of patients (6.0% bempedoic acid, 3.6% placebo), none of which were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. More patients in the bempedoic acid treatment group discontinued because of an adverse event (18.4%) compared with placebo (11.7%). Most adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation occurred in only a single patient, and no individual preferred term or system‐organ class drove the higher discontinuation rate in the bempedoic acid group (Table 5). Adverse event rates were similar in patient subgroups.

Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation by System–Organ Class

No serious muscle‐related adverse events occurred during the study. Predefined muscle‐related adverse events occurred in 12.8% of patients receiving bempedoic acid and 16.2% who received placebo (Table 4). The most common event was myalgia, experienced by 4.7% and 7.2% of patients in the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Myalgia led to study drug discontinuation for 3.4% of patients who received bempedoic acid and 6.3% of patients who received placebo. Muscular weakness was reported by 0.4% of bempedoic acid‐treated patients and 1.8% of placebo‐treated patients. No patient had a repeated and confirmed creatine kinase elevation > 5 times the upper limit of normal.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1145KtNK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Bempedoic acid (BA) is a novel lipid-lowering drug. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of BA compared with standard treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Methods and Results Studies were systematically searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. Efficacy outcome was represented by percentage changes (mean difference [MD] with pertinent 95% CIs) in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) in BA patients and controls. Seven studies were included (2767 BA-treated patients and 1469 controls), showing a more significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD, -17.5%; 95% CI, -22.9% to -12.0%), total cholesterol (MD, -10.9%; 95% CI, -13.3% to -8.5%), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD, -12.3%; 95% CI, -15.3% to -9.20%), apolipoprotein B (MD, -10.6%; 95% CI, -13.2% to -8.02%), and hs-CRP (MD, -13.2%; 95% CI, -16.7% to -9.79%) in BA-treated patients compared with controls. Results were confirmed when separately analyzing studies on patients with high cardiovascular risk, studies on statin-intolerant patients, and studies on patients with hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. BA-treated subjects reported a higher rate of treatment discontinuation caused by adverse effects, of gout flare, and of increase in uric acid compared with controls. On the other hand, BA-treated patients showed a lower incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus than controls. Conclusions BA is associated with a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and hs-CRP compared with standard treatment. Documented efficacy is accompanied by an acceptable safety profile.

### Association of bempedoic acid administration with atherogenic lipid levels in phase 3 randomized clinical trials of patients with hypercholesterolemia [^116r7DrS]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Additional lipid-lowering therapy options are needed for patients who cannot achieve sufficient decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins alone or for those who are statin intolerant.

Objective

To conduct a pooled analysis of phase 3 randomized clinical trials of bempedoic acid vs placebo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This analysis pooled data from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials conducted from 2016 to 2018. Patients were enrolled in North America and Europe. Eligibility criteria included hypercholesterolemia while receiving stable lipid-lowering therapy and high cardiovascular risk or hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 2:1 to bempedoic acid, 180 mg (n = 2425), or placebo (n = 1198) once daily for 12 to 52 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary efficacy end point was percentage change from baseline in LDL-C level at week 12 in the intention-to-treat population. Patients were parsed into 2 groups according to enrollment criteria: (1) patients with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or with both and receiving statins and (2) patients with hypercholesterolemia who were statin intolerant receiving maximally tolerated statins.

Results

In this analysis of 3623 patients, the overall mean (SD) patient age was 65.5 (9.2) years (similar in both pools). Among patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both, the mean (SD) baseline LDL-C level was 107.6 (32.7) mg/dL. At week 12, the LDL-C level percentage change from baseline was -16.0% with bempedoic acid vs 1.8% with placebo (difference, -17.8%; 95% CI, -19.5% to -16.0%; P < .001). Patients with statin intolerance had a mean (SD) baseline LDL-C level of 144.4 (38.8) mg/dL. The percentage changes in LDL-C levels at week 12 were -23.0% in the bempedoic acid group and 1.5% in the placebo group (difference, -24.5%; 95% CI, -27.8% to -21.1%; P < .001). The decrease in LDL-C levels with bempedoic acid was sustained during long-term follow-up in both pools (patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, difference of -12.7% at week 52; patients with statin intolerance, difference of -22.2% at week 24). Decreases in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were greater with bempedoic acid vs placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated more frequently with bempedoic acid than with placebo included increased blood uric acid level (2.1% vs 0.5%), gout (1.4% vs 0.4%), decreased glomerular filtration rate (0.7% vs < 0.1%), and increased levels of hepatic enzymes (2.8% vs 1.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Bempedoic acid added to maximally tolerated statins, including moderate- or high-intensity statins or no background statin, was associated with decreased LDL-C levels vs placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia with an acceptable safety profile. As a nonstatin adjunct or statin alternative, bempedoic acid has potential for use in a broad spectrum of patients.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^1141C6m4]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Bempedoic acid

Bempedoic acid (Esperion, Ann Arbor, MI) is an oral small molecule that acts in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway interfering with ATP-citrate lyase upstream of HMGCR. Bempedoic acid 180 mg daily reduces LDL-C by 15% to 20% from baseline either as monotherapy or when taken with background statin therapy. When bempedoic acid 180 mg daily and ezetimibe 10 mg daily were taken together, LDL-C was reduced by 50%. Although serious side effects have not been reported to date, blinded clinical trial patients randomized to receive bempedoic acid were more likely to discontinue treatment, often because of headaches. Bempedoic acid was approved in 2020 by the FDA for LDL-C reduction both as monotherapy 180 mg (trade name Nexletol in the United States, Nilemdo in the EU [Esperion]) and in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg (trade name Nexlizet in the United States, Nustendi in the EU [Esperion]). Potential indications for bempedoic alone and in combination with ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors include helping patients achieve lower LDL-C than is possible while taking the maximally tolerated statin dose. A large cardiovascular outcome study of bempedoic acid in patients with statin intolerance has been initiated.

Predefined sensitivity analyses for all primary and secondary efficacy end points were performed without imputation for missing data, and included data prior to any postbaseline change in concomitant lipid‐modifying therapy (adjunctive lipid‐modifying therapy analysis) and data from the on‐treatment period (on‐treatment analysis). Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary end point using analysis of covariance without imputation for missing data on the following groups: cardiovascular disease risk category (primary versus secondary prevention), baseline LDL‐C category (< 130 mg/dL, ≥ 130 and < 160 mg/dL, ≥ 160 mg/dL), history of diabetes mellitus, age (< 65, ≥ 65 to < 75, ≥ 75 years), race, sex, body mass index category (< 25 kg/m², ≥ 25 and < 30 kg/m², ≥ 30 kg/m²), and background lipid‐modifying therapy (statin, nonstatin, none). Safety analyses included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. No statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups for safety data. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

### New cardiovascular prevention guidelines: how to optimally manage dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk in 2021 in patients needing secondary prevention? [^1161rx8r]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a principally modifiable cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; accordingly, recent European and US multisociety dyslipidaemia guidelines emphasise the importance of lowering LDL-C to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review provides perspectives on established and emerging agents that reduce LDL-C to help providers synthesize the abundance of new evidence related to prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide hypothetical cases of patients with different cardiovascular risk factors and medical histories to illustrate application of current lipid-lowering guidelines in various clinical settings. As a core focus of preventive therapy, both European and US lipid management guidelines emphasise the importance of identifying patients at very high cardiovascular risk and treating to achieve LDL-C levels as low as possible, with European guidelines setting a goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) in patients with very high-risk cardiovascular disease. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are now included in the guidelines and may fulfil an important unmet need for very high-risk patients who are not able to achieve LDL-C goals with conventional agents. The recently approved bempedoic acid and other promising agents under development will add to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering drugs available for clinicians to help patients meet their treatment goals.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^114eeKya]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients who cannot tolerate a statin‐based treatment regimen present a particular challenge for lipid management and cardiovascular event risk reduction. 1, 2 Registries and observational studies have reported statin intolerance prevalence rates of 7% to 29%, with the predominant symptoms being muscle‐related side effects. 3 Statin‐associated muscle symptoms account for > 90% of side effects attributed to statins 4 and contribute to the high rate of nonadherence and discontinuation frequently observed with statin therapy. 3, 5, 6, 7 As treatment with a statin, the cornerstone of lipid‐lowering therapy, is not suitable at standard doses for individuals with intolerance, these patients are less likely to achieve adequate antiatherogenic lipid reduction and are, thus, at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with statin‐treated patients. 8, 9, 10 To reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients, additional pharmacologic lipid‐lowering options are needed. 11, 12

Bempedoic acid (Esperion Therapeutics Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) is a first‐in‐class, small‐molecule inhibitor of ATP‐citrate lyase, a component of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that works upstream of β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme A. Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that is activated by very‐long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase‐1, an enzyme that is not present in skeletal muscle. 13 Therefore, although bempedoic acid acts on the same pathway as statins, lack of the activating enzyme in skeletal muscle may prevent the muscular adverse effects associated with statins. 13 In phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, bempedoic acid significantly reduced atherogenic lipoproteins and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and was associated with a low risk for adverse events typically associated with statins such as muscle‐related symptoms and new‐onset diabetes mellitus. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Here, we report the results of CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL‐Inhibiting Regimen) Serenity, a phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of bempedoic acid 180 mg daily versus placebo in statin‐intolerant patients requiring lipid‐lowering therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Statistical Analysis

A sample size of 300 randomized patients (200 assigned to bempedoic acid and 100 assigned to placebo) was chosen to provide > 95% power to detect a 15% difference between the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups in LDL‐C percent change from baseline to week 12. This calculation was based on a 2‐sided t test at the 5% level of significance and a common standard deviation of 15%.

Primary efficacy analyses were performed using the intention‐to‐treat population, which included all randomized patients. The primary and key secondary efficacy end points were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model, with treatment group as the main effect adjusting for patient type (primary versus secondary prevention/heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) and baseline values. Baseline for LDL‐C, non–HDL‐C, and total cholesterol was defined as the mean of the last 2 nonmissing values on or before study day 1. Baseline for apoB and hsCRP was defined as the predose value on day 1. Missing data were imputed using a pattern mixture model. For patients with missing data who had already discontinued the study drug (bempedoic acid or placebo), the missing values were imputed using data from placebo group patients only (ie, their responses were assumed to be similar to patients in the placebo group once they were off treatment). For patients who had missing data and were adherent to study treatment, their missing data were imputed using patient data from their respective treatment group. Means, least‐squares means, and standard errors were calculated for individual treatment groups, and 95% CIs and P values were determined for the placebo‐corrected change from baseline. Data are presented as placebo‐corrected least‐squares mean changes, unless otherwise indicated. For hsCRP, nonparametric analyses (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test) with Hodges‐Lehmann estimates and CIs were performed. A stepdown approach was used to test the primary efficacy end point followed by specific secondary efficacy end points sequentially in the following order: LDL‐C (week 12), LDL‐C (week 24), non–HDL‐C (week 12), total cholesterol (week 12), apoB (week 12), and hsCRP (week 12). In this hierarchical testing structure, each hypothesis was tested at a significance level of 0.05, 2‐sided. Statistical significance at each step was required to test the next hypothesis. In this study, all end points included in the step‐down procedure achieved the prespecified significance level; thus, the overall type I error was preserved. Had statistical significance not been achieved at any step, any subsequent end points would be considered as descriptive only. Additional time points and lipid measures that were not part of the hierarchical testing structure, including changes in triglycerides and HDL‐C, were summarized using descriptive statistics.

### Bempedoic acid: a new drug for an old problem [^111MPiL3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of bempedoic acid for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was conducted from January 2000 to June 15, 2020, using the keyword bempedoic acid for phase III clinical trials published in the English language.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles related to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of bempedoic acid and other trials relating to the safety and efficacy of this drug were included.

Data Synthesis

The findings from this review show that bempedoic acid is a safe and effective option for lowering LDL-C levels in patients requiring LDL-C lowering for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Statin therapy remains the mainstay of treatment for both primary and secondary prevention. However, many patients cannot tolerate statin therapy because of statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid may be a reasonable adjunct for LDL-C reduction, though further evaluation of cardiovascular outcomes with bempedoic acid in this population is needed.

Conclusions

The recent FDA approval of bempedoic acid offers an additional option for lowering LDL-C levels in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia. Additional data regarding effect on long-term cardiovascular outcomes with bempedoic acid are currently being studied.

### CLEAR serenity trial: more clarity for the future of bempedoic acid in patients unable to take statins? [^115t9Pr6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The CLEAR Serenity trial also raises questions about bempedoic acid. First, the baseline LDL‐C levels in the study were high, which may exaggerate the percentage reduction of LDL‐C. It is somewhat reassuring that previous phase 3 trials with the 180‐mg/d dose, which had lower LDL‐C baselines, showed a similar range in percentage reduction of LDL‐C: 18.1% in the CLEAR Harmony trial (baseline LDL‐C = 102–104 mg/dL on a background of maximally tolerated statins) and 28.5% in the CLEAR Tranquility trial (baseline LDL‐C = 123–130 mg/dL on a background of ezetimibe). 13, 14 There was further a sizable percentage of premature discontinuation (24.8% in the bempedoic acid group versus 16.2% in the placebo group), which seems high for a study of this duration. Also, although the rate of muscle symptoms was observed to be lower with bempedoic acid compared with placebo (12.8% versus 16.2%), the percentage of discontinuation attributable to adverse events observed with bempedoic acid (18.4%) was higher compared with placebo (11.7%). Finally, the occurrence of 9 adjudicated major adverse cardiac events in the treatment arm compared with 0 in the placebo arm is concerning. As the authors pointed out, this may simply be a statistical anomaly as previous studies, including the phase 3 safety trial, did not show a treatment‐related increase in cardiovascular events or mortality in the bempedoic acid group. 14

Secondary and Other Efficacy End Points

The absolute mean decrease from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C level was greater in patients treated with bempedoic acid vs placebo in patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin (bempedoic acid, −19.8 mg/dL vs placebo, 0.3 mg/dL) and in patients with statin intolerance (bempedoic acid, −36.5 mg/dL vs placebo, 0.6 mg/dL) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Decreases in LDL-C were observed at the first postbaseline study visit (week 4) and were maintained through the last measurement time point (bempedoic acid, −12.7% vs placebo, 0.4% at 52 weeks in the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin; and bempedoic acid, −22.2% vs placebo, −1.8% at 24 weeks in the pool of patients with statin intolerance; Figure 1 B and C). At week 52, the mean LDL-C level in the on-treatment analysis (which included only patients still receiving assigned therapy within 7 days before LDL-C level measurement) was 88.6 (SE, 0.8) mg/dL in the bempedoic acid group vs 104.7 (SE, 1.3) mg/dL in the placebo group, representing LS mean percentage changes from baseline of −15.4 (SE, 0.6) in the bempedoic acid group and −0.1 (SE, 0.8) mg/dL in the placebo group (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). In the on-treatment analysis, decreases from baseline associated with bempedoic acid vs placebo administration were significant at each time point (P < .001). A small but significant attenuation of the associated effect was observed from week 12 to week 52 (P = 0.006).

Bempedoic acid — this oral nonstatin lowers LDL cholesterol levels by 15% for those on statins and 23% for those not taking statins, and use with ezetimibe results in an additional 19% LDL cholesterol reduction; in CLEAR Outcomes (statin-intolerant individuals with established ASCVD [70%] or at high risk [30%]), four-point major adverse cardiovascular events were reduced by 13% versus placebo, ∼19% were on very-low-dose statin therapy at baseline, prespecified analyses in people with diabetes showed a 17% reduction in four-point major adverse cardiovascular events with bempedoic acid, and for primary prevention the primary composite outcome was reduced by 30% versus placebo.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116teYxm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The findings from the primary NMA were consistent regardless of statin background therapy for most interventions, although the analysis in patients who were apparently statin intolerant must be viewed in the context of greater uncertainty. In the case of bempedoic acid, it was shown that the addition of bempedoic acid to moderate‐ to high‐intensity statin therapy resulted in a lower percentage reduction in LDL‐C compared with use in statin‐intolerant patients. The reduced efficacy of bempedoic acid on top of statin therapy is to be expected, because ATP citrate lyase is 2 steps upstream of statin reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway; hence, the impact of ATP citrate lyase inhibition can be expected to be greater in the absence of statin reductase inhibition. Findings from the primary NMA were consistent in a subgroup analysis of trials with populations of > 50% patients with ASCVD, the most common very high‐risk group for whom nonstatin agents are recommended as an adjunct to statins to achieve LDL‐C treatment goals. The maximum reduction achieved in the primary NMA by an additional nonstatin agent was 64.68%, which is around 14% higher than the current European guidelines' minimum LDL‐C reduction goal of 50%. However, this ≥ 50% goal reduction is from a baseline of no LDL‐C–lowering treatment, not in addition to statins. The benefit of add‐on LLT can be estimated by assuming a "pre‐PCSK9" LDL‐C level of 96.7 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), which can be translated into an additional 13.5‐mg/dL (0.35‐mmol/L) reduction when comparing the reduction goal of 50% with the maximum reduction achieved by a PCSK9 inhibitor of 64.68%. Therefore, assuming the results in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta‐analysis, which indicate a 38.7‐mg/dL (1.0‐mmol/L) reduction in LDL‐C reduces MACEs by 21%, this would imply a reduction in MACEs of ≈7.9% (1 − 0.79^0.35), a hypothetical percentage that implies the benefit of the addition of nonstatin LLT agents.

### Safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1124JAqF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis we investigated the safety and efficacy of BA compared to placebo. 11 RCT, encompassing 18,315 patients, were included. Our results can be summarized as follows:
BA is associated with a substantial and stable in time reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, Apo-B and hs-CRP as compared to placebo. The efficacy of the drug was confirmed across several subgroups of hypercholesterolemic patients either with ASCVD on maximally tolerated statin therapy or statin intolerant patients.
BA efficacy on lipid profile translates clinically in a significant reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction and the need of coronary revascularisations as compared with placebo or no therapy.
Efficacy of BA is accompanied by a good safety profile. In particular the incidence of muscle disorders and serious adverse events among patients on BA was comparable to that on placebo. However, a slight but significant higher risk of gout was observed among patients treated with BA as compared to placebo. The recent Clear Outcome study also found a modest increase in cholelithiasis and tendon rupture. No increase in new onset diabetes was observed; rather a trend toward a decrease was found.

### Bempedoic acid: the new kid on the block for the treatment of dyslipidemia and LDL cholesterol: a narrative review [^114tcTBi]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in which dyslipidaemia plays a crucial role. Statins are first line therapy for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD; however, adverse events include reversible musculoskeletal and liver side effects in addition to a diabetogenic association. In this short review, we provide a succinct narrative of the future role and current trial data of a novel first-in-class molecule, bempedoic acid. The authors provide their expert insight with a focus on Phase III randomised controlled trials (RCT) of bempedoic acid. Bempedoic acid was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February and March 2020, respectively, and is a novel molecule which inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in the same mechanistic pathway as statins. It is a first-in-class small molecule, delivered as a prodrug and administered as an oral, once-daily dose that decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Phase II and III RCTs have demonstrated efficacy with adequate safety data as mono- or combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe. Bempedoic acid is hepatically converted to the active drug with a lack of activation in skeletal muscle. Due to this novel mechanism, musculoskeletal-related adverse events exhibit a lower prevalence providing an alternative pharmacotherapy in statin-intolerant patients. Bempedoic acid may be used as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy or in statin-intolerant patients for the treatment of dyslipidaemia. The recent National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (UK) technology appraisal guidance [TA694] published in April 2021 recommended bempedoic acid with ezetimibe as a treatment option for primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia if statins are not tolerated or contraindicated and if there is inadequate control of LDL-C with ezetimibe alone. Additionally, outcomes trials evaluating 'hard' endpoints in statin-intolerant patients or those with ASCVD are currently underway.

Results

Patient Disposition

Six hundred two patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance were screened, and 345 patients were randomized to treatment with bempedoic acid (n = 234) or placebo (n = 111; Figure 2). A total of 327 patients (94.8%) completed the study, with 78.0% (n = 269) receiving the study drug throughout. Fifty‐eight (24.8%) patients in the bempedoic acid treatment group and 18 (16.2%) patients in the placebo treatment group discontinued study treatment (Figure 2). Mean study‐drug exposure was similar in the bempedoic acid and placebo groups (147.4 and 154.1 days, respectively). All randomized patients were included in the intention‐to‐treat and safety populations.

Figure 2
Patient disposition.

Baseline Characteristics

The study population was 56.2% female, 89.0% white, and had a mean age of 65.2 ± 9.5 years (Table 1). A greater proportion of patients were enrolled for primary versus secondary prevention (61.2% and 38.8%, respectively). Two percent of patients had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. A history of diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension was common in both treatment arms. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment groups.

Table 1
Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics a

At baseline, mean LDL‐C was 157.6 ± 39.9 mg/dL, non–HDL‐C was 192.6 ± 44.6 mg/dL, mean total cholesterol was 244.2 ± 46.3 mg/dL, apoB was 141.3 ± 31.2 mg/dL, and median hsCRP was 2.90 (Q1, Q3: 1.29, 5.15) mg/L. The majority of patients (58.0%) were not receiving any concomitant lipid‐modifying therapy. One third of patients were on background nonstatin therapy (the most common agents were ezetimibe and fish oil), and very‐low‐dose statin therapy was used by 8.4% of patients. All patients had a history of prior statin use; the most frequently reported were atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Documented statin intolerance attributable to muscle complaints (with or without other symptoms) was reported by 93.3% of patients. Approximately one third of patients who had experienced statin intolerance attributable to muscle symptoms had tried 3 or more statin medications.

Results

Patients

The total population comprised 3623 patients: 3009 patients in the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin (bempedoic acid, 2010; placebo, 999) and 614 in the pool of patients with statin intolerance (bempedoic acid, 415; placebo, 199) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups for both pools (Table 1). Overall, the mean (SD) patient age was 65.5 (9.2) years and was similar in both pools, and the number (%) of males in each group was balanced within the statins pool (bempedoic acid, 1427 [71.0%]; placebo, 697 [69.8%]) and within the pool of patients with statin intolerance (bempedoic acid, 173 [41.7%]; placebo, 82 [41.2%]). In the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, 2926 (97.2%) patients had a history of ASCVD and 112 (3.7%) had HeFH. In the pool of patients with statin intolerance, 201 patients (32.7%) were receiving no background LLT. In both the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin and the pool of patients with statin intolerance, the prevalence rates of diabetes (patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, 873 [29.0%]; patients with statin intolerance, 141 [23.0%]) and hypertension (ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, 2430 [80.8%]; patients with statin intolerance, 395 [64.3%]) were high. Baseline lipid parameters, including levels of lipoproteins, were similar between treatment groups for both pools and were consistent with the inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) baseline LDL-C level was 107.6 (32.7) mg/dL in the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin, and 144.4 (38.8) mg/dL in the pool of patients with statin intolerance.

Subgroup Analyses

In 38 of the trials included in the primary NMA, patients received background statin therapy. A subgroup analysis of these trials looking at the mean difference in percentage change in LDL‐C from baseline relative to placebo at week 12 found similar results to the overall population (Figure 4), with evolocumab, 140 mg Q2W/420 mg QM, and alirocumab, 150 mg Q2W, being the most efficacious (65.44% and 61.94% change in LDL‐C from baseline, respectively), followed by other alirocumab doses, inclisiran, and then the bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FDC and its components. A similar pattern was found in an NMA including the 10 trials in patients reporting statin intolerance (Figure S2); however, these findings are based on a much smaller evidence base (lower number of trials and sample size) and a more disconnected network. Furthermore, all the evidence for evolocumab, ezetimibe, and the bempedoic acid/ezetimibe FDC compared with placebo is indirect. These data therefore have greater levels of uncertainty.

Figure 4
Subgroup analysis: the mean difference (MD) in percentage change in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) from baseline in response to lipid‐lowering therapy relative to placebo at week 12 in patients receiving statin background therapy (moderate‐high intensity) (blue), with the primary analysis data plotted for comparison (gray).

FDC indicates fixed‐dose combination; Q2W, every 2 weeks; Q3M, every 3 months; Q6M, every 6 months; QD, once a day; and QM, once a month.

Unlike other agents, the percentage reduction of LDL‐C levels by bempedoic acid was influenced by statin background therapy. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL‐C levels to a lesser extent in the subgroup analysis focusing on trials with moderate‐ to high‐intensity statin background therapy, than it did in the overall analyses, which also included trials that declared lower intensities/no statin patients to be statin intolerant.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^113UNHVG]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Bempedoic acid (BA) clinical considerations — BA reduces cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting ATP-citrate lyase and is activated in the liver but not skeletal muscle, potentially reducing muscular adverse effects. BA received FDA approval for adults who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or are at increased risk and are unable to take recommended statin therapy to reduce ASCVD events, and it is also approved to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary hyperlipidemia including HeFH. Evidence for primary prevention is limited; in adults with elevated LDL-C at or at increased risk of ASCVD who cannot adhere to recommended statin doses, BA results in a small decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) but leads to moderate increases in treatment discontinuation because of adverse events. Given the adverse events and modest effect sizes, a shared decision-making approach may be best, especially in older adults.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^1142XBF7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of ASCVD, it remains a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Central to ASCVD prevention is effective lipid-lowering, which reduces both the onset of disease and the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in those with established disease. However, translating these evidence-based strategies into routine clinical practice presents several challenges. Achieving guideline-directed lipid management can be complicated by factors such as patient intolerance, individual variability in response to therapy, and the presence of risk-enhancing factors that are not always neatly addressed by current guidelines.

Moreover, many commonly encountered clinical scenarios — as depicted in the aforementioned case examples — require nuanced, patient-centered approaches that extend beyond standard recommendations. The rapidly evolving landscape of LLTs, including the development of novel agents such as PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and inclisiran, provides clinicians with new tools to tailor treatments, but also necessitates a deeper understanding of when and how to use these therapies effectively. This review has aimed to bridge the gap between guideline-directed care and real-world clinical complexities, offering practical insights into managing patients with challenging lipid disorders. By contextualizing current recommendations and highlighting emerging treatment options, we hope to empower clinicians to make informed, individualized treatment decisions that improve outcomes for their patients. As the field of lipidology continues to evolve, it is crucial that healthcare providers employ both established and emerging therapies to reduce ASCVD risk and enhance patient care.

Although statins play a pivotal role in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, many patients fail to achieve recommended lipid levels due to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid is an oral pro-drug that is activated in the liver and inhibits cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes, but is not activated in skeletal muscle which has the potential to avoid muscle-related adverse events. Accordingly, this agent effectively lowers atherogenic lipoproteins in patients who experience statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the effects of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been studied. STUDY DESIGN: Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Included patients must have all of the following: (i) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or have a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, (ii) documented statin intolerance, and (iii) an LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. The study randomized 14,014 patients to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg daily or matching placebo on a background of guideline-directed medical therapy. The primary outcome is a composite of the time to first cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization. The trial will continue until 1620 patients experience a primary endpoint, with a minimum of 810 hard ischemic events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) and minimum treatment duration of 36 months and a projected median treatment exposure of 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: CLEAR Outcomes will determine whether bempedoic acid 180 mg daily reduces the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in high vascular risk patients with documented statin intolerance and elevated LDL-C levels.

### Inflammation and cholesterol as predictors of cardiovascular events among 13 970 contemporary high-risk patients with statin intolerance [^116kzD9r]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Among patients treated with statin therapy to guideline-recommended cholesterol levels, residual inflammatory risk assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is at least as strong a predictor of future cardiovascular events as is residual risk assessed by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC). Whether these relationships are present among statin-intolerant patients with higher LDLC levels is uncertain but has implications for the choice of preventive therapies, including bempedoic acid, an agent that reduces both LDLC and hsCRP.

Methods

The multinational CLEAR-Outcomes trial (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen Outcomes Trial) randomly allocated 13970 statin-intolerant patients to 180 mg of oral bempedoic acid daily or matching placebo and followed them for a 4-component composite of incident myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death, and for all-cause mortality. Quartiles of increasing baseline hsCRP and LDLC were assessed as predictors of future adverse events after adjustment for traditional risk factors and randomized treatment assignment.

Results

Compared with placebo, bempedoic acid reduced median hsCRP by 21.6% and mean LDLC levels by 21.1% at 6 months. Baseline hsCRP was significantly associated with the primary composite end point of major cardiovascular events (highest versus lowest hsCRP quartile; hazard ratio [HR], 1.43 [95% CI, 1.24–1.65]), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.53–2.61]), and all-cause mortality (HR, 2.21 [95% CI, 1.79–2.73]). By contrast, the relationship of baseline LDLC quartile (highest versus lowest) to future events was smaller in magnitude for the primary composite cardiovascular end point (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.04–1.37]) and neutral for cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.70–1.17]) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.78–1.16]). Risks were high for those with elevated hsCRP irrespective of LDLC level. Bempedoic acid demonstrated similar efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events across all levels of hsCRP and LDLC.

Conclusions

Among contemporary statin-intolerant patients, inflammation assessed by hsCRP predicted risk for future cardiovascular events and death more strongly than hyperlipidemia assessed by LDLC. Compared with placebo, bempedoic acid had similar efficacy for reducing cardiovascular risk across hsCRP and LDLC strata.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^114BMqX1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

QUESTION 8
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, when should non‐statin therapies be considered for ASCVD risk reduction?

Synopsis

Due to a lack of randomized controlled trials, non‐statin therapy for adults older than 75 years without prevalent ASCVD was not addressed in recent US or ESC guidelines of cholesterol management. Ezetimibe as monotherapy has been evaluated since in a single randomized controlled open label trial, EWTOPIA 75 (Ezetimibe Lipid‐Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in 75 or Older) which showed a 2.6% absolute and 34% relative reduction in risk of MACE in the ezetimibe group. The combination of statin and ezetimibe has not been evaluated in outcomes trials among adults older than 75 years without ASCVD. Among adults older than 75 years in whom a decision is made to use LDL‐C lowering therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD, statins are preferred given the available evidence, but ezetimibe therapy may be considered as an alternative if statin therapy is not tolerated, deemed inadvisable, or based on patient preference.

Limited data on bempedoic acid among statin‐intolerant high‐risk primary prevention patients are available from a subgroup analysis of the CLEAR Trial (Bempedoic Acid and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Statin‐Intolerant Patients). Bempedoic acid reduced the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events by 30% (absolute risk reduction 2.3% (5.3% vs. 7.6%)). The mean age among primary prevention patients was 68 years. In the overall trial, 15% of participants were aged 75 years or older, but data specific to this subgroup were not provided. There was no interaction of treatment by age. Thus, among statin intolerant individuals older than 75 years in whom a decision is made to lower LDL‐C to reduce ASCVD risk, bempedoic acid may be considered.

Secondary prevention trials with both evolocumab and alirocumab suggest similar benefits and safety of PCSK9 inhibition in older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger individuals. To date, there are no large randomized controlled outcomes trials using PCSK9 inhibition for primary prevention of ASCVD. Current data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for the treatment of adults aged 75 or older without ASCVD.

Figure 3 summarizes some key steps in managing hypercholesterolemia among this population.

### Factors associated with enhanced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with bempedoic acid [^114MiemD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Although based on pooled data from 4 randomized placebo‐controlled studies, this was a post hoc analysis. Other limitations include the smaller (19%) proportion of patients not receiving a statin compared with patients receiving background statin therapy. No change or an increase in LDL‐C was observed in 18% of patients receiving bempedoic acid. No response or hyporesponse has been reported with statins and other LLTs, which has often contributed to a lack of adherence to the study drug. Pharmacokinetics data are not available to determine adherence to either bempedoic acid or statin in either treatment arm. Most of the patients in this analysis were White and non‐Hispanic, which might limit generalizability of the results. Finally, although one might predict greater potential reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among those with the most robust LDL‐C lowering, bempedoic acid has other effects that may influence atherosclerotic risk including hsCRP lowering. Therefore, the clinical implications of these findings await the results of the ongoing CLEAR Outcomes trial (n = 14 014), which is examining the effects of bempedoic acid on LDL‐C levels and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with statin intolerance, has enrolled 6755 (48.2%) women and 5998 (42.8%) patients with diabetes. For all the patients enrolled in the CLEAR Outcomes trial, the mean (SD) baseline BMI is 29.9 kg/m² (5.2 kg/m²), and the median (Q1, Q3) hsCRP level is 2.3 mg/L (1.2, 4.5 mg/L).

Based on our analysis, about 25% of patients receiving background statin therapy and are initiating bempedoic acid should be expected to achieve at least an additional 30% reduction in LDL‐C levels. Approximately 50% of patients unable to take any statin should be expected to achieve LDL‐C lowering comparable to that of a moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin. Our findings may also help clinicians identify the clinical features of patients, including those having a history of statin intolerance, female sex, having diabetes, and having higher baseline hsCRP levels, that suggest these patients are more likely to achieve enhanced LDL‐C lowering with bempedoic acid.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^116RuGPY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Bempedoic acid was safe and well tolerated when administered to patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of statin intolerance. Muscle‐related symptoms were not increased relative to placebo, even among patients who were receiving background therapy with a very‐low‐dose statin. This finding is notable for 2 reasons: > 90% of patients enrolled in the study had experienced muscle symptoms during past treatment with a statin, and both bempedoic acid and statins act on the same biochemical pathway. A key differentiator between statins and bempedoic acid is that bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires activation by very‐long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase‐1, an enzyme that is absent in skeletal muscle. 13 The trial confirms the expectation that bempedoic acid does not induce muscle‐related side effects. Patients in the bempedoic acid treatment group did experience a small elevation in mean uric acid levels, but the occurrence rate of gout was low (1.7%). Increases in uric acid observed in patients taking bempedoic acid may be attributable to a potential competition between uric acid and the glucuronide metabolite of bempedoic acid for the same renal transporter(s). A small number of adjudicated clinical events occurred in the bempedoic acid treatment group, whereas none were observed in the placebo group. The imbalance between treatment groups is likely due to the small number of events overall and the 2:1 randomization scheme resulting in twice as many patients in the bempedoic acid treatment group. There has been no suggestion from prior studies of increased MACE risk with bempedoic acid. In the CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL‐Inhibiting Regimen) Harmony study, which enrolled patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, the rate of adjudicated MACE over 52 weeks of treatment was 4.6% with bempedoic acid and 5.7% with placebo. 20 Further insights regarding the long‐term efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with statin intolerance will come from the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial (CLEAR [Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL‐Inhibiting Regimen] Outcomes; NCT02993406).

On the other hand, it is noteworthy to highlight that BA was associated with an ≈30% lower incidence of new‐onset diabetes mellitus compared with standard treatment. Although needing to be confirmed in further studies, this finding is supported by a pathophysiological point of view by the mechanism of action of BA. Indeed, by inhibiting adenosine triphosphate–citrate lyase, besides suppressing cholesterol synthesis and triggering upregulation of low‐density lipoprotein receptor expression in the liver, BA modifies fatty acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. 13 Indeed, BA, by activating AMP‐activated protein kinase, determines an inhibitory phosphorylation of acetyl‐CoA carboxylase that, in turn, leads to inhibition of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, increase in mitochondrial long‐chain fatty acid oxidation, and improvement of glucose metabolism. 31, 32 This might suggest a potential ancillary effect of BA in patients with atherogenic hypercholesterolemia.

There are some differences in study population characteristics of studies included in the analysis. Three studies 23, 24, 26 enrolled patients with high cardiovascular risk and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia receiving stable doses of maximally tolerated statin therapy alone or in combination with other lipid‐lowering therapies; 2 studies 25, 27 enrolled patients with statin intolerance receiving no statin, low‐dose statin, or maximally tolerated statin therapy; and 2 studies 28, 29 enrolled patients with hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

We performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate differences in efficacy of BA in different settings, and we, interestingly, found that in both high‐risk patients and statin‐intolerant subjects, BA determined an ≈20% reduction in LDL‐C. In contrast, a somehow higher efficacy in non–HDL‐C, ApoB, and hs‐CRP reduction was observed in statin‐intolerant patients compared with high‐risk patients. This is likely caused by the lack of an adequate treatment in the large majority of statin‐intolerant patients, thus making BA treatment proportionally more efficacious.

### Factors associated with enhanced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with bempedoic acid [^115qQLiE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines suggest the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy to assist patients in reaching LDL‐C treatment goals. Variability of LDL‐C lowering with ezetimibe either alone or in combination with statins is reported, with some indication that variability with a statin is lower with concomitant ezetimibe use. Furthermore, greater reductions in LDL‐C with ezetimibe when given in combination with a statin is reported among obese individuals. Patients already receiving ezetimibe were more likely to achieve at least a 30% reduction in LDL‐C when bempedoic acid was added to their regimen. Adherence to treatment tends to decrease with an increase in the number of medications. The fixed‐dose combination of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe may be particularly useful in optimizing patient LDL‐C lowering, especially among patients taking other medications for comorbidities.

Results from multivariable analysis suggest that enhanced (≥ 30%) LDL‐C lowering with bempedoic acid is more likely for women versus men, patients with diabetes versus patients without diabetes, and patients with higher versus patients with lower hsCRP levels. After middle age, women have a higher total atherogenic lipoprotein burden compared with men, are more likely than men to experience statin intolerance, and less likely than men to be treated with any statin or guideline‐recommended statin intensity. Dyslipidemia is often uncontrolled in patients with diabetes, and patients with diabetes are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event. Patients with higher hsCRP levels are also at a higher risk of having a cardiovascular event. Therefore, bempedoic acid may be of particular benefit for patients who are often undertreated or unable to tolerate statins and who are at high‐risk for cardiovascular disease, including women, patients with diabetes, and patients with elevated hsCRP levels.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid added to ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^111ArZLd]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Patients with hyperlipidemia who are unable to tolerate optimal statin therapy are at increased cardiovascular risk due to ongoing elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The objective of CLEAR Tranquility (NCT03001076) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid when added to background lipid-modifying therapy in patients with a history of statin intolerance who require additional LDL-C lowering.

Methods

This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled patients with a history of statin intolerance and an LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL while on stable lipid-modifying therapy. After a 4-week ezetimibe 10 mg/day run-in period, patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily added to ezetimibe 10 mg/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C.

Results

The study population comprised 269 patients (181 bempedoic acid, 88 placebo). Bempedoic acid added to background lipid-modifying therapy that included ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28.5% more than placebo (p < 0.001; -23.5% bempedoic acid, +5.0% placebo). Significant reductions in secondary endpoints, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-23.6%), total cholesterol (-18.0%), apolipoprotein B (-19.3%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-31.0%), were observed with bempedoic acid vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Bempedoic acid was well tolerated; rates of treatment-emergent adverse events, muscle-related adverse events, and discontinuations were similar in the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups.

Conclusions

Bempedoic acid may provide an oral therapeutic option complementary to ezetimibe in statin intolerant patients who require additional LDL-C lowering.

### Bempedoic acid for prevention of cardiovascular events in people with obesity: a CLEAR outcomes subset analysis [^113SRwS6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedures.

The study design, full inclusion and exclusion criteria, and main results of CLEAR Outcomes have been published. Briefly, CLEAR Outcomes was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial at 1250 sites in 32 countries evaluating bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo daily in patients with statin intolerance who had elevated LDL‐C and high cardiovascular risk. Patients were included if they were aged 18 to 85 years, with baseline LDL‐C at least 100 mg/dL and a history of CVD (such as coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease; ie, secondary prevention) or were without CVD but considered at high risk for a cardiovascular event based on a coronary artery calcium score > 400 Agatston units, presence of either type 1 or 2 diabetes in women > 65 years or men > 60 years, Reynolds risk score > 30%, or Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation risk > 7.5% over 10 years (ie, primary prevention). Investigators assessed and confirmed the diagnosis of statin intolerance, which for the purposes of this trial included adverse events that started or increased during statin therapy and resolved or improved after discontinuation. Entry criteria required inability to tolerate 2 or more statins at any dose, or 1 statin and being unable or unwilling to (or advised by a physician not to) attempt a second statin. Stable, concomitant treatment with a very low statin dose (below the lowest approved daily dose) without side effects was permitted, as was administration of other lipid‐lowering therapy such as ezetimibe and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9) inhibitors.

### Comparative cardiovascular benefits of Bempedoic acid and statin drugs [^115rAPCx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) Outcomes trial, treatment of statin-intolerant patients with bempedoic acid produced a 21% decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) relative to placebo and a 13% relative reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

Objectives

This study sought to determine whether the relationship between LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular benefit achieved with bempedoic acid resembles that observed with statins when standardized per unit change in LDL-C.

Methods

To compare the treatment effect of bempedoic acid with statins, the methodology of the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) was applied to outcomes among the 13,970 patients enrolled in the CLEAR Outcomes trial. The CTTC endpoint of "major vascular event" was a composite of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization. HRs for CTTC-defined endpoints were normalized to 1 mmol/L differences in LDL-C levels between bempedoic acid and placebo groups.

Results

A first major vascular event occurred in 703 (10.1%) patients in the bempedoic acid group and 816 (11.7%) patients in the placebo group (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77–0.94). When normalized per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, the HR was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.63–0.90), comparable to the rate ratio of 0.78 reported for statins in the CTTC meta-analysis. Normalized risk reductions were similar for bempedoic acid and statins for the endpoints of major coronary events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization.

Conclusions

Cardiovascular risk reduction with bempedoic acid is similar to that achieved with statins for a given absolute magnitude of LDL-C lowering.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^112Gh3sE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Elevations of apoB and hsCRP are associated with increased cardiovascular event risk, whereas on‐treatment reductions or lower achieved levels have been linked to decreased risk. 23, 24, 25 The importance of apoB reduction is underscored by epidemiologic and genetic data, 26, 27 including a recent Mendelian randomization analysis that determined that the effect of cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibition on cardiovascular event risk correlates with changes in apoB‐containing lipoproteins to a greater degree than changes in LDL‐C or HDL‐C. 28 The value of combining LDL‐C lowering with hsCRP reduction is highlighted by results from the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) study in which the benefit of statin therapy was most pronounced in patients who achieved maximal LDL‐C lowering in combination with reduced hsCRP levels. 29 The magnitude of hsCRP reduction with bempedoic acid is marked, ranging from 22.4% to 40.2% for bempedoic acid 180 mg/day. 17, 18, 19, 20 In comparison, the addition of ezetimibe to a statin decreases CRP by only 9% to 10%, 30, 31 whereas monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 have no impact on CRP levels. 32

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^116Pvgxk]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well established. Lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) are a cornerstone in the management of ASCVD risk by causing significant reductions in LDL-C and adverse cardiovascular events. The growing arsenal of LLT, from statins to newer therapies like proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and bempedoic acid, provides clinicians with a robust toolkit to tailor treatment based on patient-specific risk profiles. Statins remain the foundational therapy, backed by decades of evidence supporting their efficacy in both primary, and secondary prevention of ASCVD. However, statin intolerance and the need for more aggressive LDL-C reduction in high-risk individuals have driven the development of nonstatin alternatives. These nonstatin therapies expand treatment options for those in need of greater LDL-C lowering or who cannot tolerate statins. In addition, they enhance LDL-C clearance and offer new opportunities for combination therapy, achieving greater reductions in LDL-C levels than monotherapy alone. As guidelines continue to evolve, integrating these therapies into clinical practice allows for more individualized approaches to lipid management to improve outcomes for patients at risk of ASCVD.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^115RqGc5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Inability to tolerate statins because of muscle symptoms contributes to uncontrolled cholesterol levels and insufficient cardiovascular risk reduction. Bempedoic acid, a prodrug that is activated by a hepatic enzyme not present in skeletal muscle, inhibits ATP -citrate lyase, an enzyme upstream of β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Methods and Results The phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) Serenity study randomized 345 patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of intolerance to at least 2 statins (1 at the lowest available dose) 2:1 to bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary end point was mean percent change from baseline to week 12 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The mean age was 65.2 years, mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 157.6 mg/dL, and 93% of patients reported a history of statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid treatment significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline to week 12 (placebo-corrected difference, -21.4% [95% CI, -25.1% to -17.7%]; P < 0.001). Significant reductions with bempedoic acid versus placebo were also observed in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.9%), total cholesterol (-14.8%), apolipoprotein B (-15.0%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-24.3%; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Bempedoic acid was safe and well tolerated. The most common muscle-related adverse event, myalgia, occurred in 4.7% and 7.2% of patients who received bempedoic acid or placebo, respectively. Conclusions Bempedoic acid offers a safe and effective oral therapeutic option for lipid lowering in patients who cannot tolerate statins.

### Impact of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular outcomes by sex [^115one9e]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipid lowering therapies are crucial to reduce cardiovascular risk, yet outcomes data in women are limited. Further, women are less likely to have hypercholesterolemia diagnosed or treated and more likely to report statin intolerance.CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid [ECT1002], an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) Outcomes showed patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease who are unable or unwilling to take guideline-recommended doses of statins had a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, than with placebo.CLEAR Outcomes is notable for having 48% (n = 6740) female subjects — the highest percentage enrollment of females among contemporary lipid-lowering outcomes trials — affording the opportunity to assess whether improvements in cardiovascular risk seen with bempedoic acid varied by sex.

CLEAR Outcomes methods have been previously published. In brief, it was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 13 970 patients at 1250 sites in 32 countries. The study was approved by individual site institutional review committees, and participants gave informed consent. Participants were randomized to 180 mg oral bempedoic acid daily or placebo and followed for a median of 3.4 years. Approximately 91% of participants enrolled identified as white race, and 17% as Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity.

### Bempedoic acid for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in statin-intolerant patients [^116SYKxw]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effects of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-intolerant patients without a prior cardiovascular event (primary prevention) have not been fully described.

Objective

To determine the effects of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular outcomes in primary prevention patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This masked, randomized clinical trial enrolled 13 970 statin-intolerant patients (enrollment December 2016 to August 2019 at 1250 centers in 32 countries), including 4206 primary prevention patients.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to oral bempedoic acid, 180 mg daily (n = 2100), or matching placebo (n = 2106).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy measure was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any component of a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization.

Results

Mean participant age was 68 years, 59% were female, and 66% had diabetes. From a mean baseline of 142.2 mg/dL, compared with placebo, bempedoic acid reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 30.2 mg/dL (21.3%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 0.56 mg/L (21.5%), from a median baseline of 2.4 mg/L. Follow-up for a median of 39.9 months was associated with a significant risk reduction for the primary end point (111 events [5.3%] vs 161 events [7.6%]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55–0.89]; p = 0.002) and key secondary end points, including the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (83 events [4.0%] vs 134 events [6.4%]; HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48–0.84]; P < .001); MI (29 events [1.4%] vs 47 events [2.2%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.39–0.98]); cardiovascular death (37 events [1.8%] vs 65 events [3.1%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.41–0.92]); and all-cause mortality (75 events [3.6%] vs 109 events [5.2%]; HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.54–0.98]). There was no significant effect on stroke or coronary revascularization. Adverse effects with bempedoic acid included a higher incidence of gout (2.6% vs 2.0%), cholelithiasis (2.5% vs 1.1%), and increases in serum creatinine, uric acid, and hepatic enzyme levels.

Conclusions

In a subgroup of high-risk primary prevention patients, bempedoic acid treatment was associated with reduced major cardiovascular events.

CLEAR Harmony and CLEAR Wisdom assessed the safety and tolerability of 180 mg once daily bempedoic acid versus placebo in patients with high cardiovascular risk and elevated LDL cholesterol not adequately controlled by their current maximally tolerated statin therapy. Both trials were of 52 weeks duration. At 12 weeks bempedoic acid reduced the mean placebo corrected LDL-C by −16.5% (CLEAR Harmony) and −17.4% (CLEAR Wisdom) from baseline and showed no greater risk of adverse events compared to placebo CLEAR (Harmony; 78.5% versus 78.7%, CLEAR Wisdom; 70.1% versus 70.8%). CLEAR Tranquillity observed the safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid added to ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In this 12-week trial, bempedoic acid added to ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28.5% more than placebo (p < 0.001; − 23.5% bempedoic acid, + 5.0% placebo). The efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with statin intolerance were also studied in the CLEAR Serenity trial of 24 weeks duration. Patients with a history of intolerance two statins (one at the lowest available dose) were randomised (2:1) to either 180 mg once daily bempedoic acid or placebo once daily. At week 12 bempedoic acid treatment significantly lowered LDL-C by a placebo corrected − 21.4% (95% CI − 25.1 to − 17.7%; p < 0.001).

Effects of Bempedoic Acid Compared With Placebo Across hsCRP and LDLC Strata

Compared with placebo among these statin-intolerant patients, bempedoic acid reduced median hsCRP by 21.6% and mean LDLC levels by 21.1% at 6 months.

In the overall CLEAR-Outcomes trial, bempedoic acid compared with placebo reduced the primary trial composite end point by 13% (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79–0.96]). As shown in Table 4, the relative efficacy of bempedoic acid compared with placebo was of similar magnitude across all baseline subgroups defined by either hsCRP or LDLC.

Table 4.
Efficacy of Bempedoic Acid Compared With Placebo for the Primary Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events End Point of the CLEAR-Outcomes Trial for the Total Trial Cohort and Stratified by Baseline hsCRP and LDLC Levels

Sensitivity Analyses

Within the CLEAR-Outcomes trial, 22.3% of participants were receiving a very low average daily statin dose (lower than the lowest approved dose). None of the above analysis changed in any substantive manner when these individuals were excluded from analysis. Likewise, no substantive differences in outcomes were observed in sensitivity analyses on the basis of non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol rather than LDLC. An additional sensitivity analysis that censored patient data 30 days after receiving any nontrial lipid-lowering therapy revealed a nearly identical primary trial composite end point (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.94]) suggesting that any differential drop-in to adjunctive lipid-lowering therapy had little to no effect on trial outcomes. This is likely related to the fact that the great majority of primary composite end points (92.9% and 90.9% of events in the bempedoic acid and placebo groups, respectively) occurred before any nontrial adjunctive therapy was given.

### Choosing the optimal nonstatin lipid lowering therapies for statin-intolerant patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115wFYD8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Statin intolerance presents a considerable challenge in managing patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases, as it limits patients' access to standard lipid-lowering therapies.

Objective

This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of various nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are intolerant to statins.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and EBSCO open dissertations through September 2023 for randomized controlled trials in statin-intolerant patients comparing nonstatin lipid-lowering agents. The primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). A random-effects model estimated comparative effects using mean differences (MDs) for LDL-C reduction and relative risks (RRs) for safety outcomes, specifically trial withdrawal due to adverse events. Results were reported with 95% CIs, and therapies ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Evidence certainty was assessed with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) platform.

Results

Of 1533 articles, 6 studies (1326 patients) met inclusion criteria. Evolocumab combined with ezetimibe achieved the greatest LDL-C reduction (MD: 48.98%; 95% CI: 59.19, -38.77) vs ezetimibe alone, with moderate evidence certainty. Evolocumab, alirocumab, and the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, also showed significant reductions in LDL-C compared to ezetimibe monotherapy, though the magnitude of their effects was smaller than that of the evolocumab and ezetimibe combination. The SUCRA of evolocumab and ezetimibe (99.7%) aligns with its highest comparative efficacy. No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed across treatments.

Conclusion

Evolocumab combined with ezetimibe is the most effective regimen for LDL-C reduction, with a safety profile comparable to other treatments, making it a viable alternative for patients with statin intolerance.

### CLEAR serenity trial: more clarity for the future of bempedoic acid in patients unable to take statins? [^111BhKid]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

CLEAR Serenity Trial: What We Have Learned

In the present phase 3 trial, CLEAR Serenity, Laufs et al, in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), assessed the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL‐C = 155.6 ± 38.8 mg/dL in the placebo group and 158.5 ± 40.4 mg/dL in the bempedoic acid group) who could not tolerate statin therapy. 15 Statin intolerance was defined as the inability to tolerate at least 2 statins, 1 at a low daily dose (rosuvastatin, 5 mg; atorvastatin, 10 mg; simvastatin, 10 mg; lovastatin, 20 mg; pravastatin, 40 mg; fluvastatin, 40 mg; or pitavastatin, 2 mg), because of an adverse event that began or increased on statin and resolved or improved when statin was discontinued. In this study, 345 patients were randomized 2:1 to either bempedoic acid, 180 mg, or placebo daily over a period of 24 weeks, with a primary end point of mean percentage change from baseline of LDL‐C at 12 weeks. Both primary and secondary prevention patients were included with 2% of the patients having a history of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Approximately 8.4% were taking low‐dose statin therapy, and one third were taking nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe or fish oil). At 12 weeks, treatment with bempedoic acid significantly lowered LDL‐C, −21.4% (95% CI, −25.1% to −17.7%) more from baseline compared with placebo, with effect continuing through the duration for the study. Heterogeneity of effect was observed with diabetes mellitus status (P = 0.012), with diabetic patients appearing to have less LDL‐C reduction compared with nondiabetic patients at 12 weeks. Bempedoic acid also lowered non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (−14.8%), apolipoprotein B (−15.0%), and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (−24.3%). Muscle‐related adverse events occurred less frequently in the bempedoic acid group compared with placebo (12.8% versus 16.2%). However, when comparing the treatment arm with placebo, there appeared to be higher rates of overall adverse events (64.1% versus 56.8%), serious adverse events (6.0% versus 3.6%), and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (18.4% versus 11.7%) in the bempedoic acid group. There were a further 9 major adverse cardiovascular events (3.8%) that occurred in the bempedoic acid group compared with 0 events in the placebo group.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Very high-risk ASCVD — bempedoic acid positioning and precautions: If additional LDL-C lowering is warranted (patient has achieved < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 85 mg/dL), despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 mAb, the addition of bempedoic acid may be considered. Although there are currently no outcome studies for bempedoic acid, this agent may be beneficial for further LDL-C reduction or if evidence-based agents are contraindicated or not tolerated, and considerations that may favor its addition include the need for further LDL-C reduction (with a mean expected reduction of approximately 17%), documented statin intolerance, and ease of use for patients who prefer to avoid injectable medications. Bempedoic acid should be used with caution in patients who have a history of gout or tendon rupture.

### Bempedoic acid for prevention of cardiovascular events in people with obesity: a CLEAR outcomes subset analysis [^1155YfV4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In people with obesity enrolled in the CLEAR Outcomes trial, bempedoic acid reduced cardiovascular risk, LDL‐C, and hs‐CRP, with a safety profile consistent with previous reports. Thus, in addition to reduction in excess adiposity, bempedoic acid may be a clinically relevant option to improve CVD outcomes in people who are statin intolerant and living with obesity who have elevated LDL‐C and are at high cardiovascular risk.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid for prevention of cardiovascular events and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fkH2q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of 11 RCTs enrolling 4391 patients, the use of bempedoic acid was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, and coronary revascularization in statin-intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, bempedoic acid use was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes.

Comparison with existing data

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis assessing the effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular events. The previous meta-analysis has evaluated the use of bempedoic acid to reduce LDL cholesterol, and had analyzed 5 trials with a total of 625 patients with hypercholesterolemia, concluding that bempedoic acid led to significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels without adverse events. The previous review did not assess the efficacy of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular events and may be underpowered to assess adverse drug events due to the small sample size.

This study builds on the previous meta-analysis mainly through the inclusion of two large trials, the CLEAR Harmony trial and the CLEAR Wisdom trial. However, both trials were not designed to assess the effect on cardiovascular events, and thus, individually did not observe significant between-group differences in the incidence of cardiovascular events.

Another important finding of our analysis is that bempedoic acid was associated with a reduction in new-onset or worsening diabetes. This phenomenon may be related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), since bempedoic acid plays a dual role in both activation of hepatic AMPK signaling pathway and inhibitory activity against hepatic ATP-citrate lyase (ACL).

### Bempedoic acid and cardiovascular outcomes in statin-intolerant patients [^116JhWpC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and is associated with a low incidence of muscle-related adverse events; its effects on cardiovascular outcomes remain uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients who were unable or unwilling to take statins owing to unacceptable adverse effects ("statin-intolerant" patients) and had, or were at high risk for, cardiovascular disease. The patients were assigned to receive oral bempedoic acid, 180 mg daily, or placebo. The primary end point was a four-component composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization.

Results

A total of 13,970 patients underwent randomization; 6992 were assigned to the bempedoic acid group and 6978 to the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up was 40.6 months. The mean LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 139.0 mg per deciliter in both groups, and after 6 months, the reduction in the level was greater with bempedoic acid than with placebo by 29.2 mg per deciliter; the observed difference in the percent reductions was 21.1 percentage points in favor of bempedoic acid. The incidence of a primary end-point event was significantly lower with bempedoic acid than with placebo (819 patients [11.7%] vs. 927 [13.3%]; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 0.96; P = 0.004), as were the incidences of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial infarction (575 [8.2%] vs. 663 [9.5%]; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.96; P = 0.006); fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (261 [3.7%] vs. 334 [4.8%]; hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.91; P = 0.002); and coronary revascularization (435 [6.2%] vs. 529 [7.6%]; hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92; P = 0.001). Bempedoic acid had no significant effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause. The incidences of gout and cholelithiasis were higher with bempedoic acid than with placebo (3.1% vs. 2.1% and 2.2% vs. 1.2%, respectively), as were the incidences of small increases in serum creatinine, uric acid, and hepatic-enzyme levels.

Conclusions

Among statin-intolerant patients, treatment with bempedoic acid was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization).

### Association of bempedoic acid administration with atherogenic lipid levels in phase 3 randomized clinical trials of patients with hypercholesterolemia [^115i2Pbs]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does an association exist between the administration of bempedoic acid and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia?

Findings

In this pooled analysis of 3623 patients included in 4 pivotal randomized clinical trials, bempedoic acid administration was associated with decreased mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 18% vs placebo when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or both and by 24% vs placebo in patients with a history of statin intolerance. Increased uric acid levels and gout occurred more frequently among patients treated with bempedoic acid than with placebo.

Meaning

Treatment with bempedoic acid was associated with decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia when added to background statin therapy and in patients with a history of statin intolerance.

Primary End Point

Compared with placebo, treatment with bempedoic acid was associated with significantly lower LDL-C levels at week 12 in both pools (Figure 1 A). The placebo-corrected LS mean changes from baseline in LDL-C levels were −17.8% (95% CI, −19.5% to −16.0%; P < .001) in the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin (bempedoic acid, −16.0%; placebo, 1.8%) and −24.5% (95% CI, −27.8% to −21.1%; P < .001) in the pool of patients with statin intolerance (bempedoic acid, −23.0%; placebo, 1.5%). A test of heterogeneity revealed a significant difference between pools in the placebo-corrected change from baseline at week 12 (nominal P < .001).

### Safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117D1D6Z]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although this meta-analysis does not confirm the previous suggestion that BA may significantly lower the risk of new-onset DM, showing only a numerically non-significant lower incidence of DM, it confirmed that BA does not increase the risk of new onset DM, at variance with statins. The finding that BA acts as an activator of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increasing insulin sensitivity and improving glycemic control in the liver may be the underlying mechanism of this effect. Similarly to statins, but differently from other non-statins agents such as PCSK9i, BA significantly reduced the inflammatory marker CRP. Whether this activity contributes to the overall benefit of the agent is unknown, but it is acknowledged that an anti-inflammatory activity may reduce MACE in patients with coronary artery disease.

Our results must be interpreted in the context of some limitations. Like all meta-analyses, this study shares the limitations of each individual trial included. Nevertheless, the trials analysed in this study were all randomized controlled trials with an estimated low or moderate risk of bias. We did not have access to individual-level data, so we were unable to assess the potential effect of patient heterogeneity. As some studies were phase II trials, there exists heterogeneity in terms of trial design, sample size, power, and follow-up.

Notably, the most recent trial accounts for over 70% of the entire sample in this meta-analysis, potentially explaining the low heterogeneity for most of the analysis on the clinical events, along with similar inclusion criteria and consistency of results. Such trial was also characterised by a considerably longer follow-up as compared with other included trials. To account for the potential bias associated with this issue, analyses were performed at 12-weeks and at the latest available follow-up whenever feasible.

Despite these limitations, our results provide comprehensive and up-to-date evidence about the safety and efficacy of BA, including its impact on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes. Additionally, for the first time, we explored the potential of BA when used in conjunction with other background LLTs trying to better quantify the relative effect of this new drug. Indeed, the present paper compared to other meta-analysis on the same topic enrolled a larger sample size and provided insights of the effect of BE on clinical events and on lipid profile controls of patients stratified according to indications to addictive therapy (that is statin intolerant vs. high CV risk vs hypercholesterolemia) and on lipid profile according to background medical therapy.

### Association of bempedoic acid administration with atherogenic lipid levels in phase 3 randomized clinical trials of patients with hypercholesterolemia [^111ck2bV]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The absolute mean decreases in LDL-C levels associated with bempedoic acid administration were 19.8 mg/dL in the pool of patients with ASCVD or HeFH or both receiving a maximally tolerated statin and 36.5 mg/dL in the pool of patients with statin intolerance. These decreases are of sufficient magnitude to provide meaningful changes in the cardiovascular risk profile. Using the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration estimate of major vascular event risk reduction per 1.0 mmol/L–LDL-C decrease, the corresponding decreases in event risk with bempedoic acid would theoretically be 11% and 21%, respectively, in the setting of a 5-year cardiovascular outcomes trial. The actual translation of LDL-C level decrease with bempedoic acid administration into cardiovascular protective effects is being evaluated in the ongoing CLEAR Outcomes study.

The characteristics of patients who comprised the 2 pools in the present analysis have relevance to clinical practice because these are groups for whom nonstatin agents are a guideline-recommended treatment option. According to the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on the management of blood cholesterol, addition of the nonstatin agent ezetimibe is recommended for patients with ASCVD whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. Addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximally tolerated statin therapy plus ezetimibe may be considered in very high-risk patients, but access to these drugs has been limited. An alternative such as bempedoic acid has the potential to fulfill an unmet clinical need for high-risk patients in whom the administration of a statin or a statin plus ezetimibe does not adequately decrease LDL-C levels and for patients with statin intolerance.

Limitations

There are several limitations to consider when evaluating a pooled analysis. Data pooled for this analysis were derived from 4 studies, with different durations, eligibility criteria, and patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities, increasing the potential for heterogeneity and variability in the data set. In addition, background LLT was highly variable both within and across studies, and adherence to background LLT was not monitored. The latter point may explain the slight increase in LDL-C levels observed at later measurement time points. The size of some of the subgroups analyzed was relatively small. Further investigations of key subgroups and safety end points are warranted.

### Factors associated with enhanced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with bempedoic acid [^111qFcFf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although most patients experience marked reductions in LDL‐C with statin treatment, some will not be able to achieve treatment goals with statins alone. Among patients registered in the VOYAGER (indiVidual patient data meta‐analysis Of statin therapY in At risk Groups: Effects of Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin) database (a large database of patients [> 32 000] who received atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin during 1 of 37 clinical trials), response to a statin varied from no response to up to an 80% reduction in LDL‐C. Similarly, results from a meta‐analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials investigating simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin provided a wide range of LDL‐C reductions from no response to up to a 90% reduction in LDL‐C. As with statins, we observed variability of response with bempedoic acid, with 28.9% of patients in the entire study population assigned to bempedoic acid achieving at least a 30% reduction in LDL‐C; variability was also seen in the placebo group (4.4% achieved a 30% reduction in LDL‐C).

Many patients cannot tolerate high‐intensity statins because of muscle‐related adverse reactions and are taking lower statin doses or alternative LLTs as options to lower LDL‐C levels. In a real‐world setting where 83% of patients were receiving low‐ or moderate‐dose statins, the proportion of patients who achieved at least a 30% reduction in LDL‐C was 41.6%. In our analysis, bempedoic acid allowed 50.9% of patients unable to take any statin to achieve at least a 30% reduction in LDL‐C. Results from both univariable and multivariable analysis showed that the absence of statin use was associated with greater probability of achieving LDL‐C lowering with bempedoic acid similar to that in which a moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin was used. Bempedoic acid inhibits hepatic cholesterol synthesis upstream of statins. As monotherapy, bempedoic acid is not vying with statins to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, thus providing more opportunity to lower LDL‐C with bempedoic acid alone than in combination with a background statin. Bempedoic acid and a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor are options for patients who require additional lowering of LDL‐C.

Data analysis

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), as defined by included trials, were our primary clinical efficacy outcome, assessed at the latest available follow-up. Secondary efficacy outcome were: all-cause death, cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for unstable angina (UA), coronary revascularization and non-fatal stroke. As co-primary efficacy outcome we assessed the relative and absolute reduction of LDL-C at 12 week and at the latest available follow-up. Other secondary outcomes at laboratory level included changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, ApoB lipoprotein and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the BA and in the control groups. As safety outcomes we evaluated new-onset or worsening diabetes, gout, myalgia or muscle disorders, neurocognitive disorders along with any adverse event (AE), serious AE and AE leading to drug discontinuation, and as defined by included trials. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the main inclusion criteria of trials who entered this meta-analysis. In particular, we assessed the efficacy of BA across subgroup of patients with (a) high cardiovascular risk (ASCVD and/or FH and or multiple cardiovascular risk factors); (b) hypercholesterolemic (regardless of medical history of ASCVD and background therapy) and (c) statin intolerant patients. As a sensitivity analysis we excluded from the analysis for the main outcome arms with 100% of patients taking BA and ezetimibe and compared to placebo. Further, we performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the efficacy of BA according to background LLT [namely (a)] high intensity statin vs low/moderate intensity statin vs no statin and (b) ezetimibe vs no ezetimibe). Statin intensity definition was according to current definition of American Heart association guidelines. A metaregression analysis to assess the impact of several baseline variables (Male sex, age, DM and baseline LDL-c) on the efficacy of BA on MACE and LDL-c reduction was also performed.

### Clinical implementation of bempedoic acid in blood lipid management: real-world data from an Italian lipid clinic [^113oHHCa]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bempedoic acid (BA), an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, is approved for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction and is well tolerated, especially in statin-intolerant patients. Real-world evidence, particularly from Europe, remains limited.

Objective

To assess real-world effectiveness, safety, and predictors of LDL-cholesterol target achievement with BA in Italian patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of 160 patients treated with BA at a lipid clinic in Milan, Italy. Patients were followed for 12 months. LDL-cholesterol levels, laboratory parameters, clinical events, and adverse effects were collected. Effectiveness was assessed as percentage change in LDL-cholesterol from baseline. Predictors of LDL-cholesterol target achievement were identified using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

BA significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol from 116.1 ± 49.3 to 78.5 ± 36.0 mg/dL (-26.1%, P < .05). The majority of patients (60.8%) reached European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society LDL-cholesterol goals (≤ 55 mg/dL). LDL-cholesterol reduction was greater in statin-intolerant patients (-29.0% vs -21.0%) and smaller in those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (-18.0% vs -29.2%). Independent predictors of target non-achievement were FH (odds ratio [OR] 0.045, 95% CI 0.004–0.523, P = 0.013), while concomitant proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitor use predicted success (OR 31.82, 95% CI 2.57–394.17, P = 0.007). Among 69 patients not achieving LDL-cholesterol targets, 84% were on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), 67% were statin-intolerant, and 11 had FH. Safety analysis showed good tolerability; 4.0% developed hyperuricemia, and only 2 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events occurred during follow-up.

Conclusion

BA was effective and well tolerated in this high-risk cohort, including statin-intolerant and FH patients. Beyond its initial indication, BA now represents a valuable therapeutic option to optimize LDL-cholesterol lowering in patients who remain above target despite standard LLT.

### Bempedoic acid in the management of lipid disorders and cardiovascular risk. 2023 position paper of the international lipid expert panel (ILEP) [^115T8L4p]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) and the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Substantial reductions in the CVD prevalence have been achieved in recent years by the attenuation of risk factors (particularly hypertension and dyslipidaemias) in primary and secondary prevention. Despite the remarkable success of lipid lowering treatments, and of statins in particular, in reducing the risk of CVD, there is still an unmet clinical need for the attainment of guideline lipid-targets in even 2/3 of patients. Bempedoic acid, the first in-class inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase presents a new approach to lipid-lowering therapy. By reducing the endogenous production of cholesterol, upstream of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA-reductase, i.e., the target of statins, bempedoic acid reduces circulating plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and major adverse CVD events (MACE). Bempedoic acid has the potential to contribute to the reduction of CVD risk not only as monotherapy, but even further as part of a lipid-lowering combination therapy with ezetimibe, reducing LDL-C cholesterol up to 40%. This position paper of the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) summarises the recent evidence around the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid and presents practical recommendations for its use, which complement the 'lower-is-better-for-longer' approach to lipid management, which is applied across international guidelines for the management of CVD risk. Practical evidence-based guidance is provided relating to the use of bempedoic acid in atherosclerotic CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, and statin intolerance. Although there are still no sufficient data avilable for the role of bempedoic acid in the primary prevention of CVD, its favourable effects on plasma glucose and inflammatory markers makes this drug a rational choice in the patient-centred care of specific groups of primary prevention.

### Real-world utilization of bempedoic acid in an academic preventive cardiology practice [^112fKprh]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipid management for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease remains insufficient for many with currently available therapies.

Objective

Evaluate real-world use of bempedoic acid.

Methods

Retrospective study of patients in our Center for Preventive Cardiology who were prescribed bempedoic acid between February 2020 and July 2021. Patients were managed according to clinical standards of care, with lipid assessments at months ≤ 3, 6, and 12 post-bempedoic acid initiation.

Results

Seventy-three patients were prescribed bempedoic acid, with 64 initiating therapy. The majority had atherosclerosis (89%), familial hypercholesterolemia (64%), and statin intolerance (74%), with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 120 mg/dL. Prior authorization requests and appeals of denials were required in 90% and 19% of cases, respectively. Cost-mitigating strategies reduced median monthly drug costs from $432 pre-insurance approval to $80 post-insurance approval, to $10 after financial assistance intervention. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C by -36.7%, -31%, and -20.3% at ≤ 3, 6, and 12, respectively, with > 20% achieving LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. There was substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in LDL-C lowering. We observed high rates of drug discontinuation (35.9%), mostly related to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (32.8%), primarily musculoskeletal complaints. Use of reduced dose bempedoic acid (< 180 mg) was associated similar LDL-C lowering but TEAE and drug discontinuation were still common.

Conclusions

Real-world use of bempedoic acid was limited by insurance and cost barriers requiring substantial post-prescription interventions. In patients at heightened risk for atherosclerotic events and statin intolerance, bempedoic acid was associated with clinically meaningful LDL-C lowering, but high rates of TEAEs and drug discontinuations.
