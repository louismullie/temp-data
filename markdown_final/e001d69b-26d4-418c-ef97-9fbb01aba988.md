## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code E72.8 when used to code a creatine biosynthesis defect characterized by elevated guanidinoacetate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition is represented by ICD-10 code E72.8 when used to code a creatine biosynthesis defect characterized by elevated guanidinoacetate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10 category structure and where E72.8 fits. Then, I should verify which creatine biosynthesis defect specifically causes elevated guanidinoacetate. Next, I will check whether ICD-10 provides a more specific code for that entity or if E72.8 is the correct fallback. Finally, I will confirm the biochemical rationale and ensure there isn't a more precise subcode I'm missing.

> Let me first confirm the ICD-10 context. E72.8 sits under E72, "Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism", and is labeled "Other specified disorders of amino-acid metabolism", which is a residual category used when no more specific subcode exists for a defined amino acid metabolism disorder [^1176HT7B].

> Now, I need to identify the exact disorder. Elevated guanidinoacetate with a creatine biosynthesis defect points to guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder in which GAMT fails to methylate guanidinoacetate to creatine, causing guanidinoacetate accumulation and cerebral creatine deficiency; this is precisely the biochemical signature described in the literature and in newborn screening frameworks [^113sdpyo] [^114wXRqu] [^114xpdJ2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about coding specificity. I should verify whether ICD-10-CM includes a dedicated code for GAMT deficiency. Scanning the E72 subcodes, I see entries for urea cycle disorders and other amino acid transport/metabolism defects, but there is no unique code listed for GAMT deficiency; thus, the most appropriate available code is E72.8, "Other specified disorders of amino-acid metabolism", with the condition name documented in the record [^114xpdJ2].

> Wait, let me verify the biochemical logic one more time to avoid a mistake. GAMT catalyzes the methylation of guanidinoacetate to creatine; when GAMT is deficient, guanidinoacetate accumulates and brain creatine is depleted, which is why elevated guanidinoacetate is the pathognomonic biomarker for GAMT deficiency and why screening algorithms target guanidinoacetate in dried blood spots or plasma [^113sdpyo] [^114wXRqu] [^1176HT7B].

> I should confirm that alternative creatine disorders don't fit this biomarker profile. AGAT deficiency shows low guanidinoacetate, and creatine transporter deficiency typically shows normal guanidinoacetate with an elevated urine creatine:creatinine ratio; neither presents with elevated guanidinoacetate, reinforcing that the E72.8-coded entity here is GAMT deficiency rather than AGAT or SLC6A8-related disease [^115ZzZQS] [^116tumpk] [^117CoQzQ].

> Putting this together, I will conclude that ICD-10-CM code E72.8, "Other specified disorders of amino-acid metabolism", is the correct code to use for a creatine biosynthesis defect characterized by elevated guanidinoacetate, and the specific diagnosis is guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, which should be explicitly documented alongside the code [^114xpdJ2] [^113sdpyo].

---

The ICD-10 code **E72.8** corresponds to **Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency**, a creatine biosynthesis defect characterized by elevated guanidinoacetate and cerebral creatine deficiency. This autosomal recessive disorder presents with intellectual disability, seizures, and movement disorders; early diagnosis and treatment with creatine, ornithine, and arginine restriction can improve outcomes [^113sdpyo] [^114xpdJ2].

---

## Clinical features of GAMT deficiency

GAMT deficiency exhibits a **distinct clinical phenotype**, including:

- **Intellectual disability**: Global developmental delay and intellectual impairment are common [^115ckcNJ].

- **Seizures**: Epilepsy is a frequent manifestation, often presenting in infancy or early childhood [^115ckcNJ].

- **Movement disorders**: Dystonia, choreoathetosis, and other extrapyramidal symptoms are characteristic [^115pynW9].

- **Behavioral abnormalities**: Autism-like behaviors and social communication difficulties are often observed [^116ye4vq].

- **Speech delay**: Expressive language impairment is a consistent feature [^111JJMLM].

---

## Biochemical abnormalities

GAMT deficiency is defined by **characteristic biochemical findings**:

- **Elevated guanidinoacetate**: Accumulation of guanidinoacetate in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid due to impaired methylation [^116tumpk].

- **Reduced creatine**: Decreased cerebral creatine levels, documented by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) [^112NMxuk].

- **Low creatinine**: Reduced plasma creatinine concentrations due to impaired creatine synthesis [^111sXeEH].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of GAMT deficiency relies on a **combination of clinical, biochemical, and genetic testing**:

- **Biochemical testing**: Measurement of guanidinoacetate and creatine levels in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid [^1176HT7B].

- **Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)**: Demonstrates cerebral creatine deficiency [^112NMxuk].

- **Genetic testing**: Identification of pathogenic variants in the GAMT gene confirms the diagnosis [^117G9Qz9].

---

## Treatment strategies

Effective management of GAMT deficiency involves a **multimodal approach**:

- **Creatine supplementation**: Oral creatine monohydrate restores cerebral creatine levels and improves neurological symptoms [^114UGRe3].

- **Ornithine supplementation**: Reduces guanidinoacetate accumulation by competing with arginine for transport into the brain [^115PDsEe].

- **Arginine-restricted diet**: Limits substrate availability for guanidinoacetate synthesis, thereby reducing its accumulation [^115ckcNJ].

- **Early intervention**: Initiating treatment in infancy or early childhood yields the best outcomes, often preventing intellectual disability and seizures [^114wXRqu].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of GAMT deficiency varies with the **timing of diagnosis and initiation of therapy**. Early diagnosis and treatment can lead to normal or near-normal neurodevelopmental outcomes, whereas delayed treatment results in persistent intellectual disability, seizures, and movement disorders [^115ckcNJ] [^114wXRqu].

---

## ICD-10 coding considerations

The ICD-10 code **E72.8** specifically denotes "other specified disorders of amino-acid metabolism", which accurately encompasses GAMT deficiency. Accurate coding is essential for clinical documentation, epidemiological tracking, and insurance reimbursement.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code **E72.8** corresponds to GAMT deficiency, a creatine biosynthesis defect characterized by elevated guanidinoacetate and cerebral creatine deficiency. Early diagnosis and targeted therapy significantly improve outcomes, underscoring the importance of recognizing this condition in clinical practice.

### Evidence and recommendation for guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency newborn screening [^113sdpyo]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis due to pathogenic variants in the GAMT gene that lead to cerebral creatine deficiency and neurotoxic levels of guanidinoacetate. Untreated, GAMT deficiency is associated with hypotonia, significant intellectual disability, limited speech development, recurrent seizures, behavior problems, and involuntary movements. The birth prevalence of GAMT deficiency is likely between 0.5 and 2 per million live births. On the basis of small case series and sibling data, presymptomatic treatment with oral supplements of creatine, ornithine, and sodium benzoate, and a protein-restricted diet to reduce arginine intake, appear to substantially improve health and developmental outcomes. Without newborn screening, diagnosis typically happens after the development of significant impairment, when treatment has limited utility. GAMT deficiency newborn screening can be incorporated into the tandem-mass spectrometry screening that is already routinely used for newborn screening, with about 1 per 100000 newborns screening positive. After a positive screen, diagnosis is established by finding an elevated guanidinoacetate concentration and low creatine concentration in the blood. Although GAMT deficiency is significantly more rare than other conditions included in newborn screening, the feasibility of screening, the low number of positive results, the relative ease of diagnosis, and the expected benefit of presymptomatic dietary therapy led to a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that GAMT deficiency be added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. This recommendation was accepted in January 2023.

### Guanidinoacetate and creatine / creatinine levels in controls and patients with urea cycle defects [^1139JVpY]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

We established an analytical methodology for guanidinoacetate and creatine determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the use of stable isotopes as internal standards. The method showed good precision and high sensitivity, and it requires minimal sample handling. We determined the reference values in urine and plasma. In urine both guanidinoacetate concentration and creatine/creatinine ratio decrease as age increases, but no significant differences were found in plasma. In addition, 15 patients with urea cycle defects were analysed and showed low guanidinoacetate concentrations when compared with age-matched controls. We concluded that guanidinoacetate concentration is a parameter to be considered in the follow-up of patients with urea cycle defects, and arginine should be supplemented in sufficient amounts, as the brain seems to be impermeable to creatine influx, but not to its precursor, arginine, which is needed for creatine, protein, and NO synthesis.

### Creatine and creatine deficiency syndromes: biochemical and clinical aspects [^112NMxuk]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Creatine deficiency syndromes, which have only recently been described, represent a group of inborn errors of creatine synthesis (L-arginine-glycine amidinotransferase deficiency and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency) and transport (creatine transporter deficiency). Patients with creatine deficiency syndromes present with mental retardation expressive speech and language delay, and epilepsy. Patients with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency or creatine transporter deficiency may exhibit autistic behavior. The common denominator of these disorders is the depletion of the brain creatine pool, as demonstrated by in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For diagnosis, laboratory investigations start with analysis of guanidinoacetate, creatine, and creatinine in plasma and urine. Based on these findings, enzyme assays or DNA mutation analysis may be performed. The creatine deficiency syndromes are underdiagnosed, so the possibility should be considered in all children affected by unexplained mental retardation, seizures, and speech delay. Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency and arginine-glycine amidinotransferase deficiency are treatable by oral creatine supplementation, but patients with creatine transporter deficiency do not respond to this type of treatment.

### Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency: differences of creatine uptake in human brain and muscle [^1178pC6c]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Deficiency of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), the first described creatine biosynthesis defect, leads to depletion of creatine and phosphocreatine, and accumulation of guanidinoacetate in brain. This results in epilepsy, mental retardation, and extrapyramidal movement disorders. Investigation of skeletal muscle by proton and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy before therapy demonstrated the presence of considerable amounts of creatine and phosphocreatine, and accumulation of phosphorylated guanidinoacetate in a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with GAMT deficiency, suggesting separate mechanisms for creatine uptake and synthesis in brain and skeletal muscle. The combination of creatine supplementation and a guanidinoacetate-lowering therapeutic approach resulted in improvement of clinical symptoms and metabolite concentrations in brain, muscle, and body fluids.

### Creatine metabolism and the urea cycle [^1132a8fx]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Because creatine and creatine phosphate are irreversibly converted to creatinine, there is a continuous need for their replacement. This occurs by means of diet and de novo synthesis. Dietary creatine is provided in animal products and can amount to about half of the required amount. Synthesis provides the remainder. Creatine synthesis is a major component of arginine metabolism, amounting to more than 20% of the dietary intake of this amino acid. Creatine metabolism is of importance to patients with urea cycle disorders in two ways, both related to arginine levels. In patients with arginase deficiency, markedly elevated arginine levels may result in higher concentrations of guanidinoacetate and higher rates of creatine synthesis. This is of concern because it is thought that elevated levels of guanidinoacetate may exert neurotoxic effects. In the case of the other urea cycle disorders, arginine levels are markedly decreased unless the patients are supplemented with this amino acid. Decreased levels of arginine may result in decreased rates of creatine synthesis. This may be compounded by the fact that such patients, maintained on low protein diets, will also have lower dietary creatine intakes. There is some evidence that this may decrease brain creatine levels which may contribute to the neurological symptoms exhibited by these patients. It is clear that patients with urea cycle disorders also have altered creatine metabolism. Whether this contributes in a significant way to their neurological symptoms remains an open question.

### Irreversible brain creatine deficiency with elevated serum and urine creatine: a creatine transporter defect? [^1166ZnNQ]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent reports highlight the utility of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques to recognize creatine deficiency syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Reported cases demonstrate partial reversibility of neurologic symptoms upon restoration of CNS creatine levels with the administration of oral creatine. We describe a patient with a brain creatine deficiency syndrome detected by proton MRS that differs from published reports. Metabolic screening revealed elevated creatine in the serum and urine, with normal levels of guanidino acetic acid. Unlike the case with other reported creatine deficiency syndromes, treatment with oral creatine monohydrate demonstrated no observable increase in brain creatine with proton MRS and no improvement in clinical symptoms. In this study, we report a novel brain creatine deficiency syndrome most likely representing a creatine transporter defect.

### Creatine and guanidinoacetate: diagnostic markers for inborn errors in creatine biosynthesis and transport [^116tumpk]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, measurements of guanidinoacetate (GAA) and creatine (Cr) in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were performed using stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both compounds were analyzed in a single analysis. Reference values were established for GAA and Cr. These values were age dependent. No differences with gender were observed. Eight guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficient patients and eight creatine transporter SLC6A8 deficient patients were investigated. In urine, plasma, and CSF of GAMT deficient patients increased levels of GAA are present. The SLC6A8 deficient patients all show increased creatine/creatinine (Cr/Crn) ratio in urine demonstrating the importance of the Cr/Crn ratio as a pathognomonic marker of the SLC6A8 deficiency.

### Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency: late onset of movement disorder and preserved expressive language [^111JJMLM]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is a disorder of creatine biosynthesis, characterized by early-onset learning disability and epilepsy in most affected children. Severe expressive language delay is a constant feature even in the mildest clinical phenotypes. We report the clinical, biochemical, imaging, and treatment data of two female siblings (18y and 13y) with an unusual phenotype of GAMT deficiency. The oldest sibling had subacute onset of a movement disorder at age 17 years, later than has been previously reported. The younger sibling had better language skills than previously described in this disorder. After treatment with creatine, arginine restriction and ornithine-supplemented diet, seizure severity and movement disorder were reduced but cognition did not improve. This report confirms that GAMT deficiency, a heterogeneous, potentially treatable disorder, detected by increased levels of guanidinoacetate in body fluids (e.g. plasma or urine) or by an abnormal creatine peak on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, should be considered in patients of any age with unexplained, apparently static learning disability and epilepsy.

### Presymptomatic treatment of neonatal guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency [^1153BwYf]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Prospective observation in a neonate with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT-D), a severe neurometabolic disorder, revealed increased guanidinoacetate levels at birth. After 14-month treatment with creatine, high-dose ornithine, benzoate, and an arginine-restricted diet, the patient's development is normal and she does not present any symptoms of GAMT-D. The authors' observation indicates that early detection of GAMT-D is possible in the neonatal period, and presymptomatic treatment may prevent its manifestation.

### Clinical characteristics and diagnostic clues in inborn errors of creatine metabolism [^115pynW9]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Creatine deficiency syndromes are a newly described group of inborn errors of creatine synthesis (arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency and guanidinoaceteate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency) and creatine transport (creatine transporter (CRTR) deficiency). The common clinical denominator of creatine deficiency syndromes is mental retardation and epilepsy, suggesting the main involvement of cerebral grey matter (grey matter disease). Patients with GAMT deficiency exhibit a more complex clinical phenotype with dystonic hyperkinetic movement disorder and epilepsy that in some cases is unresponsive to pharmacological treatment. The common biochemical denominator of creatine deficiency syndromes is cerebral creatine deficiency which is demonstrated by in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurement of guanidinoacetate in body fluids may discriminate GAMT (high concentration), AGAT (low concentration) and CRTR (normal concentration). Further biochemical characteristics include changes in creatine and creatinine concentrations in body fluids. GAMT and AGAT deficiency are treatable by oral creatine supplementation, while patients with CRTR deficiency do not respond to this type of treatment. Further recognition of patients will be of major importance for the estimation of the frequency, for the understanding of phenotypic variations and for treatment strategies.

### Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency: a rare but treatable epilepsy [^115822hS]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Epilepsy commonly presents in childhood as part of a syndrome, and some such children may reach adult services without an underlying syndromic diagnosis. For adult neurologists taking over their care, it is often unclear how hard to search for an underlying diagnosis. The diagnostic yield may be small and such a diagnosis may not change management. Young adults with learning difficulties are also challenging to investigate, as they may not tolerate standard epilepsy tests. We present such a case in which simple tests identified a unifying diagnosis. With the new diagnosis came a new treatment that had a significant impact on seizures and quality of life.

### High cerebral guanidinoacetate and variable creatine concentrations in argininosuccinate synthetase and lyase deficiency: implications for treatment? [^113bbeuG]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Cerebral creatine and guanidinoacetate and blood and urine metabolites were studied in four patients with argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) or argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency receiving large doses of arginine. Urine and blood metabolites varied largely. Cerebral guanidinoacetate was increased in all patients, while cerebral creatine was low in ASS and high in ASL deficiency. Because high cerebral guanidinoacetate might be toxic, lowering the arginine supplementation with additional creatine supplementation might be important.

### Elevation of guanidinoacetate in newborn dried blood spots and impact of early treatment in GAMT deficiency [^114wseMR]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is a good candidate disorder for newborn screening because early treatment appears to improve outcomes. We report elevation of guanidinoacetate in archived newborn dried blood spots for 3 cases (2 families) of GAMT deficiency compared with an unaffected carrier and controls. We also report a new case of a patient treated from birth with normal developmental outcome at the age of 42 months.

### Plasma creatinine assessment in creatine deficiency: a diagnostic pitfall [^111sXeEH]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2000). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (creatine deficiency syndrome) is a recently discovered inborn error of creatine biosynthesis. Affected patients have elevated concentrations of guanidino-acetate, the metabolic precursor of creatine, in urine, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, urinary creatinine excretion and plasma creatinine concentration are decreased. For biochemical evaluation of patients suspected to suffer from GAMT deficiency, correct quantification of creatinine in plasma is important. Here we report our experience with different quantification techniques. We found that creatinine in plasma from two GAMT-deficient patients appeared normal when measured by the Jaffé method but was decreased when measured enzymatically or by HPLC. The apparently normal levels of creatinine as measured by the Jaffé method were not caused by guanidinoacetate. In urine, the Jaffé method and the enzymatic method gave similar results, indicating that in urine no false elevations of creatinine can be expected. As the Jaffé method is still widely used for routine plasma creatinine measurements, it is important to realize it cannot be used to exclude GAMT deficiency.

### Inborn errors of creatine metabolism and epilepsy: clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment [^114pkpfY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Creatine metabolism disorders have so far been described at the level of two synthetic steps, guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase and arginine:glycine amidinotransferase, and at the level of the creatine transporter 1. Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase and arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency respond positively to substitutive treatment with creatine monohydrate. Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency results in a severe neurologic disease (age of onset 3 months to 2 years) characterized by developmental arrest, neurologic deterioration, movement disorders, mental retardation, autistic-like behavior, and epilepsy. Severe early-onset epilepsy with pleomorphic seizures is a key symptom of this disorder. Data suggest that in patients with guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency, epilepsy and associated electroencephalographic abnormalities are more responsive to creatine supplementation than to conventional antiepilepsy drugs. Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and creatine transporter 1 mainly present with mental retardation and severe language disorder. All cases of creatine disorders reported to date have been detected by brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, an expensive technique not routinely used in pediatric neurology. A potential diagnostic strategy to select patients for evaluation using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is proposed in this review.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^116ye4vq]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype — selected metabolic conditions that may (rarely) be associated are listed across categories, including disorders of amino acid metabolism (Phenylketonuria [untreated], Homocystinuria, Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase deficiency), γ-aminobutyric acid metabolism (Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency), cholesterol metabolism (Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome [7-dehydrocholesterol reductase deficiency]), disorders associated with cerebral folate deficiency (Folate receptor 1 gene mutations, Dihydrofolate reductase deficiency), creatine transport or metabolism (Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency, Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, X-linked creatine transporter defects), carnitine biosynthesis (6-Trimethyllysine dioxygenase deficiency), purine and pyrimidine metabolism (Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, Adenosine deaminase deficiency, Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase superactivity, Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase superactivity), lysosomal storage disorders (Sanfilippo syndrome [mucopolysaccharidosis type III]), mitochondrial disorders (Mitochondrial DNA mutations, Nuclear DNA mutations), and others (Biotinidase deficiency, Urea cycle defects).

### Successful treatment of a guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficient patient: findings with relevance to treatment strategy and pathophysiology [^1128gZAu]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Biochemical and developmental results of treatment of a guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficient patient with a mild clinical presentation and remarkable developmental improvement after treatment are presented. Treatment with creatine (Cr) supplementation resulted in partial normalization of cerebral (measured with magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy) and plasma levels of Cr and guanidinoacetate (GAA). Addition of high dose ornithine to the treatment led to further normalization of plasma GAA, while cerebral Cr and GAA did not improve further.

### Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency: first steps to newborn screening for a treatable neurometabolic disease [^113eubnL]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Background

GAMT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis resulting in severe neurological complications in untreated patients. Currently available treatment is only successful to stop disease progression, but is not sufficient to reverse neurological complications occurring prior to diagnosis. Normal neurodevelopmental outcome in a patient, treated in the newborn period, highlights the importance of early diagnosis.

Methods

Targeted mutation analysis (c.59G > C and c.327G > A) in the GAMT gene by the QIAxcel system and GAA measurement by a novel two-tier method were performed in 3000 anonymized newborn blood dot spot cards.

Results

None of the targeted mutations were detected in any newborn. Two novel heterozygous variants (c.283_285dupGTC; p. Val95dup and c.278_283delinsCTCGATGCAC; p. Asp93AlafsX35) were identified by coincidence. Carrier frequency for these insertion/deletion types of GAMT mutations was 1/1475 in this small cohort of newborns. GAA levels were at or above the 99th percentile (3.12 μmol/l) in 4 newborns. Second-tier testing showed normal results for 4 newborns revealing 0.1% false positive rate. No GAMT mutations were identified in 4 of the newborns with elevated GAA levels in the first tier testing.

Conclusion

This is the first two-tier study to investigate carrier frequency of GAMT deficiency in the small cohort of newborn population to establish evidence base for the first steps toward newborn screening for this treatable neurometabolic disorder.

### Creatine and guanidinoacetate reference values in a French population [^115VML6p]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Creatine and guanidinoacetate are biomarkers of creatine metabolism. Their assays in body fluids may be used for detecting patients with primary creatine deficiency disorders (PCDD), a class of inherited diseases. Their laboratory values in blood and urine may vary with age, requiring that reference normal values are given within the age range. Despite the long known role of creatine for muscle physiology, muscle signs are not necessarily the major complaint expressed by PCDD patients. These disorders drastically affect brain function inducing, in patients, intellectual disability, autistic behavior and other neurological signs (delays in speech and language, epilepsy, ataxia, dystonia and choreoathetosis), being a common feature the drop in brain creatine content. For this reason, screening of PCDD patients has been repeatedly carried out in populations with neurological signs. This report is aimed at providing reference laboratory values and related age ranges found for a large scale population of patients with neurological signs (more than 6 thousand patients) previously serving as a background population for screening French patients with PCDD. These reference laboratory values and age ranges compare rather favorably with literature values for healthy populations. Some differences are also observed, and female participants are discriminated from male participants as regards to urine but not blood values including creatine on creatinine ratio and guanidinoacetate on creatinine ratio values. Such gender differences were previously observed in healthy populations; they might be explained by literature differential effects of testosterone and estrogen in adolescents and adults, and by estrogen effects in prepubertal age on SLC6A8 function. Finally, though they were acquired on a population with neurological signs, the present data might reasonably serve as reference laboratory values in any future medical study exploring abnormalities of creatine metabolism and transport.

### X-linked creatine transporter defect: an overview [^115CexXV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2003). Low credibility.

In 2001 we identified a new inborn error of metabolism caused by a defect in the X-linked creatine transporter SLC6A8 gene mapped at Xq28 (SLC6A8 deficiency, McKusick 300352). An X-linked creatine transporter defect was presumed because of (1) the absence of creatine in the brain as indicated by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); (2) the elevated creatine levels in urine and normal guanidinoacetate levels in plasma, ruling out a creatine biosynthesis defect; (3) the absence of an improvement on creatine supplementation; and (4) the fact that the pedigree suggested an X-linked disease. Our hypothesis was proved by the presence of a hemizygous nonsense mutation in the male index patient and by the impaired creatine uptake by cultured fibroblasts. Currently, at least 7 unrelated families (13 male patients and 13 carriers) with a SLC6A8 deficiency have been identified. Four families come from one metropolitan area. This suggests that SLC6A8 deficiency may have a relatively high incidence. The hallmarks of the disorder are X-linked mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour. In approximately 50% of the female carriers, learning disabilities of varying degrees have been noted.

### Case study for the evaluation of current treatment recommendations of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency: ineffectiveness of sodium benzoate [^111skcnP]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of creatine biosynthesis. We report a new patient with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency and her > 3-year treatment outcome.

Patient

This is a 6-year-old girl who was diagnosed with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency at the age of 28 months. She presented with moderate global developmental delay, one afebrile seizure, and hypotonia between 6 and 18 months of life. She was treated with creatine and ornithine supplementation and a strict arginine-restricted diet for 42 months.

Results

Mutation analysis (compound heterozygous mutations, a known c.327G > A and a novel c.58dupT [p. Trp20LeufsX65]) and enzyme studies in primary fibroblasts confirmed the diagnosis. After 33 months of therapy, her cerebrospinal fluid guanidinoacetate level decreased from 47 to 5.3 times the normal level. Brain creatine by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy increased by > 75% but did not normalize in the basal ganglia and white matter after 3 years of therapy. Additional treatment with sodium benzoate for 17 months did not further improve plasma guanidinoacetate levels, which questions the relevance of this therapy.

Conclusion

Treatment did not improve moderate intellectual disability or normalize guanidinoacetate accumulation in the central nervous system.

### Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency: outcomes in 48 individuals and recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and monitoring [^115ckcNJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

We collected data on 48 patients from 38 families with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency. Global developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) with speech/language delay and behavioral problems as the most affected domains was present in 44 participants, with additional epilepsy present in 35 and movement disorder in 13. Treatment regimens included various combinations/dosages of creatine-monohydrate, l-ornithine, sodium benzoate and protein/arginine restricted diets. The median age at treatment initiation was 25.5 and 39 months in patients with mild and moderate DD/ID, respectively, and 11 years in patients with severe DD/ID. Increase of cerebral creatine and decrease of plasma/CSF guanidinoacetate levels were achieved by supplementation with creatine-monohydrate combined with high dosages of l-ornithine and/or an arginine-restricted diet (250 mg/kg/d l-arginine). Therapy was associated with improvement or stabilization of symptoms in all of the symptomatic cases. The 4 patients treated younger than 9 months had normal or almost normal developmental outcomes. One with inconsistent compliance had a borderline IQ at age 8.6 years. An observational GAMT database will be essential to identify the best treatment to reduce plasma guanidinoacetate levels and improve long-term outcomes.

### Expanded clinical and molecular spectrum of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency [^1124PifX]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is a disorder of creatine biosynthesis, characterized by excessive amounts of guanidinoacetate in body fluids, deficiency of creatine in the brain, and presence of mutations in the GAMT gene. We present here 8 new patients with GAMT deficiency along with their clinical, biochemical and molecular data. The age at diagnosis of our patients ranges from 0 to 14 years. The age of onset of seizures usually ranges from infancy to 3 years. However, one of our patients developed seizures at age 5; progressing to myoclonic epilepsy at age 8 years and another patient has not developed seizures at age 17 years. Five novel mutations were identified: c.37ins26 (p.G13PfsX38), c.403G > T (p.D135Y), c.507_521dup15 (p.C169_S173dup), c.402C > G (p.Y134X) and c.610_611delAGinsGAA (p.R204EfsX63). Six patients had the c.327G > A (last nucleotide of exon 2) splice-site mutation which suggests that this is one of the most common mutations in the GAMT gene, second only to the known Portuguese founder mutation, c.59G > C (p.W20S). Our data suggests that the clinical presentation can be variable and the diagnosis may be overlooked due to unawareness of this disorder. Therefore, GAMT deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive myoclonic epilepsy as well as in unexplained developmental delay or regression with dystonia, even if the patient has no history of seizures. As more patients are reported, the prevalence of GAMT deficiency will become known and guidelines for prenatal diagnosis, newborn screening, presymptomatic testing and treatment, will need to be formulated.

### Diagnostic methods and recommendations for the cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes [^111oJH7T]. Pediatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Primary care pediatricians and a variety of specialist physicians strive to define an accurate diagnosis for children presenting with impairment of expressive speech and delay in achieving developmental milestones. Within the past two decades, a group of disorders featuring this presentation have been identified as cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS). Patients with these disorders were initially discerned using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain within a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. The objective of this review is to provide the clinician with an overview of the current information available on identifying and treating these conditions. We explain the salient features of creatine metabolism, synthesis, and transport required for normal development. We propose diagnostic approaches for confirming a CCDS diagnosis. Finally, we describe treatment approaches for managing patients with these conditions.

### Arginine-guanidinoacetate-creatine pathway in preterm newborns: creatine biosynthesis in newborns [^114xNSDb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The phosphocreatine/creatine system is fundamental for the proper development of the embryonic brain. Being born prematurely might alter the creatine biosynthesis pathway, in turn affecting creatine supply to the developing brain. We enrolled 53 preterm and very preterm infants and 55 full-term newborns. The levels of urinary guanidinoacetate, creatine, creatinine and amino acids were measured in the preterm and very preterm groups, 48 h and 9 days after birth and at discharge, and 48 h after birth in the full-term group. Guanidinoacetate concentrations of both preterm and very preterm newborns were significantly higher at discharge than the values for the full-term group at 48 h, while very preterm infants showed urinary creatine values significantly lower than those measured in the full-term group. Our results suggest an impairment of the creatine biosynthesis pathway in preterm and very preterm newborns, which could lead to creatine depletion affecting the neurological outcome in prematurely born infants.

### Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency masquerading as a mitochondrial encephalopathy [^114o8ayt]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is a rare disorder of creatine synthesis. We report a patient who presented at 10 months of age with hypotonia and global developmental delay. Subsequently, she developed seizures and choreoathetosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal bilaterally in the globus pallidus on T2-weighted images. Mitochondrial respiratory chain studies revealed low complex I activity (in muscle 0.052 nmol NADH oxidized per min per unit citrate synthase, controls 0.166 ± 0.047; in fibroblasts 0.080 nmol NADH oxidized per min per unit citrate synthase, controls 0.197 ± 0.034). The true diagnosis was suspected at 21 months of age because of persistent low plasma and urine creatinine concentrations. GAMT activity was undetectable in fibroblasts and compound heterozygous mutations were found in the GAMT gene (c.327G > A and c.522G > A). The patient was treated with creatine, dietary arginine restriction and ornithine supplements. Her movement disorder and seizures resolved but she still has severe cognitive impairment and no expressive language. The occurrence of secondary respiratory chain abnormalities in GAMT deficiency may lead to misdiagnosis, particularly as the clinical and radiological features resemble those seen in mitochondrial encephalopathies. It is important to establish the correct diagnosis because specific treatment is available.

### Biochemical, molecular, and clinical diagnoses of patients with cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes [^117CoQzQ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are a group of inborn errors of creatine metabolism that involve AGAT and GAMT for creatine biosynthesis disorders and SLC6A8 for creatine transporter (CT1) deficiency. Deficiencies in the three enzymes can be distinguished by intermediate metabolite levels, and a definitive diagnosis relies on the presence of deleterious mutations in the causative genes. Mutations and unclassified variants were identified in 41 unrelated patients, and 22 of these mutations were novel. Correlation of sequencing and biochemical data reveals that using plasma guanidinoacetate (GAA) as a biomarker has 100% specificity for both AGAT and GAMT deficiencies, but AGAT deficiency has decreased sensitivity in this assay. Furthermore, the urine creatine:creatinine ratio is an effective screening test with 100% specificity in males suspected of having creatine transporter deficiency. This test has a high false-positive rate due to dietary factors or dilute urine samples and lacks sensitivity in females. We conclude that biochemical screening for plasma GAA and measuring of the urine creatine:creatinine ratio should be performed for suspected CCDS patients prior to sequencing. Also, based on the results of this study, we feel that sequencing should only be considered if a patient has abnormal biochemical results on repeat testing.

### Long-term follow-up and treatment in nine boys with X-linked creatine transporter defect [^116CtoG5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Follow-up

Neuropsychological assessment and measurement of cerebral creatine by ¹H-MRS were performed before the start of treatment and one to three times during treatment. The treatment duration at the last neuropsychological assessment was 12–48 months (mean 33) and at the last ¹H-MRS 20–31 months (mean 25) (Fig. 1). Evaluation further consisted of check-ups twice yearly (history and physical examination) and biochemical analysis of urinary and plasma creatine, guanidinoacetate, and amino acids. A renal ultrasound was performed to screen for renal stone formation during the treatment. Eight of the nine boys were seen by a child psychiatrist to classify their behavioral problems (Table 1).

### GAMT deficiency: features, treatment, and outcome in an inborn error of creatine synthesis [^114UGRe3]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Guanidinoactetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine synthesis. The authors analyzed clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings in 27 patients.

Methods

The authors collected data from questionnaires and literature reports. A score including degree of intellectual disability, epileptic seizures, and movement disorder was developed and used to classify clinical phenotype as severe, moderate, or mild. Score and biochemical data were assessed before and during treatment with oral creatine substitution alone or with additional dietary arginine restriction and ornithine supplementation.

Results

Intellectual disability, epileptic seizures, guanidinoacetate accumulation in body fluids, and deficiency of brain creatine were common in all 27 patients. Twelve patients had severe, 12 patients had moderate, and three patients had mild clinical phenotype. Twenty-one of 27 (78%) patients had severe intellectual disability (estimated IQ 20 to 34). There was no obvious correlation between severity of the clinical phenotype, guanidinoacetate accumulation in body fluids, and GAMT mutations. Treatment resulted in almost normalized cerebral creatine levels, reduced guanidinoacetate accumulation, and in improvement of epilepsy and movement disorder, whereas the degree of intellectual disability remained unchanged.

Conclusion

Guanidinoactetate methyltransferase deficiency should be considered in patients with unexplained intellectual disability, and urinary guanidinoacetate should be determined as an initial diagnostic approach.

### A three-tier algorithm for guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency newborn screening [^114BFAn9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is a rare disorder of creatine biosynthesis presenting with epilepsy and developmental delay in infancy. Excellent developmental outcomes have been reported for infants treated from birth due to a family history. The BC Newborn Screening Program initiated a 3year pilot screening study for GAMT deficiency to evaluate the performance of a novel three-tiered screening approach.

Methods

Over 36months all bloodspots submitted for routine newborn screening were included in the pilot study (de-identified). Initial GAA measurement was integrated into the standard acylcarnitine/amino acid first-tier assay. All samples with elevated GAA were subjected to second-tier GAA analysis by LC-MS/MS integrated into an existing branched-chain amino acid (MSUD) method. GAMT gene sequencing was completed on the original bloodspot for all specimens with elevated GAA on the second-tier test. The protocol allowed for re-identification for treatment of any specimen with one or two likely pathogenic GAMT mutations.

Results

Over the study period 135,372 specimens were tested with 259 (0.19%) over the first-tier GAA cut-off. The second-tier assay removed an interference falsely elevating GAA levels, and only 3 samples required genotyping. No mutations were identified in any samples, all were deemed negative screens and no follow-up was initiated.

Conclusions

A three-tier algorithm for GAMT newborn screening showed excellent test performance with zero false positives. No cases were detected, supporting a low incidence for this disorder. Given the low incremental costs and evidence of positive outcomes with early intervention, GAMT deficiency remains an excellent candidate for newborn screening.

### Two new severe mutations causing guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency [^113y48mh]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Primary disorders of creatine metabolism have been only recently described. We report new molecular and biochemical findings obtained from a child affected by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency. This patient presented with neurological regression, epilepsy, and a movement disorder during the first year of life. HPLC analysis showed high concentrations of guanidinoacetic acid in urine, plasma, and CSF. Molecular analyses of cDNA and genomic DNA revealed two novel mutations, a G insertion following nucleotide 491 of the cDNA (c.491insG) in exon 5 and a transversion at nt -3 in intron 5 (IVS5-3C > G). The c.491insG mutation causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon at the end of the exon. The IVS5-3C > G mutation prevents the splicing of the last exon of the gene precluding the complete maturation of the transcript and, most likely, causes rapid degradation of the mRNA.

### Response to therapy of creatine transporter deficiency caused by a hypomorphic variant in SLC6A8 [^117JKhHf]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are rare inherited metabolic disorders caused by defective biosynthesis or transport of creatine. These conditions are characterized by reduced accumulation of creatine in the brain, mild to severe intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and speech-language disorders. The amount of brain creatine reduction needed to cause symptoms is not known. Here we report a new patient with creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) who presented at 15 months of age with seizures and global delays with no speech at 3 years of age. Brain MRI was normal, but brain MRS indicated creatine levels reduced to about 20% of normal. He had normal levels of creatine and guanidinoacetate in plasma, but increased creatine/creatinine ratio in urine. DNA sequencing identified a hemizygous c.832C > T (p. Arg278Cys) variant in the creatine transporter gene SLC6A8. Fibroblasts from this patient had about 25% of normal creatine transport activity, a value much higher than that measured in patients whose variants introduced premature stop codons in SLC6A8. The child was started on supplements of creatine, glycine, and arginine. His speech improved dramatically, and he had no more seizures, even during episodes of fever. Despite the clinical improvement, a repeat MRS demonstrated similar levels of brain creatine. This study suggests that a reduction in creatine transporter activity to 25% or less is sufficient to cause symptoms of brain creatine deficiency and that functionally milder forms of CTD might respond to supplements aimed at replenishing brain creatine.

### Feasibility of newborn screening for guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency [^115mToQc]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency causes brain creatine deficiency characterized by developmental delays, speech delay, seizures and autism-like behavior. Identification and therapy at birth because of a positive family history has prevented intellectual disability and seizures in all cases reported. The objective of this study was to develop a method to identify patients with GAMT deficiency from newborn screening blood spots. Creatine and guanidinoacetate were extracted from 10,000 deidentified blood spots using the same protocol routinely used for newborn screening and quantified by stable isotope dilution using deuterated creatine and guanidinoacetate as internal standards. Residual dried blood spots from three infants with GAMT deficiency were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the method. A second tier test using UPLC-MS/MS was performed to analyze samples with a concentration of guanidinoacetate > 2.44 μmol/L (99.5th centile of the normal population). Fifty four blood spots required second tier testing in addition to seven blood spots from three patients with GAMT deficiency retrospectively analyzed. With second tier testing, only the samples from GAMT deficiency patients had elevated concentration of guanidinoacetate. Our results show that GAMT deficiency can be identified in newborns using routine extraction methods. The cost of this additional screening is minimal, as it does not require additional instrumentation, procedure, or sample collection. The use of a second tier test can reduce the false positive rate to a minimum. Summary Brain creatine deficiency syndromes cause mental retardation that can be prevented if therapy is initiated early in life. This manuscript reports that infants with GAMT deficiency (one of the brain creatine deficiency syndromes) can be identified from elevated guanidinoacetate in newborn blood spots with virtually absent false-positive results using a second tier test.

### Long-term follow-up and treatment in nine boys with X-linked creatine transporter defect [^1115P6QA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Creatine is important for the energy homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk) and might act as a neuromodulator (Almeida et al.). Creatine is both taken up from the diet and synthesized endogenously, mainly in the kidney, pancreas, and liver. In the first step of the biosynthesis, catalyzed by arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), guanidinoacetic acid and ornithine are formed from arginine and glycine. In the second step, catalyzed by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), guanidinoacetic acid is methylated into creatine. Creatine is then transported through the blood to creatine-requiring organs, mainly the brain and muscles, where it is taken up via the creatine transporter (CRTR) (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk).

Cerebral creatine deficiency, which can be diagnosed by in vivo proton magnetic resonance (¹H-MRS) of the brain, causes neurological symptoms. The deficiency can be caused by autosomal recessive biosynthesis defects (AGAT or GAMT deficiency) or X-linked CRTR defect. The first male patient with CRTR defect was described in 2001 (Cecil et al; Salomons et al.). Patients present with intellectual disability (ID), severe speech delay, behavior disturbances, and epilepsy (Stöckler and Salomons).

In AGAT and GAMT deficiency, creatine supplementation has led to a partial restoration of the cerebral creatine content and attenuation of the symptoms (Mercimek-Mahmutoglu and Stockler-Ipsiroglu). In CRTR defect, high plasma creatine levels might result in some cellular creatine uptake via alternative mechanisms or residual activity of CRTR. CRTR-deficient fibroblasts take up creatine when incubated in high creatine concentrations (DeGrauw et al.). However creatine monotherapy has not proved to be successful in patients with CRTR defect (Anselm et al; Bizzi et al; DeGrauw et al; Dezortova et al; Poo-Arguelles et al.).

### Evidence-based treatment of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency [^115PDsEe]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency causes cerebral creatine deficiency. Patients can have autistic behavior, seizures, intellectual disability, and severe speech delay. The goal of therapy is to increase creatine while reducing potentially neurotoxic guanidinoacetate concentrations. Here we evaluate how different therapies affect plasma guanidinoacetate levels in patients with GAMT deficiency.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of data from five new patients with GAMT deficiency (four with delays and seizures, one diagnosed at birth).

Results

The four symptomatic patients had decreased brain creatine by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and three also had abnormal globi pallidi by MRI. GAMT sequencing identified four previously reported mutations and one novel missense mutation (c.233T > A/p.V78E). Treatment with creatine (250–1000 mg/kg/day), ornithine (100–800 mg/kg/day), and sodium benzoate (50–135 mg/kg/day) supplements along with dietary protein restriction (0.8–1.5 g/kg/day) improved seizures and development with all patients becoming verbal. The patient treated at birth remains developmentally normal. Reduction in glycine and increase in ornithine levels significantly decreased plasma guanidinoacetate, with glycine levels being the best predictor of guanidinoacetate levels. In contrast, arginine levels were not significantly correlated with plasma guanidinoacetate.

Conclusions

Our results show that supplements of creatine, sodium benzoate (to reduce glycine) and ornithine reduce guanidinoacetate levels in patients with GAMT deficiency (dietary therapy was not evaluated in our study). Normal development with early therapy renders GAMT deficiency an ideal candidate for inclusion in newborn screening panels.

### Genetic evaluation of the child with intellectual disability or global developmental delay: clinical report [^111TKx6H]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Global developmental delay/intellectual disability — Tier 2 treatable inborn errors of metabolism lists disorders with paired biochemical evaluations for targeted screening. Phenylketonuria (PAH) is paired with Plasma amino acids (increased phenylalanine); Classic homocystinuria (CBS1) with Total homocysteine (increased), plasma amino acids (increased methionine); Organic acidurias with Urine organic acids, plasma acylcarnitines, ammonia; Urea cycle disorders with Ammonia, plasma amino acids (abnormal citrulline and/or arginine), urine organic acids (+/− increased orotic acid); Creatine deficiency syndromes (GAMT, GATM, SLC6A8) with Urine creatine/creatinine, plasma creatine, urine and plasma guanidinoacetate; Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HPRT1) with Plasma uric acid (increased), urine purine and pyrimidines; Mucopolysaccharidoses with Urine glycosaminoglycans; and Biotinidase deficiency with Biotinidase enzyme activity (if not included on newborn screening or clinical suspicion).

### AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in the central nervous system, in relation to creatine deficiency syndromes: a review [^1161fBRg]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Creatine deficiency syndromes, either due to AGAT, GAMT or SLC6A8 deficiencies, lead to a complete absence, or a very strong decrease, of creatine within the brain, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency.

### Lack of creatine in muscle and brain in an adult with GAMT deficiency [^112HUGES]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, which so far has been exclusively detected in children, was diagnosed in a 26-year-old man. The full-blown spectrum of clinical symptoms already had been present since infancy without progression of symptoms during adolescence. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed normal findings. Ophthalmological examination showed no retinal changes. Besides creatine deficiency in the brain, a distinct lack of phosphocreatine in skeletal muscle was proved by ³¹P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Creatine substitution combined with a guanidinoacetate-lowering diet introduced first at the age of 26 years was shown to be effective by an impressive improvement of epileptic seizures, mental capabilities, and general behavior and by normalization of the (31)P spectrum in the skeletal muscle.

### Untargeted metabolomic analysis for the clinical screening of inborn errors of metabolism [^113ao3zC]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Using this scoring metric, 20 of the 21 disorders had multiple analyte perturbations within the pathway affected by the respective enzyme deficiency (Table 1). We were unable to screen for gaunidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT; OMIM 612736) deficiency due to a failure to detect guanidinoacetate, the diagnostic biomarker found elevated in the plasma of patients with this disorder. The number of significantly altered analytes related to the diagnosis ranged from two metabolites in patients with trimethyllysine hydroxylase epsilon (TMLHE; OMIM 300872) deficiency, i.e. decreased deoxycarnitine (γ-butyrobetaine) and increased N6-trimethyllysine (Fig. S2), to as many as 20 significant analyte perturbations that could be mapped directly up/downstream of the enzymatic defect in patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA; OMIM 25100; Figs. 1d and e; 2).

### Arginine: glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency: clinical features and long term outcomes in 16 patients diagnosed worldwide [^115ZzZQS]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Arginine:glycine aminotransferase (AGAT) (GATM) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of creative synthesis.

Objective

We performed an international survey among physicians known to treat patients with AGAT deficiency, to assess clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of this ultra-rare condition.

Results

16 patients from 8 families of 8 different ethnic backgrounds were included. 1 patient was asymptomatic when diagnosed at age 3 weeks. 15 patients diagnosed between 16 months and 25 years of life had intellectual disability/developmental delay (IDD). 8 patients also had myopathy/proximal muscle weakness. Common biochemical denominators were low/undetectable guanidinoacetate (GAA) concentrations in urine and plasma, and low/undetectable cerebral creatine levels. 3 families had protein truncation/null mutations. The rest had missense and splice mutations. Treatment with creatine monohydrate (100–800 mg/kg/day) resulted in almost complete restoration of brain creatine levels and significant improvement of myopathy. The 2 patients treated since age 4 and 16 months had normal cognitive and behavioral development at age 10 and 11 years. Late treated patients had limited improvement of cognitive functions.

Conclusion

AGAT deficiency is a treatable intellectual disability. Early diagnosis may prevent IDD and myopathy. Patients with unexplained IDD with and without myopathy should be assessed for AGAT deficiency by determination of urine/plasma GAA and cerebral creatine levels (via brain MRS), and by GATM gene sequencing.

### Prospective identification by neonatal screening of patients with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency [^114wXRqu]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder that impairs the synthesis of creatine (CRE). Lack of CRE in the brain can cause intellectual disability, autistic-like behavior, seizures, and movement disorders. Identification at birth and immediate therapy can prevent intellectual disability and seizures. Here we report the first two cases of GAMT deficiency identified at birth by newborn screening (NBS) in Utah and New York.

Methods

NBS dried blood spots were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using either derivatized or non-derivatized assays to detect guanidinoacetate (GUAC) and CRE. For any positive samples, a second-tier test using a more selective method, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) combined with MS/MS, was performed to separate GUAC from potential isobaric interferences.

Results

NBS for GAMT deficiency began in Utah on June 1, 2015 using a derivatized method for the detection of GUAC and CRE. In May 2019, the laboratory and method transitioned to a non-derivatized method. GAMT screening was added to the New York State NBS panel on October 1, 2018 using a derivatized method. In New York, a total of 537,408 babies were screened, 23 infants were referred and one newborn was identified with GAMT deficiency. In Utah, a total of 273,902 infants were screened (195,425 with the derivatized method, 78,477 with the non-derivatized method), three infants referred and one was identified with GAMT deficiency. Mean levels of GUAC and CRE were similar between methods (Utah derivatized: GUAC = 1.20 ± 0.43 μmol/L, CRE = 238 ± 96 μmol/L; Utah non-derivatized: GUAC = 1.23 ± 0.61 μmol/L, CRE = 344 ± 150 μmol/L, New York derivatized: GUAC = 1.34 ± 0.57 μmol/L, CRE = 569 ± 155 μmol/L). With either Utah method, similar concentrations of GUAC are observed in first (collected around 1 day of age) and the second NBS specimens (routinely collected at 7–16 days of age), while CRE concentrations decreased in the second NBS specimens. Both infants identified with GAMT deficiency started therapy by 2 weeks of age and are growing and developing normally at 7 (Utah) and 4 (New York) months of age.

Conclusions

Newborn screening allows for the prospective identification of GAMT deficiency utilizing elevated GUAC concentration as a marker. First-tier screening may be incorporated into existing methods for amino acids and acylcarnitines without the need for new equipment or staff. Newborn screening performed by either derivatized or non-derivatized methods and coupled with second-tier testing, has a very low false positive rate and can prospectively identify affected children. SummaryCerebral creatine deficiency syndromes caused by defects in creatine synthesis can result in intellectual disability, and are preventable if therapy is initiated early in life. This manuscript reports the identification of two infants with GAMT deficiency (one of the cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes) by newborn screening and demonstrates NBS feasibility using a variety of methods.

### ClinGen variant curation expert panel recommendations for classification of variants in GAMT, GATM and SLC6A8 for cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes [^117G9Qz9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are inherited metabolic phenotypes of creatine synthesis and transport. There are two enzyme deficiencies, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), encoded by GAMT and arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), encoded by GATM, which are involved in the synthesis of creatine. After synthesis, creatine is taken up by a sodium-dependent membrane bound creatine transporter (CRTR), encoded by SLC6A8, into all organs. Creatine uptake is very important especially in high energy demanding organs such as the brain, and muscle. To classify the pathogenicity of variants in GAMT, GATM, and SLC6A8, we developed the CCDS Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) in 2018, supported by The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource. We developed disease-specific variant classification guidelines for GAMT-, GATM-, and SLC6A8-related CCDS, adapted from the American College of Medical Genetics/Association of Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) variant interpretation guidelines. We applied specific variant classification guidelines to 30 pilot variants in each of the three genes that have variants associated with CCDS. Our CCDS VCEP was approved by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group (SVI WG) and Clinical Domain Oversight Committee in July 2022. We curated 181 variants including 72 variants in GAMT, 45 variants in GATM, and 64 variants in SLC6A8 and submitted these classifications to ClinVar, a public variant database supported by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Missense variants were the most common variant type in all three genes. We submitted 32 new variants and reclassified 34 variants with conflicting interpretations. We report specific phenotype (PP4) using a points system based on the urine and plasma guanidinoacetate and creatine levels, brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) creatine level, and enzyme activity or creatine uptake in fibroblasts ranging from PP4, PP4_Moderate and PP4_Strong. Our CCDS VCEP is one of the first panels applying disease specific variant classification algorithms for an X-linked disease. The availability of these guidelines and classifications can guide molecular genetics and genomic laboratories and health care providers to assess the molecular diagnosis of individuals with a CCDS phenotype.

### Method modification to reduce false positives for newborn screening of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency [^112HzD91]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in reduced activity of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, an accumulation of guanidinoacetate (GUAC), and a lack of cerebral creatine (CRE). Lack of CRE in the brain can cause intellectual disability, autistic-like behavior, seizures, and movement disorders. Identification at birth and immediate therapy can prevent intellectual disability and seizures. If started early in life, treatment with creatine supplements is highly effective. Because there are reliable biomarkers for GAMT deficiency, GUAC and CRE, and because the disorder is readily treatable with a significant improvement in outcomes, GAMT deficiency is an excellent candidate for newborn screening. Several programs have conducted pilot programs or started screening. An isobaric interferant of the GUAC marker has been reported which may cause false positive results. To reduce the number of false positives, a second-tier HPLC test to separate GUAC from unknown, isobaric interferants may be incorporated into the screening algorithm. New York State began screening for GAMT deficiency in October 2018 using a three-tiered screening approach. Quantification of GUAC and CRE were incorporated into routine screening for amino acids and acylcarnitines. In the first year of screening a total of 263,739 samples were tested for GAMT deficiency. Of these, 3382 required second tier testing. After second tier testing, 210 repeat specimens were requested for borderline results and 10 referrals were made to specialty care centers for confirmatory testing. In the first year of screening there were no confirmed cases of GAMT deficiency detected. To reduce the number of samples needing second tier testing and the number false positives we explored the use of a second MS transition to confirm the identity of the GUAC marker. GUAC and its internal standard are detected as butylated esters after sample preparation and derivatization. The original method used transition of the GUAC molecular ion of m/z 174.1 to a reactant ion of m/z 101.1. To confirm the identity of the GUAC marker we selected a qualifier ion of 174.1 > 73. The alternative product ion results were found to agree more closely with the second tier HPLC-MS/MS results for GUAC. It was found that the alternative transition may be used for quantification of the GUAC marker with acceptable analytical performance (linearity, accuracy, and precision). On March 5, 2020, the method of analysis for GUAC was modified to use the alternative product ion. For a comparable 6-month period, the modified method reduced the number of samples requiring second tier testing by 98%, reduced the number of borderline results requiring a repeat sample by 87.5%, and reduced the number of referrals to specialty care centers by 85%. Using the modified method, the correlation (r²) of the first and second tier screening results for GUAC is greater than 0.95. Since the first-tier results correlate well with the second-tier results, the second-tier screening is no longer necessary with the modified method.

### ¹H chemical shift imaging of the brain in guanidino methyltransferase deficiency, a creatine deficiency syndrome; guanidinoacetate accumulation in the gray matter [^115uEcpa]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

MR spectroscopy results in a mild case of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency are presented. The approach differs from previous MRS studies in the acquisition of a chemical shift imaging spectral map showing gray and white matter with the corresponding spectra in one overview. MR spectroscopy revealed guanidinoacetate (GAA) in the absence of creatine. New is that GAA signals are more prominent in gray matter than in white. In the prevailing view, that enzyme deficiency is localized in liver and pancreas and that all GAA is transported into the brain from the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid, this would be compatible with a more limited uptake and/or better clearance of GAA from the white matter compared to the grey matter.

### A prevalent pathogenic GAMT mutation (C.59G > C) in Portugal [^114osUqu]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (MIM 601240), an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis, presents with mental retardation, extrapyramidal symptoms, autistic-like behavior and epilepsy. Other hallmarks are cerebral creatine deficiency, increased levels of guanidinoacetate in body fluids and mutations in the GAMT gene. Creatine supplementation partially restores cerebral creatine content. Worldwide, 29 patients have been identified and 15 different mutations have been reported in the GAMT gene. Ten out of these 29 patients are of Portuguese origin. Likely, a founder effect and a high carrier rate in Portugal exist, since in 17 out of the 20 Portuguese alleles the c.59G > C; p. Trp20Ser mutation was found. We investigated the carrier rate of the c.59G > C; p. Trp20Ser mutation in different regions of Portugal and confirmed the pathogenic nature of this missense mutation by transient transfections. Anonymous bloodspots (1002) were screened for the presence of the c.59G > C; p. Trp20Ser mutation by SNaPshot (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Multiplex Kit). Eight carriers of c.59G > C; p. Trp20Ser were detected of which four are derived from the Archipelagos. This suggests that the carrier rate of the c.59G > C; p. Trp20Ser mutation is relatively high in these islands, as well as in other parts of Portugal. It also implies that newborn screening in these regions is warranted for this treatable disorder.

### Secondary creatine deficiency in ornithine delta-aminotransferase deficiency [^116aeDS8]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Ornithine delta-aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency causes gyrate atrophy (GA) of the retina, as a consequence of high plasma ornithine concentrations. Because creatine synthesis requires the conversion of arginine and glycine into ornithine and guanidinoacetate, high ornithine concentration inhibits this reaction thus causing secondary creatine deficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuropsychological features and creatine metabolism in patients with GA.

Methods

The study involved 7 GA patients, aged from 11 to 27 years who underwent neuropsychological evaluation and cerebral proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

Results

Neurocognitive impairment was found in 5/7 patients, including mental retardation (3/7), school failure (1/7), major visuospatial dyspraxia (1/7), aggressive behavior (3/7) and epilepsy (2/7). Two patients had normal neuropsychological evaluation. Cerebral proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a profound creatine deficiency in all patients. MRS data were confirmed by decreased levels of creatine and/or guanidinoacetate in plasma and urine in all patients.

Conclusions

In our group of patients with GA, we found a high prevalence of neurological impairment, not reported so far, and possibly related to secondary creatine deficiency and hyperornithinemia. We propose to treat mentally retarded GA patients with high doses of creatine, as it may normalize brain creatine levels and help to reduce ornithine levels.

### Long-term follow-up and treatment in nine boys with X-linked creatine transporter defect [^111bLEYr]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

Between 2003 and 2005, nine boys (four sib pairs, including one twin, and one single case), between 8 months and 10 years old (mean 5.3 years; median 3.9 years) were diagnosed with CRTR defect based on elevated urinary creatine/creatinine ratio, cerebral creatine depletion on 1 H-MRS, and mutation in the SLC6A8 gene and were started on treatment with creatine monohydrate, L-arginine, and glycine. Clinical details of the patients are summarized in Table 1. Two sibpairs patients have been published before (Mancini et al.).

Treatment

All patients were started between 2003 and 2005 on oral creatine monohydrate 400 mg/kg and oral L-arginine 400 mg/kg per day, divided into two to three doses. In the two youngest patients (patients 8 and 9), 150 mg/kg glycine per day was added from the start. In five other patients, glycine was added after 15–21 months. Two brothers (patients 1 and 2) were never started on glycine treatment due to family circumstances. The regimen was chosen on the basis of the creatine supplement used for GAMT deficiency and L-arginine for patients with urea cycle defects. The glycine dose was chosen in a 1:1 molar ratio with L-arginine. These dosages are known to lack side effects and to be palatable and well tolerated. The individual treatment protocols are depicted in Fig. 1. Treatment was discontinued in 2009–2010 because of lack of evident response. The study protocol was discussed and supported by the Metabolic Section of the Dutch Pediatric Society.

### A proposed nosology of inborn errors of metabolism [^11218fhQ]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We propose a nosology for inborn errors of metabolism that builds on their recent redefinition.

Methods

We established a strict definition of criteria to develop a self-consistent schema for inclusion of a disorder into the nosology.

Results

We identified 1015 well-characterized inborn errors of metabolism described in the literature. In addition, there are 111 less well-characterized conditions that may be inborn errors but do not meet strict criteria for inclusion in the current nosology.

Conclusion

We provide a master list of all currently recognized inborn errors of metabolism grouped according to their pathophysiological basis, with the hope of setting a standard against which new errors should be defined, as well as to promote awareness and foster collaboration in the area. With the rapid advances in the field of genetics in recent years, it is likely that this nosology will need to be updated in the near future, a process that will benefit from broader input and collaboration of experts in the field to improve future versions of the proposed classification.

### Overexpression of GAMT restores GAMT activity in primary GAMT-deficient fibroblasts [^112poLJJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (MIM 601240) is an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis. Patients present with mental retardation, extrapyramidal symptoms, autistic-like behavior, epilepsy, cerebral creatine deficiency and increased levels of guanidinoacetate. So far 15 mutations have been reported, including six missense variants that are highly likely to be pathogenic mutations. To prove that mutations in the GAMT gene are responsible for GAMT deficiency we overexpressed the GAMT open reading frame in GAMT-deficient fibroblasts by stable transfection. In addition, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the same expression vector. In contrast to mock transfectants transfection of primary GAMT-deficient fibroblasts with wild-type GAMT results in the restoration of GAMT activity as measured by GC-MS using stable isotope labeled substrates. Moreover, the expression of the GAMT-EGFP fusion protein was analyzed by Western blot, confirming the presence of GAMT fusion protein, both in the stable as well as in the transient transfectants. Here, we prove that mutations in the GAMT gene are responsible for GAMT deficiency, since overexpression of the GAMT open reading frame restores GAMT activity in GAMT-deficient fibroblasts. Furthermore, the transient transfection of HeLa cells will be important for functional analysis of variants of unknown consequence (i.e., missense mutations).

### Long-term follow-up and treatment in nine boys with X-linked creatine transporter defect [^114gacZZ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Brain cells appear to be capable of endogenous creatine synthesis since AGAT and GAMT are expressed in all brain cells (Braissant et al.) and synthesis has been observed in brain cell cultures (Dringen et al.). Provision of arginine increased guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and creatine synthesis in astroglial cells (Dringen et al.), the rat kidney (Edison et al.) and, in combination with glycine, in human CRTR-deficient lymphoblasts (Leuzzi et al.). Supplementation with creatine precursors L-arginine and glycine might, therefore, increase endogenous cerebral creatine synthesis. Chilosi et al. observed improvement and an increase in cerebral creatine (although still well below normal) after 1-year supplementation with L-arginine in an 8.6-year-old male patient with CRTR defect (Chilosi et al.). Treatment with creatine combined with arginine and glycine also resulted in resolution of severe seizures in a 9-year-old girl with CRTR defect (Mercimek-Mahmutoglu et al.). However Fons et al. reported no effect of a 9 month L-arginine supplementation in four male patients. The effectiveness of L-arginine supplementation therefore remains controversial.

We describe the 4–6 year follow-up with repeated ¹H-MRS and neuropsychological assessments during a pilot study in nine boys who were diagnosed in the Netherlands shortly after the discovery of the creatine transporter defect in 2001 and were treated with creatine monohydrate, L-arginine, and glycine supplementation.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^116FR6fF]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

Review

Creatine as a therapy for the 3 rd trimester

The synthesis of creatine and its availability in a diet containing meat, milk products and fish is shown in Figure 1. Human adults obtain approximately half of their daily requirement for creatine from a diet containing meat, fish and other animal products, the remainder being synthesized endogenously from arginine, glycine and methionine in a two-step process involving arginine:glycine aminotransferase (AGAT), principally in the kidney, followed by hepatic methylation via guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT). Creatine is then released from the liver into the circulation and taken up by most tissues, especially muscle, by means of the creatine transporter protein (CrT). Once inside the tissues a proportion of the creatine is phosphorylated to form phosphocreatine via the action of creatine phosphokinase. Despite this endogenous synthesis, ingesting creatine increases the creatine content of skeletal muscle and brain indicating that in healthy people the intracellular pool of creatine is not fully saturated.

Figure 1
Creatine is an amino acid derivative involved with cellular energy production. In the form of energetically charged phosphocreatine (PCr), its primary function is to provide the phosphate group for regeneration of ATP from ADP in tissues of high and fluctuating energy demands. Human adults obtain approximately half of their daily requirement for creatine from a diet containing fresh fish, meat, and other animal products. The remainder is synthesized endogenously from arginine, glycine and methionine (methyl donor for GAMT reaction). This is a two-step process involving arginine:glycine aminotransferase (AGAT), principally in the kidney, producing guanidinoacetate (GAA), followed by hepatic guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) activity producing creatine. Once synthesized, creatine is released from the liver into the circulation and taken up by most tissues, particularly muscle, by means of the creatine transporter. Inside the tissues a proportion of the creatine is phosphorylated to PCr, via the action of creatine kinase (CK). One important aspect of creatine biosynthesis is that the daily utilization of methyl groups on the GAMT reaction roughly equals the total daily intake of 'labile' methyl groups (methionine + choline) in an average diet. Thus, if methionine and choline levels are reduced, then endogenous creatine biosynthesis, responsible for half of our daily requirement for creatine, may be critically reduced.

### Plasma creatine and incident type 2 diabetes in a general population-based cohort: the PREVEND study [^115bYtA6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this population‐based cohort, we validated that plasma creatine concentrations are lower in males than in females. In time‐to‐event analyses, higher plasma creatine was independently associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes, and we demonstrate that this association between plasma creatine concentration and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes is heavily modified by sex, with higher plasma creatine being independently associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes in males, but not in females.

Creatine plays a crucial bioenergetic role in adenosine triphosphate turnover and is especially important in tissues with high and fluctuating energetic demands, that is skeletal muscles, brain and heart. 33, 34 In omnivorous humans, creatine is synthesized endogenously, but also ingested through the diet. 35 The first step of the biochemical synthesis of creatine is a facilitated by the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), which converts arginine and glycine into guanidinoacetate, and it is at this step that regulation of endogenous creatine synthesis occurs. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 In humans, highest AGAT activities are present in kidney and pancreas, while other tissues, such as brain and testes, express lower activities of AGAT. 41, 42 The high expression of AGAT in the kidneys likely explains the strongly positive association we found between plasma creatine concentration and kidney function. Generally, due to a reduction in clearance, plasma concentrations of small water‐soluble molecules increase with decreasing kidney function. However, we found that lower kidney function was associated with lower plasma creatine, confirming that enzymatic kidney function is likely for a large part responsible for endogenous biosynthesis of creatine in humans. 35, 43 The second step of endogenous creatine synthesis is facilitated by the liver enzyme guanidinoacetate N‐methyltransferase (GAMT), converting guanidinoacetate to creatine by performing a methylation step, which interestingly, uses up to 40% of all endogenously generated S‐adenosylmethionine. 44, 45 The importance of creatine and endogenous creatine synthesis becomes apparent from the rare inherited AGAT and GAMT deficiency syndromes, leading to severe mental retardation, autism, movement disorders and epilepsy. 46 After being released into the circulation, creatine is transported into tissues by the creatine transporter 1 (CrT1), encoded by the SLC6A8 gene, located on the X‐chromosome. 47 Through the years, several sex‐based differences in creatine homeostasis have been identified. Rates of endogenous creatine biosynthesis in females have been found to be 70%–80% lower than in males, 41 which is also reflected by lower serum guanidinoacetate concentrations in females than in males. 48 Usually, dietary creatine intake is also lower in females than in males. 41 Despite the lower production and intake in females, we found significantly higher plasma concentrations of creatine in females, compared to males. In 1989, Delanghe et al. investigated potential sex‐based differences in serum creatine in a small population of 60 healthy adults and also found significantly higher creatine concentrations in females compared to males. 49 In their study, serum creatine was on average 9.4 μmol/L higher in females than in males. 49 In our present study, we found a comparable difference of 12.3 μmol/L. Interestingly, the trend of higher creatine concentrations in females was also found in biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle, where females had 10% higher intracellular creatine concentrations compared to males. 50 This difference could not be attributed to differences in the proportion of fast and slow twitch fibres.

### Infant mortality in Brazil attributable to inborn errors of metabolism associated with sudden death: a time-series study (2002–2014) [^1159boTL]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The SINASC was designed by analogy with the SIM and implemented gradually by the Ministry of Health from 1990 onward. It has contained nationally consolidated data since 2004, although the degree of coverage varied during the first few years of implementation. The SINASC registry includes information on all live births in the country, with data on the pregnancy, the delivery, and the child's condition at birth. The system's basic document is the Live Birth Certificate, registration of which has been compulsory since 1999.

To collect data on IEM-related deaths, we selected all infant deaths recorded in Brazil in which the underlying cause was assigned an ICD-10 code (OMS 12) corresponding to the list of 43 IEMs potentially associated with SUDI and/or Reye Syndrome, as described by van Rijt et al. (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Death records were obtained for all infants (age < 1 year) who died in Brazil in 2002–2014 in whom the underlying cause of death was listed as ICD-10 codes E70 (Disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism), E71 (Disorders of branched-chain amino-acid metabolism and fatty-acid metabolism), E72 (Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism), or E74 (Other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism), which are known to be associated with sudden death. Although mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders do feature in the list, these disorders are clustered under a highly heterogeneous ICD category: E88 (Other metabolic disorders). Due to this heterogeneity and to the fact that not all diseases covered by this ICD code are associated with sudden death, we chose not to include them in analyses. The study period was established taking into account that pre-2002 data are highly incomplete, and that the most recent year for which information was available is 2014.

Disclaimer: These ACMG Standards and Guidelines are intended as an educational resource for clinical laboratory geneticists to help them provide quality clinical laboratory genetic services. Adherence to these standards and guidelines is voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These Standards and Guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of others that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, clinical laboratory geneticists should apply their professional judgment to the specific circumstances presented by the patient or specimen. Clinical laboratory geneticists are encouraged to document in the patient's record the rationale for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with these Standards and Guidelines. They also are advised to take notice of the date any particular guideline was adopted, and to consider other relevant medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures. Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes are neurometabolic conditions characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, speech delay, and behavioral abnormalities. Several laboratory methods are available for preliminary and confirmatory diagnosis of these conditions, including measurement of creatine and related metabolites in biofluids using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, enzyme activity assays in cultured cells, and DNA sequence analysis. These guidelines are intended to standardize these procedures to help optimize the diagnosis of creatine deficiency syndromes. While biochemical methods are emphasized, considerations for confirmatory molecular testing are also discussed, along with variables that influence test results and interpretation.

### S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency in a 26-year-old man [^11548geb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2006). Low credibility.

This paper reports the third proven human case of deficient S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase activity. The patient is similar to the only two previously reported cases with this disorder in having severe myopathy, developmental delay, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations, and hypermethioninaemia. Although he has been followed from infancy, the basic enzyme deficiency was established only at age 26 years. The diagnosis was based on markedly elevated plasma concentrations of both AdoHcy and S-adenosylmethionine, some 20% of the mean control activity of AdoHcy hydrolase activity in haemolysates of his red-blood cells, and two missense mutations in his gene encoding AdoHcy hydrolase. He had low values of erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine and plasma free choline and marginally elevated excretion of guanidinoacetate, suggesting that the elevated AdoHcy may have been inhibiting methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and guanidinoacetate. His leukocyte DNA was globally more methylated than the DNA's of his parents or the mean extent of methylation measured in age-matched control subjects.

### A mutation on exon 6 of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) gene supports a different function for isoform a and b of GAMT enzyme [^115RJtpt]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

A new patient affected by Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency was reported. This 13-year-old girl presented with mental retardation, as main symptom, associated with a typical pattern of biochemical and neurochemical (brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy) alterations. Molecular study detected a L197P transition on exon 6 of the GAMT gene. Since this mutation leaves the isoform B of the GAMT enzyme unaffected, the occurrence of biochemical alterations and disease in this subject testifies against the possibility that isoform b had GAMT activity.

### Creatine depletion in a new case with AGAT deficiency: clinical and genetic study in a large pedigree [^116bstDF]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, EC 2.1.4.1) deficiency is a recently recognized autosomal recessive inborn error of creatine biosynthesis, characterized by mental retardation and severe language impairment. We extensively investigated a third 5-year-old patient with AGAT deficiency, discovered in the pedigree of the same Italian family as the two index cases. At the age of 2 years he presented with psychomotor and language delay, and autistic-like behavior. Brain MRI was normal, but brain ¹H-MRS disclosed brain creatine depletion, which almost completely normalized following creatine monohydrate supplementation. A remarkable clinical improvement paralleled the restoration of brain creatine concentration. AGAT and GAMT (guanidinoacetate:methyltransferase) genes were analyzed in the proband and in 26 relatives, including the two cousins with AGAT deficiency. Sequencing of the proband's AGAT gene disclosed the same homozygous mutation at nt position 9093 converting a tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG) at residue 149 (W149X), as already described in the two previously reported cases. The proband's parents and 10 additional subjects of the pedigree were carriers for this mutation. AGAT deficiency was further confirmed by undetectable AGAT activity in the patient's lymphoblasts. Mutation analysis of the GAMT gene revealed a sequence variation in exon 6 (T209M), not in the proband, but in 15 additional subjects from the pedigree. The silent nature of this sequence variation is supported by its homozygosity in one AGAT deficient cousin and in one asymptomatic adult, both with normal GAMT activity.

### Arginine: glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency: an easy-to-miss treatable adult-onset myopathy [^115yym9q]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency is an ultrarare disorder of creatine metabolism, presenting with developmental delay, characteristic biochemical findings and muscle weakness. Most known cases have been identified and treated in early childhood. We describe a 27-year-old woman with learning difficulties and significant myopathy who was diagnosed through genetic investigation in adulthood. Treatment with creatine (10–15 g/day) led to a significant and rapid improvement of muscle strength. A literature review of the few reported adult cases confirms that progressive myopathy is a prominent feature that responds well to creatine supplementation. AGAT deficiency, a partially treatable condition, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a genetic myopathy, particularly in people with developmental delay and progressive myopathy.

Creatine transporter deficiency has been described with normal or uninformative levels of creatine and creatinine in plasma, while urine has been the preferred specimen type for biochemical diagnosis. We report a cohort of untreated patients with creatine transporter deficiency and abnormal plasma creatine panel results, characterized mainly by markedly decreased plasma creatinine. We conclude that plasma should be considered a viable specimen type for the biochemical diagnosis of this disorder, and abnormal results should be followed up with further confirmatory testing.

### Current and potential new treatment strategies for creatine deficiency syndromes [^1171dkaR]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are inherited metabolic disorders caused by mutations in GATM, GAMT and SLC6A8 and mainly affect central nervous system (CNS). AGAT- and GAMT-deficient patients lack the functional brain endogenous creatine (Cr) synthesis pathway but express the Cr transporter SLC6A8 at blood-brain barrier (BBB), and can thus be treated by oral supplementation of high doses of Cr. For Cr transporter deficiency (SLC6A8 deficiency or CTD), current treatment strategies benefit one-third of patients. However, as their phenotype is not completely reversed, and for the other two-thirds of CTD patients, the development of novel more effective therapies is needed. This article aims to review the current knowledge on Cr metabolism and CDS clinical aspects, highlighting their current treatment possibilities and the most recent research perspectives on CDS potential therapeutics designed, in particular, to bring new options for the treatment of CTD.

### Consensus recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of inherited methylation disorders [^112tZm6H]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inherited methylation disorders are a group of disorders affecting the transmethylation processes in the metabolic pathway between methionine and homocysteine (Fig. 1). Transmethylation is the transfer of a methyl group from methionine via S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which is the methyl group donor in humans, to numerous acceptors. The large group of methyl group acceptors includes important molecules such as DNA, RNA, lipids, proteins and amino acids, neurotransmitters and guanidinoacetate (Clarke and Banfield). Methyl group transfer is mediated by numerous different methyltransferases. Katz and co-workers (Katz et al) concluded from bioinformatic analysis of various genomes, including that of humans, that class-1 AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases correspond to about 0.6 to 1.6% of all open reading frames in analysed genomes. This would point to about 300 AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases in humans. The fact that transmethylation, together with the process of remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, i.e. the methionine cycle, occurs in almost all mammalian tissues and cells, also reflects its significance for normal cellular hemostasis (Mudd et al; Finkelstein; Brosnan and Brosnan; Blom et al).

### Targeted urine metabolomics with a graphical reporting tool for rapid diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism [^115NQ1FC]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3.2 disease group 2 — disorders of carbohydrate metabolism

We included 7 of the 44 phenotypes suitable for TUM. Galactitol is the prime biomarker for galactokinase deficiency (OMIM 230200) and galactose‐1‐phosphate:uridyltransferase deficiency (OMIM 230400). Samples from patients on galactose restriction showed nondiscriminant z‐scores.

While glycerol and sedoheptulose are not quantified in dedicated assays, we can analyze them in TUM. Even in samples with many abnormal biomarkers, these specific metabolites resulted in high‐ranking prediction scores for untreated patients with fructose‐1,6‐biphosphate deficiency (OMIM 229700) or sedoheptulose kinase deficiency (OMIM 617213).

Untreated patients with disorders in glyoxylate metabolism can be diagnosed based on glycolic and glyceric acid.

3.3.3 disease group 3 — disorders of fatty acid and ketone body metabolism

TUM gave comparable results to urine organic acid analysis for the disorders included here, including six disorders of ketone body metabolism, malonyl‐CoA decarboxylase deficiency (OMIM 248360), and combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (OMIM 614265). We excluded defects of long‐chain fatty acid oxidation (LCHADD, VLCADD), as they have no (specific) urinary biomarkers.

3.3.4 disease group 4 — disorders of energy metabolism

Our validation included fumarase deficiency (OMIM 136850) and disorders of creatine metabolism. In case of fumarase deficiency (Figure 4), TUM even resulted in the identification of previously unknown, but theoretically logical, disease‐associated metabolites.

FIGURE 4
Needle plot and heatmap from a patient with fumarase deficiency displaying new metabolites due to a secondary adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency

Disorders of creatine biosynthesis and transport lead to subtle metabolite abnormalities and proved more difficult to diagnose. In addition, creatine treatment disturbs the phenotype prediction. In case of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, n = 2) deficiency (OMIM 612718) the diagnosis was obvious in one sample, whereas in other sample, we observed multiple abnormalities.

TUM correctly called two of the eight samples of patients with cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome 2 (guanidinoacetate methyltransferase [GAMT]; OMIM 612736). In two cases, treatment with creatine disturbed the prediction algorithm. In the remaining four samples, z‐scores for guanidinoacetate and creatine were within reference. Creatine Transporter (CrT) deficiency was difficult to diagnose with our pipeline.

### Use of denaturing HPLC to provide efficient detection of mutations causing guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency [^1171FMLo]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive error of creatine synthesis characterized by cerebral creatine deficiency, accumulation of guanidinoacetate, mental retardation, epilepsy, and extrapyramidal symptoms. To date, 14 mutations of the GAMT gene in 27 patients have been reported. Mutation analysis was done using direct sequencing of PCR products and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with direct sequencing. In contrast, we evaluated the efficiency of a newly developed DHPLC method to detect mutations in the GAMT gene by analysing DNA from 14 GAMT patients with known mutations. PCR amplification of both patient and control DNA was followed by formation of homoduplices and heteroduplices, and their detection by DHPLC. DHPLC identified all mutations tested and is the preferred choice of analytical method.

### Genetic evaluation of the child with intellectual disability or global developmental delay: clinical report [^111QAonT]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Corollary testing — neuroimaging, vision, hearing in global developmental delay/intellectual disability (GDD/ID) — in children with GDD/ID, evaluation by an ophthalmologist should be considered, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and in children with language delay, hearing evaluation is also important, with sensorineural hearing loss potentially offering a phenotypic clue. Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated in children with GDD/ID and abnormal head circumference, focal neurological signs or symptoms, seizures, increased tone or developmental regression; it may also be considered in moderate to severe GDD/ID, if a specific disorder with abnormal neuroimaging is suspected, or if no etiology is identified following other diagnostic evaluations including genetic studies.

### Asymptomatic / pauci-symptomatic creatine kinase elevations (hyperckemia) [^116V6LpS]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular clinicians are frequently asked to evaluate patients referred for asymptomatic elevations in creatine kinase (CK), a catalytic enzyme that combines creatine and ATP to form phosphocreatine and ADP. This reaction is crucial for cellular energy generation and metabolism. This laboratory finding, often referred to in simplified lexicon as asymptomatic hyperCKemia, continues to generate controversy at several levels, including definition, the extent of evaluation, and the yield of diagnostic testing. In this review, we summarize the literature based on series of patients with asymptomatic hyperCKemia and provide a rational clinical approach to reveal identifiable underlying causes.

Results

Case ascertainment

A total of 1637 potential cases were identified. After removal of duplicates, manual electronic patient record review and application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a cohort of 255 cases of expert-determined definite incident IIM was established (seefor details). All included cases had a minimum core set of data including a formal assessment of power (and distribution of weakness), a documented creatine kinase (CK) level, serological status, the presence or absence of dysphagia and biopsy status available to allow for the criteria to be applied. The more common underlying diagnoses in the excluded cases were inherited myopathies, such as a dystrophy or metabolic myopathy; primary neurological conditions with elevated CK levels, such as motor neurone disease; acquired causes of myositis that are not primarily immune mediated, such as toxic rhabdomyolysis or critical illness polyneuromyopathy; or simply an error in clinical episode coding. In addition, a substantial proportion of the MSA-positive cases were ultimately interpreted as false positives and excluded. 1

### Untargeted metabolomic analysis for the clinical screening of inborn errors of metabolism [^112ittnc]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations of this platform were also uncovered. A number of clinically relevant plasma compounds were not identified in this study, most notably homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, tetradecenoylcarnitine (C14:1), and guanidinoacetate (GAA). The latter missed identification led to the failure to detect GAMT deficiency; however, the inability to detect homocysteine, tetradecenoylcarnitine, and methylmalonic acid was mitigated by the identification of multiple other disease related analyte perturbations in the case of homocystinuria or methylmalonic acidemia. Given the sample preparation methods, it is understandable that we did not detect homocysteine because analysis requires a reducing reagent to release conjugated homocysteine (Frick et al). Overall, metabolomic analysis provided excellent coverage of the amino acids and acylcarnitines covered by targeted clinical tests (Tables S4 and S5); however, long chain hydroxylated acylcarnitines were missed and therefore this platform would likely not be able to diagnose trifunctional protein deficiency (OMIM 609015). For many OTC deficiency patients, only treatment-associated findings were uncovered, similar to the reports for clinical amino acid testing of the same specimens. Thus, as with targeted assays, metabolomic results have to be interpreted with the caveat that a patient's diet and physiological condition may mask the underlying genetic disorder. It is worth reiterating that almost all specimens in our study were collected while the patient was on clinical management designed to alleviate their biochemical phenotype. For instance, citrulline and/or arginine levels would likely be significantly reduced in OTC patients if they were not receiving supplementation of these amino acids. In many cases, but especially in the OTC cohort, our dataset likely does not fully demonstrate the capabilities of this platform in a clinical diagnostic setting focused on undiagnosed patients.

Among creatine deficiency syndromes, an X-linked condition related to a defective creatine transport into the central nervous system has been described recently. Hallmarks of the disease are the absence of a creatine signal at brain spectroscopy, increased creatine levels in blood and urine, ineffectiveness of oral supplementation, and a mutation in the SLC6A8 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 300036) creatine transporter gene. We report on a patient in whom a novel mutation (1221-1223delTTC) was identified.

4.3 Evidence levels in treatment decision‐making

Most treatment strategies had limited evidence levels of 4 or 5, based mainly on case series and case reports. Remarkably, enzyme replacement therapies achieved level 1b in 35% of cases, likely due to more robust trials, clear mechanisms of action, and significant improvements in disease severity. The levels of evidence for the other treatment strategies were limited.

Conducting an RCT for IEMs and other rare diseases is often unfeasible due to their rarity. Definitions of "rare disease" vary globally: in Europe, it affects fewer than 1 in 2000 people, while in the United States, fewer than 200 000 people, corresponding to 1 in 1666 based on a population of approximately 333 million. In rare diseases, alternative study designs like n‐of‐1 trials are often used, despite being viewed as lower evidence than RCTs. However, according to The Oxford Levels of Evidence, n‐of‐1 studies also provide level 1 evidence. The results of n‐of‐1 trials may be more relevant for the treatment of a specific rare disease or individual patient.n‐of‐1 and other alternative trial designs generate real‐world evidence crucial for optimizing treatments. This underscores a potential incongruence between the level of evidence and the relevance of a specific treatment for a specific patient or disease. For example, creatine has a significant and highly relevant effect in arginine amidinotransferase deficiency, yet the level of evidence is low. Overall, in rare diseases, the relevance of treatment effects often outweighs the formal level of evidence in clinical decision‐making.

4.4 Limitations and strengths

Limitations encountered during this study include the scarcity of robust clinical data for rare IEMs, which posed challenges in determining treatment efficacy. Second, the evolving landscape of IEM therapies requires regular updates and continuous monitoring of new treatments. And third, most therapies exhibited evidence levels 4 or 5, reflecting the inherent difficulty in conducting RCTs for rare diseases. Finally, our criteria for identifying metabolites specific to IEMs may have unintentionally excluded some relevant ones.

Strengths of this study include its comprehensive approach, encompassing the identification of treatable IEMs, an extensive literature review, and systematic extraction of treatment efficacy data. Furthermore, the clear documentation of treatment strategies, evidence levels, and effects on clinical outcome measures, including biomarkers, provides valuable insights into available treatments. Third, this study offers a user‐friendly, accessible resource for healthcare professionals centralizing treatment data online. Lastly, this study may help to streamline reimbursement procedures and enhance accessibility to therapies.

### Infant mortality in Brazil attributable to inborn errors of metabolism associated with sudden death: a time-series study (2002–2014) [^116Fx557]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

From 2002 to 2014, the deaths of 598,734 children under 1 year old were recorded in Brazil. Over the same period, according to the SIM, there were 199 deaths of infants under 1 year old attributed to the IEMs of interest, which corresponds to a median 17 deaths per year (IQR: 12–18) (Fig. 1). The infant mortality rate attributable to the selected IEMs in the period of analysis was 0.67 per 10,000 live births.

Fig. 1
Distribution of the number of infant deaths due to IEMs recorded in Brazil, 2002–2014

Of these 199 deaths, 18 (9.0%) occurred in the North of Brazil, 43 (21.6%) in the Northeast, 80 (40.2%) in the Southeast, 46 (23.1%) in the South, and 12 (6.0%) in the Center-West region. Across all five regions of the country, ICD-10 code E74 (Other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism) was predominant; of all IEM-related infant deaths recorded in the study period, 80 (40.2%) were assigned this ICD code as the underlying cause. In the North and Southeast regions, the second leading cause was ICD-10 code E72 (Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism), whereas in the South and Northeast regions, code E70 (Disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism) was the second leading cause. In the Center-West region of Brazil alone, disorders classified under ICD-10 code E71 (Disorders of branched-chain amino-acid metabolism and fatty-acid metabolism) were the second leading cause of death (Table 1).

Table 1
Distribution of deaths due to IEMs according to ICD-10 classification, stratified by region of Brazil, 2002–2014

According to the latest demographic census at the time of writing, the population of Brazil was 202,768,562, with 2,979,259 live births in 2014 and an infant mortality rate of 14.4 per 1000. Table 2 provides infant mortality rates attributable to the IEMs of interest, using these data as a baseline.

### The role of ERNDIM diagnostic proficiency schemes in improving the quality of diagnostic testing for inherited metabolic diseases [^115TU2R4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The common sample circulated in 2011 with GAMT deficiency as the diagnosis was classed as educational. In a repeat distribution of a different sample, the DPT‐France scheme classed it again as educational, illustrating no clear improvement in the diagnosis of GAMT deficiency. This is probably because the specific biomarkers for GAMT deficiency (guanidinoacetate and creatine) are not included in the standard portfolio for participating in DPT schemes.

Figure 2A illustrates the improvement in proficiency of MNGIE/thymidine phosphorylase deficiency samples (delta proficiency of +11/+28/+32/+33 in the four respective schemes). Participating laboratories were probably more aware of the need to perform purine/pyrimidine analysis given the clinical details after the first distribution. In DPT‐France, the first distribution was considered as educational due to the poor overall proficiency of 45%. As another example, aspartylglucosaminuria (delta proficiency +17/−10/+9/+39) in subsequent surveys shows clear improvement especially in the UK scheme (Figure 2B). The sample was classed as educational by the SAB for the UK scheme the first year and performance improved on repeat distribution.

At 35 weeks the patient delivered a male newborn by planned caesarean section, weighing 2450 g (25th centile), with a length of 49 cm (25th centile) and HC of 32 cm (10th centile); APGAR score was 8–9. The newborn plasma and urinary concentrations of Cr were 56.4 and 103 µmol/L, respectively. The guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) values in the infant plasma and urine were both low (0.15 and 17.2 µmol/L, respectively; GAA reference range: 0.22–3.14 µmol/L in plasma, 56–698 µmol/L in urine, respectively). He was breastfed for 4 months during which the mother continued taking 3 g/day of Cr; at that time the plasma Cr of the child was 49.4 µmol/L, the Cr on brain MRS was normal as well as brain MRI.

The boy reached normal developmental milestones; his weight and height remained at 25th centiles. At four months his sucking was normal as were his muscle tone and strength; the general movements examination (GMs) was also normal (present fidgety movements). At 12 months of age, the plasma and urinary Cr of the baby increased to 67.7 and 369.7 µmol/L; the plasma and urinary GAA concentrations were 0.56 µmol/L and 250.2 µmol/L, respectively. The child's psychomotor development was normal (Bayley III) and auxological data, including HC, were at the 25th centile. After 4 months of breastfeeding, the mother, of her own accord, decided to reduce her Cr supplementation, returning to the dose prior to her pregnancy of 2 g daily, because of weight gain.

2.3 Patient characteristics

Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed at the date of the index CV event. Comorbidities included all available diagnoses up to 2 years preindex and were categorized as shown in Table S1. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and corresponding chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage were defined using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD‐EPI) formula, based on plasma creatine measures. All laboratory measure summaries used the closest available measure, up to 14 days post event and up to 90 days pre‐event.

Recurrent events were defined as new diagnoses of the same ICD‐10 codes used for the index CV event and additional criteria of being recorded as the main diagnosis code for treatment given in the emergency room or during the hospital inpatient stay. A minimum time interval of 7 days from the previous same type of event was required for an event to be classified as new. Time of death was retrieved from the hospital data lakes.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Next-generation metabolic screening: targeted and untargeted metabolomics for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in individual patients [^117E2Qfy]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

NGMS-based screening of IEMs in individual patients

We applied our NGMS technology to delineate plasma metabolomic profiles of 46 distinct IEMs (Table 1). All patients were on diagnosis-specific treatment following available guidelines or based on expert opinion of attending clinicians. Because of treatment, biochemical abnormalities were expected to be less pronounced compared with those detected in samples of untreated patients. In each individual plasma sample, > 10,000 features could be detected. Due to the high level of complexity of data generated through this untargeted NGMS methodology, we searched for an application feasible for future implementation in routine patient diagnostics. In analogy to routine diagnostic analysis of big data generated from next-generation (exome) sequencing strategies through disease-specific filters, we developed an IEM metabolite panel containing 340 clinically relevant metabolites known to be either diagnostic or associated with common therapeutic interventions for IEMs (Supplemental Table 1) as a first filtering step to reduce data complexity and extract relevant diagnostic information. Through a semi-automated pipeline developed in-house, all features detected in a plasma sample were compared between an individual patient and controls. Bonferroni-corrected P values were calculated for statistical significance of each feature. Open-access metabolite information from the HMDB was integrated for metabolite annotation (see "Methods" section). Only significantly different features between a patient and controls were evaluated and reported. Based on chemical characteristics of the metabolite, different adducts were preferentially formed (see Table 1). Following this approach, we identified key diagnostic metabolites in 42 of 46 (91%) IEMs tested (see Fig. 1) to visualize results in barplots of feature intensity for a selection of IEMs. Among those IEMs were several organic acidurias, for which the relevant urinary biomarkers could readily be detected in plasma using the NGMS approach. In our set of 46 IEMs tested, four diagnoses remained undetected by the standard NGMS workflow: guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, argininosuccinic aciduria, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency, and lysinuric protein intolerance. In the first three of these diseases, peaks could be detected in raw data files at the expected m/z and retention time for the relevant metabolites guanidinoacetate, argininosuccinic acid, and dimethylglycine (Supplemental Fig. 2). However, these features were not present in the XCMS output file, indicating that they were lost in the alignment procedure. For lysinuric protein intolerance, a negative fold change (−3.2×) for lysine was observed in raw data but was rejected in our statistical selection (corrected P value > 0.05).

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^116zDveZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate pediatric patients with elevated CK levels (> 171 U/L) presenting to the Pediatric Metabolism Outpatient Clinic. Patients were classified into three groups: idiopathic, IMD-diagnosed, and other diseases. Our primary objective was to assess the utility of CK levels in distinguishing IMDs from other conditions and to identify additional biochemical markers that may enhance diagnostic accuracy. By correlating CK values with detailed clinical, biochemical, and genetic data, we sought to refine CK cut-off thresholds and highlight laboratory patterns that could assist clinicians in recognizing pediatric patients at risk for IMDs.

### X-linked creatine transporter deficiency: clinical aspects and pathophysiology [^116sSrTR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Creatine transporter deficiency was discovered in 2001 as an X-linked cause of intellectual disability characterized by cerebral creatine deficiency. This review describes the current knowledge regarding creatine metabolism, the creatine transporter and the clinical aspects of creatine transporter deficiency. The condition mainly affects the brain while other creatine requiring organs, such as the muscles, are relatively spared. Recent studies have provided strong evidence that creatine synthesis also occurs in the brain, leading to the intriguing question of why cerebral creatine is deficient in creatine transporter deficiency. The possible mechanisms explaining the cerebral creatine deficiency are discussed. The creatine transporter knockout mouse provides a good model to study the disease. Over the past years several treatment options have been explored but no treatment has been proven effective. Understanding the pathogenesis of creatine transporter deficiency is of paramount importance in the development of an effective treatment.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^1156v3af]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Biomarkers of mitochondrial disorders [^114wTs8S]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Creatine

Creatine is closely related to CK, where creatine is stored in the form of phosphocreatine, serving as a short-term reservoir of phosphate groups to donate to adenosine diphosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme CK. Clinically, creatine has been proposed as a biomarker for mitochondrial disease due to its inverse relation with intracellular phosphocreatine:creatine ratio, thereby suggesting that elevated creatine levels may represent a low energetic state in tissues.

Creatine as a biomarker was evaluated in 3 different studies with 4 different cohorts, including 132 blood samples. Statistical significance was found in 3 of the 4 cohorts, with the 4th not reporting. Despite the strong association, the sensitivity was relatively low at 39–60 ​% and specificity 83–93 ​% among these studies. So, while statistical significance was noted in these studies, the sensitivity and specificity were relatively weak compared to other biomarkers. Similar to CK as a biomarker, this may be related to the fact that creatine can also be released in any condition causing a myopathy.

### An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD) [^113jyYM3]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Several initiatives at establishing a classification of inherited metabolic disorders have been published previously, some focusing on pathomechanisms, others on clinical manifestations, while yet another attempted a simplified approach of a comprehensive nosology. Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.

### Whole-exome sequencing identifies rare genetic variants associated with human plasma metabolites [^111WMVhy]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

A possible interpretation of the association is that the combined effect of missense variants may reduce the overall enzymatic activity of aminoacylase 1, leading to an increase of their substrate (in this case N-acetylated amino acids). ACY1 has been described in OMIM as a gene causing aminoacylase 1 deficiency (ACY1D), a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by increased urinary excretion of specific N-acetyl amino acids, and most affected individuals show neurologic abnormalities such as intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia, and motor delay. We therefore searched two UKB PheWAS databases, GBEand PheWeb, for associations with complex neurological phenotypes (subjects and methods). Driver variant rs6804746 (MAF = 0.02%) was associated with ICD10 code G31 ("other degenerative diseases of the nervous system not elsewhere classified", GBE; p = 4.6 × 10⁻⁸) and with chronic fatigue syndrome (PheWeb; p = 3.5 × 10⁻⁴). Two other driver variants associated with mental disorders in PheWeb, namely rs1164299165 with pervasive developmental disorders (MAF = 0.005%; p = 9.7 × 10⁻⁴) and rs887540 with major depressive disorder (MAF = 0.03%; p = 3 × 10⁻⁴).

### Serum creatine kinase: requesting and interpreting results [^116m285X]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase is an intracellular enzyme found abundantly in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. It is well known as a biomarker that increases following skeletal muscle damage and doctors instinctively associate it with myopathies. Serum creatine kinase is undoubtedly often raised in many myopathies and the extent of increase may provide a clue to the myopathic culprit. However, in other myopathies, it may be normal or only marginally raised, and rarely it is normal when the underlying pathology suggests that it should be very raised. Creatine kinase can also be raised in neurogenic disorders, and it can help in the investigation of some neurological disorders that are unrelated to neuromuscular disease. Finally, it may be discovered to be mysteriously elevated without a clear clinical correlate. Here, we examine each of these conundrums, beginning with the clinical problem at hand.

### Longitudinal assessment of creatine kinase, creatine / creatinine, and myostatin as monitoring biomarkers in Becker muscular dystrophy [^116EZp56]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective 4-year study, we aimed to investigate whether Cr/Crn, myostatin, and CK could be biomarkers of disease severity and progression in BMD. Cr/Crn and myostatin, but not CK, were highly patient specific and correlated with disease severity but not with disease progression over 4 years. The explained variation of concurrent functional performance by these biomarkers together with age was up to 75%. Our study demonstrates that Cr/Crn and myostatin may be candidate monitoring biomarkers in BMD.

The lack of outcome measures capable of showing changes within the duration of a trial in rare and slowly progressive diseases has hindered the development and evaluation of potential drugs in clinical trials. Monitoring biomarkers have been defined by the Food and Drug Administration as a biomarker that is measured over time. Monitoring biomarkers in general may serve multiple purposes, including detecting the therapeutic effect or disease progression or determining how a drug is metabolized. Therefore, this term covers several types of biomarkers, including prognostic, predictive, response (pharmacodynamic), and safety biomarkers. Creatine used in the creatine/creatinine ratio is derived from diet but can also be synthesized in the liver using guanidinoacetic acid and S-adenosyl-methionine. It functions as an energy buffer in high-energy demanding tissues such as skeletal muscle tissue. In periods of low muscle activity, creatine is phosphorylated to create phosphocreatine by the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to creatine. This reversible transfer is catalyzed by CK and yields adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphate group. In periods of high-energy demand in muscle cells, the phosphor group of phosphocreatine is transferred from ADP to create ATP and can occur within seconds of intense muscular effort. Creatine is nonenzymatically converted to creatinine in human muscle tissue in a constant rate of about 1.7% per day and is then released into the blood and cleared by the kidneys. With loss of muscle mass that is typical for muscular dystrophies, less creatine is converted into creatinine, leading to an increased ratio of creatine to creatinine. Serum creatinine has been shown to be reduced in several neuromuscular diseases including DMD, BMD, and spinal muscular atrophy. Two studies in a large cohort of mainly pediatric patients with dystrophinopathy demonstrated that creatinine levels distinguished DMD from BMD, and that it was inversely correlated with function; creatinine was also associated with disease progression in a smaller longitudinal subset with deteriorating DMD (n = 32) and BMD (n = 4) patients, with 2 time points spanning multiple years. Myostatin (or growth differentiation factor 8) is a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily and acts as a muscle growth inhibitor. It is produced and released by myocytes and fibroblast residing in skeletal muscle tissue. Myostatin circulates in a latent form in the blood as a complex of 2 C-terminal dimers and 2 N-terminal inhibitory prodomains. When the prodomains are cleaved, the myostatin dimer becomes active and can bind to its receptor complex activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) and activin receptor–like kinase (ALK) 4 or ALK5 type 1 receptor in muscle tissue. On binding, myostatin inhibits muscle growth in 3 different pathways; myogenesis is downregulated through mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and through Smad 2/3 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation, and protein synthesis is reduced by the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Inhibition of the myostatin pathway has been shown to lead to muscle hypertrophy in mice models for various muscular dystrophies. Circulating myostatin levels seemed to be lower in patients with clinically more severe disease such as DMD and SMA compared with BMD and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Moreover, its levels seemed to decrease with age in patients with DMD. Thus, downregulation of myostatin may be due to an intrinsic disease process in patients with clinically more severe disease, or it may be a direct consequence of the amount of muscle mass (e.g. the amount of muscle tissue that is able to produce myostatin) or a combination of both.

### Long-term follow-up and treatment in nine boys with X-linked creatine transporter defect [^116vqsw4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

No significant increase in brain creatine content upon treatment was seen in ¹H-MRS. It should be noted that creatine measurements varied inter- and intraindividually, which can be temporarily (mis)taken for improvements. Creatine measurements also differed over the various brain regions, being significantly higher in the basal ganglia and cerebellum than in cortex and white matter. These differences must be taken into account when comparing ¹H-MRS creatine levels in a single individual or in small numbers of observations. The regional differences are comparable to those in healthy subjects (Pouwels et al.).

There are several possible explanations why treatment failed to increase cerebral creatine content. It is possible that the uptake of arginine and glycine through the blood-brain barrier was insufficient. In future trials, this could be monitored by measurements of cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of amino acids. Other explanations are related to the central question why the CRTR defect leads to cerebral creatine deficiency to begin with if the brain is capable of endogenous creatine synthesis. It is possible that the cerebral creatine synthesis is limited and that the expected upregulation of the AGAT reaction, the rate-limiting step in creatine synthesis, by decreasing creatine (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk) or by supplementation of precursors L-arginine and glycine, does not occur in the brain. This is, however, in contrast with the hypothesis that the CNS mainly derives its creatine from endogenous synthesis (Braissant et al.) because the permeability of the blood-brain barrier for creatine appears limited (Wyss and Schulze), and astrocytes, contacting the capillary endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier, do not express CRTR (Braissant et al.). In addition, CRTR might also be important in the cerebral creatine synthesis. Braissant et al. found that AGAT and GAMT, although expressed in all CNS cell types, are rarely co-expressed within the same cell and hypothesized that GAA must be transported by CRTR between brain cells for creatine synthesis to occur (Braissant and Henry; Braissant et al.). In this model GAA accumulation would be expected in cases of CRTR deficiency (Braissant and Henry), which was indeed suggested in one patient (Sijens et al.). Arginine and glycine supplementation would then not lead to the aimed for creatine increase but to further GAA accumulation, an adverse effect because GAA is considered to be epileptogenic (Tachikawa et al.). However, we saw no GAA accumulation in our cohort of CRTR-deficient patients nor an increase during treatment.

### Infant mortality in Brazil attributable to inborn errors of metabolism associated with sudden death: a time-series study (2002–2014) [^114VJ9Ah]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The literature suggests that 0.9 to 6% of infants who die unexpectedly may have had a metabolic disorder. At least 43 different inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) have been associated with sudden death (SUDI). To date, the frequency of IEM-associated SUDI has not been studied in Brazil. The present study sought to characterize infant mortality related to IEMs known to cause SUDI disaggregated by each of the regions of Brazil.

Methods

This was a descriptive, cross-sectional, population-based study of data obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health Mortality Information System (SIM). Death records were obtained for all infants (age < 1 year) who died in Brazil in 2002–2014 in whom the underlying cause of death was listed as ICD-10 codes E70 (Disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism), E71 (Disorders of branched-chain amino-acid metabolism and fatty-acid metabolism), E72 (Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism), or E74 (Other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism), which are known to be associated with SUDI.

Results

From 2002 to 2014, 199 deaths of infants aged < 1 year were recorded in the SIM with an underlying cause corresponding to one of the IEMs of interest. The prevalence of IEM-related deaths was 0.67 per 10,000 live births (0.58–0.77). Of these 199 deaths, 18 (9.0%) occurred in the North of Brazil, 43 (21.6%) in the Northeast, 80 (40.2%) in the Southeast, 46 (23.1%) in the South, and 12 (6.0%) in the Center-West region. Across all regions of the country, ICD10-E74 was predominant.

Conclusions

This 13-year time-series study provides the first analysis of the number of infant deaths in Brazil attributable to IEMs known to be associated with sudden death.

### Acute kidney injury is independently associated with death in patients with cirrhosis [^111qH3Bb]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Setting

The Royal Derby Hospital is a 1139-bed teaching hospital that provides all major medical and surgical specialities (excepting neuro- and cardiothoracic surgery). The liver unit is a tertiary referral centre, serving a population of 700 000. There is a central chemical pathology laboratory for all inpatient and outpatient samples. A compensated kinetic Jaffe method with an inter-assay coefficient of variance of 2.3% at 96 µmol/l (Roche P-analyser, Roche Diagnostics, West Sussex, UK) was used to measure all serum creatine values throughout the study period (normal creatine range 70–120 µmol/l).

Detection of AKI

We have devised and implemented a real-time electronic reporting system for AKI that identifies all cases of AKI across our hospital. This is based on the AKIN diagnostic criteria, which are summarised in table 1. This system has been in clinical use since 2010 and its diagnostic accuracy has been established. A full description of the system is available elsewhere.

Table 1
Classification/staging system for AKI according to AKIN

This system also allows prospective data collection for all cases of AKI at our centre. A daily electronic report of all AKI episodes is automatically generated that details patient location (community vs hospital-acquired), patient age and baseline creatine. These data are supplemented by the highest AKI stage, last serum creatine in stay (to assess renal recovery), length of hospital stay and whether the patient survived to hospital discharge. Comorbidity data (based on ICD-10) coding and Charlson score are also included. Approval to use anonymised data in this way was obtained from the National Information Governance Board and a Local Research Ethics Committee waived requirement of individual patient consent.
