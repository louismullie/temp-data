## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about PCOS treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and how it shapes treatment. Then, I should verify first-line lifestyle management and its limitations. Next, I will examine pharmacologic therapy for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, followed by infertility management including ovulation induction sequencing. After that, I need to consider metabolic comorbidity management, including weight-inclusive care and emerging therapies. I will then review adolescent-specific considerations, psychological screening, and long-term risk mitigation. Finally, I should confirm shared decision-making, off-label counseling, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways anchored to current guidelines [^114NTN9g] [^115vVBem].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation because treatment hinges on accurate phenotyping and exclusion of mimics; in adults, the 2023 international guideline retains the Rotterdam-based framework requiring two of three features — clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology — with mandatory exclusion of other causes, and importantly, AMH is now an acceptable alternative to ultrasound in adults, whereas in adolescents both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required and neither ultrasound nor AMH should be used for diagnosis due to poor specificity, so I need to ensure I do not overcall morphology in teens [^114NTN9g] [^111T6jk3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before addressing lifestyle; the 2023 guideline continues to prioritize healthy lifestyle as foundational for all patients, with structured, intensive, and ongoing support, and I should emphasize that even modest weight loss can improve metabolic and reproductive outcomes, though I must also be mindful of weight stigma and frame goals around health behaviors and central adiposity rather than weight alone, especially since many patients experience persistent barriers to weight change [^115gjgoa] [^113to1WH].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit from lifestyle alone; evidence shows lifestyle interventions yield modest but meaningful improvements in weight, insulin resistance, and ovulatory function, yet weight loss is hard to sustain and rarely exceeds about 10 kg on average, so I should set realistic expectations and pair lifestyle with pharmacotherapy when indicated, particularly for metabolic features or persistent anovulation [^114SFyXM] [^114fx1S5].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism; combined oral contraceptives remain first-line to regulate cycles and treat hirsutism/acne, with no specific formulation preferred and a general preference for lower-dose ethinyl estradiol preparations, and I need to remember that anti-androgens such as spironolactone or finasteride are second-line adjuncts for hirsutism after or when COCPs are contraindicated or insufficient, with careful contraception counseling due to teratogenicity [^117BX9Sd] [^112dxxiT].

> I will now examine infertility management, and I should double-check the ovulation induction hierarchy; letrozole is first-line for anovulatory infertility in PCOS and outperforms clomiphene for ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth, with reassuring safety data regarding fetal anomalies, while clomiphene remains an alternative, and metformin alone is less effective than letrozole or clomiphene but may be considered in select cases or combined with clomiphene to improve outcomes, always with shared decision-making and counseling about off-label status where applicable [^115tdTX5] [^111pkfgU] [^114KMFar] [^112vnaZr].

> Let me consider second-line options carefully; gonadotropins are appropriate second-line after failed oral ovulation induction, ideally using a low-dose step-up protocol with intensive ultrasound monitoring to minimize multiple pregnancy and OHSS, and I should confirm that there is no clear superiority between urinary and recombinant FSH preparations, allowing choice based on availability and cost [^1164E4zM] [^115XXdq1].

> But wait, what if oral agents and gonadotropins fail; IVF becomes third-line in the absence of an absolute IVF indication, and I need to ensure PCOS-specific precautions such as GnRH antagonist protocols, elective single embryo transfer to mitigate multiple pregnancy risk, and consideration of in vitro maturation in high OHSS risk scenarios, with explicit counseling on OHSS risk and mitigation strategies [^115fGpFR] [^112YVDhs].

> I should confirm the role of metformin beyond ovulation induction; metformin is recommended primarily for metabolic indications such as impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes risk, with modest benefits on weight and insulin resistance, and it is not routinely recommended in pregnancy despite historical use, so I need to avoid overpromising reproductive benefits and align its use with metabolic goals and patient preferences [^111GXWnL] [^115E75rj].

> Next, I should review weight management and metabolic risk through a weight-inclusive lens; structured programs, dietary patterns that patients can adhere to long term, and regular physical activity are key, and while no single diet is superior, lower glycemic load approaches may improve insulin dynamics, and for patients with obesity and significant comorbidity, anti-obesity pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery may be considered in line with general population guidance, balancing risks and reproductive goals, though anti-obesity agents for reproductive outcomes should remain in research settings pending stronger evidence [^115gjgoa] [^114DncuV] [^113drmbc].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging metabolic therapies; GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors show promise for weight and glycemic outcomes in PCOS, but high-quality PCOS-specific data are still limited, so I should frame them as evolving options within diabetes/obesity care paradigms rather than established PCOS treatments, and I must avoid extrapolating beyond current evidence [^113JbPEF] [^112U3AEh].

> Let me think about adolescents specifically; diagnosis requires both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, with ultrasound and AMH avoided, and management prioritizes education, healthy lifestyle, menstrual regulation with COCPs or progestins as appropriate, and metformin for metabolic indications, with careful attention to growth, bone health, and psychosocial needs, and I should confirm that evidence quality is low, necessitating shared decision-making with patients and families [^111T6jk3] [^114uX3F8] [^115av4dT].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook psychological health; PCOS carries a high burden of anxiety, depression, and body image distress, so routine screening and access to mental health support should be integrated into care, and I should ask explicitly about quality of life impacts and priorities to guide individualized management plans [^116myHhh] [^113awMdC].

> Next, I should review long-term risk mitigation; PCOS confers increased risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, endometrial cancer, and pregnancy complications, so lifelong metabolic surveillance, endometrial protection strategies when cycles remain irregular, and preconception counseling with early pregnancy monitoring are prudent, and I should communicate absolute risks clearly to avoid undue alarm while enabling prevention [^113awMdC].

> I should double-check the principle of shared decision-making and off-label counseling; most PCOS pharmacotherapies are off-label, so I must inform patients about evidence quality, potential benefits and harms, and engage in values-based decisions, documenting discussions and adapting plans to cultural context and resource availability [^114uX3F8] [^117ACvpo].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm diagnosis with appropriate criteria and exclusions, implement lifestyle with structured support, address menstrual and hyperandrogenic symptoms with COCPs or progestins and add anti-androgens if needed, for infertility use letrozole first-line with clomiphene or metformin combinations as appropriate, escalate to gonadotropins and then IVF with PCOS-specific precautions, layer in metformin for metabolic indications, and embed mental health screening and long-term risk surveillance throughout, adjusting to patient goals and local practice constraints [^114NTN9g] [^115vVBem].

> In summary, I should emphasize that PCOS care is lifelong, multidomain, and individualized, with lifestyle as the foundation and pharmacotherapy tailored to reproductive goals, metabolic risk, and symptom burden, and I must remain vigilant about evidence gaps, communicate uncertainties transparently, and update practice as new high-quality data emerge to reduce the persistent care gaps experienced by patients with PCOS [^114PNgub] [^113UnmPB].

PCOS management is **individualized and symptom-targeted**, with lifestyle change as first-line therapy for all [^115E75rj] and pharmacologic therapy added based on goals (cycle control, hirsutism/acne, or fertility) [^113xdTro]. Letrozole is **first-line for ovulation induction** [^115tdTX5], with clomiphene or gonadotropins as alternatives [^112YVDhs]; metformin is used for metabolic indications [^111GXWnL] and may augment ovulation induction in some cases [^112vnaZr]. Long-term care focuses on metabolic risk reduction, menstrual regulation, and reproductive planning [^113awMdC].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of PCOS management, particularly for overweight or obese patients [^113b8a35]. Even modest weight loss (**5–10%**) [^notfound] improves insulin sensitivity, menstrual regularity, androgen levels, and fertility [^114fx1S5]. Dietary interventions should emphasize **balanced, calorie-controlled eating** [^115gjgoa]; no specific diet is superior, but lower glycemic load approaches may improve insulin resistance [^114fx1S5]. Physical activity with **≥ 150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus resistance training improves insulin sensitivity, weight, and cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. Behavioral support — including counseling and education — enhances adherence and outcomes [^115gjgoa].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacologic therapy is tailored to symptoms, reproductive goals, and metabolic risk [^113xdTro].

---

### Menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism

- **Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs)**: First-line for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenic symptoms (hirsutism, acne) [^117BX9Sd]; preferred low-dose formulations [^1117rGpu].

- **Anti-androgens**: Spironolactone, finasteride, or flutamide for hirsutism/acne when COCPs are inadequate or contraindicated; require effective contraception due to teratogenicity [^112dxxiT] [^115E75rj].

- **Metformin**: For metabolic indications (insulin resistance, prediabetes); limited benefit for hirsutism/acne [^111GXWnL] [^117MaXiA].

---

### Infertility management

- **Letrozole**: First-line ovulation induction agent; superior to clomiphene citrate for ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth rates [^115tdTX5] [^111pkfgU].

- **Clomiphene citrate**: Alternative first-line agent; consider with metformin if ovulation fails with letrozole [^112YVDhs].

- **Gonadotropins**: Second-line therapy; require careful monitoring due to multiple pregnancy and OHSS risks [^115hCB4p].

- **IVF**: Third-line option; single embryo transfer preferred to reduce multiple pregnancy risk [^115fGpFR].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical options are reserved for refractory cases. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is considered for clomiphene-resistant patients, particularly when gonadotropins are contraindicated or unavailable [^113Q8ryX]. Bariatric surgery may be considered for severe obesity with failed lifestyle/medical therapy, improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes [^114DncuV].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

Long-term care addresses metabolic and reproductive risks [^113awMdC]. Metabolic screening includes periodic assessment for insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes [^notfound]. Endometrial protection involves menstrual regulation (COCPs, progestins) to reduce endometrial hyperplasia/cancer risk [^notfound]. Reproductive planning should provide counseling on fertility options and preconception care [^1166Mcnz].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies show promise but require further research. GLP-1 receptor agonists are under investigation for weight loss and metabolic improvement [^113JbPEF]. Inositol has limited evidence and is not routinely recommended [^115TGnwJ]. Bariatric surgery is increasingly considered for severe obesity with PCOS [^113JbPEF].

---

PCOS management is **multidisciplinary and individualized**, combining lifestyle, pharmacologic, and surgical options with long-term metabolic and reproductive risk management [^1166Mcnz].

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112wF9NW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Update on PCOS: consequences, challenges, and guiding treatment [^1111HKxW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis, and less-than-optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. The International PCOS network, consisting of geographically diverse international experts in PCOS as well as consumers, engaged in a multi-year international evidence-based guideline development process that was jointly sponsored by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The guideline was published in 2018 and endorsed by more than 40 international societies involved in PCOS. Translation of this evidence-based guideline to medical practice and consumer groups remains a priority. However, there remain many challenges to both understanding the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Evidence suggests that both clinicians and consumers are not satisfied with the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment options. This review summarizes the important findings for diagnosis and treatment from the guidelines and expands on recent developments in the literature since its publication. Special attention to diagnosis at the ends of the reproductive spectrum are discussed and remaining areas of controversy are noted. Additionally, the review highlights some of the remaining challenges in the understanding and management of PCOS to help guide clinicians and investigators in this perplexing condition.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114PNgub]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NTN9g]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^117ACvpo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

What Does This Mean for Those With PCOS?

Building on the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), this Guideline updates and expands clinical questions, aiming to ensure that women with PCOS receive optimal, evidence-based care that meets their needs and improves health outcomes. The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages including priority topics and outcomes for those with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their healthcare providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on improved education and awareness of healthcare professionals, partnership in care, and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered, in addition to resource availability across different settings. With effective translation, the Guideline will address priorities identified by women with PCOS, upskill healthcare professionals, empower consumers, improve care and outcomes, identify key research gaps, and promote vital future research.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

Introduction

Metabolic consequences of PCOS

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition affecting women in the reproductive age, with a prevalence of 15–20%.PCOS is characterised by biochemical and clinical features of excess androgen levels (hirsutism and acne), menstrual irregularities and polycystic morphology of the ovaries. Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, both drivers of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nearly 50% of women with PCOS progress to frank metabolic syndrome (MS).MS is defined as a group of conditions including dyslipidaemia, central adiposity, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, all predisposing to coronary heart disease and diabetes. The prevalence of MS in women with PCOS is significantly high, at around 40–50% compared with the general population. In addition, PCOS is associated with a spectrum of complications that include infertility, increased body weight, endometrial cancer and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A therapeutic approach targeting weight control is the cornerstone in the management of PCOS as effective weight loss is a positive predictor for long-term prevention of cardiometabolic disorders in PCOS. However, weight loss in women with PCOS remains challenging to achieve. Lifestyle modifications that include diet and physical activity are the first-line therapy. Still, it rarely reduces body weight by more than 10 kg, and the available evidence on lifestyle intervention is largely disappointing. Pharmacotherapies to prevent and manage metabolic comorbidities in PCOS exist; however, they are underutilised as their effectiveness remains relatively unexplored, and they are used primarily to treat other conditions such as T2DM. The surgical approach for weight loss has been an option for many decades, but it has not been used commonly as a therapeutic option in the management of PCOS. In this review, we have aimed to provide an overview of the treatment options that offer therapeutic and preventive advantages for the metabolic comorbidities in PCOS focussing on lifestyle modification, T2DM medications and bariatric surgery. The review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome as a metabolic disease [^117CpVuL]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous familial disorder affecting up to one in five women. The aetiology remains unclear, but available evidence suggests it is a polygenic disorder with epigenetic, developmental, and environmental components. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS are based on reproductive features, and the syndrome is categorized into several phenotypes that can vary by race and ethnicity. Insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and contribute to many adverse metabolic outcomes that place a substantial burden on the health of women with PCOS across their lifespan. Metabolic abnormalities like those identified in women with PCOS are also present in their female and male first-degree relatives. Overall, more emphasis is required on defining PCOS as a metabolic disorder in addition to a reproductive one. This approach could affect the management and future treatment options for the syndrome. The rationale of the current review is to identify and analyse existing evidence for PCOS as a metabolic, as well as a reproductive, disease.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: definition, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment [^113vkmcG]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in premenopausal women. Heterogeneous by nature, PCOS is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction in the absence of other specific diagnoses. The aetiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown, but mounting evidence suggests that PCOS might be a complex multigenic disorder with strong epigenetic and environmental influences, including diet and lifestyle factors. PCOS is frequently associated with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis and treatment of PCOS are not complicated, requiring only the judicious application of a few well-standardized diagnostic methods and appropriate therapeutic approaches addressing hyperandrogenism, the consequences of ovarian dysfunction and the associated metabolic disorders. This article aims to provide a balanced review of the latest advances and current limitations in our knowledge about PCOS while also providing a few clear and simple principles, based on current evidence-based clinical guidelines, for the proper diagnosis and long-term clinical management of women with PCOS.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114n5z6q]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

Infertility management pathway for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follows a stepwise medical approach beginning with diagnosis/baseline investigations and lifestyle optimization, then first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Baseline investigations include an endocrine profile, pelvic ultrasound, BMI/BP/glycemic assessment, routine preconception checks, and consideration of semen analysis and tubal patency assessment. Healthy lifestyle "should be recommended in all those with PCOS". First line medical treatment is letrozole with dose escalation, with off-label status noted and clinicians advised to inform women of evidence, concerns, and side effects; metformin and gonadotrophins have differing efficacy, cost, and multiple pregnancy profiles, and either may be an alternative first-line choice for informed women. If further treatment is required, second line is gonadotrophins with US monitoring or consideration of laparoscopic ovarian surgery. If needed, third line is in vitro fertilization with PCOS-specific protocols to minimize ovarian hyperstimulation risk and consideration of in vitro maturation; the pathway also includes repeated cycles with shared decision-making considering age and resources then to IVF.

### Which treatment options should be used in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome? [^117CME9p]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Several studies have hypothesized a peripubertal onset of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This syndrome affects different pathogenetic pathways and includes endocrine-metabolic abnormalities such as hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance. The therapeutic approaches must be addressed to individualization of therapy, considering the major clinical manifestations of the syndrome during adolescence. While the treatment of hyperandrogenism makes use of different drugs already studied, the debate about the use of insulin sensitizing drugs is still open. It will be more and more necessary to define the phenotypic and genotypic milieu in which all treatments will be as safe and effective as possible.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113JbPEF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin resistance to type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and it is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising agents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic aspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential therapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices. Incretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that could be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures have become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal of metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment targeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese women with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1 agonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic options for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological features between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is the potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in parallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115fUtFh]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

Pharmacology treatment principles in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Shared decision making between the patient (and parent/s or guardian/s, if the patient is a child) and the healthcare professional is required. An individual's characteristics, preferences and values must be elicited and considered when recommending any intervention alone or in combination. Understanding how individual adults and adolescents value treatment outcomes is essential when prescribing medications. Medical therapy is generally not approved for use specifically in PCOS and recommended use is therefore evidence-based, but off-label. Healthcare professionals need to inform adults, adolescents and their parents/s or guardian/s and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects. Regulatory agencies should consider approval of evidence-based medications for use in PCOS.

Treatment options for women with PCOS include lifestyle modification, treatment with insulin-sensitizing agents, ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (CC), FSH preparations, and possibly, GnRH antagonists. The GnRH antagonists provide a new treatment option for women with PCOS. When the goal is to restore normal ovulation, the use of GnRH antagonists is limited to the prevention of LH surges. When undertaking controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in women with PCOS, a GnRH antagonist protocol should be the protocol of choice.

### How to manage weight loss in women with obesity and PCOS seeking fertility? [^111MMm38]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Obesity exacerbates the phenotype of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) including infertility as well as reducing the efficacy and access to fertility treatments. Weight management is, therefore, a key component of treatment for women with PCOS and coexistent obesity. Many women with PCOS describe significant difficulty losing weight and treatment options are limited. The first-line treatment is lifestyle interventions though the weight loss and any impact on fertility are limited. No one dietary strategy can be preferentially recommended based on current evidence. While very low energy diets can result in significant weight loss the evidence for impact on fertility is limited. Pharmacotherapy, including a range of treatments can result in marked weight loss and there is some evidence of improved rates of conception including spontaneous and in response to assisted reproduction treatment. As with pharmacotherapy, data regarding bariatric surgery is largely from nonrandomized studies and though the significant weight loss is anticipated to improve fertility the available data prevents firm conclusions. Clinicians and patients must consider the magnitude of weight loss to be targeted as well as the anticipated fertility treatment required and the timeline of treatment when deciding upon the personalized weight loss strategy. Clinicians and patients should be confident in targeting the most appropriate treatment early in the patient's management to avoid unnecessary delays.

### Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome [^113Q8ryX]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is surrounded by many controversies. On the basis of the currently available evidence, a group of experts reached a consensus regarding the therapeutic challenges raised in these women. Before any intervention is initiated, preconceptional counseling should be provided emphasizing the importance of lifestyle, especially weight reduction and exercise in overweight women, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate (CC). Recommended second-line intervention, should CC fail to result in pregnancy, is either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS). The use of exogenous gonadotropins is associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancy, and, therefore, intense monitoring of ovarian response is required. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery alone is usually effective in less than 50% of women, and additional ovulation induction medication is required under those circumstances. Overall, ovulation induction (representing the CC-gonadotropin paradigm) is reported to be highly effective with a cumulative singleton live-birth rate of 72%. Recommended third-line treatment is in vitro fertilization (IVF). More patient-tailored approaches should be developed for ovulation induction based on initial screening characteristics of women with PCOS. Such approaches may result in deviation from the above mentioned first-line, second-line, or third-line ovulation strategies in well-defined subsets of patients. Metformin use in PCOS should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance. Based on recent data available in the literature, the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended. Insufficient evidence is currently available to recommend the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors for routine ovulation induction. Even singleton pregnancies in PCOS are associated with increased health risk for both the mother and the fetus.

### Polycystic ovarian syndrome management options [^115oQmrm]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction. Hirsutism and elevated free testosterone levels are the most consistent signs of the androgen excess. Irregular, infrequent, or absent menses and infertility are symptoms of ovulatory dysfunction. Obesity is also a feature of this syndrome and contributes to associated metabolic abnormalities. Lifestyle modification should be the first treatment and is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms. The ovulatory infertility associated with PCOS can be overcome in most cases with oral (clomiphene citrate or letrozole) or injectable (gonadotropins) agents. Surgical intervention is reserved for cases resistant to medical management.

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

Method of Development of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society deemed the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force followed the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group with expertise in development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase "we recommend" and the number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase "we suggest" and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that ⊕○○○ denotes very low quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○, low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○, moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕, high quality. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that panelists considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the panelists and their values and preferences; therefore, these remarks are considered.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — letrozole recommendations specify that letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS, with no other infertility factors. The use of letrozole is still off- label in many countries. Letrozole should not be given where there is any possibility of a pre-existing pregnancy, though there is no evidence for increased teratogenicity compared to other ovulation induction agents.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female reproductive disorder that often manifests during adolescence and is associated with disruptions in health-related quality of life. Prompt evaluation and clinical support after diagnosis may prevent associated complications and optimize overall health management. This article incorporates the most recent evidence and consensus guidelines to provide an updated review of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management strategies for adolescents with this complex condition. We will review the recent international guidelines on PCOS; because the diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial, management of this condition is inconsistent. In 2019, PCOS remains a common, yet neglected, condition, in part, because of the lack of agreement around both diagnosis and management.

### How to manage weight loss in women with obesity and PCOS seeking fertility? [^113NKrwr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Obesity exacerbates the phenotype of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) including infertility as well as reducing the efficacy and access to fertility treatments. Weight management is, therefore, a key component of treatment for women with PCOS and coexistent obesity. Many women with PCOS describe significant difficulty losing weight and treatment options are limited. The first‐line treatment is lifestyle interventions though the weight loss and any impact on fertility are limited. No one dietary strategy can be preferentially recommended based on current evidence. While very low energy diets can result in significant weight loss the evidence for impact on fertility is limited. Pharmacotherapy, including a range of treatments can result in marked weight loss and there is some evidence of improved rates of conception including spontaneous and in response to assisted reproduction treatment. As with pharmacotherapy, data regarding bariatric surgery is largely from nonrandomized studies and though the significant weight loss is anticipated to improve fertility the available data prevents firm conclusions. Clinicians and patients must consider the magnitude of weight loss to be targeted as well as the anticipated fertility treatment required and the timeline of treatment when deciding upon the personalized weight loss strategy. Clinicians and patients should be confident in targeting the most appropriate treatment early in the patient's management to avoid unnecessary delays.

### Lean polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): an evidence-based practical approach [^112QrNzA]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age. Common features include menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology although the presentation can be heterogeneous. Insulin resistance is thought to be responsible for the hormonal and metabolic derangements observed. PCOS has two phenotypes, overweight/obese and lean, the latter being a much less common presentation of the syndrome.

Aims

The aim of the present review is to summarise cardinal features, and to devise diagnostic and treatment algorithms for lean PCOS based on recent literature.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar using search terms such as 'lean polycystic ovary syndrome' OR 'lean polycystic ovarian syndrome' OR 'lean PCOS' OR 'lean polycystic ovary disease' OR 'lean polycystic ovarian disease' OR 'lean PCOD' OR 'hyperandrogenism' AND 'low BMI OR 'low body mass index' to identify potential articles to be included in the review. Citation searches were subsequently performed in order to find relevant literature.

Results

Hormonal, metabolic and haematological profiles were altered in lean women with PCOS compared to healthy counterparts. However, the derangements were either comparable or less obvious compared to obese women with the syndrome. Insulin resistance seemed inherent in PCOS independent of obesity. Treatment options included weight maintenance, restoration of ovulation with insulin-sensitizers such as metformin, relief of symptoms such as hirsutism, acne and menstrual dysfunction, and assisted reproductive technologies in refractory cases, all of which showed promising results. The literature with evidence on lean PCOS is of low to moderate quality and there are still some uncertainties in the evidence base.

Conclusion

Carefully designed randomised controlled trials are required to confirm findings of previous studies in lean PCOS and to consolidate diagnostic and management algorithms proposed in this review. This paper will aid health professionals to improve their clinical approach in managing lean women with PCOS.

### Impact of metformin on the clinical and metabolic parameters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114ykfim]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine condition that affects women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of up to 20%.PCOS is characterised by biochemical and clinical features of excess androgen, menstrual irregularities and polycystic ovarian morphology. In PCOS, high insulin contributes to excess ovarian androgen production, and insulin enhances steroid hormone release in the ovaries. High androgen levels are the drive for hirsutism and reduced fertility levels in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS have a significantly higher rate of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, nearly 70% of women with PCOS will develop the metabolic syndrome (MS), characterised by the constellation of dyslipidaemia, central adiposity, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, all predisposing factors to coronary heart disease and diabetes. A therapeutic approach targeting weight loss and improving insulin resistance is the cornerstone in managing PCOS and preventing its related complications, however, significant weight loss is still challenging in PCOS. Lifestyle intervention is the first-line therapy causing significant though minimal weight reduction. Pharmacological options for managing PCOS exist; however, their actual impact in clinical practice is still relatively unexplored. Metformin is a member of the biguanide family primarily used to manage T2DM. Metformin is also widely used in managing women with PCOS; it reduces androgen levels by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing the cardiometabolic risks associated with hyperinsulinemia in PCOS.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is diagnosed in up to 10% of women attending gynaecology clinics, but the prevalence in the population as a whole is unclear. PCOS has been associated with hirsutism, infertility, acne, weight gain, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and endometrial hyperplasia.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: finasteride, flutamide, metformin, spironolactone, cyproterone acetate-ethinylestradiol (co-cyprindiol), interventions to achieve weight loss, ketoconazole, and mechanical hair removal.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that most likely represents a heterogenous disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. Recent findings suggest PCOS has substantial metabolic sequelae, including risk of diabetes and possibly cardiovascular disease, and that primary treatment should focus on metabolic sequelae.

### Treatment of obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome: a position statement of the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society [^113b8a35]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize current evidence on lifestyle management (dietary, exercise, or behavioral interventions) of obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to indicate gaps in knowledge, and to review the medical and surgical alternatives for weight management.

Design

Expert panel appointed by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AEPCOS Society) to review the literature and draft the initial report after a consensus process via electronic communication. The initial report was reviewed and critiqued by all expert panel members and the AEPCOS Society Board of Directors and modified based on their comments.

Conclusion(S)

Lifestyle management should be used as the primary therapy in overweight and obese women with PCOS for the treatment of metabolic complications. For reproductive abnormalities, lifestyle modification may improve ovulatory function and pregnancy. Data are preliminary for improvement in pregnancy and live-birth rates, and further research is needed. There is currently no evidence that modifying dietary macronutrient composition offers additional benefits over conventional dietary approaches for weight loss, and further research is needed. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise offers additional benefits to dietary energy restriction for reproductive features of PCOS.

Lifestyle modification intervention

Over 50% of the women with PCOS are overweight or obese, with a higher propensity of central adiposity, due primarily to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in this population. Increased visceral fat deposition is associated with increased severity of PCOS and plays a pivotal role in high serum androgen production and reduced serum levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Obese women with PCOS are more prone to an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities and severe cardiovascular conditions compared with women without PCOS. Even though the aetiology of PCOS not fully understood, PCOS has been associated strongly with obesity and insulin resistance. Given the links between obesity, insulin resistance and increased cardiometabolic risk factors, treating obesity is a priority, especially in obese women with PCOS.

In many cases, this can be achieved by modest weight loss and lifestyle modification interventions, including dietary management and physical activity, are strongly recommended, particularly for those who are categorised as prediabetes as this may delay the onset of T2DM. The recent international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS has emphasised the importance of physical activity and diet for managing PCOS-related symptoms and to prevent its metabolic complications. Weight reduction can benefit obese women with PCOS through reduced adiposity, androgen levels, insulin levels, improved ovulatory function, increased fertility and a reduction in the overall risk of CVD. Given the strong link between obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic problems, a low glycaemic index diet would seem to be an attractive option for weight reduction; however, no one single diet has proven to be better than another, although the trials to date have been small, of limited duration and heterogeneous in their design. A small study of women with PCOS assigned for a ketogenic, low-carbohydrate diet for 6 months reported significant improvement in their weight, hormonal profiles and fertility. Others have shown that a very modest reduction of carbohydrate intake from 55% to 41% of total energy reflected in favourable metabolic effects and a preferential decrease in fat mass among women with PCOS. A systematic review of relevant studies found that low carbohydrate diets improved the hormonal profile, reduced insulin levels and helped resume ovulation in women with PCOS. A survey of 14 women with PCOS administered a low ketogenic Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks, reported a significant reduction in serum insulin, blood glucose level and average weight loss of 9.4 kg. Previous studies showed that lifestyle modifications could be associated with significant improvement in symptoms of PCOS. A study assessing the effect of isocaloric diets on insulin sensitivity and insulin levels has demonstrated that moderate reduction in carbohydrate intake reduced fasting and challenged insulin levels amongst women with PCOS. A recent meta-analysis assessed the effect of different dietary compositions on metabolic and reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS that showed there was more significant weight loss with monounsaturated fat, improved menstrual problems with a low glycaemic index diet and a more substantial reduction in insulin resistance. Physical activity usually acts as an adjunct to dietary intervention for the management of PCOS. A systematic review evaluating exercise intervention in PCOS reported that moderate-intensity regular aerobic exercise over a short period of time significantly improved menstrual regularity and ovulation and contributed to reduced weight and insulin resistance in young and obese women with PCOS. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis that examined the effects of lifestyle interventions including exercise only or in combination with diet and behavioural therapy in women with PCOS, showed significant effects of exercise on the metabolic, anthropometric and cardiorespiratory outcomes.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lifestyle and weight management — In those with higher weight, weight management can be associated with significant clinical improvements and key points need to be considered including a lifelong focus on prevention of further weight gain, a tailored energy deficit when weight loss is the goal, the value of improvement in central adiposity or metabolic health, and the need for ongoing assessment and support. Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight stigma when discussing lifestyle management with women with PCOS. Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management, in the context of structured, intensive, and ongoing clinical support, appears equally effective in PCOS as in the general population. In those who are not overweight, in the adolescent and at key life points, the focus should be on healthy lifestyle and the prevention of excess weight gain. Although insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in PCOS, clinically available insulin assays are of limited clinical relevance and should not be used in routine care.

There is limited evidence with uncertain results, on the effect of inositol on ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Side effects and safety are not known for inositol. Women need to be aware that these agents can have limited regulation with variable dose, quality, consistency, and combination with other agents. Women's personal goals and preferences should be considered when discussing complimentary therapies.

### Metformin or oral contraceptives for adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome: a meta-analysis [^115av4dT]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common disease. There is limited evidence to support various treatment choices. This leads to variable treatment practices.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of metformin versus oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the treatment of PCOS in adolescents aged 11 to 19 years.

Data Sources

We performed literature searches through Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and gray literature resources, up to January 29, 2015.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts of identified citations, assessed full text eligibility, and extracted information from eligible trials.

Results

Four RCTs met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reviewed evidence came from 170 patients. Overall, OCP treatment resulted in modest improvement in menstrual cycle frequency (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.27, P < .01, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.33 to -0.21) and mild reduction of acne scores (WMD = 0.3, P = 0.02, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.55). While metformin resulted in greater BMI reduction (WMD = -4.02, P < .01, 95% CI -5.23 to -2.81) it was associated with decreased dysglycemia prevalence (risk ratio: 0.41, P = 0.02, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.86) and improved total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. Metformin and OCPs were similar in terms of impact on hirsutism.

Conclusions and Limitations

Current evidence is derived from very low to low quality evidence. Therefore, treatment choice should be guided by patient values and preferences while balancing potential side effects. Future high quality RCTs are needed to address several questions for the treatment of adolescents with PCOS.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities [^111NnsYL]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic goals

Difficulty in losing weight, irregular menses, infertility, and excessive hair growth were the most important health problems reported by patients with polycystic ovary syndrome in an international survey. These problems should therefore represent the main targets for therapeutic intervention, although priority setting partnerships are still needed to help focus research priorities. Existing drug treatments have not been licensed specifically for polycystic ovary syndrome and are used off-label to target symptoms. Also, previous studies have not emphasised health related quality of life measures when evaluating response to treatment. An ideal treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome should look at the health risks, reduce key processes in the pathogenesis of the disease, and be responsive to the symptom profile and needs of the individual. Where relevant, treatments should reduce clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, restore ovulatory cycles and fertility, normalise the length of the menstrual cycle, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce weight and cardiometabolic risk, and improve condition specific quality of life.

Weight-inclusive care and stigma in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight-inclusive practices which promote acceptance of and respect for body size diversity and focus on improvement of health behaviours and health outcomes for people of all sizes. In PCOS this includes acknowledging that whilst higher weight is a risk factor for PCOS and its complications, it is only one indicator of health and broader factors should be assessed, asking permission to discuss and measure weight and using strategies to minimize discomfort (e.g., blind weighing), recognizing that the terms "overweight" and "obese/obesity" can be stigmatizing with suggested alternatives including "higher weight", explaining how weight information will be used to inform risks, prevention and treatment, ensuring appropriate equipment is available for women of all sizes, offering options of weight-centric care or weight-inclusive care tailored to individual goals and preferences, and offering all women best practice assessment, treatment and support regardless of weight. Increasing awareness of weight stigma among family members of women and adolescents with PCOS should be considered.

### When should an insulin sensitizing agent be used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome? [^111zj88q]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The attendant hyperinsulinaemia is also thought to contribute to the mechanism of anovulation in PCOS. Both metabolic and reproductive abnormalities are amplified by obesity and the treatment of first choice for overweight or obese women with PCOS is modification of diet and lifestyle. Nevertheless, changes in diet and exercise are, for many subjects, not easy to sustain and there seems an obvious place for insulin sensitizing agents in management of both reproductive and metabolic disturbances. Of the available agents affecting insulin sensitivity, metformin has been the most widely used but despite an enormous literature reporting beneficial effects on reproductive, cutaneous and metabolic manifestations of PCOS, its efficacy is unproven apart from in those subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. Metformin at least has an assured safety record whereas both efficacy and safety of other insulin sensitizing agents in women of reproductive age, such as thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide analogues, remains to be established.

Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

"Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Conditional recommendations are reflected using the terms "could" or "should/could consider" which are used where evidence quality was limited or available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harms was unclear. "Should not" applies when there is a lack of appropriate evidence, or harms may outweigh benefits.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — factors affecting weight gain note that healthcare professionals and women with PCOS could consider there is a lack of consistent evidence of physiological or behavioural lifestyle differences related to weight when compared to women without PCOS, and that many women with PCOS may have underlying mechanisms driving greater longitudinal weight gain and higher BMI which may underpin greater challenges with weight management, highlight the importance of lifelong healthy lifestyle strategies and prevention of excess weight gain, and assist in forming realistic, tailored lifestyle goals.

Management of Infertility

Overall LSTs were considered the optimal first-line treatment for anovulation in women with PCOS and infertility for 3 to 6 months. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline considered pharmacological ovulation induction a contraindication in obese women (body mass index > 35 kg/m²) with PCOS. Three CPGs recommended the use of letrozole as the primary method of pharmacological ovulation induction. This represented a shift in evidence compared to older CPGs such as the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guideline, which considered it optional, and the Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline which recommended clomiphene citrate as first-line treatment. Most CPGs recommended ovulation induction with gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling as a second-line treatment. The Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline recommended ovulation induction with a follicle stimulating hormone starting dose of 37.5 to 50 IU/day used up to a 14-day stimulation period with close ovulation monitoring and a maximum of 6 stimulation cycles. In vitro fertilization was suggested as last option with a preference for gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocols and metformin to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although there were limited recommendations on the best in vitro fertilization protocols in women with PCOS.

Management strategies for overweight and obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who desire fertility should include weight loss. Even a small reduction in body weight can improve ovulatory function and pregnancy rate and reduce adverse obstetric outcomes. New data suggest that letrozole should be considered as the new first-line medical treatment of anovulatory infertility in PCOS over clomiphene citrate. Second-line treatments for anovulatory infertility include in vitro fertilization, gonadotropins, or ovarian drilling.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111PxC7f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Letrozole is the preferred first line pharmacological infertility therapy, with clomiphene in combination with metformin; gonadotrophins or ovarian surgery primarily having a role as second line therapy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be offered, potentially with in vitro maturation, as third line therapy, where other ovulation induction therapies have failed and in the absence of an absolute indication for IVF in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Given the underlying risk for pregnancy complications in PCOS, single embryo transfer should be preferred.

Overall, evidence in PCOS is low to moderate quality. Based on high prevalence and significant health impact, greater priority, education, models of care, funding, and research are recommended. Guideline translation will be extensive including multilingual education outputs and evidence-based resources for consumers (the ASKPCOS app), healthcare professionals and policy makers.

The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however a clear process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available by contacting the author for correspondence online. The translation program will be free and internationally accessible, building on the existing range of codesigned resources including the patient focused, evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), used in 186 countries and based on a rigorously developed question prompt list. Multi-faceted patient codesigned resources will aim to enhance health literacy with comprehensive PCOS-related health information available in multiple formats and in 15–20 languages. Internationally accessible resources include education modules for healthcare professionals at different career stages and disciplines, healthcare professional accredited courses, practice resources and tools, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources that will be available online. Importantly, the Guideline and translation of the Guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, of accessible evidence-based information and of improved multi-disciplinary support. Ultimately, this international initiative may serve as an exemplar for large scale collaborative engagement, pooling of resources, avoidance of duplication and inconsistency with consensus-based statements, and codesign of best quality consistent guidelines with processes for local adaption and healthcare impact. Key elements include extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation, consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation, and evaluation. We sincerely thank the partner and collaborating organizations, consumer groups and members of the GDGs for their substantive commitment to the international partnership to optimize health outcomes for women with this common, heterogeneous, and much neglected condition.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112dxxiT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: −1.59 [−3.06, −0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (−2.11 μU/ml [−3.97, −0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and −1.12 [−1.44, −0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (−0.93, [−3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [−0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (−3.48 [−4.58, −2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (−0.30 ng/ml [−0.50, −0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (−0.29 nmol/l [−0.52, −0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full guideline and the technical reports and outlined in Figure 1 and available at. The process aligns with all elements of the AGREEII tool for quality guideline assessment. This involved extensive evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework covering evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice. Categories include evidence-based or consensus recommendations with accompanying clinical practice points (Table 1).

Terms include "should", "could", and "should not", are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and quality of the evidence and are independent descriptors reflecting the judgement of the multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG), including consumers. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms, and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. "Could" is used where either the quality of evidence was limited or the available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harm was unclear. "Should not" is used where there is either a lack of appropriate evidence, or the harms may outweigh the benefits.

The GRADE of the recommendation is determined by the guideline development group based on comprehensive structured consideration of all elements of the GRADE framework, including desirable effects, undesirable effects, balance of effects, resource requirements and cost effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility and includes:

* Conditional recommendation against the option;
 Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison;
* Conditional recommendation for the option;
Strong recommendation for the option.

Quality of the evidence is categorized according to: the number and design of studies addressing the outcome; judgments about the quality of the studies and/or synthesized evidence, such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and any other considerations that may influence the quality of the evidence; key statistical data; and classification of the importance of the outcomes (Table 2). The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence in an estimate of the effect to support a particular recommendation and was largely determined by the expert evidence synthesis team.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^115E75rj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, treatment of PCOS in general populations is often symptom‐ and context‐dependent, but generally comprises lifestyle management as first‐line therapy, including diet modification and physical activity. Education and counselling around the chronic nature of the condition and psychological support are also vital aspects of management for women with PCOS. Pharmacotherapies are commonly used to manage PCOS, depending on individual needs and symptoms. Cosmetic light therapy, along with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is the recommended treatment for management of menstrual irregularities and hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism and acne, with anti‐androgens as second‐line pharmacological treatments when COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. For individuals seeking fertility treatment, ovulation‐induction agents such as letrozoleare recommended as first‐line therapy. For metabolic features of PCOS including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dysglycemia, alongside lifestyle modification, metformin is recommended first line, and in some cases, glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists or metabolic surgery. Given the broad spectrum of symptoms and outcomes associated with PCOS, a tailored combination of lifestyle and pharmacological therapies is essential to improve quality of life and mitigate comorbidities in women with PCOS.

In pregnancy, however, the treatment of PCOS can present unique challenges. While lifestyle and/or weight management remain important and can improve pregnancy outcomes, the physiological demands of pregnancy, combined with the metabolic and endocrine disturbances characteristic of PCOS, often necessitate additional pharmacological support. However, pharmacological options used to manage PCOS in non‐pregnant individuals are unsuitable during pregnancy including the COCP and GLP‐1 receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide), due to contraindications and safety concerns. Anti‐androgens, including spironolactone and finasteride, are contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Similarly, thiazolidinediones, which can improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic features pre‐pregnancy, have raised concerns around growth restriction and teratogenicity, precluding their use in pregnancy. While metformin has been used in pregnancy for decades, and offers a potentially safe pharmacological option for managing metabolic disturbances in PCOS pregnancies, its efficacy and long‐term safety have been questioned. Potential benefits include preventing early pregnancy loss and limiting excess GWG in PCOS pregnancies, but there are conflicting reports regarding its efficacy for other outcomes such as GDM, preterm birth, and preeclampsia. Furthermore, concerns regarding its long‐term safety, particularly for offspring metabolic health, continue to fuel debate and contribute to inconsistent clinical recommendations around the use of metformin during pregnancy.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — clomiphene citrate could be used in preference to metformin to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates; the risk of multiple pregnancy is increased with clomiphene citrate (alone or with metformin) and therefore cycles may require ultrasound monitoring; clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than clomiphene citrate alone to improve ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates and could be used rather than metformin alone to improve live birth rates, with monitoring of combined cycles equivalent to clomiphene citrate alone.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — assessment and risk management states that clinical measurement of insulin resistance is not currently recommended, and management should address broad health domains with a lifelong health plan; PCOS should be considered a high‑risk condition in pregnancy with monitoring, and an increased premenopausal endometrial cancer risk should be recognized while absolute risks remain low. Specifically, "clinical measurement is not currently recommended", "assessment and management should address reproductive, metabolic, cardiovascular, dermatologic, sleep, and psychological features", "A lifelong health plan is recommended", "PCOS should be considered a high-risk condition in pregnancy with women identified and monitored", and "An increased premenopausal risk of endometrial cancer should also be recognized, whilst absolute risks remain low".

Dr. Hoeger has a research interest in the management of PCOS and established the PCOS Lifestyle Center at the University of Rochester for which she currently serves as Director, focusing on nutrition, lifestyle change and medication in the management of PCOS. The views expressed are those of Dr. Kathleen Hoeger and do not necessarily reflect opinions, views, or official policy of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Women's Health.
- Evidence of excess male type hormones, noted either by having elevated blood hormones levels of androgens or excess growth of facial or body hair in areas where men usually have hair
- Irregular periods with menstrual cycles more than 35 days apart or eight or fewer menstrual cycles per year not due to hormonal birth control
- The presence of a high number of eggs on an ovarian ultrasound. How is PCOS treated. There is no single treatment that works for all women with PCOS. Typically, treatment is used to relieve specific PCOS symptoms.

For example, oral contraceptives can be used to manage menstrual cycles. Certain medications may also help control unwanted hair growth. Laser hair removal or electrolysis is also helpful in some cases. Metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, are linked to an increased risk of diabetes and treatment with medicine like metformin may be helpful. Lifestyle modification
- which includes dietary changes and physical activity, may improve certain aspects of PCOS and is still considered a primary treatment. Fertility concerns are usually best treated with medicines that promote ovulation. Is it possible to reduce the risk of developing PCOS. Right now, we don't have proof that any certain treatment can stop the development of PCOS since the risk of developing PCOS is likely predetermined by genetics. Avoiding weight gain, particularly in adolescence and early adulthood, may help reduce the risk of developing PCOS symptoms. What are some misconceptions about PCOS.

The most common misconception is that PCOS is caused by, or associated with, ovarian cysts. Even though "cystic" is in the name, cysts are not the cause or a symptom of PCOS. Another misconception is that patients with PCOS will never conceive. This is not true. Many women with PCOS can become pregnant on their own, without intervention. Those with fertility concerns often conceive successfully with treatment.
