## Question

PFT abnormalities after bronchodilator therapy required for diagnosis of COPD according to GOLD 2024 criteria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pulmonary function test (PFT) abnormalities required after bronchodilator therapy to diagnose COPD per GOLD 2024 criteria, and to synthesize a concise, expert version of that reasoning with explicit citations and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic anchor in GOLD and the precise post-bronchodilator spirometric threshold. Then, I should verify how severity is graded and whether it also relies on post-bronchodilator values. Next, I will review why GOLD insists on post-bronchodilator testing rather than pre-bronchodilator, and whether that still holds in current practice. After that, I need to check what to do when results are borderline and how often to repeat testing. I will then consider alternative or adjunctive PFT abnormalities beyond the FEV1/FVC ratio, including lung volumes, DLCO, and flow-volume morphology. Finally, I should distinguish COPD from pre-COPD and PRISm, integrate the clinical context and ABE assessment, and summarize the diagnostic algorithm succinctly with the exact thresholds and grading system, while double-checking that I have not inadvertently misstated any criterion.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor. According to GOLD 2024/2025, COPD is confirmed when post-bronchodilator spirometry demonstrates persistent airflow limitation defined as FEV1/FVC less than 0.70, and this single ratio is the mandatory diagnostic abnormality that must be present after bronchodilation to establish COPD in the appropriate clinical context, so I should not understate that requirement or imply any flexibility around it [^113eVjqR] [^113WdzSb] [^116QiQbz].

> Hold on, I should verify how severity is staged because I initially thought severity might be based on pre-bronchodilator FEV1; wait, let me verify that. GOLD uses post-bronchodilator FEV1 to grade severity once the diagnosis is established by a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.70, with GOLD 1 defined as FEV1 at least 80% predicted, GOLD 2 as 50–79%, GOLD 3 as 30–49%, and GOLD 4 as less than 30% predicted, so severity grading indeed relies on post-bronchodilator values, not pre-bronchodilator values [^114ca6LT] [^113eRQyK] [^1122K9RQ].

> Next, I should review why GOLD requires post-bronchodilator testing rather than accepting pre-bronchodilator obstruction. The rationale is to document non-fully reversible airflow limitation, which is a hallmark of COPD, and to avoid misclassification from transient bronchomotor tone or variability; importantly, GOLD now notes that assessing the degree of bronchodilator reversibility to distinguish COPD from asthma or to predict treatment response is not recommended, and patients do not need to stop inhaled therapy before follow-up spirometry, which I should emphasize to avoid unnecessary medication holds in routine care [^113d5NE3] [^117UbHaF] [^115TQgF8].

> I need to ensure I address borderline results and repeat testing. If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is between 0.60 and 0.80, GOLD advises repeating spirometry on a separate occasion because biological variability can shift results near the threshold; if the initial post-bronchodilator ratio is less than 0.60, it is very unlikely to normalize above 0.70 on repeat, which supports diagnostic confidence without delay in that scenario [^117As1no] [^116zeTJ1].

> Let me consider additional PFT abnormalities that, while not required for diagnosis, refine understanding of disease phenotype and severity. Gas trapping with increased residual volume and static hyperinflation with increased TLC are common in COPD and can be quantified by plethysmography; reduced DLCO indicates emphysema or vascular involvement; and a concave expiratory limb on the flow-volume curve reflects small-airway disease and may correlate with symptoms even when FEV1 is preserved, so I should note these as supportive abnormalities rather than diagnostic criteria [^1118VV6T] [^1162n8D6] [^117657ML].

> But wait, what if the patient has symptoms and risk factors but the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is not less than 0.70. In that case, I should distinguish pre-COPD, defined by symptoms and/or structural or functional abnormalities without airflow obstruction on post-bronchodilator spirometry, from PRISm, defined by FEV1/FVC at least 0.70 but FEV1 less than 80% predicted after bronchodilation; both entities carry increased risk of future obstruction and adverse outcomes, so I need to ensure longitudinal follow-up and risk-factor modification even when COPD is not yet diagnosed [^111wUrxc] [^113sCTsi] [^112Hwenb].

> I should double-check the clinical context and initial assessment framework. Diagnosis requires compatible symptoms and/or risk-factor exposure plus confirmatory post-bronchodilator obstruction; once confirmed, initial assessment should integrate post-bronchodilator FEV1 for prognosis, symptom burden by mMRC or CAT, exacerbation history, blood eosinophils, and comorbidities, and then categorize risk using the GOLD ABE tool, which replaces the older ABCD grouping and guides pharmacologic choices and nonpharmacologic care [^114cNF8H] [^1136DXyW] [^115iAHYK].

> Let me summarize the diagnostic algorithm succinctly to ensure nothing is missing. Suspect COPD based on symptoms and risk factors; obtain spirometry; if pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is less than 0.70, proceed to post-bronchodilator testing; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is less than 0.70, COPD is confirmed and severity is graded by post-bronchodilator FEV1; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is 0.70 or higher, COPD is not diagnosed, but consider pre-COPD or PRISm and arrange follow-up if clinical suspicion remains high; if the initial post-bronchodilator ratio is borderline, repeat spirometry to confirm persistence before labeling the diagnosis [^115Dzv9i] [^113eVjqR] [^117As1no].

> Finally, I should confirm the exact thresholds and grading so there is no ambiguity. The mandatory abnormality after bronchodilator therapy is a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70, and once that is present, severity is staged by post-bronchodilator FEV1 as follows: GOLD 1 at least 80% predicted, GOLD 2 50–79%, GOLD 3 30–49%, and GOLD 4 less than 30% predicted, which aligns with the current GOLD schema and should be the definitive statement in the summary [^113eVjqR] [^114ca6LT] [^113eRQyK].

---

The GOLD 2024 criteria require a **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70** [^113eVjqR] to confirm persistent airflow limitation and diagnose COPD [^113WdzSb]. This must be measured after administering a short-acting bronchodilator [^117Dpbtm] to ensure the obstruction is not fully reversible [^117Dpbtm]. Severity is graded by post-bronchodilator FEV1 (% predicted) [^113eRQyK] [^114ca6LT], and **reversibility testing is not required** for diagnosis or treatment decisions [^113d5NE3] [^117UbHaF]. If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is 0.60–0.80, repeat spirometry is recommended to confirm persistence [^117As1no] [^116zeTJ1].

## Diagnostic criteria for COPD according to GOLD 2024

GOLD 2024 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways and/or alveoli, causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction [^112HQBsk]. The diagnosis of COPD **requires confirmation of persistent airflow limitation** [^113WdzSb] by spirometry [^114bjVtx].

---

## Spirometric criteria for COPD diagnosis

Spirometry is the **gold standard** for diagnosing COPD [^112r5YCp]. The key spirometric abnormality required for the diagnosis of COPD is a **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70** [^113eVjqR], confirming persistent airflow limitation [^113WdzSb].

---

## Post-bronchodilator spirometry: rationale and procedure

Post-bronchodilator spirometry is essential to differentiate COPD from asthma and other reversible airway diseases [^1162n8D6]. It ensures that the airflow limitation is **persistent and not fully reversible** [^113WdzSb]. Procedure: administer a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. 400 mcg salbutamol) [^117Dpbtm] and repeat spirometry after 10–15 minutes. The diagnosis of COPD is confirmed if the **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio remains less than 0.70** [^113WdzSb].

---

## Severity grading of airflow obstruction

Once COPD is diagnosed, the severity of airflow obstruction is graded based on the **post-bronchodilator FEV1** expressed as a percentage of the predicted value [^113eRQyK]:

| **Gold grade** | **Severity** | **Post-bronchodilator fev1 (% predicted)** |
|-|-|-|
| Grade 1 | Mild | ≥ 80% |
| Grade 2 | Moderate | 50–79% |
| Grade 3 | Severe | 30–49% |
| Grade 4 | Very severe | < 30% |

---

## Clinical significance of post-bronchodilator spirometry

Post-bronchodilator spirometry is critical for:

- **Confirming persistent airflow limitation**: Ensures the obstruction is not fully reversible, distinguishing COPD from asthma [^113WdzSb] [^1162n8D6].
- **Guiding treatment decisions**: Helps determine the severity of airflow obstruction and appropriate pharmacological management [^114wdfWs].
- **Monitoring disease progression**: Allows for longitudinal assessment of lung function decline [^114JK64x].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While post-bronchodilator spirometry is the gold standard, several limitations and considerations must be acknowledged:

- **Variability in bronchodilator response**: The degree of reversibility can vary between tests, influencing diagnostic accuracy [^113zY8n4].
- **Age-related considerations**: The fixed FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70 may overdiagnose COPD in older adults and underdiagnose it in younger individuals [^116Rwkyi] [^1119hqok].
- **Need for repeat testing**: If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is borderline (0.60–0.80), repeat spirometry is recommended to confirm persistence [^117As1no] [^116zeTJ1].

---

## Summary of GOLD 2024 criteria for PFT abnormalities after bronchodilator therapy

- **Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70**: Mandatory for confirming persistent airflow limitation and diagnosing COPD [^113eVjqR] [^113WdzSb].
- **Severity grading**: Based on post-bronchodilator FEV1 (% predicted) [^113eRQyK] [^114ca6LT].
- **No requirement for reversibility testing**: Assessing the degree of reversibility is no longer recommended for diagnostic or therapeutic decisions [^113d5NE3] [^117UbHaF].
- **Repeat spirometry**: Recommended if initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is borderline (0.60–0.80) [^117As1no] [^116zeTJ1].

---

The GOLD 2024 criteria require a **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70** [^113eVjqR] to confirm persistent airflow limitation and diagnose COPD. This criterion ensures accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and effective monitoring of disease progression [^114wdfWs].

Fourth, while post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended. The degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate COPD from asthma (except when airflow limitation disappears following bronchodilators, which is incompatible with COPD), or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Accordingly, it is not necessary nor advised to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Finally, the role of screening spirometry in the general population for the diagnosis of COPD is also controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposure to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated. By contrast, in those with symptoms and/or risk factors (e.g. > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, prematurity, or other significant early-life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high, and spirometry should be considered as a method for case finding.

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Diagnosis: Forced Spirometry

A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who complains of dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease (see above), but forced vital capacity maneuver during spirometry showing the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 is needed to establish the diagnosis of COPD. The FEV 1 also serves to determine the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1, 2, 3, 4 or mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). Yet, several important aspects related to forced spirometry need to be considered here.

First, airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible is not specific for COPD. For instance, it may also be found in patients with asthma and other diseases, so the clinical context and risk factors (see above) must also be considered when establishing a diagnosis of COPD.

Pre-COPD

This term has been proposed to identify individuals of any age, with respiratory symptoms and/or other detectable structural (e.g. emphysema) and/or functional abnormalities (e.g. hyperinflation, reduced lung diffusing capacity, rapid FEV 1 decline), in the absence of airflow obstruction on post-bronchodilator spirometry (i.e. FEV 1 /FVC > 0.7). These patients may (or may not) develop persistent airflow obstruction (i.e. COPD) over time. Yet, people with pre-COPD so defined should already be considered "patients" because they suffer symptoms and/or have functional and/or structural abnormalities. Currently, there is no evidence on what the best treatment is for these patients. There urgently is a need for RCTs, both in patients with "pre-COPD" and in young people with COPD. Research in this area would benefit from pediatric-to-adult cohorts and more active case-finding strategies.

PRISm

This term has been proposed to describe individuals with FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 0.7 and FEV 1 < 80% of reference after bronchodilation. Its prevalence ranges from 7.1% to 20.3%, is particularly high in current and former smokers, and is associated with increased all-cause mortality. PRISm can transition to normal, obstructive or restrictive spirometry over time. Despite an increasing body of literature on PRISm, significant knowledge gaps remain in relation to its pathogenesis and treatment.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the leading causes of disability and death in developed countries. The prevalence of COPD is still on the rise, and costs for the health system are substantial. Airflow limitation that is not fully reversible after bronchodilator application is a key feature of COPD, and spirometry is the routine diagnostic procedure of choice recommended to diagnose COPD. However, the degree of obstruction that establishes the diagnosis of COPD is still under debate. The Global Initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defined COPD as a fixed post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC ratio) of less than 0.70. This definition is widely accepted, mainly because of its practicability.

Since the FEV1 value decreases more quickly with age than the (F)VC, the GOLD definition tends to overdiagnose COPD in the elderly. Therefore, some authors suggested using the lower limit of normal (LLN) procedure to diagnose COPD. The LLN is based on age-stratified pre-bronchodilator cut-off values of the FEV1/FVC ratio, and a value below the lower fifth percentile of an aged-matched healthy reference group is considered abnormal and consistent with a diagnosis of COPD. Multiple studies showed that application of any population-derived LLN will result in lower prevalence estimates of COPD compared to the GOLD definition in the elderly. The question remains however which method should be preferred. Another question is, whether there are other pulmonary function test variables that could improve the diagnostic accuracy of GOLD or LLN. The final question is, which definition predicts best prognosis and thus is useful for treatment decisions in COPD. To answer all three questions, the two criteria should be compared with an alternative, and acceptable reference standard, applied in the relevant domain, that is, a population suspected of COPD. An expert panel diagnosis of COPD, based on all available diagnostic information from the clinical assessment, smoking habits, and a complete pulmonary function test (PFT) could be regarded as such a reference standard.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to validate GOLD and LLN criteria against an expert panel diagnosis in patients suspected of COPD and to assess their prognostic ability.

Since, in daily practice, establishing the diagnosis of COPD is usually not based on a single PFT parameter, we furthermore assessed whether the addition of other PFT parameters to the GOLD or LLN criteria increases diagnostic accuracy compared to either definition alone.

Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic algorithm for COPD: Measure pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, classify as not COPD, with consideration to measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC if a volume responder is suspected (e.g., low FEV1 or high symptoms). If pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, interpret as flow response needing follow-up with repeat assessment, and if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, COPD is confirmed. If the pre-bronchodilator values show obstruction the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using post-bronchodilator measurements, and individuals whose pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC shows obstruction but whose post-bronchodilator ratio does not show obstruction have an increased risk of future development of COPD and should be followed closely.

### Is It time to abandon the postbronchodilator requirement in defining chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^112TXtfR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The COPDGene 2019 definition of COPD expanded the spirometric criteria for possible COPD to include both obstructive and restrictive findings, in addition to including radiology and symptoms in their classification metric. Although the spirometric guidance does not specify before or after bronchodilator, one could advocate that abnormal spirometry in either scenario is evidence of abnormality that could support intervention.

To answer the question posed in the title, is there any value in the concept of reversibility in defining the presence of "obstruction" (using whatever metric of obstruction one would like to), I would argue that the answer is no. Clinically, if a patient shows up at clinic with respiratory symptoms like dyspnea, wheezing, and cough; has a prebronchodilator spirometry that falls just below the obstructive threshold; has a postbronchodilator spirometry that shows a nonsignificant increase in their lung function that pushes them above the threshold (along with an improvement in some of their symptoms) — is one not going to make a diagnosis and treat them as if they have a chronic lower respiratory disease? Conversely, bronchodilator responsiveness, that significant improvement in lung function that follows a bronchodilator, is an important metric that has the potential to guide therapy (such as the decision to include an inhaled steroid in the treatment). Improving our approach to patients with COPD requires that we refine our approach based on current data that includes clinically meaningful outcomes.

Diagnostic criteria — spirometry confirms COPD when, in the appropriate clinical context, there is non‑fully reversible airflow obstruction defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7 post‑bronchodilation; individuals with structural or physiological abnormalities without airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 post‑bronchodilation) are labeled Pre‑COPD, and the term PRISm (Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry) has been proposed for those with a normal ratio but abnormal spirometry; subjects with Pre‑COPD or PRISm are at risk of developing airflow obstruction over time, but not all do.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining additional evaluation, including the measurement of lung volumes, diffusion capacity, exercise testing and/or lung imaging, in patients with persistent symptoms after initial treatment.

Second, if the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio is between 0.60 and 0.80 on a single spirometric measurement, this should be confirmed by repeat spirometry on a separate occasion, as in some cases the ratio may change as a result of biological variation when measured at a later interval. When the initial post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio is < 0.6, it is very unlikely to rise spontaneously above 0.7.

Third, there is a long-standing debate on whether it is better to use a fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio of < 0.7 or the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the diagnosis of COPD. GOLD favors the use of the former because it is simple and independent of reference values, since it relates to variables measured in the same individual and has been used in all the clinical trials that form the evidence base on which treatment recommendations are drawn. GOLD 2023 acknowledges that use of a fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 to define airflow obstruction may underdiagnose young adults and overdiagnose the elderly, especially in mild disease, compared to using the LLN values of FEV 1 /FVC. LLN values are based on the normal distribution and classify the bottom 5% of the healthy population as abnormal. Thus, LLN values are highly dependent on the choice of reference equations as well as race/ethnicity, and there are no longitudinal studies available validating the use of the LLN. Further, using the fixed ratio is not inferior to LLN regarding prognosis. Finally, the risk of misdiagnosis and overtreatment of individual patients using the fixed ratio as a diagnostic criterion is limited, as spirometry is only one biological measurement to establish the clinical diagnosis of COPD in the appropriate clinical context (symptoms and risk factors). Diagnostic simplicity and consistency are crucial for the busy clinician.

Diagnostic criteria — In the appropriate clinical context, spirometry confirming non‑fully reversible airflow obstruction with FEV1/FVC < 0.7 post‑bronchodilation establishes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas individuals with symptoms, structural lesions, and/or physiological abnormalities without airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 post‑bronchodilation) are labeled Pre‑COPD; the term PRISm identifies those with a preserved ratio but abnormal spirometry, and subjects with Pre‑COPD or PRISm are at risk of developing airflow obstruction over time, but not all of them do.

New Definition of COPD

The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases. Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents, focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own.

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

COPD diagnosis — A diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be considered in any patient who has dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease, but forced spirometry that demonstrates the presence of a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7 is mandatory to establish the diagnosis of COPD.

If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.6 it is very unlikely to rise spontaneously above 0.7.

### COPD diagnosis related to different guidelines and spirometry techniques [^114eV5TV]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Uniform international standards for the diagnosis of COPD are lacking. The existing major consensus statements and guidelines, regarding the diagnosis of COPD, yield differences in prevalence rates, which perhaps reflect that the different guidelines may primarily be intended for either clinical use or for screening and prevention. This complicates the organization of appropriate epidemiological surveys and comparisons between countries. Our results indicate that both the FVC and the SVC manoeuvre should be performed when persons at risk for COPD are examined. We also fully agree with the generally accepted concept to diagnose COPD based on lung function measurements after bronchodilatation.

Spirometric criteria to define airflow obstruction — For diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), GOLD uses a post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7. The fixed FEV1/FVC ratio (< 0.7) may lead to over-diagnosis in the elderly and under-diagnosis in approximately 1% of young adults, especially in mild disease. If COPD is suspected in younger adults (age < 50 years) who have a repeated fixed ratio ≥ 0.7, comparing the ratio to a predicted lower limit of normal (LLN) or using z-scores may help. LLN classifies the bottom 5% of the healthy population as abnormal, and a z-score of −1.645 is equivalent to the 5th centile. The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) found that classification using z-scores versus a fixed ratio can differ and its clinical relevance remains uncertain; GLI predicted values are based on pre-bronchodilator measurements, and postbronchodilator reference values were more successful at identifying individuals with mild COPD than prebronchodilator values in SCAPIS. There are no longitudinal studies validating LLN, and using the fixed ratio is not inferior to LLN regarding prognosis; thus, GOLD favors using the fixed ratio over LLN.

### From GOLD 0 to pre-COPD [^115JrQFj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) currently requires the demonstration of poorly reversible airflow limitation, defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7. Although some have argued that the lower limit of normal rather than a fixed value to define obstruction may be more accurate and theoretically more appropriate, recent pooled data from multiple NIH cohorts demonstrate that the fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.70 provides discrimination of COPD-related hospitalization and mortality that is equal to or better than other thresholds and the lower limit of normal.

At present, FEV 1 /FVC remains the most robust and widely available marker of airflow limitation, although it may be less sensitive than some other measures (e.g. forced oscillometry). Likewise, FEV 1 is one of the most powerful predictors of clinically relevant outcomes, including symptoms, exacerbations, and mortality. Spirometry is inexpensive and widely available, even in many developing countries. Yet, at the same time, at an individual level, FEV 1 may not fully indicate the extent of disease severity and progression, which may instead be manifest by symptoms, exacerbations, and increased risk of death. Furthermore, significant lung damage may have already occurred before abnormalities in FEV 1 are evident. Identifying individuals who will eventually develop airflow obstruction consistent with a diagnosis of COPD may enable therapeutic interventions with the potential to modify the course of disease.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive inflammatory disease involving the airways, alveoli and pulmonary vasculature, eventually leading to irreversible airflow limitation and loss of elastic recoil. The disease causes a gradual decline in expiratory flow, resulting in increased end-expiratory volume and dynamic hyperinflation. The management of COPD remains challenging, due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the disease, both in its clinical features and its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The confirmation of chronic airflow limitation using post-bronchodilator spirometry remains a major criterion for the diagnosis of COPD. Furthermore, Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) evaluation is crucial in estimating the severity of airflow limitation and until recently guided the clinical management of the disease. However, it is now widely accepted that FEV1 measurement alone does not effectively represent the functional impairment and subsequent symptomatology experienced by individual patients. A holistic patient assessment including multiple parameters is required for efficient COPD phenotyping, as some phenotypes have been shown to respond to treatment differently and have a worse prognosis. Established phenotypes include frequent exacerbators, patients with predominant emphysema, and patients with overlapping characteristics of asthma and COPD.

The notion of COPD phenotyping and individualized care has been incorporated into the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy for the diagnosis and management of the disease. In this context, a broader range of Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs), comprising of resting lung volume, capacity and airway resistance evaluations, diffusion capacity measurements and field or cardiopulmonary exercise testing provide a more comprehensive assessment of COPD patients. Notably, it has been proposed that the calculation of anthropometric indices could further facilitate the assessment of patients. Nevertheless, the optimal classification of COPD patients remains far from being considered as elucidated.

Each of these parameters highlight different physiological and functional aspects of the disease requiring targeted therapy. The goal of a personalized approach is overcoming the complexity of the disease, in an effort to optimize patient management and eventually improve clinical outcomes. The aim of the current review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the available PFTs, which can be incorporated into the primary care physician's practice, in order to enhance the efficiency of COPD management.

Definitions

The definitions and recommendations for defining COPD from the ERS consensus statement from 1995, the NICE guideline, and the GOLD guidelines were used to calculate the prevalence of COPD (table 1). In the NICE guidelines a FEV 1 < 80% of predicted value is required for a COPD diagnosis. To fulfil the COPD definition according to the ERS guidelines FEV 1 /VC has to be < 88% (men) or < 89% (women) of predicted value whereas a FEV1/VC ratio < 0.7 is required in NICE and GOLD recommendations. InNICE and GOLD guidelines only FVC is used while the best of FVC and SVC is used in the ERS recommendations. The ATS/ERS standards published in 2004 are identical to the GOLD guidelines in this context and are therefore not specifically considered.

Table 1
Definitions of COPD according to the ERS consensus statement, the NICE and the GOLD guidelines.

In the present study lung function was calculated after bronchodilatation, according to NICE, ERS and GOLD guidelines and FEV 1 /VC ratio was calculated by using only FVC or the best out of FVC and SVC. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm (reg.no. 98:044).

Spirometry — considerations in performing spirometry (Figure 2.4) state that forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. Preparation includes that spirometers should produce hard copy or have a digital display of the expiratory curve to permit detection of technical errors or have an automatic prompt to identify an unsatisfactory test and the reason for it. During performance, the pause between inspiration and expiration should be less than one second, the recording should go on long enough for a volume plateau to be reached, which may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease, and both FVC and FEV1 should be the largest value obtained from any of three technically satisfactory curves and the FVC and FEV1 values in these three curves should vary by no more than 5% or 150 mL, whichever is greater; the FEV1/FVC ratio should be taken from the technically acceptable curve with the largest sum of FVC and FEV1. For bronchodilation testing, possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short-acting beta2-agonist, 160 mcg short-acting anticholinergic, or the two combined; FEV1 should be measured 10–15 minutes after a short-acting beta2-agonist is given, or 30–45 minutes after a short-acting anticholinergic or a combination of both classes of drugs, and patients already on bronchodilator treatment, in whom spirometry is requested for monitoring purposes do not need to stop their regular treatment for spirometry. For evaluation, spirometry measurements are evaluated by comparison of the results with appropriate reference values based on age, height and sex, and the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction.

Staging the severity of airflow obstruction — method preference and prognosis: GOLD continues to recommend using the FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value to stage the severity of airflow obstruction. The ERS and ATS recommend using z-scores rather than percent predicted values to stage severity. For the time being GOLD recommends continuing to use this method to assess severity of airflow limitation. In patients with airflow obstruction a low FEV1 or a rapid decline in FEV1 is associated with increased mortality.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis — spirometric criteria and thresholds emphasize that diagnosis requires confirmation of an airflow limitation that is not fully reversible via spirometry and the history of a potentially causative exposure, with airflow limitation defined by a low post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. The threshold FEV1/FVC ratio to confirm airflow limitation is described as uncertain; a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 has traditionally been the criterion, which may identify airflow limitation more often in the elderly and less among young adults less than 45 years of age compared with a threshold based on the lower limit of normal of FEV1/FVC. The page notes that advocates for the fixed ratio argue it identifies patients with significant pulmonary pathology not detected by the lower limit of normal, whereas advocates for the lower limit of normal argue the fixed ratio is more likely to yield false-positive results.

### Persistent empiric COPD diagnosis and treatment after pulmonary function test showed No obstruction [^1139VUjz]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health-care providers often diagnose and empirically treat COPD without a confirmative pulmonary function test (PFT) or even despite a PFT that is not diagnostic of obstructive lung disease. We hypothesized that a portion of patients continue to carry a persistent empiric COPD diagnosis and receive treatment with bronchodilators and inhaled steroids after a PFT shows no obstruction.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed single PFT sessions with both spirometry and plethysmography in 1,805 subjects. We included subjects who had a normal PFT or a restrictive ventilatory defect. Persistent empiric COPD diagnosis and treatment were defined when subjects with normal PFTs or a restrictive ventilatory defect continued to carry a health-care provider COPD diagnosis or receive treatment with bronchodilators and/or inhaled glucocorticoids, respectively, after a PFT showed no obstruction.

Results

One quarter of subjects with FEV1/FVC ≥ lower limit of the normal range had nonspecific PFT abnormalities. We included 473 subjects with normal PFTs and 382 with a restrictive ventilatory defect (n = 855). Persistent empiric COPD diagnosis (60 of 855, 7% prevalence) was associated with current (odds ratio [OR] = 44.7, P < .001) and former smoking (OR = 17.3, P < .001) and older age (OR = 1.03/y, P = .005). Persistent empiric treatment (208 of 855, 24%) was associated with empiric COPD diagnosis (OR = 24.6, P < .001), female sex (OR = 1.75, P = .002), current (OR = 2.04, P = 0.040) and former smoking (OR = 1.53, P = 0.029), interstitial lung disease (OR = 2.09, P = .001), other respiratory diagnosis (OR = 3.17, P < .001), and obstructive sleep apnea (OR = 1.79, P = .006).

Conclusions

Persistent empiric COPD diagnosis was 7%, but persistent empiric treatment was common.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QXf45]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and classification — recommendation and spirometric confirmation: We suggest post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut-offs in post-bronchodilator spirometry, and post-bronchodilator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Evidence suggests that a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma; however, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging, and using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as "obstructed" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increase the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short-acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated testing in COPD patients, the absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long-term pharmacotherapy, and thus, reversibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. The Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Is It time to abandon the postbronchodilator requirement in defining chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^112JNDUK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Definitions used in clinical medicine are, by nature, dogmatic and somewhat arbitrary. They do, however, serve a useful purpose in helping to determine who may be more likely to benefit from an intervention.

A particular problem with definitions relates to thresholds. Values of any measurement close to a threshold may be within the measurement error for that value, yet one slightly above the threshold is considered "normal" and one slightly below the threshold is considered "abnormal".

Using spirometry to measure lung function and determine the presence of obstruction presents some of the challenges of these definitions and thresholds. The Global Initiative on Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommends classifying obstruction based on the post-bronchodilator spirometry, and uses a fixed ratio of the FEV 1 to the FVC of less than 0.70 to define obstruction. Other guidance recommends using the FEV 1 /FVC below the lower limit of normal to define obstruction but also states that this should be based on a postbronchodilator spirometry.

The origins of the requirement for postbronchodilator are not perfectly clear. The initial 2001 GOLD document states, "The presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1, 80% of the predicted value in combination with an FEV 1 /FVC < 70% confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible", without a reference or other justification for this statement. In general, measurement of lung function after the administration of a bronchodilator in a population results in a mean improvement of 3–4% in both the FEV 1 and the FVC, with a great deal of variability in this change. One thought is that the postbronchodilator spirometry is a more accurate and stable measure, although this, to my knowledge, has never really been demonstrated as completely being an actual effect of the bronchodilator as opposed to being a learning effect of doing a difficult set of maneuvers a second time. And although lung function decline based on postbronchodilator spirometry varies from that seen in prebronchodilator spirometry in the context of clinical trials, either measurement can be used to assess lung function decline. Another thought has been that response to a bronchodilator distinguishes asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although this has also been demonstrated to not be true.

### Bronchodilator reversibility in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: use and limitations [^113zY8n4]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

The change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator has been widely used to identify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have a potentially different disease course and response to treatment. Despite the apparent simplicity of the test, it is difficult to interpret or rely on. Test performance is affected by the day of testing, the severity of baseline lung-function impairment, and the number of drugs given to test. Recent data suggest that the response to bronchodilators is not enhanced in patients with COPD and does not predict clinical outcomes. In this Review we will discuss the insight that studies of bronchodilator reversibility have provided into the nature of the COPD, and how the abnormal physiology seen in patients with this disorder can be interpreted.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1164Dcbs]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Combined initial COPD assessment — In 2011, GOLD proposed moving from a simple spirometric grading system to a combined assessment based on the level of symptoms (mMRC or CAT™), the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4), and the frequency of previous exacerbations to guide initial pharmacological treatment, incorporating patient-reported outcomes and highlighting exacerbation prevention. The initial version relied on both the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4) and the frequency of previous exacerbations to assess exacerbation risk, but the severity of airflow obstruction was subsequently removed considering its lower precision at the individual level to predict outcomes and drive treatment decisions, while complexifying the use of the classification by clinicians. In the 2023 GOLD report, GOLD proposed a further evolution of the ABCD combined assessment tool in which the A and B groups remained unchanged and the C and D groups were merged into a single group termed "E", recognizing the clinical relevance of exacerbations; it was acknowledged that this proposal would have to be validated by appropriate clinical research.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction

- COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over the lifetime of the individual that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes

- the main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental and host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging) can also contribute

- the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency; a number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

### A STAR is born: a new approach to assessing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity [^114myXVF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The essential role of the doctor in all societies is the ability to name the illness that affects the patient; predict its natural history; and, in more recent times, intervene to reverse or ameliorate its impact. For those with what we now describe as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the last 30 years has seen significant progress in all these aspects of medical practice. After many years of debate about what to call this illness, there is now a global consensus that COPD is the best term to use, and this is reflected in its increased recognition by patients and healthcare funders. Although the precise terms used to define COPD have evolved, there is general agreement that accurate diagnosis involves the demonstration that the FEV 1 /FVC ratio is less than 0.7 or, as some advocate, below the lower limit of normal for a person of similar age, sex, and height. To exclude the individuals with significant degrees of reversible airflow obstruction, post-bronchodilator spirometry is recommended, although the need for this has been challenged.

Although COPD is defined by an abnormal ratio, the experts (myself included) who developed the current severity classifications used the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 expressed as a percent predicted (pp) to create broad groups characterized by worsening lung function. Although the ways in which individuals might find themselves in a given group are complex, the simple system that arbitrarily splits patients into mild (above 80 pp), moderate (79–50 pp), severe (49–30 pp), and very severe (below 30 pp) disease seemed to accord with clinical experience and has been shown to identify patients whose natural history of disease was different. Although no longer used as a direct guide to therapy and now renamed as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1–4, the FEV 1 grading performs better than systems based on worsening z -score.

Lung resection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — Risk factors should be identified by careful history taking including physical examination, chest radiography, and pulmonary function tests. There is consensus that all COPD candidates for lung resection should undergo a complete battery of tests, including spirometry with bronchodilator response, static lung volumes, diffusing capacity, and arterial blood gases at rest, and those at high risk for surgical complications due to poor lung function should undergo further assessment such as tests of regional distribution of perfusion and exercise capacity. The risk of postoperative complications from lung resection appears to be increased with decreased predicted postoperative pulmonary function (FEV1 or DLco < 30–40% predicted) or reduced exercise capacity (peak VO2 < 10 ml/kg/min or 35% predicted). The final decision to pursue surgery should be made after discussion with the surgeon, pulmonary specialist, primary clinician, and the patient, and surgery should be postponed if an exacerbation is present.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### The effect of a post-bronchodilator FEV / FVC [^113xuEh5]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

If physicians were largely unaware of the diagnostic implications of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7, our study suggests a role for the use of clinical decision support to help physicians diagnose COPD in a manner concordant with GOLD guidelines. Indeed, our study suggests that if this is the case, in the absence of such decision support, COPD misdiagnosis may persist with some frequency even after spirometry has been performed. Attempts to improve COPD diagnosis simply by increasing the performance of spirometry, as with recent proposals to screen for COPD with spirometry, will be less successful than imagined if spirometry interpretation — rather than just spirometry performance — represents an important limiting factor in COPD diagnosis.

On the other hand, if the discrepancy between the recommendations of GOLD guidelines and the clinical diagnosis of COPD stems from the decision on the part of clinicians to depart from these guidelines, then simply alerting physicians to the fact that the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC is less than 0.7 will have little effect on clinical practice. If this is the case, COPD diagnosis might be advanced by replacing the simple 0.7 cutoff with a more robust model of airway obstruction.

### Should the diagnosis of COPD be based on a single spirometry test? [^1174hbrY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent chronic respiratory condition that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to inhaled particles or gases. Current international clinical COPD guidelines state that spirometry is required to make the diagnosis. These guidelines state that the presence of a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) over forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio below 0.70 confirms the presence of airway obstruction in subjects who are suspected of having COPD due to cumulative exposure to risk factors (e.g. tobacco smoke, occupational or indoor air pollution) and presence of respiratory symptoms that are compatible with COPD. There is increasing evidence that the use of an age- and sex-specific lower limit of normal value for FEV 1 /FVC would be a more appropriate approach when defining airway obstruction.

In routine clinical practice, a COPD diagnosis is often based on a single initial spirometry test, and none of the above COPD guidelines recommend repeat spirometry testing when making the diagnosis of COPD, or indicate that a different result may be found if spirometry is repeated. Interestingly, although long-term variability has been reported for FEV 1 and FVC in healthy subjectsand for patients with COPD, and their year-to-year variability is reported in ERS/ATS lung function guidelines to be ± 15%, similar evidence for variability of FEV 1 /FVC is lacking.

The aim of this study was, therefore, in a sample of subjects at risk for COPD, to investigate the long-term stability of a diagnosis on the basis of a once-only measurement of post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio in primary care. We examined shifts in diagnostic category (i.e. shifts between 'obstructed' and 'non-obstructed' and vice versa) after 1 year and 2 years. We used routine spirometry data from subjects who had entered a respiratory health diagnostic and annual monitoring service offered by primary care diagnostic centres in the Netherlands.

### The effect of a post-bronchodilator FEV / FVC [^114nqwJt]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the presence of obstruction on spirometry. According to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, obstruction is present if the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV 1 /FVC) is less than 0.7, with the diagnosis of COPD recommended only in patients with obstruction. Despite this, studies comparing the performance of spirometry with the prior clinical diagnosis of COPD have found that the presence of obstruction correlates only loosely with this diagnosis. Between 30 and 60% of patients diagnosed with COPD do not have obstruction on spirometry, while between 60 and 80% of patients with obstruction have not been diagnosed with COPD.

This contrast between the presence of obstruction and the diagnosis of COPD has been attributed to the underuse of spirometry, with the assumption that physicians would diagnose COPD in accordance with GOLD guidelines if they had access to the results of spirometry. However, while such access would position physicians to arrive at an accurate diagnosis of COPD, diagnostic accuracy depends further on the proper interpretation of these results. Studies comparing the prior performance of spirometry with the clinical diagnosis of COPD have found that even after spirometry has been performed, the diagnosis of COPD still often fails to align with GOLD guidelines.

To better understand the role of spirometry in medical decision making, we sought to estimate effect of the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 on COPD diagnosis and treatment. We hypothesized that if physicians applied GOLD guidelines to spirometry to diagnose COPD, this would yield a substantial discontinuity in the probability of a COPD diagnosis at the 0.7 cutoff; COPD would generally not be diagnosed in patients with an FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 0.7 and would generally be diagnosed in patients with an FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7. Because current GOLD guidelines do not recommend that spirometry directly inform treatment decisions, though treatment decisions likely follow the establishment of a COPD diagnosis, we hypothesized that a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 would affect COPD treatment but to a lesser extent than it would affect diagnosis.

Screening and case-finding — indications and approaches: The role of screening spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD in the general population is controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposures to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated; whereas in those with symptoms or risk factors (e.g., > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, early life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high and spirometry should be considered as a method for early case finding. Both FEV1 and FVC predict all-cause mortality independent of tobacco smoking, but data to support that population-based screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or in improving COPD outcomes in patients who are identified before the development of significant symptoms is weak. An randomized controlled trial (RCT) using community case-finding reported that symptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD who received treatment by a pulmonologist and an educator had fewer respiratory events over one year and showed improvements in symptoms, lung function, and disease-specific quality of life, and these results suggest that such an approach, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic COPD results in better clinical outcomes. GOLD advocates active case finding, i.e., performing spirometry in patients with symptoms and/or risk factors, but not screening spirometry, and systematic active case-finding in a primary care setting via mail-out of a screening questionnaire was also found to be an effective way to identify undiagnosed COPD patients.

### The effect of a post-bronchodilator FEV / FVC [^112UqHCd]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) only in patients with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV 1 /FVC) less than 0.7. However the impact of this recommendation on clinical practice is unknown.

Objective

To estimate the effect of a documented post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 on the diagnosis and treatment of COPD.

Design

We used a regression discontinuity design to measure the effect of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 on COPD diagnosis and treatment.

Participants

Patients included in a national electronic health record database who were 18 years of age and older and had a clinical encounter between 2007 and 2022 in which a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC value was documented.

Main measures

An encounter was associated with a COPD diagnosis if an international classification of disease code for COPD was assigned, and was associated with COPD treatment if a prescription for a medication commonly used to treat COPD was filled within 90 days.

Results

Among 27,817 clinical encounters, involving 18,991 patients, a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 was present in 14,876 (53.4%). The presence of a documented post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 increased the probability of a COPD diagnosis by 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–10.9%) from 38.0% just above the 0.7 cutoff to 44.0% just below this cutoff. The presence of a documented post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 had no effect on the probability of COPD treatment (−2.1%, 95% CI −7.2 to 3.0%).

Conclusions

The presence of a documented post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 had only a small effect on the diagnosis of COPD and no effect on corresponding treatment decisions.

Introduction — global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states that the GOLD Report provides a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with COPD, with treatment objectives organized into two groups that relieve and reduce the impact of symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse health events in the future. The original FEV1-based staging system is described, but at an individual level FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of the severity of breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment, and risk of exacerbation. The report highlights that there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed for routine clinical practice, enabling an assessment system that draws together the impact of symptoms and the patient's risk of a serious adverse health event and can be used in any clinical setting anywhere in the world to move COPD treatment toward individualized medicine.

Putting It All Together?

Conceptually, one step forward would be to combine symptoms, lung function, and CT assessments to try to stage people with respect to risk for COPD development. A recent publication from the COPDGene research group suggests exactly this and puts forward a new proposed disease-classification scheme for COPD. According to this proposal, individuals can be classified using a combination of symptoms, abnormal spirometric results, and abnormal CT features as possible, probable, and definite COPD. It should be noted that this system would both classify some individuals without spirometrically defined obstruction as having possible or probable COPD while reclassifying others with spirometrically defined obstruction into possible COPD. At this point, however, the clinical utility of classifying patients in this manner is unknown. Further prospective data will be needed to understand disease evolution from these respective categories as well as response to therapies.

### Estimating the U.S. prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry: the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 [^115SWNoe]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Spirometry measurements can be used to define COPD, specifically the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. Accordingly, the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) standards for the diagnosis and management of patients with COPD state that spirometry should be performed in all patients suspected of COPD and is necessary for diagnosis, assessment of disease severity, and monitoring disease progression.

Recent estimates based on self-reported data show that 15 million Americans aged 18 years and older have been diagnosed with COPD. Estimating the prevalence of COPD can, however, be challenging and may vary based on the diagnostic method (e.g. self-report or spirometry), the criteria used for defining COPD (e.g. GOLD, ATS/ERS), and the age group analyzed (e.g. 18 years and older or 40 years and older). Estimates will also vary if pre-bronchodilator or post-bronchodilator spirometry results are used with the GOLD guidelines advocating the use of post-bronchodilator spirometry while the ATS/ERS guidelines support the use of pre-bronchodilator spirometry. The GOLD criteria with the fixed cutoff may be simpler to use in daily clinical practice, however, studies suggest that it overestimates disease burden in the elderly. While the ATS/ERS guidelines may be better suited to capture age-related decline in pulmonary function, their use is more computationally intensive and requires appropriate, population-based, reference equations for the interpretation of pulmonary function tests.

During 2007–2010, the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted a spirometry component which obtained pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator pulmonary lung function data on survey participants 6–79 years of age. Data on respiratory symptoms and diseases were also collected. These data offer a unique opportunity to examine multiple approaches to estimating the prevalence of COPD in a large nationally representative sample.

The main objectives of this study were 1) to estimate the prevalence of COPD in the United States based on pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements and according to the operational definitions in the two major published guidelines: ATS/ERS and GOLD and 2) to examine the potential impact of nonresponse on the estimated prevalence.

Diagnosis of COPD according to the GOLD and LLN criteria

A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70 established the diagnosis 'GOLD-COPD'. The 'GOLD-COPD' was graded using post-bronchodilator % of predicted FEV1 values: GOLD stage 1 (mild): ≥ 80%; stage 2 (moderate): 50–79%; stage 3 (severe): 30–49; stage 4 (very severe) < 30%.

A FEV1/FVC ratio below the lower fifth percentile of healthy reference groups (similar age) established the diagnosis 'LLN-COPD'. From several LLN equations provided by we selected three LLN reference equations on the basis of sample size, popularity and comparability with the age of our study population. These equations were derived from the following populations:

1. Enright et al.: USA; healthy Caucasians with no respiratory symptoms, N = 1,227, 26% male, age range 65–85 years, non-smokers or all-time smoking duration < 5 years.

2. Quanjer et al. (ECCS/ERS): Europe; healthy never-smokers with no respiratory symptoms, N = 1,204, 27% male, age range 20–70 years.

3. Falaschetti et al. (Health Survey for England): Great Britain; healthy never-smokers with no respiratory disease, N = 6,053, 41% male, age range 16–85 years.

The aforementioned reference equations of the LLN-COPD definitions are based on pre-bronchodilator values, and the GOLD-COPD definition on post-bronchodilatory FEV1/FVC values. We analysed both pre- and post-bronchodilator cut-off values for both definitions. Because the results were similar, we only present the post-bronchodilator results.

Prognostic outcomes

Exacerbations of COPD (need for short course of oral steroids), hospitalization for COPD, and all-cause mortality were assessed blinded to the diagnostic classification.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The diagnosis of COPD involves a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, lung function tests (spirometry), and physical examination. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides guidelines for diagnosis and staging, which inform treatment decisions. According to GOLD criteria, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 is diagnostic for COPD. Managing COPD requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological interventions (such as steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics), pulmonary rehabilitation, and ventilator support. Stable COPD is characterized by a period of time when the patient's symptoms are stable and not experiencing an acute exacerbation. During this period, patients may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing, but these symptoms are typically manageable with medication and other treatments. Conversely, post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) patients are those who have recently experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD and are in the recovery phase. These patients are at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations, hospital readmissions, and mortality, and require careful management to prevent further decline and improve outcomes.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration, published or unpublished. We will not consider cluster‐RCTs or cross‐over RCTs to minimise unit of analysis errors, overestimation of treatment effects, and residual effects of cross‐over ICS and LAMA. The transitivity assumption is likely to hold in this network meta‐analysis. This is due to clinical homogeneity across studies, balanced distribution of effect modifiers, and thorough evaluation by the review authors during protocol development and analysis stages, as in the previous version of the review.

Types of participants

We will include studies that recruited individuals aged 40 years or older with a diagnosis of COPD in accordance with the American Thoracic Society‐European Respiratory Society, GOLD report, or equivalent criteria. Obstructive ventilatory defects should be at least moderate, with a baseline FEV 1 of less than 80% predicted. We will exclude studies that enroled participants with a history of asthma or other respiratory disease. We plan to include a subset of eligible participants according to the guidance outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, specifically in section 3.2.1. This involves carefully identifying and extracting data specifically for the eligible subset that aligns with our predetermined inclusion criteria. We will contact study authors where necessary to obtain disaggregated data for the subset of interest, ensuring that our analysis remains consistent with the objectives and scope.

### Should the diagnosis of COPD be based on a single spirometry test? [^114S6HCK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

According to the fixed FEV 1 /FVC definition, 83.0% of initially obstructed subjects were still categorised as having airway obstruction after 1 year, and after 2 years only 76.2% had obstruction (Figure 3b). Of the subjects without baseline airway obstruction (n = 1,255), 87.5% remained unobstructed after 1 year and 81.3% after 2 years. Again, agreement between obstruction/non-obstruction status was 'substantial' when comparing T0 with T1 (Kappa = 0.707, 95% CI = 0.678–0.736) and T0 with T2 (Kappa = 0.695, 95% CI = 0.666–0.724) classifications.

Figure 4 shows that diagnostic shifts were observed across the full range of baseline FEV 1 /FVC values. Numbers (%) of patients with borderline results in terms of the fixed FEV 1 /FVC definition (e.g. FEV 1 /FVC between 0.68 and 0.72) were 337 (14.3%) at T0, 319 (13.6%) at T1 and 321 (13.6%) at T2. Of the 315 patients who shifted category in either direction between T0 and T1, only 65 (20.6%) were in the 0.68–0.72 range at T0.

Factors associated with shifting between diagnostic categories

Several factors were independently associated with shifting from being obstructed at T0 to being non-obstructed at T1 when applying the LLN FEV 1 /FVC criterion. Higher body mass index (BMI) and baseline short-acting bronchodilator use increased the odds of shifting to non-obstructed (Table 2). Older age, baseline post-BD FEV 1 < 50% predicted, baseline inhaled corticosteroid use, and being a current smoker or using a short-acting bronchodilator at T1 reduced this odds.

Being male, older age, lower baseline post-BD FEV 1% predicted, and being current smoker at baseline increased the odds of shifting from being non-obstructed to being obstructed at T1, whereas higher baseline BMI reduced these odds (Table 2).

Bronchodilator reversibility was not significantly associated with diagnostic shift in either direction.

COVID-19 — spirometry precautions and alternatives: During periods of high prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, spirometry should be restricted to patients requiring urgent or essential tests for the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. When routine spirometry is not available, home measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) combined with validated patient questionnaires could be used to support or refute a possible diagnosis of COPD, although PEF does not correlate well with the results of spirometry, has low specificity, and cannot differentiate obstructive and restrictive lung function abnormalities. Airflow obstruction could also be confirmed by giving patients a personal electronic portable spirometers with instruction and observation in their homes using video conferencing technology, and the ATS and ERS have provided recommendations regarding testing and precautions that should be taken.

### "GOLD or lower limit of normal definition? A comparison with expert-based diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a prospective cohort-study" [^114MvuHm]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a fixed post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) below 0.7. Age-dependent cut-off values below the lower fifth percentile (LLN) of this ratio derived from the general population have been proposed as an alternative. We wanted to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic capability of the GOLD and LLN definition when compared to an expert-based diagnosis.

Methods

In a prospective cohort study, 405 patients aged ≥ 65 years with a general practitioner's diagnosis of COPD were recruited and followed up for 4.5 (median; quartiles 3.9; 5.1) years. Prevalence rates of COPD according to GOLD and three LLN definitions and diagnostic performance measurements were calculated. The reference standard was the diagnosis of COPD of an expert panel that used all available diagnostic information, including spirometry and bodyplethysmography.

Results

Compared to the expert panel diagnosis, 'GOLD-COPD' misclassified 69 (28%) patients, and the three LLNs misclassified 114 (46%), 96 (39%), and 98 (40%) patients, respectively. The GOLD classification led to more false positives, the LLNs to more false negative diagnoses. The main predictors beyond the FEV1/FVC ratio for an expert diagnosis of COPD were the FEV1% predicted, and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC). Adding FEV1 and RV/TLC to GOLD or LLN improved the diagnostic accuracy, resulting in a significant reduction of up to 50% of the number of misdiagnoses. The expert diagnosis of COPD better predicts exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality than GOLD or LLN.

Conclusions

GOLD criteria over-diagnose COPD, while LLN definitions under-diagnose COPD in elderly patients as compared to an expert panel diagnosis. Incorporating FEV1 and RV/TLC into the GOLD-COPD or LLN-based definition brings both definitions closer to expert panel diagnosis of COPD, and to daily clinical practice.

### Should the diagnosis of COPD be based on a single spirometry test? [^115X77na]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Particular strengths of our study are the large sample of subjects from primary care for whom guidelines recommend investigation for COPD (respiratory symptoms, age ⩾40, smoker/ex-smoker), the fact that all spirometry tests were performed by certified technicians using standardised protocols and equipment, that both pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry were performed, and the existence of regional primary care programmes for ongoing monitoring of lung function as a part of routine patient care.

The study has some limitations as well. First, we assume that the patients being seen longitudinally in the primary care diagnostic centres are representative of a larger population, but we have no information on the precise reasons why some patients were scheduled for annual follow-up visits, whereas other patients were not. Selection may have occurred, as patients in the monitoring service may have been patients of special concern to their GPs; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the number of variable spirometric findings was falsely elevated because of this. Also, patients with severe and unchanging disease may have been referred to secondary care medical specialists and have been lost to the primary care diagnostic centre monitoring service and, consequently, to our dataset. This might have caused a bias away from seeing consistent findings from year to year. Another limitation of the study is the fact that, because these follow-up visits are scheduled annually, we were not able to look at the variability of FEV 1 /FVC over shorter periods of time — for instance, within-day or week-to-week — as already reported for FEV 1 and FVC. Further research is needed to establish the optimal interval between the initial spirometry test and a 'verification test' after some weeks or months. Clearly, regression to the mean effects could have a role in explaining our observations as, by chance alone, subjects with more extreme FEV 1 /FVC values are likely to show less extreme values at reassessment; furthermore, as the diagnosis of COPD is currently based on a specific FEV 1 /FVC value (whether < LLN or ≤ 0.70), trivial changes could lead to a diagnostic shift for subjects with a baseline ratio just below or just above the relevant cut-off point. However, only about 20% of patients with a diagnostic shift had been in the borderline range of 0.68–0.72 at baseline, and diagnostic shifts were observed across the full range of baseline FEV 1 /FVC values (Figure 4). Finally, subjects non-obstructed at baseline may have been less likely to be enrolled in a diagnostic centre's monitoring service and may therefore be under-represented in our dataset.

### Prevalence, diagnostic utility and associated characteristics of bronchodilator responsiveness [^112jhiNC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The prevalence and diagnostic utility of bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) in a real-life setting is unclear. Objective: To explore this uncertainty in patients aged ⩾12years with physician-assigned diagnoses of asthma, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or COPD in NOVELTY, a prospective cohort study in primary and secondary care in 18 countries. Methods: The proportion of patients with a positive BDR test in each diagnostic category was calculated using 2005 (ΔFEV 1 or ΔFVC ⩾12% and ⩾200ml) and 2021 (ΔFEV 1 or ΔFVC > 10% predicted) European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society criteria. Measurements and Main Results: We studied 3,519 patients with a physician-assigned diagnosis of asthma, 833 with a diagnosis of asthma+COPD, and 2,436 with a diagnosis of COPD. The prevalence of BDR was 19.7% (asthma), 29.6% (asthma+COPD), and 24.7% (COPD) using 2005 criteria and 18.1%, 23.3%, and 18.0%, respectively, using 2021 criteria. Using 2021 criteria in patients diagnosed with asthma, BDR was associated with higher fractional exhaled nitric oxide; lower lung function; higher symptom burden; more frequent hospital admissions; and greater use of triple therapy, oral corticosteroids, or biologics. In patients diagnosed with COPD, BDR (2021) was associated with lower lung function and higher symptom burden. Conclusions: BDR prevalence in patients with chronic airway diseases receiving treatment ranges from 18% to 30%, being modestly lower with the 2021 than with the 2005 European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society criteria, and it is associated with lower lung function and greater symptom burden. These observations question the validity of BDR as a key diagnostic tool for asthma managed in clinical practice or as a standard inclusion criterion for clinical trials of asthma and instead suggest that BDR be considered a treatable trait for chronic airway disease.

### Bronchodilator responsiveness as a phenotypic characteristic of established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115dRcQW]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchodilator responsiveness is a potential phenotypic characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We studied whether change in lung function after a bronchodilator is abnormal in COPD, whether stable responder subgroups can be identified, and whether these subgroups experience different clinical outcomes.

Methods

1831 patients with COPD, 285 smoking (SC) and 228 non-smoking (NSC) controls from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) cohort. Spirometric reversibility to 400 μg inhaled salbutamol was assessed on four occasions over 1 year.

Results

Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) increase after salbutamol was similar in SC (mean 0.14 litres (SD 0.15)) and COPD (0.12 litres (0.15)) and was significantly greater than NSC (0.08 litres (0.14)). Reversibility status varied with repeated testing in parallel with the day-to-day variation in pre-bronchodilator FEV(1), which was similar in control subjects and patients with COPD. Absolute FEV(1) change decreased by Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage in patients with COPD (GOLD II, mean 0.16 litres (SD 0.17); III, 0.10 litres (0.13); IV, 0.05 litres (0.08) as did chances of being classified as reversible. CT-defined emphysema was weakly related to the absolute change in FEV(1) post salbutamol. Consistently reversible patients (n = 227) did not differ in mortality, hospitalisation or exacerbation experience from irreversible patients when allowing for differences in baseline FEV(1).

Limitations

Reversibility only assessed with salbutamol and defined by FEV(1) criteria. The COPD population was older than the control populations.

Conclusions

Post-salbutamol FEV(1) change is similar in patients with COPD and smoking controls but is influenced by baseline lung function and the presence of emphysema. Bronchodilator reversibility status varies temporally and does not distinguish clinically relevant outcomes, making it an unreliable phenotype.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up assessment — smoking status, measurements, imaging, and comorbidities — includes the following: At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure should be determined followed by appropriate action. Decline in FEV1 can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) and a timed walking test (6-minute walking distance or shuttle-walking test) provides additional information regarding prognosis. Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia. If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated, and when exacerbations are repeatedly characterized by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis. Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition should be recorded and, if present, an appropriate diagnostic work-up should follow.

### COPD diagnosis related to different guidelines and spirometry techniques [^1132acvE]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

The aim was to compare the diagnosis of COPD among smokers according to different international guidelines and to compare the outcome when using slow (SVC) and forced vital capacity (FVC). In order to find current smokers a questionnaire was sent to persons who had been on sick leave for more than two weeks. Those who smoked more than 8 cigarettes per day were invited to perform a spirometry. Totally 3,887 spirometries were performed. In this sample 10.2% fulfilled the NICE COPD-criteria, 14.0% the GOLD COPD-criteria and 21.7% the ERS COPD criteria. The diagnosis according to NICE and GOLD guidelines is based on FVC and in the ERS guidelines the best value of either SVC or FVC is used. Thus, substantially more subjects with COPD were found when the best of either SVC or FVC was used. Forced VC tended to be higher than SVC when lung function was normal and in those with mild obstruction prior to bronchodilatation whereas SVC exceeded FVC after bronchodilatation in those who had severe bronchial obstruction. The diagnosis of COPD is highly depending on which guidelines are used for defining the disease. If FVC and not the best of SVC and FVC is used when defining COPD the diagnosis will be missed in a substantial number of patients.

Discussion

Main findings

Considering the high mortality and treatment costs of COPD, the disease should be diagnosed in its early phases. Risk factors such as tobacco smoking, exposure to air pollution (burning of wood), a family history of COPD, or a history of recurrent respiratory infections during childhood, should highlight the need for screening and early intervention. Undiagnosed COPD is a common problem and is usually associated with poor quality of life and poor functional status. Spirometry is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of COPD and it should be performed in all individuals with clinical signs of the disease. Despite the benefits from early diagnosis, the results of this study show that spirometry assessment is underused in Latin America.

Use of our GOLD-modified criteria (which consider the presence of respiratory symptoms and risk factors) as an indication for COPD screening was shown to be the most cost-effective method, as it produced the lowest number of individuals requiring evaluation and provided the highest proportion of COPD diagnoses.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^113pXAJB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the GOLD stages 1–4 are used to describe the severity of airflow limitation and represent important cutoffs for clinical study inclusion/exclusion criteria, this patient characterization based on FEV 1 alone lacks sufficient precision to predict those at risk of adverse outcomes, including disease exacerbations or mortality and to adequately guide treatment decisions. Therefore, the GOLD consortium issued a combined approach for COPD grading in 2017. 2 In this paradigm, patients undergo spirometry to determine severity of airflow limitation (which helps define prognosis) and are assessed for severity of symptoms and history of exacerbations. The best predictor of future exacerbations is a history of treated exacerbations. 14 Frequent exacerbators are defined as those reporting two or more per year or at least one requiring hospitalization or an emergency department visit. Symptoms are assessed by two main tools; the COPD Assessment Test or the modified Medical Research Council questionnaires. COPD Assessment Test is an eight‐item questionnaire with a total score of 40 that captures information regarding health status, 15 and the modified Medical Research Council is a 4‐grade scale for breathlessness. 16 Based on these outcomes, patients are categorized into four GOLD grades A−D reflecting symptom burden and exacerbation risk (Table 1). The GOLD grades are intended to guide clinician treatment decisions as well as pharmacological therapy escalation and de‐escalation if required.

### Pulmonary function testing in COPD: looking beyond the curtain of FEV1 [^117657ML]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

FEV1

Spirometry is the cornerstone of COPD diagnosis. According to GOLD guidelines, persistent airflow limitation is defined as a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 0.7. However, the use of a fixed FEV1/FVC ratio as a diagnostic cut-off is a rather simplified approach, leading to overdiagnosis of COPD in older patients, while simultaneously underestimating the presence of COPD in younger patients. Notably, it has been reported that in almost 75% of patients older than 65 years old diagnosed with mild COPD using the GOLD criteria, the measured FEV1/FVC values are within the normal range for healthy age-related and race-matched controls. Thus, although the fixed FEV1/FVC ratio importance has been validated by numerous studies and remains the standard diagnostic criterion due to its simplicity, it should be employed with caution.

Flow-volume curve concavity

The functional information provided by measuring the FEV1 is limited to the first second of forced exhalation when the small airways are exposed to substantial distending forces. During this period, the small airways' contribution to total airway resistance is limited, unless extensive airway narrowing is present. In early-stage COPD, when small airway narrowing is not yet extensive, the measurement of FEV1 is not a sensitive marker of airway obstruction.

Spirometry allows visualization of the maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve. The concave shape of the MEFV curve has been reported to be useful for diagnosing airway limitation, especially in the poor expiratory effort if the patient cannot exhale for ≥ 6 sec or create a plateau in the volume-time curve, and it correlates with symptoms. MEFV curves with varying concave contours are seen in patients with COPD and partly attributable to the mechanical interaction between airway conductance and loss of elastic recoil.

Terminology

As mentioned above, it is now well established that a range of lung function trajectories exist through life and that COPD can develop by both abnormal lung development and/or accelerated lung aging. This has generated some terminological confusion, so GOLD proposes the use of the following terminology.

Early COPD

The word "early" means "near the beginning of a process". Because COPD can start early in life and take a long time to manifest clinically, identifying "early" COPD is difficult. Further, a biological "early" related to the initial mechanisms that eventually lead to COPD should be differentiated from a clinical "early", which reflects the initial perception of symptoms, functional limitation, and/or structural abnormalities noted. Thus, GOLD proposes to use the term "early COPD" only to discuss the "biological" first steps of the disease in an experimental setting.

Mild COPD

Some studies have used "mild" airflow obstruction as a surrogate for "early" disease. This assumption is incorrect because not all patients started their journey from a normal peak lung function in early adulthood, so some of them may never suffer "mild" disease in terms of "severity" of airflow obstruction. Further, "mild" disease can occur at any age and may progress, or not, over time. Accordingly, GOLD proposes that "mild" should be used only to describe the severity of airflow obstruction measured spirometrically.

Young COPD

The term "young COPD" is seemingly straightforward because it directly relates to the "chronological" age of the patient. Given that lung function peaks at around 20 years and starts to decline around 40–50 years, GOLD proposes to operationally consider "young COPD" in patients aged 20–50 years, whether from having never achieved normal peak lung function in early adulthood and/or from shorter plateau and/or early lung function decline. COPD in "young" people may be associated with significant structural and functional lung abnormalities with substantial impact on health. A family history of respiratory diseases and/or early-life events (including hospitalizations before the age of 5 years) is reported by a significant proportion of young patients with COPD.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to general principles, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to individualize pharmacological treatment regimens guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices. Assess inhaler technique needs regularly.

Physiological tests — lung volumes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show that COPD patients exhibit gas trapping (a rise in residual volume) from the early stages of the disease, and as airflow obstruction worsens, static hyperinflation (an increase in total lung capacity) occurs, particularly during exercise (dynamic hyperinflation). These changes can be documented by body plethysmography, or less accurately by helium dilution lung volume measurement. These measurements help characterize the severity of COPD but are not essential to patient management.

An inhaled corticosteroid, either alone or more commonly in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator, can further reduce exacerbations and improve the health status of these patients. Furthermore, patients with severe COPD, particularly those who are debilitated, should be considered for pulmonary rehabilitation because these programs have been proven useful in maintaining, or in some cases improving, health status for these patients. Finally, correction of resting arterial hypoxemia with oxygen therapy for more than 15 h/d prolongs survival of COPD patients for those with a resting PaO2 lower than 55 to 60 mm Hg. The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requires attention to smoking and occupational history and documentation of symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and dyspnea.

1, 2 The performance of spirometry provides the proper documentation of the presence and severity of airflow obstruction and should be done on every patient who is suspected to have COPD. 1, 3–5 The ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity is used to determine airflow obstruction. Although spirometric thresholds remain controversial, most expert panels use FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70%1, 6 or less than 88% predicted in men or less than 89% predicted in women7 of predicted to define airflow obstruction. Both spirometric evidence of airflow obstruction and clinical symptoms are necessary for the diagnosis of COPD. In most settings, mild COPD is defined by a postbronchodilator FEV1 of 70% to 80% or greater of predicted1, 6, 7; moderate as an FEV1 of 50% to 80% of predicted1, 6, 7; severe as an FEV1 of.

Although both FEV1 and FVC values are in the normal range, the reduced FEV1/FVC ratio confirms objectively a diagnosis of COPD. Since his postbronchodilator FEV1 is greater than 80% of predicted, the patient has mild COPD. In general, long-term administration of oxygen should be reserved for individuals with COPD who have arterial hypoxemia, or a PaO2 between 55 and 60 mm Hg with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or secondary erythrocytosis.

Step 3: Confirm the Restrictive Pattern If the patient's initial PFT results indicate a restrictive pattern or a mixed pattern that is not corrected with bronchodilators, the patient should be referred for full PFTs with DLCO testing. DLCO is a quantitative measurement of gas transfer in the lungs. Diseases that decrease blood flow to the lungs or damage alveoli will cause less efficient gas exchange, resulting in a lower DLCO measurement. Full PFTs provide the patient's total lung capacity. The restrictive pattern is confirmed as a true restrictive defect if the total lung capacity is less than 80% of predicted in patients five to 18 years of age, or less than the LLN in adults. If full PFTs cannot be obtained, the FVC can be used to infer a restrictive defect; however, FVC has a poor positive predictive value. 13, 14.

Step 5: Determine Reversibility of the Obstructive Defect If the patient has an obstructive defect, the physician should determine if it is reversible based on the increase in FEV 1 or FVC after bronchodilator treatment. 3 Figure 4 shows a fully reversible obstructive defect. Obstructive defects in persons with asthma are usually fully reversible, whereas defects in persons with COPD typically are not. If PFTs show a mixed pattern and the FVC corrects to 80% or more of predicted in patients five to 18 years of age or to the LLN or more in adults after bronchodilator use, it is likely that the patient has pure obstructive lung disease with air trapping.

Step 6: Bronchoprovocation If PFT results are normal but the physician still suspects exercise- or allergen-induced asthma, the next step is bronchoprovocation, such as a methacholine challenge, a mannitol inhalation challenge, exercise testing, or sometimes eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea testing. 15, 16 When the FEV 1 is 70% or more of predicted on standard spirometry, bronchoprovocation should be used to make the diagnosis. If the FEV 1 is less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a bronchodilator may be considered. 17.

1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20.

3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis. Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms. 27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. LONG-TERM OXYGEN THERAPY The American Thoracic Society, U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and U. S.

Department of Defense recommend long-term oxygen therapy for patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia.
