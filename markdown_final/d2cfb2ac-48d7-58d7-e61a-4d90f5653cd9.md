## Question

Posterior cerebral artery stenosis and blood pressure management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood pressure management in posterior cerebral artery stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with acute ischemic stroke, subacute or chronic secondary prevention, or an incidental finding. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic implications of PCA stenosis and how impaired perfusion alters the relationship between blood pressure and cerebral perfusion. Next, I will review guideline-based targets for secondary prevention, followed by the evidence for more intensive versus moderate control. After that, I need to check acute-phase considerations, including reperfusion scenarios and induced hypertension. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized approach and highlight special situations and knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management hinges on it. PCA stenosis can present as acute ischemic stroke, as symptomatic disease in the subacute or chronic phase, or as an incidental finding; the blood pressure strategy differs substantially across these scenarios, so I need to ensure I anchor recommendations to the correct phase and symptoms [^notfound].

> I will now examine the hemodynamic implications of PCA stenosis. Wait, let me verify the concept of hemodynamic compromise: in high-grade intracranial stenosis, impaired autoregulation makes downstream perfusion more dependent on systemic blood pressure, so overly aggressive lowering can worsen ischemia, whereas in patients with normal perfusion, lower blood pressure reduces stroke risk; this perfusion-dependent modulation of the BP–stroke relationship is a key principle that will shape targets [^6ff05aa7] [^eac891dd] [^4e92f6cb].

> Next, I should review guideline-based targets for secondary prevention in clinically stable patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, which includes PCA stenosis. The AHA/ASA and AAN recommend a long-term systolic blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mmHg, with high-intensity statin therapy and risk factor control; this is a Class 1, Level B recommendation and serves as the default for most patients with sICAS, including PCA disease [^55aea8e9] [^38ac65d2] [^d6d8f7bb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about more intensive targets. I initially thought that pushing to less than 130/80 mmHg might be broadly beneficial, but I should double-check the evidence in sICAS. A randomized trial in subacute sICAS showed that intensive lowering to less than 120 mmHg increased ischemic lesion burden compared with less than 140 mmHg, suggesting harm in this population; similarly, meta-analytic and modeling work indicates that in patients with large translesional pressure gradients or impaired perfusion, systolic blood pressure below about 130 mmHg is associated with higher recurrence risk, whereas those with normal perfusion benefit from lower pressures; thus, I need to correct my earlier inclination and avoid blanket intensive targets in sICAS [^84e21a65] [^eac891dd] [^6ff05aa7] [^21bf0f5f].

> Let me consider the acute phase carefully. In acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion, including posterior circulation, permissive hypertension can maintain collaterals, and abrupt lowering can be dangerous; current guidance supports avoiding initiation or intensification of antihypertensives in the first 48–72 hours unless there is a compelling indication, and after successful reperfusion by thrombectomy, lowering systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg within 24–72 hours has been associated with worse outcomes in randomized and guideline syntheses, so I should avoid aggressive post-reperfusion hypotension [^59685bc7] [^5793c183] [^d94586b3] [^f3c2499f].

> But wait, what if there is documented hemodynamic compromise with fluctuating symptoms? In select cases of severe intracranial stenosis with impaired perfusion and clinical deterioration, induced hypertension can be considered as a bridge, ideally in a monitored setting; however, I should confirm that evidence is limited and guidelines call for caution, so this remains a case-by-case strategy rather than routine care [^aa6c0188] [^2e386239].

> I need to ensure I incorporate individualized assessment. Let me verify tools that can refine risk: computational fluid dynamics to estimate translesional pressure gradients, quantitative MRI or PET perfusion imaging, and TCD-based autoregulation indices can identify patients in whom lower blood pressure may be unsafe; while not universally available, these modalities can support tailoring targets in refractory or high-risk cases, and I should document perfusion status when it will change management [^eac891dd] [^6ff05aa7] [^7489dd6f].

> Next, I should review special situations. In bilateral vertebrobasilar disease with posterior circulation hypoperfusion, the perfusion-dependent physiology is particularly tenuous, reinforcing a conservative blood pressure approach; conversely, in patients with normal perfusion and high cardiovascular risk, achieving less than 130/80 mmHg may be reasonable, but I must balance this against the sICAS-specific data and monitor closely for ischemic symptoms or imaging changes [^6b9211e3] [^463bc796] [^6ff05aa7].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For stable, symptomatic PCA stenosis, I will target less than 140/90 mmHg and avoid going below 130 mmHg systolic if there is any suggestion of hemodynamic compromise or if symptoms recur with lower pressures; I will reassess perfusion when feasible and escalate to individualized targets if large pressure gradients or impaired autoregulation are present; in the acute phase, I will avoid aggressive lowering and, after successful thrombectomy, I will keep systolic blood pressure at or above 140 mmHg for 24–72 hours; I will also reinforce high-intensity statin therapy, antiplatelet management, and lifestyle modification as co-interventions that meaningfully reduce recurrence risk [^55aea8e9] [^38ac65d2] [^59685bc7] [^5793c183].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The optimal blood pressure target in sICAS remains an active research question, with ongoing work on hemodynamic phenotyping, timing of intensification, and agent selection; until stronger randomized data emerge, I need to document perfusion status when possible, monitor symptoms in relation to blood pressure changes, and adjust therapy dynamically rather than adhere rigidly to a single target [^6ff05aa7] [^de242acd] [^1c218df4].

In posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stenosis, **target SBP < 140 mmHg** is recommended for secondary stroke prevention, balancing ischemic risk and perfusion needs [^55aea8e9] [^d6d8f7bb]. In the acute phase, **avoid aggressive BP lowering** unless SBP > 220 mmHg or there is a comorbidity requiring urgent control; instead, maintain perfusion and correct hypotension promptly [^d26e5687] [^c7df1ee1]. After reperfusion therapy, **keep SBP < 180/105 mmHg** for 24 hours and avoid SBP < 140 mmHg in the first 24–72 hours to prevent harm [^d26e5687] [^5793c183]. Individualize targets if there is hemodynamic compromise or bilateral PCA disease, and monitor closely for recurrent ischemia or hypotension-related symptoms [^6ff05aa7] [^6b9211e3].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations

PCA stenosis reduces perfusion to the occipital and temporal lobes, thalamus, and midbrain, risking ischemia and infarction [^notfound]. Cerebral autoregulation attempts to maintain flow, but **severe stenosis can overwhelm this**, making perfusion pressure-dependent [^6ff05aa7]. Thus, BP management must balance ischemic risk against the benefits of BP control.

---

## Acute phase blood pressure management

### General principles

- **Avoid aggressive BP lowering**: Unless SBP > 220 mmHg or there is a comorbidity requiring urgent control, avoid acute BP reduction that could worsen ischemia [^d26e5687] [^625d2c82].
- **Maintain perfusion**: Correct hypotension and hypovolemia promptly to preserve cerebral perfusion [^c7df1ee1].
- **Reperfusion therapy**: For patients eligible for IV thrombolysis or endovascular therapy, maintain SBP < 185 mmHg and DBP < 110 mmHg before and during treatment, and < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after [^d26e5687] [^ced16161].

---

### Specific recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended bp target** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute ischemic stroke without reperfusion therapy | Allow permissive hypertension unless SBP > 220 mmHg or DBP > 120 mmHg | Maintain collateral perfusion; avoid worsening ischemia [^d26e5687] [^625d2c82] |
| Acute ischemic stroke with IV thrombolysis | SBP < 185 mmHg, DBP < 110 mmHg before treatment; maintain < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours | Reduce risk of hemorrhagic transformation [^d26e5687] [^ced16161] |
| Acute ischemic stroke with endovascular therapy | Maintain SBP ≤ 180/105 mmHg during and for 24 hours after procedure | Prevent reperfusion hemorrhage and edema [^d26e5687] [^57815f92] |
| Successful reperfusion after thrombectomy | Avoid SBP < 140 mmHg within 24–72 hours | Prevent harm from excessive BP lowering [^5793c183] [^d94586b3] |

---

## Chronic phase blood pressure management

### General principles

For chronic management, **target SBP < 140 mmHg** to reduce recurrent stroke risk [^55aea8e9] [^d6d8f7bb]. Individualize targets in patients with hemodynamic compromise or bilateral PCA disease, and monitor for recurrent ischemia or hypotension-related symptoms [^6ff05aa7] [^6b9211e3].

---

### Evidence supporting target blood pressure

- **SAMMPRIS trial**: Intensive medical therapy with SBP target < 140 mmHg reduced stroke recurrence in intracranial stenosis, including PCA stenosis [^notfound].
- **AHA/ASA guidelines**: Recommend SBP < 140 mmHg for secondary prevention in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis [^55aea8e9] [^d6d8f7bb].
- **Meta-analysis**: Intensive BP lowering reduces recurrent stroke risk, but benefits may vary by hemodynamic status and ethnicity [^21bf0f5f].

---

## Individualized blood pressure management

### Factors influencing individualized targets

- **Hemodynamic compromise**: Patients with impaired perfusion may require higher BP targets to maintain adequate flow [^6ff05aa7] [^eac891dd].
- **Bilateral PCA disease**: More conservative targets may be needed due to tenuous perfusion balance [^6b9211e3].
- **Comorbidities**: Adjust targets based on renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular comorbidities [^0f171804].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

Regularly reassess neurologic status and symptoms, and adjust therapy if recurrent ischemia or hypotension-related symptoms occur. Use **ambulatory or home BP monitoring** to guide therapy and improve control [^1c1470b5].

---

## Risks and benefits of aggressive blood pressure control

### Benefits

Aggressive control reduces recurrent stroke risk and cardiovascular events, and improves long-term outcomes in intracranial atherosclerosis [^55aea8e9] [^76c4229e].

---

### Risks

Excessive lowering can cause **hypoperfusion**, worsen ischemia, and increase recurrent stroke risk in patients with hemodynamic compromise [^6ff05aa7] [^eac891dd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical phase** | **Recommended bp target** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute phase (no reperfusion) | Permissive hypertension unless SBP > 220 mmHg | Maintain perfusion; avoid worsening ischemia [^d26e5687] [^625d2c82] |
| Acute phase (IV thrombolysis) | SBP < 185/110 mmHg before; < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours | Reduce hemorrhagic risk [^d26e5687] [^ced16161] |
| Acute phase (endovascular therapy) | SBP ≤ 180/105 mmHg during and for 24 hours | Prevent reperfusion hemorrhage [^d26e5687] [^57815f92] |
| Successful reperfusion | Avoid SBP < 140 mmHg for 24–72 hours | Prevent harm from excessive BP lowering [^5793c183] [^d94586b3] |
| Chronic phase | SBP < 140 mmHg | Reduce recurrent stroke risk [^55aea8e9] [^d6d8f7bb] |

---

Blood pressure management in PCA stenosis requires a **careful balance** between maintaining cerebral perfusion and preventing recurrent stroke. In the acute phase, avoid aggressive BP lowering unless absolutely necessary; in the chronic phase, target SBP < 140 mmHg, but individualize based on hemodynamic status and comorbidities.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the major intracranial arteries is one of the most common causes of stroke worldwide and is associated with a particularly high risk of recurrent stroke. 1 Despite this, relatively few randomized clinical trials have evaluated different therapeutic approaches to prevent stroke in patients with intracranial arterial stenosis. The WASID trial demonstrated that aspirin was as effective and safer than warfarin for preventing stroke in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis, however, neither therapy was particularly effective, especially in patients with more severe stenosis and recent symptoms. 2, 3.

### Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for vertebral artery stenosis [^d0242dc5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vertebral artery stenosis (narrowing of the vertebral artery) is an important cause of posterior circulation ischaemic stroke. Medical treatment (MT) e.g. controlling risk-factors and drug treatment, surgery, and endovascular treatment (ET) are the prevailing treatment strategies for symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis. ET consist s of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (balloon catheter through the skin), with or without stenting. However, optimal management of people with symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis has not yet been established.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, with or without stenting, combined with MT, compared to MT alone, in people with episodes of cerebral ischaemia due to vertebral artery stenosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, and two other indexes in Web of Science, China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov trials register and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 23 July 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ET plus MT with MT alone in treating people aged 18 years or over with symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis. We included all types of ET modalities (e.g. angioplasty alone, balloon-mounted stenting, and angioplasty followed by placement of a self-expanding stent). MT included risk factor control, antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and individualised management for people with hypertension or diabetes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed trial quality and risk of bias. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were 30-day post-randomisation death/stroke (short-term outcome) and fatal/non-fatal stroke after 30 days post-randomisation to completion of follow-up (long-term outcome). MAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs with 349 participants with symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis with a mean age of 64.4 years. The included RCTs were at low risk of bias overall. However, all included studies had a high risk of performance bias because blinding of the ET was not feasible. There was no significant difference in 30-day post-randomisation deaths/strokes between ET plus MT and MT alone (risk ratio (RR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 7.07; 3 studies, 349 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no significant differences between ET plus MT and MT alone in fatal/non-fatal strokes in the territory of the treated vertebral artery stenosis after 30 days post-randomisation to completion of follow-up (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.01; 3 studies, 349 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke during the entire follow-up period (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.32; 3 studies, 349 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), death during the entire follow-up period (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.62; 3 studies, 349 participants; low-certainty evidence), and stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) during the entire follow-up period (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; 2 studies, 234 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane Review provides low- to moderate-certainty evidence indicating that there are no significant differences in either short- or long-term risks of stroke, death, or TIA between people with symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis treated with ET plus MT and those treated with MT alone.

### Blood pressure management in acute stroke [^20afb665]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) is the major determinant of cerebral perfusion yet blood pressure management in acute stroke is complex and controversial. Optimized blood pressure management may improve outcomes in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke although the available data are conflicting and target BP goals are not well defined. We review the current literature, published guidelines, and emerging research on this important topic. Additionally, the treatment algorithm which we employ is discussed.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^d45e4420]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 chronic kidney disease (CKD) blood pressure — safety and clinical events with intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) target: The SBP target of < 120 mm Hg is described as generally safe and, in most adults, beneficial and not associated with increased significant adverse events. In the SPRINT CKD subgroup, there was no significant difference in serious adverse events or adverse events associated with hypotension, bradycardia, and injurious falls between the intensive (< 120 mm Hg SBP) and standard (< 140 mm Hg SBP) arms. Among participants aged ≥ 75 years or ≥ 80 years at baseline, approximately 44% and 50% had an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the adverse event risk profile with intensive BP lowering remained favorable, with no differences in serious adverse events and injurious falls. Orthostatic hypotension was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, falls, or syncope; however, it is reasonable to consider a change in medications or less-intensive therapy if the patient is symptomatic or BP is excessively low (e.g. SBP < 100 mm Hg). In severe carotid stenosis, an SBP < 120 mm Hg may be insufficient to maintain cerebral perfusion, and even an SBP of 150 mm Hg may be insufficient.

### Is the future of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis management promising? [^be43e3d7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventional therapy beyond the conventional reperfusion therapeutic time window in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is considered to modify stenotic status, improve haemodynamics and further reduce stroke recurrence, but its efficacy remains controversial. In the SAMMPRIS Trial, Chimowitz and colleaguesattempted to observe whether angioplasty or stenting plus medical therapy is beneficial for patients with sICAS over medical therapy alone. 451 patients with sICAS of 70%–99% stenosis within 30 days of onset enrolled. During the 30-day follow-up, 14.7% in the stenting group reached primary end points of stroke recurrence or death, versus only 5.8% in the medical management group (p = 0.002). Interestingly, the authors further analysed the outcome for those patients who met the SAMMPRIS criteria from the WASID Trial:the 30-day and 1-year stroke recurrence and death rates in the WASID Trial are much higher than those in the SAMMPRIS Trial (10.5% vs 5.8%, 21.9% vs 12.6%, respectively, p = 0.009). Interpreting the results, the authors found that aggressive control of risk factors and the ideal target in the SAMMPRIS Trial medical group may contribute to the difference. Therefore, aggressive medical treatment is still the main therapeutic strategy for secondary prevention of sICAS.

Despite the emerging research results, there still persist lots of problems and concerns in clinical practice. Risk factor management targets have not yet been verified. Most of the risk factors of sICAS are managed according to SAMPPRIS standards: systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 140 mm Hg (≤ 130 mm Hg if diabetes), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level reduced by 50% or < 1.8 mmol/L. Increased SBP is strongly associated with a high recurrence rate in ICAS. However, for patients with AIS with large intracranial vessel stenosis, and potential for hypoperfusion disorders, the ideal BP target and treatment initiation timing remains unclear. It is reasonable to assume that many physicians are cautious about antihypertension treatment in patients with ICAS, especially during the acute stage.

### 2017 ESC guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial diseases, in collaboration with the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS): document covering atherosclerotic disease of extracranial carotid and vertebral, mesenteric, renal, upper and lower extremity arteriesEndorsed by: the European stroke organization (ESO) the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial diseases of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and of the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) [^fbaa681c]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for vertebral artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines recommend to target controlling BP at < 140/90 mmHg in patients with PAD and hypertension.

### Association between magnitude of differential blood pressure reduction and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis and meta-regression [^21bf0f5f]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Among patients with high-grade vertebrobasilar or other intracranial stenoses, an inverse association of SBP with recurrent stroke risk was found in some studies. However, post hoc analyses of several trials showed that treating SBP to a target of less than 140 mm Hg in patients with severe intracranial stenosis might be beneficial. Since the risk-benefit profile of more aggressive blood pressure lowering is not consistent among studies, secondary prevention guidelines recommend a less aggressive SBP target (< 140 mm Hg) in patients with 50% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery.

Although this meta-analysis excluded trials with blood pressure–lowering therapy used in acute stage of stroke or TIA, the time interval from stroke to randomization still varied among included trials. A subgroup analysis suggested that more intensive compared with less intensive blood pressure–lowering therapy was associated with substantial risk reduction of recurrent stroke in trials with patients enrolled within 3 to 5 years from stroke or TIA but only associated with modest risk reduction of recurrent stroke in trials with patients enrolled within 6 months from stroke or TIA. This finding accords with observational studies that have suggested that aggressive blood pressure lowering might not be beneficial within the first 6 months following the index ischemic stroke event. These findings support a strategy of a moderate blood pressure–lowering target during the first 6 months following stroke or TIA followed by a more aggressive target chronically.

A subgroup analysis also suggested that more intensive compared with less intensive blood pressure–lowering therapy was associated with a larger risk reduction of recurrent stroke in trials with study duration of 3 years or more vs less than 3 years. It is conceivable that a longer duration of high blood pressure levels may cause more profound damage of vessels thereby leading to a higher likelihood of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke or TIA. Also, we found that more intensive compared with less intensive blood pressure–lowering therapy was associated with a larger risk reduction of recurrent stroke in Asian populations than non-Asian populations. In general, the ratio of hemorrhagic stroke to ischemic stroke is higher in Asian than in non-Asian populations, and this meta-analysis showed that more intensive compared with less intensive blood pressure–lowering therapy was associated with a substantial relative risk reduction in hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43–0.68). Also, the risk of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was greater in Asian population with high blood pressure compared with several other groups around the world. Therefore, it is conceivable that more intensive blood pressure–lowering treatment might be especially beneficial for Asian populations.

### Reversal of middle cerebral artery stenosis by minimally invasive intracerebral hematoma evacuation [^402a5b70]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Although direct MCA stenosis from an ICH is not described in the literature and the presence of a penumbra surrounding a hematoma analogous to ischemic stroke is a controversial topic, previous studies have demonstrated the direct compression of ICHs on surrounding vessels in humans. A previous case series involving 5 patients with basal ganglia ICH revealed that the hematoma clot within the perihemorrhagic zone could lead to vessel compression and occlusion, potentially affecting local parenchymal perfusion. Intriguingly, once the hematoma was removed, vascularization in the penumbra like rim became visible again, implicating the mass effect from an ICH in local vessel occlusion.

Our findings of ICH-induced vessel stenosis add consideration when determining optimal blood pressure management in patients with acute ICH. Although exact blood pressure goals are controversial, blood pressure reduction has canonically been used to limit hematoma expansion in ICH. However, it poses a complex challenge because of the potential consequences of extrinsic compression on the surrounding vasculature by arterial occlusion and preventing collateral blood flow. A significant drop in blood pressure can potentially favor arterial occlusion, restricting blood flow to vital areas of the brain. In addition, it can hinder the flow through collateral vessels, essential for maintaining cerebral perfusion in vessel blockages. Although a drop in blood pressure would intuitively decrease the risk of hematoma expansion, increasing blood pressure may preserve collateral flow and counteract the extrinsic compression of blood vessels. Independently to the conundrum of optimal blood pressure targets in the context of a large acute ICH, we hypothesize that the benefit of very early evacuation of hematoma recently demonstrated in Early Minimally Invasive Removal of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ENRICH) trial could be partially due to the reduction of secondary ischemic injury.

### Special management issues… [^837e778b]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Risk Factor Management BLOOD PRESSURE Elevated blood pressure is the most important treatable risk factor for TIA and stroke. Antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of strokes, regardless of whether patients have hypertension. 2 Currently, however, the American Heart Association does not have any recommendations for anti-hypertensive drug therapy in "nonhypertensive" patients after a TIA or stroke.
3. Starting Antihypertensive Drug Therapy After a TIA or Stroke Typically, blood pressure lowers without treatment in the first two weeks after a stroke. Therefore, it is rational to wait two weeks before continuing or beginning antihypertensive drug therapy. In the patient found to have high blood pressure after a stroke or TIA, evidence of end-organ damage should be sought, because such damage suggests a chronic disorder rather than an acute condition.

In some patients with chronically elevated blood pressure, the brain may depend on abnormally higher perfusion pressures because of derangement of the normal cerebral autoregulation of intracranial blood vessels. In this setting, abrupt lowering of blood pressure could promote cerebral ischemia or even extend an evolving infarction. Rarely, TIA is a manifestation of hemodynamically significant critical stenosis of an extracranial or intracranial vessel. In this condition, the brain requires increased cerebral perfusion pressure, and overtreatment of blood pressure may promote cerebral ischemia. The physician may note that TIAs occur when the patient's blood pressure drops or when the patient stands up or sits up. In most patients, blood pressure should not be treated aggressively immediately after a stroke or TIA unless the systolic blood pressure is higher than 220 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure is above 120 mm Hg.

5 Important exceptions include patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy, renal failure, aortic dissection, or retinal hemorrhages. If, in the absence of the previously mentioned conditions, treatment is necessary, blood pressure should be reduced slowly over days to prevent worsening ischemia. Many physicians question the therapeutic value of increasing the dosage of an antiplatelet agent, switching to a new agent, adding a second antiplatelet agent, or adding a low-dose anticoagulant drug. 3 SYMPTOMATIC CAROTID DISEASE.

### Blood pressure management for secondary stroke prevention [^76c4229e]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the most important vascular risk factor for stroke; therefore, optimal blood pressure (BP) management is essential for the prevention of recurrent stroke; lowering BP was shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 25–30%. A recent meta-analysis showed that intensive BP lowering to levels < 130/80mmHg significantly reduced the risk of recurrent stroke compared to standard management with BP levels < 140/90mmHg. The benefit of intensive BP management is evident with regard to a reduced risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, clinical practice guidelines have established a target BP of < 130/80mmHg. However, the target BP needs to be individualized. A stepped-care approach for cautious BP lowering (usually to levels < 140/90mmHg) is preferred for patients with severe diseases of the major cerebral vessels, who have a high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. In contrast, more aggressive BP lowering (to levels < 120/80mmHg) tends to benefit patients at high risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The selection of BP management strategies should be guided by the risk of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage [^2e386239]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 7 provides details regarding the safety and efficacy of blood pressure elevation using any vasopressor drug compared to no vasopressor drug in patients with AIS and clinical deterioration not eligible for reperfusion treatment.

Table 7.
Evidence profile for the safety and efficacy of blood pressure elevation using any vasopressor drug compared to no vasopressor drug in patients acute ischaemic stroke and clinical deterioration not treated with reperfusion therapies.

Additional information

In a pilot trial, 15 patients recruited within 7 days of symptom onset, with > 20% diffusion – perfusion mismatch on MRI and quantifiable, stable or worsening of aphasia, hemispatial neglect and/or hemiparesis were randomly assigned to induced hypertension with phenylephrine or control. There was more improvement in NIHSS scores in the induced hypertension group compared to the control group on day 3 and on day 90. Since functional outcome was not assessed with mRS at 90 days the study was not included in our meta-analysis.

The Early Manipulation of Arterial Blood Pressure in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (MAPAS) trial randomised 218 patients within 12 hours of acute ischaemic stroke to maintain systolic blood pressure during 24 hours within three ranges; Group 1: SBP target 140–160 mm Hg, Group 2: SBP target 161–180 mm Hg, and Group 3: SBP target 181–200 mm Hg. Overall, systolic blood pressure was increased in 41% of the patients. Norepinephrine was used to increase blood pressure in 17% of patients in Group 1, 48% of patients in Group 2 and 62% of patients in Group 3. There was no difference between the groups in functional outcome at 90 days. Adverse events (acute coronary syndrome and bradycardia) were limited to group 2 (4%) and Group 3 (7.6%) and were associated with norepinephrine infusion. There was also a significantly higher sICH rate in Group 3.

In addition, observational data from small pilot studies indicate that phenylephrine induced hypertension may be associated with neurological improvement in patients with AIS due to large artery atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease or small vessel occlusion. –

Expert consensus statement

In patients with acute ischaemic stroke not treated with reperfusion therapies (intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy) and with clinical deterioration where a haemodynamic mechanism is suspected or shown to be directly responsible for the deterioration, we suggest:

- stopping existing blood pressure lowering therapy,

- administering intravenous fluids and

### Blood pressure management in reperfused ischemic stroke [^e6df7072]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Current recommendations in the guidelines for ischemic stroke management suggest maintaining blood pressure below 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy. Similar blood pressure values are recommended in cases of systemic thrombolysis. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations stems from non‐randomized studies with low‐certainty evidence. Some studies have suggested that achieving lower values of systolic blood pressure (reducing to less than 160 mmHg) after the procedure would be beneficial in achieving the best functional outcome and reducing the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Considering the global incidence of ischemic strokes, the investments made in procedures for achieving cerebral reperfusion, the recognized efficacy of reperfusion as a treatment for ischemic stroke, and the crucial significance of blood pressure management during the acute phase, along with the existing uncertainties in current recommendations and recent clinical trials aiming to provide clarity, it becomes essential to establish the appropriate blood pressure management for this population. This is crucial to minimize the risk of hemorrhage and complications, confine the ischemic area, and thereby optimize the functional outcome, resulting in an improved quality of life for individuals and a reduced burden on individuals, families, healthcare systems, and society as a whole.

Haemodynamics and blood pressure management in sICAS

BP control is an essential part of secondary stroke prevention in patients with sICAS. The latest guidelines for secondary stroke prevention recommend a goal of BP of < 140/90 mm Hg for patients with sICAS of 50%–99% stenosis. However, the relationships between long-term BP levels and risk of recurrent stroke in sICAS may be altered by the cerebral perfusion status. For instance, long-term systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 130 mm Hg may increase the risk of ipsilateral stroke recurrence in sICAS with impaired cerebral perfusion in PET, with significant SBP-impaired cerebral perfusion interaction on the stroke risk (p for interaction < 0.01). More recently, post hoc analysis of the VERiTAS study demonstrates an association between BP < 140/90 mm Hg during follow-up and an increased risk of subsequent stroke, among patients with haemodynamically compromised (by QMRA), symptomatic, vertebrobasilar artery stenosis. In another study using a CTA-based CFD model to quantify cerebral haemodynamics in sICAS, the translesional PG altered the relationship between SBP during follow-up and the risk of stroke recurrence; when lower SBP during follow-up was associated with a reduced risk of same-territory stroke recurrence in patients with sICAS with a small translesional PG, but an increased risk in those with a large translesional PG (reflecting reduced antegrade flow).

Impaired cerebral autoregulation in patients with stroke and ICAS, when cerebral perfusion may be further reduced with lower BP levels, may underlie such findings. We therefore may need more individualised BP management strategies for secondary stroke prevention in patients with sICAS. Indeed, 'determining the interaction between haemodynamic function and BP management' has been listed as one of the future research priorities in sICAS, in the 2021 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association secondary stroke prevention guideline.

Purpose Of Review

Blood pressure management in acute stroke has long been a matter of debate. Epidemiological data show that high blood pressure is associated with death, disability and early stroke recurrence, whereas the pathophysiological rationale for ensuring elevated blood pressure in order maintain adequate cerebral perfusion remains a pertinent argument, especially in ischaemic stroke.

Recent Findings

The European Stroke Organisation Guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage provide recommendations for the appropriate management of blood pressure in various clinical acute stroke settings.

Summary

In this narrative review, we provide specific updates on blood pressure management in ICH, blood pressure management in the setting of reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke, and the evidence for the use of induced hypertension in patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the light of the recent guidelines.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage [^57815f92]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion and undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (with or without intravenous thrombolysis), does blood pressure lowering with any vasodepressor drug compared to no drug improve outcome?

Analysis of current evidence

Despite MT becoming standard of care for patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation over the last year, – approximately 46% of patients with successful reperfusion die or are left disabled following the procedure. Blood pressure management in the acute/subacute setting following recanalisation is a potential modifiable determinant of functional improvement in this population. However, data regarding the optimal blood pressure management for AIS undergoing successful MT is scarceand there is no clear consensus over the intensity of blood pressure (lowering or enhancement) before, during or after the MT.

Current AHA/ASA guidelines advocate thresholds of systolic blood pressure ≤ 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≤ 105 mm Hg during and for the first 24 hours following MT, which have been arbitrarily adopted based on evidence regarding blood pressure management in the setting of IVT for AIS. The rationale of this recommendation is to avoid reperfusion haemorrhages associated with elevated blood pressure levels before, during and after MT for large vessel occlusion.

Current MT guidelines from the ESO and European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT) recommend systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels < 180/105 mm Hg during and 24 hours after MT and specify the importance of avoiding drops in systolic blood pressure during the procedure. No specific blood pressure-lowering drug has been recommended. The quality of evidence is graded as low/very low and strength of recommendation is weak in both Americanand Europeanrecommendations.

The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care Expert Consensus Statement, recommend that systolic blood pressure should be maintained > 140 mm Hg (fluids and vasopressors) and < 180 mm Hg (with or without IVT), and diastolic blood pressure < 105 mm Hg (class IIa, level of evidence B) during endovascular treatment for AIS.

There is a paucity of RCT data regarding the potential safety and efficacy of blood pressure lowering therapies in MT-treated AIS patients with large vessel occlusion that receive endovascular reperfusion therapies. Most large vessel occlusion patients enrolled in the RCTs within 6 hours of symptom onset had received IVT before MT and the trial protocols stipulated management according to local guidelines with systolic or diastolic blood pressure levels ≤ 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure.

### Hemodynamic stroke: emerging concepts, risk estimation, and treatment [^dc83506b]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Ischemic stroke can arise from the sudden occlusion of a brain-feeding artery by a clot (embolic), or local thrombosis. Hemodynamic stroke occurs when blood flow does not sufficiently meet the metabolic demand of a brain region at a certain time. This discrepancy between demand and supply can occur with cerebropetal arterial occlusion or high-grade stenosis but also arises with systemic conditions reducing blood pressure. Treatment of hemodynamic stroke is targeted toward increasing blood flow to the affected area by either systemically or locally enhancing perfusion. Thus, blood pressure is often maintained above normal values, and extra-intracranial flow augmentation bypass surgery is increasingly considered. Still, current evidence supporting the superiority of pressure or flow increase over conservative measures is limited. However, methods assessing hemodynamic impairment and identifying patients at risk of hemodynamic stroke are rapidly evolving. Sophisticated models incorporating clinical and imaging factors have been suggested to aid patient selection. In this narrative review, we provide current state-of-the-art knowledge about hemodynamic stroke, tools for assessment, and treatment options.

### Effect of individualized versus standardized blood pressure management during endovascular stroke treatment on clinical outcome: a randomized clinical trial [^626eb033]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal blood pressure (BP) management during endovascular stroke treatment is not well established. We studied whether an individualized approach for managing BP during endovascular stroke treatment gives a better clinical outcome than an approach with standardized systolic BP targets.

Methods

The INDIVIDUATE study (Individualized Blood Pressure Management During Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke Under Procedural Sedation) is a randomized clinical trial with a prospective randomized open blinded end point (PROBE) design. Patients were recruited between October 1, 2020 and July 7, 2022 at a single center at a tertiary care university hospital. Patients were eligible, when they were suffering from acute ischemic stroke of the anterior circulation with occlusions of the internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of ≥ 8 receiving endovascular stroke treatment in procedural sedation. The intervention consists of an individualized BP management strategy, where preinterventional baseline systolic BP (SBP) values are used as intraprocedural BP targets. As a control, the standard treatment aims to maintain the intraprocedural SBP between 140 and 180 mmHg. The main prespecified outcome is the proportion of favorable functional outcomes 90 days after stroke, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2.

Results

Two hundred fifty patients were enrolled and included in the analysis, mean (SD) age was 77 (12) years, 142 (57%) patients were women, and mean (SD) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 17 (5.2). In all, 123 (49%) patients were treated with individualized and 127 (51%) with standard BP management. Mean (SD) intraprocedural SBP was similar in the individualized versus standard BP management group (157 [19] versus 154 [18] mmHg; P = 0.16). The rate of favorable functional outcome after 3 months was not significantly different between the individualized versus the standard BP management group (25% versus 24%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.41–1.61]; P = 0.56).

Conclusions

Among patients treated with endovascular stroke treatment due to an acute ischemic stroke of the anterior circulation, no significant difference was seen between the individualized BP management strategy, where intraprocedural SBP was targeted to baseline values, and the standardized regimen of targeting SBP between 140 and 180 mmHg.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage [^eeae6633]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal blood pressure (BP) management in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial. These European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations to assist physicians in their clinical decisions regarding BP management in acute stroke. The guidelines were developed according to the ESO standard operating procedure and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The working group identified relevant clinical questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and made specific recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided where insufficient evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. Despite several large randomised-controlled clinical trials, quality of evidence is generally low due to inconsistent results of the effect of blood pressure lowering in AIS. We recommend early and modest blood pressure control (avoiding blood pressure levels > 180/105mmHg) in AIS patients undergoing reperfusion therapies. There is more high-quality randomised evidence for BP lowering in acute ICH, where intensive blood pressure lowering is recommended rapidly after hospital presentation with the intent to improve recovery by reducing haematoma expansion. These guidelines provide further recommendations on blood pressure thresholds and for specific patient subgroups. There is ongoing uncertainty regarding the most appropriate blood pressure management in AIS and ICH. Future randomised-controlled clinical trials are needed to inform decision making on thresholds, timing and strategy of blood pressure lowering in different acute stroke patient subgroups.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^b8b3feef]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Hypertension management in carotid atherosclerosis — Elevated blood pressure increases the risk for stroke, and reducing blood pressure decreases the risk for stroke, with each 10-mm Hg increase in blood pressure resulting in an increase in risk for stroke of 30% to 45% and each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure amongst hypertensive patients decreasing the risk for stroke by 33%. Lowering blood pressure to a target < 140/90 mm Hg by lifestyle interventions and antihypertensive treatment is recommended in individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, and aggressive lowering of blood pressure may harm patients who have had a recent stroke by reducing cerebral perfusion. However, antihypertensive therapy aimed at reducing blood pressure to < 140/90 is recommended for patients who have had an ischemic stroke or TIA and are beyond the hyperacute period.

### Translesional pressure gradient alters relationship between blood pressure and recurrent stroke in intracranial stenosis [^eac891dd]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- There is debate over an optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) in secondary stroke prevention of patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS). We investigated whether translesional pressure gradient across sICAS would alter the relationship between SBP and risk of recurrent stroke in such patients. Methods- We recruited patients with sICAS (50%-99% stenosis) confirmed in computed tomography angiography. We simulated blood flow across sICAS with computed tomography angiography-based computational fluid dynamics models. Translesional pressure ratio (PR = Pressure post-stenotic /Pressure pre-stenotic) was calculated in each case. Pressure ratio (PR) ≤ median was defined as low PR, indicating larger translesional pressure gradient across sICAS. All patients received optimal medical treatment. We investigated the interaction of translesional PR and mean SBP during follow-up (SBP FU) in determining the risk of the primary outcome, recurrent ischemic stroke in the same territory within 1 year. Results- Among 157 patients with sICAS, the median PR was 0.93. Multivariate Cox regression revealed significant PR-SBP FU interaction on the primary outcome (P = 0.008): in patients with normal PR, risk of primary outcome significantly decreased with lower SBP FU (hazard ratio for 10 mmHg decrement = 0.46; P = 0.018); however, in those with low PR, SBP FU ≤ 130 mmHg was associated with significantly increased risk of primary outcome, compared with 130 < SBP FU < 150 mmHg (hazard ratio = 5.08; P = 0.043). Conclusions- Low SBP level may be associated with increased risk of stroke recurrence in patients with sICAS with a large translesional pressure gradient. Translesional PR by computational fluid dynamics models may yield a promising indicator to guide more individualized blood pressure management in patients with sICAS, warranting future studies.

Risk factors management

Neurologists and study investigators at each site will be responsible for the management of patients' risk factors. They receive training on risk factors management according to Chinese Stroke Association guidelines for the clinical management of cerebrovascular disorders. All study investigators are regularly trained according to BASIS protocol every 6 months. If a patient fails to reach the target, a face-to-face follow-up with the local neurologist to modify their medical regime will be necessary.

Blood pressure management

Blood pressure will be checked at screening, randomisation, discharge, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 1 year and the end of the trial. Patients may need to visit local sites for blood pressure measurement and medical regime modification if necessary. The target blood pressure is no more than 140 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) and no more than 130 mm Hg/80 mm Hg for patients with DM. Antihypertensive drugs include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril 10 mg or 40 mg), angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan 16 mg or 32 mg), beta-blocker (atenolol 50 mg or 100 mg), calcium channel antagonist (felodipine 5 mg or 10 mg), diuretic, vasodilator (hydralazine 50 mg), etc.

Achieving target LDL cholesterol

The baseline serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) level is recorded before enrolment. The target LDL-c level is < 1.8 mmol/L or 70 mg/dL. If the patient's LDL level is higher than the target level, he/she should modify the lipid-lowering drugs. Liver enzyme (Aspartate aminotransferase/Alaninetransaminase) levels will be measured at the beginning of the study and at each visit point.

Non-HDL cholesterol

The target level of nonhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is < 100 mg/dL. Non-HDL cholesterol includes low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very-low-density lipoproteins and intermediate-density lipoproteins. When a larger statin dosage fails to lower LDL level, while non-HDL cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL and triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL, other lipid-lowering drugs in addition to statin are recommended, such as ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

Diabetes management

The target of DM management is to achieve HbA1c < 7.0%. Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels will be measured at baseline, 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year.

### Magnitude of systolic blood pressure reduction following endovascular treatment and clinical outcomes in acute large artery occlusion stroke [^10418715]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently, endovascular treatment (EVT) has become the standard of treatment for patients experiencing acute large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS) in both anterior and posterior circulation. Moreover, with the development of thrombectomy technology, the indications for EVT are gradually expanding. However, it should be noted that more than 50% of patients who receive EVT have not gained functional independence despite the achievement of successful vessel recanalisation. Apart from the advancements in thrombectomy technology, improving periprocedural management may further enhance patient outcomes.

Blood pressure (BP) is a crucial, potentially modifiable factor that can improve favourable neurological outcomes in patients undergoing acute reperfusion therapy. In the setting of acute ischaemic stroke, initial BP is often elevated to augment blood flow via collateral circulation to the ischaemic region. However, higher systemic BP may worsen clinical outcomes through increased risks of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) or cerebral oedema after successful EVT. Therefore, lowering BP following EVT has been recognised as an acceptable clinical practice, as shown by a survey conducted among StrokeNet institutions. However, a meta-analysis of recent randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on early intensive BP management after successful reperfusion following EVT showed that aggressive post-EVT BP reduction did not provide clinical benefits and may pose risks.

The Outcome in Patients Treated With Intra-Arterial Thrombectomy–Optimal Blood Pressure Control (OPTIMAL-BP) trialshowed that intensive BP management (< 140 mm Hg) was associated with worse functional outcomes than conventional BP management (140–180 mm Hg) in successful EVT patients, which is consistent with the results of the Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombectomy Stroke Study (ENCHANTED2/MT). The BP Target in Acute Stroke to Reduce Haemorrhage After Endovascular Therapy (BP-TARGET) trialindicated that the intensive systolic BP (SBP) management of 100–129 mm Hg following successful recanalisation did not reduce the rate of ICH as compared with the conventional SBP management of 130–185 mm Hg. However, the level of intensive BP management in these RCTs was not unified, and how the magnitude of BP reduction determined high or low risk of harms was unclear.

In view of the former considerations, we performed an investigation to explore the effect of the magnitude of SBP reduction (SBPr) after EVT on outcomes in LVOS patients. We further analysed the association between BP drop and prognosis among different subgroups.

### Effect of haemodynamics on the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with severe vertebral artery stenosis [^36415a11]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately one-fifth of all ischaemic strokes occur in the posterior circulation system, and steno-occlusive disease of the vertebrobasilar arteries is an important underlying pathophysiological mechanism responsible for approximately one-quarter of these ischaemic stroke cases. Emerging data have suggested that vertebrobasilar stenosis predicts recurrent ischaemic events whose average annual incidence rate is 10%–15%. Therefore, effective secondary prevention strategies are important.

Endovascular treatment (EVT) of vertebral artery (VA) stenosis with the use of stents is a promising option and is widely implemented in clinical practice. However, both the Vertebral Artery Stenting Trial (VAST)and the Vertebral Artery Ischemia Stenting Trial (VIST)have failed to demonstrate the superiority of stenting in preventing recurrent strokes in patients with symptomatic VA stenosis compared with optimal medical management. Based on data from the above trials, many experts have suggested that the current treatment strategies should be revised to provide optimal individualised care for all patients. Many issues need to be discussed before deciding to perform revascularisation, even in patients with severe VA stenosis. Considering the periprocedural risks associated with endovascular therapy, angioplasty and stenting are more likely to benefit specific groups of patients with the highest risk of ischaemic events.

It is now recognised that haemodynamic insufficiency plays an important role in the aetiology of stroke associated with VA stenosis. Colour duplex ultrasonography (CDU) is a dynamic real-time tool for the quantitative measurement of blood flow velocities and volumes. Given that EVT does not significantly benefit patients with symptomatic VA stenosis and the need for revising current treatment strategies for individualised patient care, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between net VA flow volume (NVAFV) and the risk of posterior circulation infarction (PCI) to find the high-risk patient population who could benefit from revascularisation.

### Cerebrovascular disease and stroke [^8349851a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Haemorrhagic stroke

The management strategy should ensure optimal intravascular volume, normothermia and normoglycaemia. A neurosurgical opinion is mandatory for the discussion of haematoma drainage and the management of complications, including hydrocephalus, vasospasm, perihaematomal oedema and brain shift. Intracranial pressure monitoring and osmotherapy targeted at maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure may be required. Fluid restriction is not advisable initially but may be initiated if there is evidence of inappropriate ADH release. Vasospasm may complicate subarachnoid haemorrhage, is detectable by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and treatable with calcium channel antagonists. Blood pressure control is a controversial topic as perfusion pressure must be maintained while the risk of recurrent haemorrhage may mandate avoidance of hypertension before definitive vascular treatment. If there is an underlying AVM or aneurysm, the recurrence riskmeans that a vascular team with considerable experience should evaluate and decide between the management options (neurosurgery, neuroradiology or stereotactic radiotherapy) once the patient has recovered from the acute phase.

Ischaemic stroke

Some children presenting with AIS/VST are candidates for acute interventions (figs 3 and 4) after neuroimaging and paediatric neurological consultation. –

Transfusion for acute stroke in sickle cell disease

The population with sickle cell disease provides an ideal model for proactive stroke prevention as the majority of strokes are predicted by TCD. Blood transfusion is a mainstay of stroke preventionas well as acute stroke management. Transfusion should commence within 2–4 h of presentation with neurological deficit; emergency exchange, rather than top-up, transfusion at the time of first stroke appears to be associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The aim is to reduce the HbS % to ≤ 30% with a haematocrit of > 30%. Pathology can include haemorrhage, VST, RPLS, acute necrotising encephalitis and arterial dissection as well as territorial infarction secondary to arterial stenosis and "silent" or covert injury, generally in the watershed regions (fig 1F 3) and often associated with transient neurological symptoms and signs rather than overt stroke. If available, emergency MR may guide management.

### Impaired perfusion modifies the relationship between blood pressure and stroke risk in major cerebral artery disease [^4e92c6cb]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusive disease, chronic reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure (chronic haemodynamic compromise) increases the risk of ischaemic strokeand can be detected by directly measuring haemodynamic parameters. Accurate evaluation of haemodynamic status is essential for determining patient prognosis. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies to prevent recurrent strokes should differ between patients with and without haemodynamic compromise. However, strategies for selecting treatments based on haemodynamic measurements have not been clearly established.

Identification of patients with impaired perfusion may be essential for informing the proper control of blood pressure (BP) to reduce stroke recurrence. Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, and antihypertensive therapy provides general benefits to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). However, the level to which BP should be lowered to achieve maximal benefits among survivors of stroke and TIAs is not precisely known, although post hoc analysis of PROGRESSsuggests a goal < 130 mm Hg systolic BP (SBP). However, there had been concern that lowering BP might impair cerebral perfusion in patients with atherosclerotic ICA or MCA occlusive diseaseand thereby increase stroke risk. Previous studies have demonstrated that the risk of stroke increases with BP in the great majority of patients with stenosis of the extracranial ICA or intracranial large artery, while patients with symptomatic bilateral carotid stenosis > 70% exhibit an inverse relationship between BP and stroke risk. Notably, these studies did not include direct evaluations of baseline patient haemodynamic status. They also did not include patients with symptomatic occlusion of the major cerebral arteries, in which the incidence of impaired perfusion is greater than in patients with stenosis of the major cerebral arteries. Thus, the interpretation of these studies was limited by the fact that the proportion of patients with impaired perfusion was unknown and potentially low. The relationship between BP and stroke risk in patients with impaired perfusion may be different from that in patients without impaired perfusion, and lower BP in this specific population may increase recurrent stroke risk. Therefore, a more thorough characterisation of the relationships among perfusion, BP and stroke risk should be performed to inform selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen for individual patients.

In this study, we retrospectively analysed the relationship between BP during follow-up and stroke risk in a population of a relatively large number of patients with symptomatic ICA or MCA occlusion. We quantitatively evaluated baseline haemodynamic status with positron emission tomography (PET) and 15 O-gas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among BP, impaired perfusion and recurrent stroke risk in symptomatic major cerebral artery occlusive disease.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage [^b372bf47]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) are common in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the pathophysiology of the hypertensive response is poorly understood. Despite considerable research effort, the optimal post-stroke blood pressure management in these conditions remains controversial and unresolved. As randomised-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of this topic are limited and challenging, clinical decisions are often made on the basis of observational studies that are prone to bias, confounding and random error. – Theoretical concepts and pathophysiological arguments are used to defend arguments for and against alteration of blood pressure in the setting of acute stroke; to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence, cerebral oedema, reperfusion haemorrhage for AIS patients after reperfusion therapies, and reduce haematoma expansion and cerebral oedema in ICH; to avoid impairment of cerebral perfusion to viable ischaemic tissue in the presence of altered autoregulation. Whilst most attention has been focused on the avoidance of hypertension, drug-induced hypertension has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to increase cerebral perfusion in some AIS patients.

Although numerous observational studies have shown that both extremely low and high blood pressure levels are associated with worse outcomes in AIS and ICH patients, – there has been inconsistency in results from multiple RCTs of different antihypertensive strategies for acute stroke subtypes.

Here, we update previous guidelines from the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) on the management of acute blood pressure in AISand ICH, this including new RCTs and individual patient data meta-analyses (IPDM) that have been published since 2008and 2014respectively. We review current evidence and provide recommendations for blood pressure management (both blood pressure reduction and augmentation) in patients with acute stroke; including recommendations for blood pressure management in the pre-hospital setting, according to eligibility for reperfusion treatment in AIS and separately for patients with acute ICH. Our goal was to facilitate decision-making in these patient groups where there is considerable ongoing uncertainty over optimal post-stroke blood pressure management.

### Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes: diagnosis and management [^1679bdbf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

One in five strokes affects the posterior circulation. Diagnosing posterior circulation stroke can be challenging, as the vascular anatomy can be variable, and because presenting symptoms are often non-specific and fluctuating. Nevertheless, making the correct diagnosis is important, as these strokes have a high chance of recurrence, can be life threatening, and can lead to equally life-threatening complications. Investigation and management largely follow those for stroke in general, although some specific differences exist. These include the preferred use of MRI for diagnosing posterior fossa lesions, the management of basilar artery thrombosis, which may have a longer time window for recanalisation therapy, and the use of endovascular therapies for secondary prevention, which, so far, have not shown any benefit in the treatment of vertebral or basilar artery stenosis. In this review, we summarise the anatomy, aetiology and presentation of posterior circulation stroke, and discuss current approaches to management.

Endovascular thrombectomy blood pressure management — randomized evidence in the acute post-procedural period shows similar rates of any and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage when comparing systolic blood pressure (SBP) goals of 110 to 129 mm Hg versus 130 to 185 mm Hg, while more intensive targets were harmful; ENCHANTED-2 MT comparing < 120 mm Hg to 140 to 180 mm Hg was stopped early due to increased worse global disability (OR: 1.53 [95% CI: 1.18–1.97]), OPTIMAL BP comparing < 140 mm Hg to 140 to 180 mm Hg was stopped early with fewer improved outcomes at 90 days (modified Rankin scale score 0 to 2 of 39.4% vs 54.4%), and BEST-II found an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg was potentially harmful on a utility-weighted modified Rankin score. For neurologically stable outpatients with cerebrovascular disease, data support an SBP/DBP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a lower limit of BP within the normal range, and the optimal timing for BP reduction after stroke is unclear.

### Sentinel angiographic signs of cerebral hyperperfusion after angioplasty and stenting of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis: a technical note [^ec073d82]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is a serious complication of endovascular angioplasty and stent placement for long-standing intracranial stenosis, resulting in neurologic dysfunction, seizure, or reperfusion hemorrhage. Rigorous control of blood pressure is commonly used in the perioperative period to prevent cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, but the optimal blood pressure is often arbitrary. We describe the angiographic features that reflect impaired cerebral autoregulation and microvascular transit abnormality, which may be used to gauge the optimal blood pressure parameters in the immediate postintervention period for prevention of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome.

### Blood pressure management for ischemic stroke in the first 24 hours [^c5808aef]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is common after ischemic stroke and associated with a poor functional outcome and increased mortality. The conundrum then arises on whether to lower BP to improve outcome or whether this will worsen cerebral perfusion due to aberrant cerebral autoregulation. A number of large trials of BP lowering have failed to change outcome whether treatment was started prehospital in the community or hospital. Hence, nuances on how to manage high BP are likely, including whether different interventions are needed for different causes, the type and timing of the drug, how quickly BP is lowered, and the collateral effects of the drug, including on cerebral perfusion and platelets. Specific scenarios are also important, including when to lower BP before, during, and after intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy/thrombectomy, when it may be necessary to raise BP, and when antihypertensive drugs taken before stroke should be restarted. This narrative review addresses these and other questions. Although further large trials are ongoing, it is increasingly likely that there is no simple answer. Different subgroups of patients may need to have their BP lowered (eg, before or after thrombolysis), left alone, or elevated.

What Would a Clinic Targeting High‐RiskPatients Look Like? How About in Countries With Limited Resources?

We believe that this is a fundamental concept if we truly want to tackle cSVD and prevent its consequences, although the concept of high‐risk cSVD clinics needs further research to support its structured implementation. We suggest that such clinics should be directed primarily toward high‐risk patients, the most obvious being those where the goal is secondary prevention (ie, those with established cardiovascular events) but also targeting patients who show a high‐risk profile in a primary prevention context (ie, patients with a high vascular risk factor profile with high cSVD burden). High cSVD burden may be defined on the basis of severe manifestations of individual cSVD markers or composite scores that capture the burden of multiple cSVD manifestations.

A high‐risk cSVD clinic should be multidisciplinary. Although all vascular risk factors can be addressed at an initial single time point simultaneously, and treated, because of the complexity of some of these patients, there is a frequent requirement for expertise in the treatment of each risk factor, and when such expertise is available, it should be pursued. Most cases could be treated and monitored by primary care providers, but there are frequently patients where the expertise of other providers is needed such as vascular neurologists, diabetes experts, hyperlipidemia experts, enrollment in smoking cessation programs, nutritionist consultations, rehabilitation medicine involvement, social work participation, and healthy lifestyle enhancement. The foundation for each intervention is education, and while education alone is not sufficient, we submit that patients and family members alike should be educated. Participation of family members is crucial and offers the advantage of targeting many individuals at the same time.

A practical approach when simultaneous assessment and treatment of multiple vascular risk factors is unlikely to be effective, could be to target 1 risk factor, 1 patient at a time. We would suggest addressing hypertension as a priority. Although not all studies support aggressive blood pressure lowering, treatment of hypertension is clearly beneficial for cardiovascular risk reduction and should be a priority. The level of blood pressure control, however, requires further research. Other risk factors including hyperlipidemia, smoking cessation, healthy lifestyle, and diabetes also need to be targeted, and research is needed to determine the individual contribution and their cumulative treatment effect in cSVD management. It is important to note the significance of uncontrolled diabetes in worsening the remainder of cardiovascular risk factors. The Table summarizes the available guidelines and the treatment targets that can be implemented in the care of patients with cSVD.

### Thrombectomy for primary distal posterior cerebral artery occlusion stroke… [^a0cf237c]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Improvement of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores and differences were compared by treatment group and stratified by subgroups. IVT indicates intravenous thrombolysis. Functional outcome rates at 90 days were stratified and compared by treatment status after propensity score matching. eMethods. Propensity Matching Score Analysis. Interventions Mechanical thrombectomy or standard medical treatment with or without IVT. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical end point was the improvement of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores at discharge from baseline. Safety end point was the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhagic complications were classified based on the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study. Functional outcome was evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale score at 90-day follow-up.

Significant treatment effects of mechanical thrombectomy were observed in the subgroup of patients who had higher NIHSS scores on admission of 10 points or higher and in the subgroup of patients without IVT. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 4 of 92 patients in each treatment cohort. The most common cardiovascular risk factors were arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Diabetes as a cardiovascular risk factor was significantly higher in the standard medical treatment cohort vs the mechanical thrombectomy cohort. After PSM, the median baseline NIHSS score had decreased at discharge to −2 points in the mechanical thrombectomy cohort and −1. 5 points in the standard medical treatment cohort.

The binary ENI was observed in 36 of 85 patients in the mechanical thrombectomy cohort and 32 of 86 in the standard medical treatment cohort.

### Prevalence, predictors, and prognosis of symptomatic intracranial stenosis in patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke: a population-based cohort study [^1c1470b5]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The impact of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews depends on the external validity (or generalisability) — ie, the extent to which the results apply to a definable group of patients in a particular setting. Both SAMMPRIS and VISSIT had young cohorts, due to the exclusion of elderly patients, and reported lower than predicted recurrent event rates on medical treatment alone. Our findings in a population-based cohort, including many older patients, nevertheless supports the external validity of the trials.

The low risk of stroke on medical treatment alone in SAMMPRIS has been suggested to be due to the intensity of risk factor management. The patients in OXVASC also received intensive medical management, similar to that of both SAMMPRIS and VISSIT. This consisted of dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) for the first month with clopidogrel or aspirin monotherapy thereafter, high-intensity statin treatment and ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure (target of < 130/80 mm Hg). Patients were also given advice on smoking cessation, exercise, and diet and were regularly followed-up by study research nurses to ensure medication compliance and adequate blood pressure control. For example, in patients with 50–99% symptomatic intracranial stenosis, systolic blood pressure was reduced by about 20 mm Hg between baseline and 1-month follow-up.

### Relationship between risk factor control and vascular events in the SAMMPRIS trial [^f748588c]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study is the first stroke prevention trial to include protocol-driven intensive management of multiple risk factors. In this prespecified analysis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between risk factor control during follow-up and outcome of patients in the medical arm of SAMMPRIS.

Methods

Data from SAMMPRIS participants in the medical arm (n = 227) were analyzed. Risk factors were recorded at baseline, 30 days, 4 months, and then every 4 months for a mean follow-up of 32 months. For each patient, values for all risk factor measures were averaged and dichotomized as in or out of target.

Results

Participants who were out of target for systolic blood pressure and physical activity, as well as those with higher mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein, were more likely to have a recurrent vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) at 3 years compared to those who had good risk factor control. In the multivariable analysis, greater physical activity decreased the likelihood of a recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death (odds ratio 0.6, confidence interval 0.4–0.8).

Conclusions

Raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical inactivity should be aggressively treated in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis to prevent future vascular events. Physical activity, which has not received attention in stroke prevention trials, was the strongest predictor of a good outcome in the medical arm in SAMMPRIS.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8ba4fcda]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention and hypertension management — outpatient primary care includes confirming the cause of the stroke and prioritizing indicated diagnostic tests, especially carotid imaging and cardiac rhythm monitoring; despite careful searching, the cause remains uncertain for ≈30% of patients. Class 1 treatment recommendations include carotid revascularization for carotid stenosis, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, blood pressure (BP) lowering, statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, and class 1 recommendations for lifestyle improvement, diabetes management, and weight optimization. Hypertension is common (50% to 80% of patients) and BP lowering after stroke reduces recurrence risk by 30% to 40%, with trials using indapamide alone and perindopril with the addition of indapamide as needed. The 2021 AHA/American Stroke Association guideline cites moderate-quality evidence to strongly recommend a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg after ischemic stroke for most patients, and treatment tolerance, safety, and patient characteristics are considerations for target BP.

### Best evidence for medical therapy for carotid artery stenosis [^a09567c9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Carotid atheromatous disease is an important cause of stroke and represents a key target in stroke prevention. Randomized trials have shown the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in secondary stroke prevention. Carotid stenting presents a less invasive alternative to surgical intervention. Advances in medical management, if compliance can be ensured, are leading to improvement in outcomes when implemented as sole therapy in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. This includes lifestyle modification, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet and statin therapy. Over the last 20 years, the annual rate of ipsilateral stroke associated with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has decreased from 2% to 4% to less than 1%. This is largely due to improvements in medical therapy. However, despite numerous trials and years of clinical research, the optimal management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease remains controversial. This article presents and summarizes the evidence supporting best medical treatment for carotid artery stenosis.

### Early vs delayed antihypertensive treatment in acute single subcortical infarction: a secondary analysis of the CATIS-2 randomized clinical trial [^bf1d683f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Single subcortical infarction (SSI) is typically characterized as a single subcortical lesion within the territory of perforating arteries, accounting for 20% to 30% of all ischemic strokes. Elevated blood pressure (BP) is more obvious in the acute phase among patients with SSI compared with other stroke subtypes and is associated with adverse prognosis. Therefore, BP management of this important stroke subtype is worth exploring.

There have been studies investigating the optimal target of BP reduction in patients with SSI. Although, the timing of initiating antihypertensive treatment was not considered in investigating the associations between BP levels and outcomes of patients with SSI in these studies. A recent registry study suggested different relationships between systolic BP (SBP) levels measured at different time points after stroke and the functional outcomes in patients with SSI. However, with limited evidence on the effects of antihypertensive treatments initiating at different time points after stroke on outcomes of patients with SSI, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of initiating antihypertensive treatment in such patients.

SSI was often considered as a lacunar stroke or cryptogenic stroke previously, while emerging evidence has suggested different etiologies of SSI. Either lipohyalinosis and fibrinoid degeneration of perforators or parent artery atherosclerosis blocking the orifice of perforators could cause SSI. SSI with coexisting parent artery disease (PAD) are common in Asian populations, among whom intracranial artery stenosis is prevalent. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether presence of PAD stenosis would affect the association between BP management strategy and outcomes of patients with SSI.

China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke-2 (CATIS-2), a multicenter randomized clinical trial, found that early antihypertensive treatment starting within the first 24 to 48 hours did not reduce the odds of dependency or death at 90 days among patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), compared with delayed treatment starting on day 8 after randomization. We conducted a subgroup analysis of the CATIS-2 trial to investigate the association of early vs delayed antihypertensive treatment with clinical outcomes in patients with acute SSI, and to evaluate such associations by the presence of PAD stenosis.

### The critical balance: understanding blood pressure and intracranial hemorrhage association in endovascular stroke therapy [^c84ab26b]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Managing blood pressure before, during, and after treating acute ischemic stroke presents a significant challenge. On one hand, elevated blood pressure helps maintain collaterals in the context of an acute vessel occlusion. On the other hand, high blood pressure, particularly during intravenous thrombolysis, carries the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and low blood pressure can accelerate the breakdown of the collateral blood supply, leading to larger infarcts. Post-therapy, both high blood pressure and high variability in blood pressure lead to poorer outcomes and increased risks of intracranial hemorrhage, especially when anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs are necessary, such as in cases of extracranial stenting. The nuances of blood pressure management during endovascular therapy are even less understood. Theoretically, maintaining elevated blood pressure is desirable as long as the vessel remains occluded, while aiming for lower or normal blood pressure is advisable once the vessel is recanalized, due to the increased risk of reperfusion injury. However, even highly individualized approaches to blood pressure management during endovascular therapy have shown no significant benefit over standardized regimens targeting systolic blood pressure.

Moreover, assessing the risk of hemorrhage after endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke typically involves standard CT scans 24 h post-therapy, where blood–brain barrier disruption can lead to hemorrhage overestimation due to overlapping aspects with contrast enhancement.

Robbe et al. address these topics in their study in the current issue. Firstly, they examined patients within 3 h after endovascular therapy using dual-energy CT to differentiate between contrast enhancement and hemorrhage. Secondly, they correlated the findings with blood pressure measurements taken during endovascular therapy. They discovered an association between elevated blood pressure and parenchymal hemorrhage. Interestingly, extraparenchymal hemorrhage, not uncommon after endovascular therapy, was not associated with higher blood pressure but rather with technical aspects of the procedure.

However, as is often the case, correlation does not imply causation, and these results should be interpreted cautiously. While patients with extraparenchymal hemorrhage did not exhibit higher rates of elevated blood pressure, supporting the hypothesis that hemorrhage alone is not a cause for excess blood pressure, patients with parenchymal hemorrhage had a higher rate of preexisting hypertension (69% vs. 50%) and previous antiplatelet medication use (62% vs. 33%) compared to the non-hemorrhage group. These patients might inherently possess a higher risk of microvascular injury due to their preexisting conditions and blood pressure adjustment may be more challenging due to potential chronic changes in cerebral autoregulation.

### Prognostic significance of pulse pressure variability during mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke patients [^a2923b62]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

An extensive literature of BP control trials in the acute phase never showed any advantage of BP lowering. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 However, these studies included intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t‐PA)‐treated patients, where the arterial status was not systematically monitored during the reperfusion therapy. As a consequence, the absence or presence of LVO and recanalization rates were not known. We may anticipate different impact of BP lowering therapies in the presence or absence of persistent intracranial occluded arteries. In the new era of MT, new studies are needed to test the effectiveness of BP reduction in the acute phase in selected patients (eg, in recanalized patients).

We must acknowledge some limitations to our study. Firstly, even though patients were included in a prospective registry, a selection bias cannot be ruled out. However, baseline characteristics of included patients were similar to those of randomized trials. 37 Secondly, we included anterior and posterior circulation strokes, essentially to have a pragmatic approach of stroke management. But BP pathophysiology and optimal management could strongly differ between anterior and posterior circulation strokes and hence limit the generalizability of our findings. Thirdly, the absence of association between BP variability and unfavorable functional outcomes (mRS 3–6) for SBP variability could be because of the small sample of our study. Further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm those results. Fourth, although PP was measured in peripheral and might not strictly reflect central arterial stiffness, in elderly patients (as it was the case in this study), peripheral‐central PP discrepancies tend to decrease because of a higher degree of central arterial stiffness. 38

### Mortality and disability according to baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients treated by thrombectomy: a collaborative pooled analysis [^f3632b58]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that the BP target in AIS patients should be maintained below 220/120 mm Hg and below 185/110 mm Hg in patients eligible for IV tPA. 30, 31, 32 The latest guidelines for patients who qualify for MT target 180/110 mm Hg, 13 but evidence supporting these guidelines is limited and, for some of them, based on extrapolation from data in acute myocardial infarction. 33, 34 Our results suggesting a SBP threshold of 180 mm Hg for favorable outcome reinforces the current guidelines. Ongoing trials (eg, ENCHANTED [Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis in Stroke Study] 35) will test whether intensive BP lowering with a SBP target of 140 mm Hg improves outcomes with a lower intracranial hemorrhagic risk. We know from the SITS‐MOST study (10 812 patients included) that high baseline SBP is associated with an increased sICH risk. 36 Among IV tPA‐treated patients presenting with a SBP > 180 mm Hg, the sICH risk reaches 12.4%, a number significantly over those reported in the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study or SITS‐MOST, respectively 5.3% and 1.9%. In our study the threshold of 180 mm Hg for SBP was associated with a worse functional outcome but not with sICH hemorrhage. The small numbers of sICH events in the present study may account for the absence of detected effect of SBP. Additional limits of the study include the characteristics of the population, which comes from a registry of AIS patients with LVO of anterior and posterior circulation. These findings cannot be extrapolated to other populations. The effect of BP may be different considering younger or older populations or a higher prevalence of patients with unstable coronary disease. In addition, we could not exclude bias in estimates from complete‐cases analysis due to missing data on outcome and BP values. Indeed, we observed some large differences in regression estimates for favorable outcome between primary analysis (complete case) and sensitivity analysis (multiple imputation). These differences could be explained by a greater time to groin puncture from symptom onset and a lower isolated MCA occlusion rate in missing cases compared to nonmissing cases, underlying a not completely at random missing data mechanism. Finally, this analysis focuses on one time point of a patient's management, and BP levels within the first few hours and over 24 hours would have been informative. It underestimates the role of other parameters such as BP variability or antihypertensive agents received during stroke management or socioeconomic status that may have had an impact on prognosis. Although we did not adjust for each antihypertensive agent, the results were adjusted for presence of antihypertensive therapy. Further studies including BP measures during and after MT are needed to clarify the impact of BP variability and BP treatment on mortality, disability, and hemorrhagic transformation. 37

Conclusions

Among patients who received EVT due to LVOS in the anterior circulation, a significant drop in SBP might be related to a poor functional outcome and a reduced incidence of sICH. Several factors need to be considered in the periprocedural BP management, such as baseline ASPECT score. Our study provides new insights for individualised BP management. A further study with a prospective design investigating the optimisation of periprocedural BP management in EVT is needed.

Current Guideline Recommendations

In addition to the European Stroke Organization guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, several recent stroke-specific guidelines also provide detailed recommendations on blood pressure management in the acute phase of hemorrhagic, and ischemic stroke (Table 1). The recommendations for hemorrhagic stroke are straightforward and consistent between various guidelines. The recommendations for ischemic stroke, however, are complicated, not only because of weak evidence, but also because of the complexity in the treatment, such as the use of intravenous thrombolysis and more recently arterial mechanical thrombectomy.

Table 1.
Current guideline recommendations on blood pressure goals in acute stroke

The recent guideline recommendations for blood pressure management in acute hemorrhagic stroke were heavily influenced by the results of the intensive blood pressure reduction in an acute intracerebral hemorrhage trial (INETERACT), which is the largest ever blood pressure lowering trial in acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Although the benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering to a level of 140 mm Hg systolic was only borderline significant, it provided evidence that early intensive blood pressure was safe and probably beneficial in functional recovery in those patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke and systolic blood pressure of 150–220 mm Hg. The AHA/American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines substantially simplified the recommendations that in patients with a systolic blood pressure of 150–220 mm Hg and without contraindication to acute blood pressure treatment acute systolic blood pressure lowering to 140 mm Hg is safe and can be effective for improving functional outcome. This AHA/ASA guidelines continued to recommend aggressive blood pressure reduction with a continuous intravenous infusion and frequent blood pressure monitoring in those patients with a systolic blood pressure of ≥ 220 mm Hg. The subsequent Canadianand Europeanguidelines provided similar recommendations.

### Intensive blood pressure control may not be safe in subacute ischemic stroke by intracranial atherosclerosis: a result of randomized trial [^84e21a65]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Current guideline recommends intensive blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients, but the appropriate target BP level after ischemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis remains uncertain.

Methods

In this randomized, single-blinded trial, patients with symptomatic internal carotid or middle cerebral artery steno-occlusion (> 50%) within 7–42 days after index stroke received intensive (target SBP < 120mmHg) or modest (target SBP < 140mmHg) BP control from April 2010 to December 2012. The primary outcome was the change in ischemic lesion volume in white matter lesions at the whole forebrain between baseline and 24 weeks as measured from fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, which was tested in noninferiority test (noninferiority margin of 3cm).

Results

Among 132 patients, follow-up FLAIR images were available in 111 (59 in the intensive and 52 in the moderate BP control groups). After 24 weeks, the SBP in the intensive group was significantly lower (124.6 ± 10.5mmHg) than in the modest group (132.3 ± 10.6mmHg). The ischemic lesion volume increased more in the intensive group (4.9 ± 18.3cm) than the modest group (2.2 ± 8.2cm), which failed to prove noninferiority. The frequency of new ischemic lesions on 24-week FLAIR images was nonsignificantly higher in the intensive group than the modest group [10 (16.9%) vs. 5 (9.6%), respectively; P = 0.26)]. Only one recurrent stroke developed during the study period in each group.

Conclusion

Intensive BP control in intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis patients failed to prove noninferiority compared with modest BP control, and may increase ischemic lesion volume in the subacute stage.

### Perioperative neurological evaluation and management to lower the risk of acute stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac, nonneurological surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^743fc3f3]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association perioperative stroke prevention in noncardiac, nonneurological surgery — this scientific statement summarizes established risk factors, preoperative and intraoperative strategies to mitigate perioperative stroke risk, postoperative assessment suggestions, and treatment approaches to minimize permanent neurological dysfunction in patients who experience perioperative stroke. Preoperative optimization includes the role of preoperative carotid revascularization in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and delaying surgery in patients with recent strokes. Intraoperative strategies to reduce risk focus on blood pressure control, perioperative goal-directed therapy, blood transfusion, and anesthetic technique. The statement also presents strategies for evaluation and treatment of suspected perioperative strokes and highlights the value of rapid recognition of strokes and the early use of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical embolectomy in appropriate patients.

### Individualized autoregulation-guided arterial blood pressure management in neurocritical care [^7489dd6f]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Transcranial Doppler (TCD)

TCD is a noninvasive monitoring modality that can measure CBF velocities and has been well-validated as a surrogate measure of CBF. TCD typically measure the middle cerebral artery, but any intracranial vessel can be assessed. This technology utilizes a low frequency ultrasound probe to access intracranial vessels by transmitting ultrasound through the thinnest portions of the cranium vault, the most common areas being the temporal and suboccipital regions. The linear relationship between CBF velocities and CBF relies on the assumption that there is minimal change in large vessel diameter with changes in MAP. However, direct measurements of the cerebral arteriolar flow cannot be made with TCDs, and the above assumption may not hold true in settings where dynamic variations are ongoing in proximal blood vessels, such as during cerebral vasospasm.

The TCD waveform is closely associated with changes in perfusion, thus CA monitoring is made possible by calculating a correlation coefficient between variations in CBF velocity in response to MAP or CPP. Several different TCD-based autoregulation indices have been studied correlating changes in end-diastolic (Dx), mean (Mx), and peak systolic CBF velocities with MAP. Mx is by far the most extensively studied index and was found to have a parabolic relationship with CPP, thus allowing for the determination of a CPP Opt.

Lastly, there are limitations regarding the use of TCDs that must be acknowledged. First, TCDs are typically performed in an episodic fashion and do not provide real-time, dynamic assessment of CA. Continuous TCD monitoring is now available but is often tedious, and frequent errors occur due to displacement of probes. Moreover, TCDs require technical expertise with significant inter-operator variability and is limited in a large subset of patients (between 10 and 40 ​%) with skull anatomy precluding insonation, including hemicraniectomy or skull fractures. Finally, as discussed above, dynamic changes in proximal vessel diameters during ongoing vasospasm may impact the interpretation of TCD-based CA metrics. TCD cannot differentiate between chronic stenosis and persistent vasospasm.

### Neurocritical care and periprocedural blood pressure management in acute stroke [^9ded5463]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the literature on periprocedural blood pressure (BP) management in acute ischemic stroke and to establish guidelines regarding management of BP. These guidelines are drawn from available evidence and expert opinion. This article reviews the pathophysiologic considerations of BP in ischemic stroke. It also examines the natural history of BP changes during stroke, as well as data on induced BP reduction and hypertension, particularly in light of reperfusion therapy. Finally, the article reviews major ongoing clinical trials for BP management in this setting. Recommendations made in this article may serve as a benchmark for future research in BP management in this patient population.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^a51a5659]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

AHA/ASA scientific statement — primary care after stroke emphasizes that primary care teams provide the majority of poststroke care and, when optimally configured, provide patient-centered care to prevent recurrent stroke, maximize function, prevent late complications, and optimize quality of life. Patient-centered primary care after stroke begins with establishing the foundation for poststroke management while engaging caregivers and family members, and includes screening for complications such as depression, cognitive impairment, and fall risk as both short-term and long-term components. Patients with ongoing functional impairments may benefit from referral to appropriate services, and ongoing care consists of managing risk factors including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, carotid stenosis, and dyslipidemia. Recommendations to reduce recurrent stroke risk also include lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet and exercise, and at the system level primary care practices can use quality improvement strategies and available resources to enhance the delivery of evidence-based care and optimize outcomes.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease — BP management overview: Stroke is a major cause of death, disability, and dementia, and due to its heterogeneous causes and hemodynamic consequences, the management of BP in adults with stroke is complex and challenging. To accommodate the variety of important issues pertaining to BP management in the stroke patient, treatment recommendations require recognition of stroke acuity, stroke type, and therapeutic objectives, and future studies should focus on identifying more precise BP targets, accounting for stroke etiology, personalized cerebrovascular hemodynamics, and appropriate antihypertensive agents.

### Impaired perfusion modifies the relationship between blood pressure and stroke risk in major cerebral artery disease [^ac79f5b7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Control of BP based on haemodynamic measurements

Our results indicate that the relationship between follow-up BP level and recurrent stroke risk differs between patients with or without impaired perfusion. We observed a statistically significant interaction between the presence of impaired perfusion and the SBP–stroke risk relationship in the present study. This finding supports a previous report documenting a similar interaction between the presence of bilateral severe ICA stenosis and the SBP–stroke risk relationship that may have been influenced by the presence of impaired perfusion. Impaired perfusion is probably absent in the majority of patients with unilateral stenosis of the extracranial ICA or intracranial large artery, which may explain the reported increase in stroke risk with BP in such patients. Lower BP during follow-up may increase the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with impaired perfusion at baseline.

Aggressive medical managements for secondary prevention may progressively decrease recurrent stroke risk in patients with ICA or MCA occlusive disease in general. Treatment of hypertension may prevent progression of large or small cerebral artery disease, which may decrease stroke recurrence. BP control is also needed to prevent cerebral haemorrhage during antiplatelet therapy. However, the present results suggest that patients with impaired perfusion should be treated differently to those without. BP could be strictly controlled only in patients without impaired perfusion, but aggressive BP lowering should be avoided in patients with impaired perfusion. In the present study, patients with impaired perfusion who had normal BP (< 130 mm Hg) and recurrent stroke during a follow-up visit exhibited higher BP (≥ 130 mm Hg) at baseline, while no patients with impaired perfusion who exhibited normal BP at baseline and normal or higher BP during follow-up had recurrent stroke (data not shown). Thus, BP lowering per se, as well as a lower target BP, might be associated with stroke risk in patients with impaired perfusion. We do not recommend lowering BP to the normal level (< 130 mm Hg) in patients who had impaired perfusion and higher BP (≥ 130 mm Hg) at baseline. Treatment with antihypertensive drugs may be safe and reduce stroke recurrence only when individual haemodynamic status is correctly evaluated and an individualised goal is selected based on the presence of impaired perfusion.

### Bilateral intracranial vertebral artery disease in the new england medical center posterior circulation registry… [^6b9211e3]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

We reviewed the original imaging films when available. When films were no longer available, we relied on radiological reports and our original drawings and descriptions of the lesions. Patients with bilateral ICVA disease usually have multiple-stroke risk factors and very often have other severe occlusive lesions within the anterior and posterior circulation. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were more frequent in patients with bilateral ICVA disease than in Registry patients with other vascular lesions or in patients with unilateral ICVA disease. Most patients with bilateral ICVA occlusive disease have extensive atherosclerosis, often including the basilar and extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. The extensive intracranial occlusive posterior circulation lesions led to a tenuous circulatory equilibrium with resultant frequent episodes of reduced perfusion.

The predominant temporal pattern in our patients with severe bilateral ICVA disease was TIAs, often multiple and stereotyped in individual patients. 1, 16 Transient ischemic attacks were noted by 81% of patients; 38% had only TIAs, whereas the others had TIAs before and after strokes. The presence of extensive hemodynamically significant occlusive lesions, the stereotypy and brevity of episodes, and provocation by changes in position and reduction in blood pressure led us to posit a hemodynamic, hypoperfusion mechanism for most TIAs in patients with bilateral severe ICVA disease. As predicted, the proximal intracranial territory was less often involved if the ICVA lesion was distal to PICA. The middle territory was more often involved when both ICVA lesions were distal to PICA, effectively causing reduced flow in the proximal basilar artery. Associated basilar artery disease and propagation of thrombus from an ICVA into the basilar artery also explained pontine infarction.

Cerebellar infarcts were most common when the PICA branches on 1 or both sides were not seen on angiography. When stenosis of the ICVA was distal to PICA, cerebellar infarction was less common. The short- and long-term outcomes are usually favorable. However, patients who also have basilar artery–occlusive lesions, presumed embolism to the distal territory, or bilateral occlusive lesions proximal to PICA have a less favorable prognosis.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Post-endovascular thrombectomy blood pressure targets — trial outcomes indicate no benefit and potential harm with very low targets. In BP TARGET, rates of any and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were similar between systolic blood pressure (SBP) goals of 110 to 129 mm Hg and 130 to 185 mm Hg. ENCHANTED-2 MT, comparing SBP goals of < 120 mm Hg and 140 to 180 mm Hg, was stopped early due to increased worse global disability in the < 120-mm Hg group (OR: 1.53 [95% CI: 1.18–1.97]). OPTIMAL BP, which compared SBP goals of < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to 180 mm Hg, was also stopped early with lower rates of improved outcomes at 90 days, with modified Rankin scale score 0 to 2 of 39.4% in the < 140-mm Hg group versus 54.4% in the 140- to 180-mm Hg group. The BEST-II trial showed that an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg was potentially harmful and indicated a low probability of benefit of post-endovascular thrombectomy BP lowering in a prespecified analysis.

### Management strategies in posterior circulation intracranial atherosclerotic disease [^a2e246d0]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the short-term prognosis of patients with recent symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease in the posterior circulation and evaluate differences in the outcome of patients receiving medical or endovascular treatment.

Methods

The records of 50 consecutive patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease in the posterior circulation were reviewed to record the occurrence of transient ischemic attack, stroke, major bleeding, and/or death during the 12-month period following a neurological event. Twenty-five patients received medical treatment alone, 13 initially received medical treatment and subsequently were treated with angioplasty/stenting due to recurrent events (analyzed in both groups), and 12 patients received endovascular treatment initially. The crossover patients were considered as 1 treated patient in each group; thus, there were 38 subjects (33 men; mean age 68 ± 9 years) receiving medical therapy compared with 25 patients (21 men; mean age 63 ± 13 years) who underwent endovascular procedures.

Results

During the 12-month period, subjects in the medically-treated group had a higher rate of events (37%, 14/38) than patients who received angioplasty/stenting (12%, 3/25; p = 0.042). Notably, there were 7 (18%) TIAs and 6 (16%) strokes in medically-treated patients versus no TIAs (0%, p = 0.035) and only 2 (8%, p = NS) strokes in the endovascular group, both of which occurred within 48 hours of the procedure. There were no deaths and only a single major bleeding event in each group.

Conclusion

Endovascular treatment of patients with symptomatic intracranial disease of the posterior territory appears to be associated with a substantially better outcome.

Recommendations

Patients with elevated blood pressure and other aspects suitable for IV rt-PA therapy should be cautious in lowering blood pressure before thrombolysis. The recommended goal systolic blood pressure is < 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure is < 105 mm Hg (class I, level of evidence B).
It is reasonable to maintain blood pressure (≤ 180/100 mm Hg) before intra-arterial therapy in patients who do not receive IV thrombolysis (class II, level of evidence B).
Within 24 hours after IV rt-PA therapy, blood pressure should be < 180/105 mm Hg (class I, level of evidence B).
Within 3 hours of onset, rt-PA IV thrombolytic therapy is recommended for patients aged over 18 years and who meet other criteria (class I, level of evidence A).
For patients who are suitable for IV thrombolysis within 3 hours of onset, IV rt-PA thrombolysis is recommended (drug dose 0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg, continuous infusion within 60 min, of which 10% of the first dose is IV infusion within 1 min) (class I, level of evidence A).
For patients with AIS with severe symptoms within 3 hours of onset, IV rt-PA thrombolysis is recommended. Although the risk of bleeding events increases, it still benefits (class I, level of evidence A).
For patients with mild symptoms but with disabling stroke symptoms within 3 hours of onset, IV rt-PA thrombolytic therapy is recommended. Current studies have shown that IV rt-PA thrombolytic therapy is beneficial for these patients (class I, level of evidence B).
IV rt-PA thrombolysis is still recommended for patients suitable for IV thrombolysis within 3–4.5 hours of onset (class I, level of evidence B).
The benefit of rt-PA thrombolytic therapy for patients with AIS aged over 80 years within 3–4.5 hours after onset is not clear (class IIb, level of evidence B).
Within 4.5 hours of AIS onset, low-dose IV rt-PA can be given to patients with potential high risk of haemorrhagic events. Usage: rt-PA 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose is 60 mg), of which 15% of the total amount was intravenously injected within the first 1 min, and the remaining 85% was intravenously infused with infusion pump for 1 hour (class IIb, level of evidence B).
Considering the low incidence of platelet abnormalities and coagulation dysfunction in the general population, IV thrombolysis should not be delayed while waiting for the results of platelet counts when there is no reason to suspect that the results of the tests are abnormal (class IIa, level of evidence B).
The safety and efficacy of IV rt-PA therapy in patients with AIS with potential haemorrhagic risk or coagulation disorders have not been determined (class III, level of evidence C).
IV rt-PA is not suitable for patients who have used low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within 24 hours, regardless of prophylactic or therapeutic dose (class III, level of evidence B).
Prethrombolytic MRI examination showed that IV thrombolysis was reasonable in patients with a number of (1–10) cerebral microbleeds (class IIa, level of evidence B).
Prethrombolytic MRI examination showed that IV thrombolysis was associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with a number of (> 10) cerebral microbleeds, and the clinical benefit is not clear. If there may be significant potential benefits, IV thrombolysis may be reasonable (class IIa, level of evidence B).
During IV thrombolysis, physicians should be fully prepared to respond to emergency adverse reactions, including haemorrhagic complications and vasogenic oedema that may cause airway obstruction (class I, level of evidence B).
Abciximab cannot be used concurrently with IV rt-PA (class III, level of evidence B).
Whether or not the endovascular treatment is bridged, the risk of starting antiplatelet therapy within 24 hours after IV thrombolysis remains unclear (class IIb, level of evidence B)
Urokinase is safe for those who are not suitable for rt-PA treatment within 6 hours of onset. However, the validity needs further confirmation by high-quality large sample size RCT (class IIb, level of evidence B).
It has not been confirmed that IV injection of tenecteplase (single dose of 0.4 mg/kg) is superior or inferior to rt-PA. However, for patients with mild neurological dysfunction without occlusion of the intracranial artery, tenecteplase can be considered instead of rt-PA (class IIb, level of evidence B).
In addition to clinical trials, ultrasound thrombolysis is not recommended as an adjunct therapy to IV thrombolysis. Desmoplatinolytic thrombolysis is not recommended under imaging guidance (class III, level of evidence B).

### Stroke prevention in symptomatic large artery intracranial atherosclerosis practice advisory: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^42592be2]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To review treatments for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke or death in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic arterial stenosis (sICAS).

Methods

The development of this practice advisory followed the process outlined in the American Academy of Neurology Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual, 2011 Edition, as amended. The systematic review included studies through November 2020. Recommendations were based on evidence, related evidence, principles of care, and inferences.

Major Recommendations

Clinicians should recommend aspirin 325 mg/d for long-term prevention of stroke and death and should recommend adding clopidogrel 75 mg/d to aspirin for up to 90 days to further reduce stroke risk in patients with severe (70%-99%) sICAS who have low risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Clinicians should recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level < 70 mg/dL, a long-term blood pressure target of < 140/90 mm Hg, at least moderate physical activity, and treatment of other modifiable vascular risk factors for patients with sICAS. Clinicians should not recommend percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for stroke prevention in patients with moderate (50%-69%) sICAS or as the initial treatment for stroke prevention in patients with severe sICAS. Clinicians should not routinely recommend angioplasty alone or indirect bypass for stroke prevention in patients with sICAS outside clinical trials. Clinicians should not recommend direct bypass for stroke prevention in patients with sICAS. Clinicians should counsel patients about the risks of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting and alternative treatments if one of these procedures is being contemplated.

### Clinical implications of haemodynamics in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis by computational fluid dynamics modelling: a systematic review [^de242acd]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, the CFD method may also be a promising tool in investigating the target for BP control in secondary stroke prevention in patients with sICAS. The latest guidelines recommend a BP < 140/90 mm Hg for secondary stroke prevention in sICAS. However, this BP target was determined following the treatment regimen in the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis trial, which was not tested against other BP targets in randomised controlled trials. Previous studies indicated that long-term, stringently controlled BP may increase the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with sICAS with hypoperfusion, when low BP levels could further aggravate the reduced cerebral perfusion. A CFD study echoed such findings that the altered relationship between SBP during follow-up and recurrent stroke risk in patients with sICAS could be attributed to the change in translesional PR.SBP level maintained below 130 mm Hg was correlated with a minimal risk of recurrent stroke in patients with normal PR, which, however, was associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke in patients with low PR (hence possibly reduced perfusion). This could be explained by the impaired cerebral autoregulation in patients with sICAS, when the cerebral perfusion could be passively affected by systemic BP changes. Yet, these were retrospective, small-scale studies, which need further validation.

### Ischaemic stroke [^690d9f4b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Stroke is the second highest cause of death globally and a leading cause of disability, with an increasing incidence in developing countries. Ischaemic stroke caused by arterial occlusion is responsible for the majority of strokes. Management focuses on rapid reperfusion with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, which both reduce disability but are time-critical. Accordingly, improving the system of care to reduce treatment delays is key to maximizing the benefits of reperfusion therapies. Intravenous thrombolysis reduces disability when administered within 4.5h of the onset of stroke. Thrombolysis also benefits selected patients with evidence from perfusion imaging of salvageable brain tissue for up to 9h and in patients who awake with stroke symptoms. Endovascular thrombectomy reduces disability in a broad group of patients with large vessel occlusion when performed within 6h of stroke onset and in patients selected by perfusion imaging up to 24h following stroke onset. Secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke shares many common elements with cardiovascular risk management in other fields, including blood pressure control, cholesterol management and antithrombotic medications. Other preventative interventions are tailored to the mechanism of stroke, such as anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and carotid endarterectomy for severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Predictors of response to endovascular treatment of posterior circulation stroke [^d85f4311]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Endovascular treatment is considered a reasonable approach for patients with acute posterior circulation stroke, but it remains uncertain which patients will benefit the most from it.

Objective

To find independent clinical and angiographic predictors of outcome after endovascular treatment for posterior circulation stroke.

Methods

We evaluated consecutive patients with acute posterior circulation stroke who underwent endovascular treatment in our comprehensive stroke center from January 2015 to December 2017. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score of 0–3 at 90 days. Intracranial atheromatous disease was established on focal stenosis recorded during endovascular treatment. Associations were sought between a good outcome and clinical and angiographic factors. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to define independent outcome predictors.

Results

Forty-seven consecutive patients were included: mean age 70.9 ± 12.1 years, median admission NIHSS score, 16 (IQR: 8–30). On univariate analysis, age (p = 0.01), smoking (p = 0.04), hypertension (p = 0.03), successful reperfusion (p = 0.04), presence of extracranial atherosclerosis (p = 0.02), and absence of atherosclerosis (p = 0.03) were significantly associated with a good outcome. On multivariate analysis, age < 70 years (odds ratio = 6.20, 95%CI 1.52–25.47, p = 0.01) and absence of intracranial atherosclerosis (odds ratio = 6.45, 95% CI 1.09–38.24, p = 0.04) were independently associated with a good outcome.

Conclusions

Pretreatment determination of the presence or absence of intracranial atherosclerosis can aid management of posterior circulation stroke patients. The absence of intracranial atherosclerosis may have value as a positive selection criterion for endovascular treatment in future trials. The presence of intracranial atherosclerosis could be used as a selection tool in future studies investigating new treatment protocols for this population.

### Stenting for intracranial stenosis: potential future for the prevention of disabling or fatal stroke [^f97eb6df]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The primary principles of intracranial stenting with Gateway balloon and Wingspan stent are as follows: (1) the microwire and guiding catheter should be placed at an appropriate position to support the delivery of stent system. (2) Selection of the stent size is based on the adjacent normal vessel diameter. Fully expanded stent diameter is 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm greater than the adjacent normal vessel diameter. The deployed stent should cover the length of the stenotic lesion and at least 3 mm normal vessel on either side of the lesion. (3) Due to thin vessel well, submaximal angioplasty with slow inflation should be applied in intracranial vasculature to avoid dissection and rupture. (4) Continuous heparinised saline flush is essential to minimise the risk of thrombosis.

Neurointerventionists should be proficient in neuroanatomy and minimise potential injury to the eloquent area of the brain. For instance, the microwire should be placed in the lower division of MCA or its temporo-occipital branch during the treatment of M1 lesion to prevent injury to the upper division. For basilar artery stenosis, it is preferable to place the microwire in the P4 segment of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) because distal PCA thrombosis or supratentorium bleeding is often less severe than proximal PCA occlusion or infratentorium bleeding.

Cerebral arteries are suspended in cerebrospinal fluids tethered by branching arteries and small perforators. The stent delivery system-induced straightening of target vessel may cause the shift or deformation of the perforators, resulting in rupture of perforators and catastrophic ICH or SAH. Even with the flexible Wingspan stent delivery system, extreme caution should be exercised to minimise the shift of major arteries and the avulsion of perforators.

Real-time haemodynamic monitoring and aggressive blood pressure control may reduce the risk of hyperperfusion injury.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management recommendations include the following. Recommendation (1 C-LD) states that in patients with acute ischemic stroke, hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function. Recommendation (1 B-NR) specifies that patients eligible for IV thrombolytics should have BP lowered to SBP < 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before therapy, and BP should be maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after initiating thrombolytic therapy to avoid complications. Recommendation (2b C-LD) adds that in patients with BP of ≥ 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV thrombolytic or endovascular treatment and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke to improve outcomes.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management recommendations are: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function (COR 1, LOE C-LD). Patients eligible for IV thrombolytics should have BP lowered to SBP ≤ 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before therapy and then maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after initiating thrombolytic therapy (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients undergoing endovascular treatment, it is reasonable to maintain BP at ≤ 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure to improve long-term functional outcomes and prevent death (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). In patients with BP of > 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV thrombolytic or endovascular treatment and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke to improve outcomes (COR 2b, LOE C-LD).

On examination, his blood pressure was 125/80 mm Hg. Results of cognitive tests, including drawing, copying, and revisualization, were normal. Visual fields were normal. The right eyelid was severely ptotic. The eyes diverged, with the right resting down and out. The patient had a left gaze palsy accompanied by tortional nystagmus in a clockwise rotation that was more obvious in the left eye. The patient's gait and left-limb clumsiness soon returned to normal, but diplopia and some oscillopsia persisted. Repeat MRA showed that the right PCA had returned to near normal. On examination, his blood pressure was 140/110 mm Hg. Results of general and neurologic examinations were normal except that the patient could not readily name drugs that he often prescribed to his patients and he had a slight right hemihypesthesia. An MR image showed small infarcts in the left thalamus and left temporal lobe.

All 3 patients in this report had transient symptoms: hemisensory in 1 patient and visual experiences in 2 patients. These involved the thalamus and the visual field supplied by the PCA dissection. Hemianopic visual and hemisensory symptoms are the most common symptoms described in patients who have transient ischemic attacks related to PCA stenosis. 12 One of the patients developed neurologic signs caused by a midbrain infarct. Only one report mentioned a possible physical precipitant: vigorous basketball. 3 Headache was a prominent and early feature. In the 5 patients in whom symptoms and signs were described, all had major clinical signs including hemianopia and hemisensory loss, often accompanied by motor deficits. In the 4 patients in whom brain imaging results were reported, there were large infarcts in the hemispheric and, often, thalamic territory supplied by the PCA.

This is especially important in patients with dissecting aneurysms, since inefficient anterograde flow encourages stasis and thrombus formation. Anticoagulation with heparin and, later, warfarin could theoretically prevent thrombus formation and embolization. Treating physicians must weigh the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulants in each individual patient with intracranial dissection. Stenting with or without preceding angioplasty is another potential treatment for intracranial dissections that cause stenosis of arteries, although there is little present experience with this technique in this condition, and recovery of luminal diameter is the rule without mechanical intervention.

### Is high blood pressure self-protection for the brain? [^6161a697]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Data from animal models of hypertension indicate that high blood pressure may develop as a vital mechanism to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain. We propose that congenital vascular variants of the posterior cerebral circulation and cerebral hypoperfusion could partially explain the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, which remains enigmatic in 95% of patients.

Objective

To evaluate the role of the cerebral circulation in the pathophysiology of hypertension.

Methods and Results

We completed a series of retrospective and mechanistic case-control magnetic resonance imaging and physiological studies in normotensive and hypertensive humans (n = 259). Interestingly, in humans with hypertension, we report a higher prevalence of congenital cerebrovascular variants; vertebral artery hypoplasia, and an incomplete posterior circle of Willis, which were coupled with increased cerebral vascular resistance, reduced cerebral blood flow, and a higher incidence of lacunar type infarcts. Causally, cerebral vascular resistance was elevated before the onset of hypertension and elevated sympathetic nerve activity (n = 126). Interestingly, untreated hypertensive patients (n = 20) had a cerebral blood flow similar to age-matched controls (n = 28). However, participants receiving antihypertensive therapy (with blood pressure controlled below target levels) had reduced cerebral perfusion (n = 19). Finally, elevated cerebral vascular resistance was a predictor of hypertension, suggesting that it may be a novel prognostic or diagnostic marker (n = 126).

Conclusions

Our data indicate that congenital cerebrovascular variants in the posterior circulation and the associated cerebral hypoperfusion may be a factor in triggering hypertension. Therefore, lowering blood pressure may worsen cerebral perfusion in susceptible individuals.

### Deviation from personalized blood pressure targets correlates with worse outcome after successful recanalization [^d516ef93]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) improves the prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke due to large‐vessel intracranial occlusion with a broadened time window. However, after successful recanalization, the optimal blood pressure (BP) target is still unknown as several randomized trials (BP‐TARGET [Safety and efficacy of intensive blood pressure lowering after successful endovascular therapy in acute ischemic stroke], ENCHANTED2/MT [Intensive blood pressure control after endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke], and BEST‐II [Blood pressure management after endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke]) obtained neutral or even harmful results. Given the high variability in infarct size, location, and risk factors of stroke, a neurophysiological monitoring–based individualized BP management strategy might be an alternative option. Cerebral autoregulation (CA) refers to the capability of cerebral arteries to maintain cerebral blood flow constant within a range of systemic BP changes. It is reasonable to determine an acceptable BP range using CA evaluation in a variety of clinical settings such as traumatic brain injury and intraoperative monitoring. Using near‐infrared spectroscopy, Petersen et al found that the percentage of time that BP exceeded the upper limits of CA, instead of a fixed target, was associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients who had undergone EVT. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the degree, in addition to the duration, of BP that deviates from CA limits (either above the upper limit or below the lower limit of autoregulation) after successful recanalization, affects outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the burden of deviated BP within the first 48 hours after EVT was associated with unfavorable outcomes. The burden of deviated BP is defined as the area enclosed by the actual mean arterial pressure (MAP) curve and the upper or lower CA‐impairment BP thresholds, to reflect the magnitude of BP deviation. Moreover, instead of near‐infrared spectroscopy, which detects only a partial region around the middle cerebral artery (MCA)–anterior cerebral artery watershed, we used transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) to assess the autoregulation of the MCA, which accounts for two‐thirds of the cerebral blood supply.

Section 9: management of risk factors and long-term intervention

The incidence of many patients with ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases is closely related to lifestyle and chronic diseases. Improving habits consciously and monitoring chronic diseases regularly helps patients' long-term survival.

Blood pressure management

The management of blood pressure within 72 hours after the onset of AIS is shown in figure 9.

Figure 9
Blood pressure (BP) management in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS).

Recommendations

For patients with blood pressure < 220/120 mm Hg, who do not receive IV rt-PA or endovascular treatment and do not have complications requiring emergency antihypertensive treatment, starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy within the first 48–72 hours after AIS is not effective in preventing death or severe disability (class III, level of evidence A).
For patients with blood pressure ≥ 220/120 mm Hg, who do not receive IV rt-PA or endovascular treatment and do not have complications requiring emergency antihypertensive treatment, the effect of starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy within the first 48–72 hours after AIS is uncertain. It may be reasonable to reduce blood pressure by 15% within the first 24 hours after a stroke attack (class IIb, level of evidence C).
For patients with AIS with other complications (such as simultaneous acute coronary events, acute heart failure, aortic dissection, bleeding transformation after thrombolysis or pre-eclampsia/eclampsia), early antihypertensive therapy is indicated. At the initial stage, a 15% reduction in blood pressure may be safe (class I, level of evidence C).
Hypotension and hypovolaemia must be corrected after stroke to ensure systemic perfusion to support organ function (class I, level of evidence C).
For patients with AIS, the therapeutic effect of drug-induced hypertension is uncertain (class IIb, level of evidence C).
If the patient has stable neurological function during hospitalisation, but blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg, it is safe to start or restart antihypertensive therapy. With the exception of contraindications, long-term control of blood pressure is reasonable (class IIa, level of evidence B).

Management of abnormal lipid metabolism

The comparison of the therapeutic dose of lipid-lowering drugs and the lipid-lowering management of AIS is shown in figure 10.
