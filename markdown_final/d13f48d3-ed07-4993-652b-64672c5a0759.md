## Question

How to diagnose pernicious anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose pernicious anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect pernicious anemia clinically. Then, I should verify the initial laboratory workup and how to interpret B12 results. Next, I will examine the role and limitations of anti–intrinsic factor and anti–parietal cell antibodies. After that, I need to check when and how to use confirmatory tests like methylmalonic acid and gastrin. Then, I should review when endoscopy with biopsies is indicated and how to interpret histology. Finally, I will consider special populations, pitfalls like assay interference, and how to integrate all of this into a practical diagnostic algorithm with appropriate caveats and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical triggers for suspicion, because missing the pre-anemic or neurologic presentations is common. I should suspect pernicious anemia in patients with unexplained macrocytosis or megaloblastic anemia, neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias, ataxia, or cognitive changes, glossitis, autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes or autoimmune thyroid disease, or unexplained iron deficiency anemia, especially in older adults or those with a family history of autoimmune gastritis or pernicious anemia [^ad53012c] [^c02191f2] [^546ce611].

> Wait, let me verify the initial laboratory strategy before jumping to antibodies. I need a CBC with indices to look for macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils, a direct serum B12 level, and a reticulocyte count to gauge marrow response. Importantly, I should not rely on B12 alone because sensitivity is imperfect and neurologic disease can occur without anemia or macrocytosis, so I should add methylmalonic acid and, when available, homocysteine to improve diagnostic yield, especially when B12 is borderline or symptoms are prominent [^ad53012c] [^731d43f1] [^546ce611].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibodies. I should confirm that anti–intrinsic factor antibodies are highly specific but only modestly sensitive, around 50–60%, so a negative test does not exclude pernicious anemia. Anti–parietal cell antibodies are more sensitive but lack specificity and can be positive in other autoimmune diseases and even in a subset of healthy individuals, so they cannot establish the diagnosis by themselves. I should order anti–IF when PA is suspected and consider anti–PC if anti–IF is negative but suspicion remains, interpreting any positive serology in clinical context [^f61db2e5] [^b3ecd343] [^ec725d56].

> I need to check confirmatory biochemical markers next. Elevated methylmalonic acid supports functional B12 deficiency and is particularly helpful when serum B12 is borderline or when neurologic symptoms are present. Gastrin is often elevated in autoimmune gastritis due to loss of acid and can support the diagnosis, but I should remember PPIs and H. pylori can elevate gastrin, so I should interpret gastrin cautiously and, when possible, stop PPIs before testing. If available, a CobaSorb test can help distinguish malabsorption due to intrinsic factor deficiency from other causes, though access varies [^731d43f1] [^b93a4236].

> Next, I should review when to pursue endoscopy with biopsies, because histology is the gold standard for autoimmune gastritis and informs cancer risk. Let me consider endoscopy in patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia, in those over 50 with serologic evidence of PA, or in anyone with alarm features. I should obtain biopsies from the body/fundus and antrum, ideally with separate jars, to assess for corpus-predominant atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, ECL cell hyperplasia, and to screen for neuroendocrine cell proliferations and adenocarcinoma, while also testing for H. pylori and treating if present [^4b84745d] [^5b776266] [^328b9da5].

> But wait, what if the patient is younger or has type 1 diabetes? I should double-check for autoimmune polyglandular syndromes and consider earlier endoscopic evaluation in high-risk groups, as AIG and PA are more prevalent in T1D and can present at younger ages. In children and adolescents, although rare, PA does occur and can present with severe neurologic injury, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and not anchor on age [^c02191f2] [^3830a410] [^319e8d9e].

> I will now examine assay pitfalls that can mislead diagnosis. Falsely normal B12 results can occur due to anti–intrinsic factor antibody interference with some immunoassays, and schistocytes or large platelets can artifactually lower the automated MCV, masking macrocytosis. If clinical suspicion is high and B12 is normal, I should repeat B12 with an alternate platform, check MMA, and review the smear manually to avoid missing megaloblastic changes or schistocytes that suggest hemolysis from ineffective erythropoiesis [^eff8bded] [^ad53012c].

> Let me think about integrating this into a practical algorithm. If B12 is low and MMA is high, I should test anti–IF. If anti–IF is positive, I can diagnose PA and proceed to endoscopy for staging and cancer risk assessment. If anti–IF is negative but suspicion remains high, I should test anti–PC, consider gastrin, and still proceed to endoscopy with biopsies to confirm autoimmune gastritis and exclude neoplasia. If B12 is borderline with high MMA, I should treat as B12 deficiency and reassess clinically, recognizing that some cases are antibody-negative PA. Throughout, I must avoid treating with folate alone, which can mask hematologic disease while allowing neurologic injury to progress [^4d11518e] [^4b84745d] [^b06ee877].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up and surveillance implications once PA is diagnosed. Patients require lifelong B12 replacement, typically parenteral, and I should monitor for recurrence of deficiency and neurologic symptoms. Given increased risks of gastric neuroendocrine tumors and adenocarcinoma in autoimmune gastritis, individualized endoscopic surveillance should be considered, with some guidelines suggesting a baseline endoscopy at diagnosis and periodic surveillance thereafter based on risk and shared decision-making, especially in older adults or those with advanced atrophy [^2e93f21d] [^5b776266] [^3fd4e125].

> In summary, I need to ensure a multimodal approach: combine clinical suspicion with CBC and smear, serum B12, MMA, and targeted antibodies, and confirm autoimmune gastritis with histology when appropriate. I should remember that anemia and macrocytosis can be absent early on, that anti–IF is specific but not sensitive, and that folate monotherapy is dangerous in undiagnosed B12 deficiency. By integrating these elements, I can reduce diagnostic delay and prevent irreversible neurologic injury while addressing cancer risk in a timely manner [^ad53012c] [^f61db2e5] [^2e93f21d].

Pernicious anemia is diagnosed by confirming **vitamin B12 deficiency** with low serum B12 and elevated methylmalonic acid, then establishing an **autoimmune cause** with positive anti–intrinsic factor antibodies [^4d11518e] [^731d43f1]. Because anti–intrinsic factor antibodies are specific but insensitive, a negative result does not exclude pernicious anemia; in such cases, confirm autoimmune gastritis with endoscopic biopsies showing corpus-predominant atrophy [^4b84745d] [^5b776266]. Evaluate for **coexisting iron deficiency** and other autoimmune diseases, and avoid relying on anti–parietal cell antibodies alone due to poor specificity [^ec725d56] [^b66518a6].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial suspicion

Pernicious anemia often presents with **nonspecific symptoms**, including:

- Fatigue, pallor, and weakness (anemia symptoms) [^aac2c778].
- **Neurological symptoms**: paresthesia, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and subacute combined degeneration [^aac2c778].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: glossitis, diarrhea, and weight loss [^785d1013].
- **Autoimmune comorbidities**: thyroid disease, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetes [^5a3f495c].

Given this variability, maintain a **high index of suspicion** in patients with unexplained anemia, neurological symptoms, or autoimmune diseases [^a7ee70e0].

---

## Laboratory diagnosis

### Step 1: confirm vitamin B12 deficiency

- **Serum vitamin B12**: Low levels (< 200 pg/mL) indicate deficiency, but borderline levels (200–300 pg/mL) may require further confirmation [^546ce611].
- **Methylmalonic acid (MMA)**: Elevated levels (> 0.4 µmol/L) confirm functional B12 deficiency, especially when serum B12 is borderline or normal [^notfound].
- **Homocysteine**: Elevated levels support B12 deficiency but are less specific than MMA [^notfound].

---

### Step 2: identify autoimmune etiology

- **Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies**: Highly specific (> 90%) but insensitive (≈ 50–60%); positive results strongly suggest pernicious anemia [^f61db2e5].
- **Anti–parietal cell antibodies**: Sensitive (> 85%) but nonspecific; present in other autoimmune conditions and some healthy individuals, so they cannot confirm pernicious anemia alone [^f61db2e5] [^b3ecd343].
- **Gastrin levels**: Elevated (> 10× normal) supports autoimmune gastritis but is not specific to pernicious anemia [^notfound].

---

### Step 3: confirm autoimmune gastritis (when serology is inconclusive)

When anti–intrinsic factor antibodies are negative or inconclusive, **confirm autoimmune gastritis** with upper endoscopy and gastric biopsies. Typical findings include corpus-predominant atrophy, loss of parietal cells, and intestinal metaplasia [^4b84745d] [^5b776266].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and algorithm

| **Step** | **Test** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Serum B12 | Low (< 200 pg/mL) indicates deficiency |
| 2 | MMA | Elevated (> 0.4 µmol/L) confirms functional deficiency |
| 3 | Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies | Positive confirms autoimmune etiology |
| 4 | Anti–parietal cell antibodies | Positive supports autoimmune gastritis but not specific |
| 5 | Endoscopy with biopsies | Corpus-predominant atrophy confirms autoimmune gastritis |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other causes of **vitamin B12 deficiency** must be excluded, including:

- Dietary deficiency (strict veganism) [^2af98635].
- Malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease, Crohn's disease, pancreatic insufficiency).
- Medications (metformin, proton pump inhibitors) [^b93a4236].
- Other autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis).

---

## Special considerations

- **Iron deficiency**: Common in pernicious anemia due to impaired iron absorption; always assess iron status [^b66518a6].
- **Neurological symptoms**: May precede hematological findings; prioritize early B12 replacement to prevent irreversible damage [^2e93f21d].
- **Gastric cancer risk**: Increased in autoimmune gastritis; consider endoscopic surveillance in high-risk patients [^3fd4e125].

---

## Pitfalls and limitations

- **Assay interference**: Some B12 assays may be affected by anti–intrinsic factor antibodies, causing falsely normal results [^eff8bded].
- **Diagnostic delay**: Often due to nonspecific symptoms and low awareness; average delay is 2 years [^0942fd35].
- **Over-reliance on anti–parietal cell antibodies**: Can lead to misdiagnosis due to poor specificity [^ec725d56].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

- **Confirm B12 deficiency**: Low serum B12 and elevated MMA.
- **Identify autoimmune etiology**: Positive anti–intrinsic factor antibodies.
- **Confirm autoimmune gastritis**: Endoscopy with biopsies if serology is inconclusive.
- **Exclude other causes**: Dietary, malabsorption, medications.
- **Assess complications**: Iron deficiency, neurological symptoms, gastric cancer risk.

---

Pernicious anemia is diagnosed by confirming **B12 deficiency** with low serum B12 and elevated MMA, then establishing an **autoimmune cause** with positive anti–intrinsic factor antibodies or endoscopic evidence of autoimmune gastritis. This stepwise approach ensures accurate diagnosis and timely management.

Conclusions

The publication of the 2024 NICE guidelines on B 12 deficiency represents progress but falls short by proposing to rename ‘pernicious anaemia’ with ‘autoimmune gastritis.’ This change does not adequately address the distinct nature of PA as an advanced stage of AIG, characterised by IF deficiency requiring lifelong B 12 treatment. Although severe and life-threatening anaemia due to PA is rare today, PA remains a specific condition that requires recognition and appropriate management. The guidelines currently lack detailed protocols for diagnosing PA, especially in patients without typical gastrointestinal symptoms, and rely on tests with limited sensitivity and specificity. Despite these limitations, the guidelines do highlight the importance of a symptom-based approach and prioritise critical research initiatives to address many of the current shortcomings associated with the patient journey. Future revisions should better distinguish PA from AIG, incorporate comprehensive diagnostic pathways that can be implemented in practice, and emphasise educating medical students and professionals to improve diagnosis, effective management and prognosis of PA.

Introduction

Pernicious anaemia (PA) is an underdiagnosed complex autoimmune condition characterised by vitamin B 12 (B 12) malabsorption. This occurs secondary to gastric atrophy which leads to a reduction or absent production of intrinsic factor (IF). While PA is linked to the end stages of autoimmune gastritis (AIG), they are not synonymous. PA remains largely under-researched in clinical practice, contributing to gaps in diagnosis, management, and patient care. Its management typically involves regular and lifelong intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. An injection frequency of 1 mg every 2–3 months is often ‘recommended’. However, this dosing schedule does not have a strong evidence base, and many individuals with PA / B 12 deficiency / PA report requiring more frequent injections for adequate symptom relief. Furthermore, recent data, which is consistent with prior work by Hooper et al. from a large survey we conducted on over 1100 PA patients shows that 40% of PA patients wait two years or longer for diagnosis, further complicating patient outcomes and satisfaction (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837).

The 2024 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on B 12 deficiency raise important questions about PA, particularly regarding its nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, and appropriate follow-up care. Here we review the NICE guidelines, with a specific focus on their implications for PA, and highlightareas for improvement in addressing the needs of such individuals.

### Pernicious anemia-genetic insights [^6ca6d4a3]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Pernicious anemia (PA) is a complex, autoimmune, multi-factorial disease. Rapid progress has been made in the understanding of susceptibility to a spectrum of other autoimmune diseases through genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, PA has been conspicuous by its absence from this work. Here, we examine the evidence that PA has a significant heritable component through epidemiological evidence and its co-occurrence with other autoimmune diseases. Further, we consider how knowledge of the genetic susceptibility to other autoimmune diseases may provide insight into the etiology of PA.

Whilst renaming PA as AIG can add confusion and uncertainty, the name PA has its own shortcomings, which is perhaps why NICE proposed to change it. The term ‘pernicious anaemia’ suggests that anaemia is a defining characteristic of the disease. However, anaemia is present in only 15–20% of PA diagnoses. Practitioners unfamiliar with PA are commonly misled by the term ‘anaemia’, as all ICD-10 (D51.0-9) codes for B deficiency incorrectly include the term anaemia. The term ‘pernicious’ is also an anachronism, predating the 1948 discovery of B as an effective treatment. It was first coined by Anton Biermer in 1871 to describe the fatal anaemia cases seen prior to the discovery of effective treatments. It is important to note that even though anaemia occurs in a minority of PA patients, this represents an important subgroup of patients that requires a different management approach. The current guidelines do not address how to specifically diagnose and manage this subgroup of patients, representing a significant gap in knowledge and warranting further research.

The definition and our understanding of the condition has evolved significantly since Biermer’s original description. We now know that PA often presents with predominantly neurological symptoms. Therefore, if a name change is warranted, it should be one that better reflects the current clinical presentation of the disease.

The persistent use of the term ‘pernicious anaemia’ in both clinical practice (primary, secondary and tertiary care) and state-of-the-art research highlights a disconnect between these guidelines and current clinical practice. It is important to highlight that the adoption of new and more appropriate terminology would require universal acceptance by clinicians, carers and patients who would have lived with the name PA for most of their lives. While changing established medical terminology may take decades—potentially one to two generations of doctors—before it is fully adopted in clinical language, emphasising that such a change, if it were to happen, would be gradual and require effective dissemination.

However, a name change could offer significant advantages by reflecting the current understanding of PA and encouraging clinicians to investigate neurological symptoms associated with PA. This would be achieved through a concerted effort to educate doctors by incorporating this knowledge into the curriculum, which will dispel misconceptions commonly ascribed to PA patients by doctors and promote a deeper understanding of PA’s complexity.

### Primary neurologic symptoms: have you considered pernicious anemia? [^aac2c778]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is a nutrient that is vital for metabolic function. Absorption of ingested B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor, which is secreted by parietal cells within the stomach. Pernicious anemia is caused by an intrinsic factor deficiency or autoantibodies against intrinsic factor. The presence of parietal cell antibodies can destroy parietal cells, which can also lead to a deficiency in intrinsic factor. Both lead to megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The typical presentation of pernicious anemia includes fatigue, pale appearance, tingling sensation, depression, alterations to vision and smell, urinary incontinence, psychotic episodes, and weakness. The most effective treatment for pernicious anemia is intramuscular B12.

Case Report

A 27-year-old woman with a history of vitiligo presented to the emergency department (ED) with bilateral lower extremity weakness, clumsiness, numbness, and tingling. Physical examination revealed ataxia, no sensation below her umbilicus, decreased strength, and hyperreflexia in both lower extremities. Complete blood count in the ED revealed low hemoglobin and hematocrit and elevated mean corpuscular volume, concerning for pernicious anemia. Further laboratory testing upon inpatient admission revealed a low vitamin B12 level and parietal cell antibodies in the blood. The patient's pernicious anemia was treated with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections, which led to near complete resolution of her symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Early suspicion and detection of pernicious anemia in the ED can prevent serious and permanent hematologic and neurologic damage and the development of other autoimmune disorders.

Renaming of pernicious anaemia as autoimmune gastritis

While the guideline has several strengths, the proposal to replace the term ‘pernicious anaemia’ with ‘autoimmune gastritis’ is, in our opinion, a notable limitation. PA is considered to develop in advanced stages of autoimmune gastritis (AIG) rather than being entirely synonymous with it. It is important to acknowledge that PA and AIG represent different stages of the same disease continuum. Autoimmune gastritis, characterised by advanced atrophy of the gastric oxyntic mucosa with a spared antrum, forms the pathological basis for PA. However, PA specifically refers to the clinical manifestation associated with IF deficiency and subsequent B 12 malabsorption. Therefore, these conditions should not be referred to as identical entities but recognised as distinct stages within the natural history of the same disease. This change could exacerbate current confusion and add further uncertainty regarding the diagnosis and management of PA. The guidelines state, “ However, pernicious anaemia in its true sense (that is, life-threatening anaemia) is now extremely rare because of developments in testing and treatment for, and greater awareness of, vitamin B 12 deficiency.”

Regarding specific circumstances for atrophic gastritis, more specifically with respect to patients with pernicious anemia, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to perform endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia (including neuroendocrine tumors) in patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia.

### Ambulatory dysfunction due to unrecognized pernicious anemia [^f3f48199]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pernicious anemia can result in significant hematologic and neurologic impairments due to a reduction in cobalamin absorption. Typically thought to be a disease of elderly whites, a growing body of literature has documented the disease in blacks and in younger age groups. We describe a case of a young black woman with gradually progressive lower extremity paresthesias, weakness, and ataxia as the primary presenting symptoms of pernicious anemia. This case is presented to make emergency physicians aware of pernicious anemia as a cause of ambulatory dysfunction in younger patients. We review the current body of literature on the diagnosis and management as well as evidence that the demographic profile of the disease is changing. Furthermore, in women of reproductive age, there is the potential for significant fetal and infant morbidity.

Conclusion

AIG is an important condition with both benign and malignant complications. Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis are common, given the indolent course and often subtle clinical presentation, if even at all, particularly in the early stages. Accordingly, clinicians should be aware of optimal practices related to diagnosis and management to reduce the likelihood of poor outcomes.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^5a3f495c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In our analysis, cases were identified from population-based biobank data using the ICD-10 code for pernicious anemia (D51.0 or D51 in the FinnGen data). This approach was selected to simplify data analysis, but we acknowledge this approach may have some shortcomings. First, the used summary statistics for FinnGen cohort are for a broader vitamin B12 deficiency phenotype definition compared to other two cohorts (so it likely includes other cases of B12 deficiency). Second, the use of the code may vary in different healthcare systems, increasing heterogeneity of the phenotype. However, we see no significant differences in effect estimates for the reported lead variants, and the identified loci and candidate genes have a clear role in autoimmune regulation, suggesting the vast majority of cases in this study have autoimmune B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia). The potential misclassification of our control subjects as not having pernicious anemia can increase the heterogeneity in the analysed data and attenuate the results towards the null, meaning that either larger datasets with the current phenotype definition or further refinement of the phenotype definition is needed to increase the number of identified loci. At the same time, the prevalence of pernicious anemia in our studied datasets ranged from 0.2–0.8%, which is roughly in line with the expected prevalence of pernicious anemia (0.1% in the general population and >2% in over 60 year olds).

Pernicious anemia is often accompanied by other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid conditions, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetes. We see similar results in the EstBB dataset, as individuals with pernicious anemia had vitiligo and hypothyroidism significantly more often, and overall, pernicious anemia cases had other autoimmune diagnoses more often than controls both in EstBB and UKBB. To rule out the confounding effect of concomitant diagnoses (especially vitiligo and hypothyroidism which were significantly more common in cases), we did a look-up for vitiligo, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid disease associated variants in our meta-analysis summary statistics and saw that loci specific to vitiligo and thyroid issues (melanocyte biology and thyroid function, respectively) were statistically not significant in our analyses, indicating that these diagnoses did not confound our results. In parallel, it is known that autoimmune diseases share genetic risk loci, therefore it is not surprising the loci associated with pernicious anemia are pleiotropic and also affect the risk of other autoimmune diseases.

PRECAUTIONS

Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia.

The patient’s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

Use only under the direction of a licensed healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

### Diagnosis and classification of pernicious anemia [^f61db2e5]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pernicious anemia (PA) is a complex disorder consisting of hematological, gastric and immunological alterations. Diagnosis of PA relies on histologically proven atrophic body gastritis, peripheral blood examination showing megaloblastic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils, cobalamin deficiency and antibodies to intrinsic factor and to gastric parietal cells. Anti-parietal cell antibodies are found in 90% of patients with PA, but have low specificity and are seen in atrophic gastritis without megaloblastic anemia as well as in various autoimmune disorders. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are less sensitive, being found in only 60% of patients with PA, but are considered highly specific for PA. The incidence of PA increases with age and is rare in persons younger than 30 years of age. The highest prevalence is seen in Northern Europeans, especially those in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, although PA has been reported in virtually every ethnic group. Because of the complexity of the diagnosis, PA prevalence is probably underestimated and no reliable data are available on the risk of gastric cancer as the end-stage evolution of atrophic gastritis in these patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to screening for gastric cancer, BSG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing a baseline endoscopy with biopsies in ≥ 50 years old patients with laboratory evidence of pernicious anemia, defined by vitamin B12 deficiency and either positive anti-parietal cell or anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. Take biopsies from the greater and lesser curves since atrophic gastritis affects the corpus in pernicious anemia.

Introduction

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory condition that involves the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa through the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, with replacement by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Histologically, AIG is characterized by atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa that is, corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis, with or without replacement by metaplastic mucosa. Classically, antral mucosa architecture is preserved, but this might not be the case in more advanced stages or if there is concomitant infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

Histologically, AIG falls under the umbrella “atrophic gastritis,” which comprises several conditions where the downstream histologic consequence of chronic environmental (e.g. H. pylori) or nonenvironmental triggers is gastric atrophy—that is, disappearance of the native gastric glands and thinning of the mucosa.There is abundant literature on chronic H. pylori gastritis leading to progression to multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) and, in a small minority, neoplastic transformation and progression to adenocarcinoma; however, the literature on pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management of AIG is sparse in comparison. Moreover, the heterogeneity across the literature with respect to criteria used to diagnose AIG further contributes to our incomplete understanding of this condition, as well as practice pattern variability. For example, pernicious anemia (PA), which is a late-stage manifestation of AIG characterized by megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, is sometimes defined in studies solely based on laboratory evidence of anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency, without endoscopic/histologic confirmation of AIG.

Notwithstanding challenges related to terminology in the literature, the prevalence of AIG is estimated to be approximately 1–2% and occurs more often in women compared to men, with increasing prevalence with age. Diagnosis of AIG is important, given the need for ongoing clinical management and vigilance with respect to downstream complications, the most serious of which is gastric adenocarcinoma. Other clinical consequences include gastric neuroendocrine tumors, consequences related to decreased gastric acid and decreased intrinsic factor due to parietal cell destruction and antibodies against intrinsic factor (e.g. micronutrient deficiencies), as well as concomitant autoimmune disorders. Considering the prevalence of AIG and the potential for severe clinical outcomes, it is important to engage in efforts to reduce practice pattern variability related to diagnosis and management. Accordingly, herein, we review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation of AIG, including both gastric and extragastric manifestations, and provide an overview of clinical management for the target audience of clinical providers.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^5b776266]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—H pylori testing, surveillance, and pernicious anemia in atrophic gastritis: “All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities.” Regarding surveillance, “the optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making,” and “a surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade.” For autoimmune gastritis, “the optimal surveillance interval … is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making.” Providers should recognize that “pernicious anemia [is] a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia,” and “patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors.”

### Noninvasive testing (...) [^b091a7ae]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL. • Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease. • Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia. Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain.

Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Noninvasive Testing Several common conditions associated with IDA can be diagnosed noninvasively, before or after endoscopy. Frequent blood donation, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption syndromes may be suggested by initial evaluation. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H. pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used.

Endoscopy Bidirectional endoscopy is the primary means of evaluation for IDA, although evidence of patient-oriented benefit is lacking. In men and postmenopausal women with IDA, bidirectional endoscopy is recommended based on diagnosis of colonic malignancy in 9% and upper gastrointestinal malignancy in 2% of patients, more than 10 times the rate of colorectal cancer found in routine screening.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^b6ccc08b]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

In one sense, this statement is correct: the term ‘pernicious anaemia,’ when taken literally, implies a severe, life-threatening form of anaemia, which is uncommon in modern practice due to improvements in testing and treatment, such severe manifestations are typically prevented, as the condition is more likely to be diagnosed earlier or treated with B 12. However, changing the name overlooks the broader clinical context of PA, which is not just an issue of anaemia but rather a condition characterised by the autoimmune-mediated destruction of parietal cells leading to IF deficiency and lifelong B 12 malabsorption. Three other points warrant mentioning. First, there is also a separate autoimmune-mediated attack on IF that will lead to PA. Second, not all AIG diagnoses translate to PA. PA occurs in only about 15–20% of AIG patients, highlighting the inaccuracy of using AIG as a substitute for PA. The life-course of PA development has not been studied, but there is sufficient information to highlight that the timelines are highly varied among patients. For instance, some individuals may develop PA as early as 1 year after the onset of AIG, while others may not progress to PA until 15 or more years after AIG onset. Thus, whilst PA is acknowledged as a consequence of AIG, conflating the two terms risks oversimplifying the disease process and ignoring the clinical specificity of PA as an advanced manifestation. Third, over 50% of individuals with symptomatic B deficiency test negative for IF or parietal cell auto-antibodies, and the true prevalence of AIG in the UK is not known, as individuals with B deficiency rarely undergo endoscopy.

PRECAUTIONS

Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the

neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made.

Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^386ac0bc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 3 
Association plot for ICD10 codes associated with pernicious anemia diagnosis in Estonian Biobank.

Each triangle in the plot represents one ICD10 main code and the direction of the triangle represents direction of effect—upward-pointing triangles show increased prevalence of diagnosis code in pernicious anemia cases. Red line— Bonferroni-corrected significance level (2.5 × 10 −5).

We also tested the prevalence of other autoimmune diseases among the cases compared to controls. In EstBB, 55.8% of all pernicious cases have at least one other autoimmune diagnosis (23.9% in controls). For comparison, we did a similar look-up for other common autoimmune diseases as well— type 1 diabetes (35.9% vs 22.8%), vitiligo (37.9% vs 23.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (39.3% vs 19.2%), and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (33.7% vs 18.6%). This confirmed the higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in pernicious anemia as well as other autoimmune diseases. A similar look-up in the UKBB data showed that 35% of pernicious anemia cases and 9% of controls had at least one other autoimmune disease from our tested list (Methods).

To check whether the pernicious anemia associations were driven by concomitant autoimmune diseases (mostly vitiligo and thyroid problems, which were also highlighted as significant in the associated diagnoses analysis), we did a look-up for vitiligo, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid disease associations in our meta-analysis summary statistics (Supplementary Data 5). Since autoimmune diseases can share pathogenic mechanisms, we focused on loci that according to current knowledge do not regulate autoimmune response. For vitiligo, we chose variants annotated to genes associated with melanocyte biology and for thyroid issues we chose the TSHR (thyroid stimulating hormone receptor) and TPO (thyroid peroxidase) loci and others (Supplementary Table 5). None of these variants reached a nominal significance in our pernicious anemia GWAS meta-analysis, confirming that the observed associations are not mainly driven by concomitant autoimmune disease.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^546ce611]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients may also present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper that may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms.In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged >60 years are at highest risk for developing pernicious anemia (autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells).A B12 level of <300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrants a diagnostic trial of B12.Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200-300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs.Older adults with mild B12 deficiency with normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg, daily.Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

Medical management

There is limited guidance on the management of non-neoplastic complications of AIG/PA, including frequency of interval surveillance and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency and iron deficiency. Importantly, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of anemia and if not addressed can lead to irreversible neurologic deficits. Parenteral rather than oral supplementation is preferred, especially if neurologic symptoms are present. Appropriate supplementation of vitamin B12 and iron is important, along with workup of other etiologies for these not uncommon deficiencies based on the clinical scenario.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^8535b5f4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In summary, our analysis of 2166 cases and 659,516 controls identifies robust risk loci for pernicious anemia in or near candidate genes with a known role in autoimmune conditions (PTPN22, HLA, IL2RA, and AIRE) and suggests PNPT1 as a potential causal gene with possible sexually dimorphic effects in the 2p16.1 locus that needs further validation. The associations between the identified loci and other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, and autoimmune thyroid conditions help to clarify the link between pernicious anemia and its common comorbidities. Analysis of associated diagnoses confirm the association between pernicious anemia and thyroid issues, vitiligo, gastritis, stomach cancer, osteoporosis, and other diagnoses, but also between pernicious anemia and spontaneous abortion.

Introduction

B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency, also known as pernicious anemia, is characterized by impaired B12 uptake caused by lack of intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein produced by epithelial cells of the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor normally binds B12 and facilitates absorption in the intestinal tract. Pernicious anemia is often caused by autoimmune damage to the stomach lining (autoimmune gastritis) in which case the gastric epithelial lining is damaged or destroyed. The prevalence of pernicious anemia is around 0.1% in populations of European ancestry; however, it is more common in older people (~2% in >60 year olds), and believed to be less prevalent in Asian populations. Symptoms of pernicious anemia range from fatigue to megaloblastic anemia and neurological abnormalities (peripheral numbness, paresthesia, and ataxia) in more serious cases.

Pernicious anemia is a complex disease with familial clustering, with a clear autoimmune basis and higher incidence of other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid conditions, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetesin both patients with pernicious anemia and their relatives. Previous studies have identified genetic variants affecting vitamin B12 levels in the general populationor associated with gastric parietal cell autoantibody positivity in type 1 diabetes patients, but it is not known whether these associate with pernicious anemia as well. Although studies focusing on HLA serotypes have been conducted for pernicious anemia, the results have been conflictingand currently there is no clear consensus on the HLA alleles or other genetic risk factors predisposing to pernicious anemia.

Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor to evaluate the contribution of genetic variation to the etiology of this disease in a combined dataset of 2166 cases and 659,516 controls from three large population based biobanks—Estonian Biobank (EstBB), UK Biobank (UKBB), and FinnGen study. Our analyses identify five genome-wide significant signals, thus providing evidence for robust associations between pernicious anemia and genetic risk factors.

Diagnosing PA: the commonest non-nutritional cause of vitamin B deficiency

Given how NICE guidelines are used in practice, we find that the guidelines lack specific advice on the clinical scenarios in which practitioners should suspect AIG and PA. While they recommend considering an anti-intrinsic factor autoantibody test if AIG is suspected, the guidelines do not adequately explain why general practitioners should suspect an autoimmune basis beyond typical gastrointestinal symptoms. The presentation of AIG is highly variable, and looking only for gastrointestinal symptoms is insufficient as these present only in the later stages or not at all in most patients. Intrinsic factor auto-antibodies (IF-Ab) perform poorly as a stand-alone diagnostic marker for PA. Although they are highly specific, they have low sensitivity and present in less than 50% of PA patients. The guidelines acknowledge that a negative IF-Ab test does not rule out AIG or PA, and they suggest additional investigations when clinical suspicion remains. They further state that these should include anti-gastric parietal cell antibody (PC-Ab) tests, gastrin level measurements, CobaSorb tests, or gastroscopy with gastric body biopsy. However, despite their high sensitivity, PC-Ab has poor specificity and is present in other autoimmune conditions (e.g. autoimmune thyroid diseases) and, more generally, in approximately 10% of the general population. However, the uncertainty with this is whether it presents a pre-vitamin B12 deficiency or PA, where individuals are not yet symptomatic or are symptomatic but have a serum B12 value within the normal reference ranges. Therefore, a positiveresult will not definitively indicate PA or AIG. Additionally, PC-Ab might test positive in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-related chronic superficial gastritis, further complicating its diagnostic utility.

### Vitamin B deficiency from the perspective of a practicing hematologist [^23e764d7]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

B 12 deficiency is the leading cause of megaloblastic anemia, and although more common in the elderly, can occur at any age. Clinical disease caused by B 12 deficiency usually connotes severe deficiency, resulting from a failure of the gastric or ileal phase of physiological B 12 absorption, best exemplified by the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia. There are many other causes of B 12 deficiency, which range from severe to mild. Mild deficiency usually results from failure to render food B 12 bioavailable or from dietary inadequacy. Although rarely resulting in megaloblastic anemia, mild deficiency may be associated with neurocognitive and other consequences. B 12 deficiency is best diagnosed using a combination of tests because none alone is completely reliable. The features of B 12 deficiency are variable and may be atypical. Timely diagnosis is important, and treatment is gratifying. Failure to diagnose B 12 deficiency can have dire consequences, usually neurological. This review is written from the perspective of a practicing hematologist.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^e23a01e6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory condition that involves the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa through the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, with replacement by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Diagnosing AIG is important, given the need for ongoing clinical management and vigilance with respect to downstream complications, the most serious of which is gastric adenocarcinoma.

Considering the prevalence of AIG and the potential for severe clinical outcomes, it is important to engage in efforts to reduce practice pattern variability related to diagnosis and management. Accordingly, herein, we review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation of AIG, including both gastric and extragastric manifestations, and provide an overview of clinical management.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^2f532489]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Look-up of genetic variants associated with vitamin B12 levels in our data showed that in general, the allele which decreases serum B12 levels increases the risk of pernicious anemia, although none of these variants was genome-wide significant in our analysis. It cannot be ruled out that, in addition to the autoimmune component, pernicious anemia has some of its origins in the biological regulation of vitamin B12 levels, or alternatively—people with naturally lower B12 levels are diagnosed earlier. This could also mean our dataset of supposedly pernicious anemia cases also includes individuals with other causes of B12 deficiency, or alternatively—the datasets used in the Grarup et al. studyof B12 levels in the general population included cases of pernicious anemia. However, as pointed out before, the loci identified in this study and mapped candidate genes have a clear role in autoimmune regulation, suggesting most our analysed cases have autoimmune B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia).

A similar look-up of variants associated with parietal cell autoantibodies (a biomarker of autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia) in T1D patients showed that many of these loci are nominally associated with our analysed phenotype as well. The associated loci have a central role in immune regulation (incl PTPN22, CTLA4, IFIH1, HLA region, and SH2B3). Notably, we did not see an association with the parietal cell autoantibody-associated INS locus, which again suggests that the genome-wide significant loci we report are not confounded by accompanying autoimmune disease (such as T1D where INS plays a central role in the etiopathogenesis).

This GWAS meta-analysis focused on individuals with pernicious anemia identified from population-based biobanks, thus more detailed analysis on the effect these genetic risk factors have on disease severity or subphenotypes is unfortunately not possible. The analyses included participants of European ancestry, however, analyses in other populations are warranted, since the prevalence of pernicious anemia differs depending on racial background, being more common in people with African or European ancestry, especially from Scandinavia and UK. The analysis of associated phenotypes could potentially provide clinically useful insights into pernicious anemia disease trajectories and offer information for patient management; however, at the moment it only includes participants of the EstBB, with limited follow-up time, therefore further studies are needed.

### Autoimmune gastritis in type 1 diabetes: a clinically oriented review [^607ab284]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia are common autoimmune disorders, being present in up to 2% of the general population. In patients with type 1 diabetes or autoimmune thyroid disease, the prevalence is 3- to 5-fold increased. This review addresses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical consequences, and management of autoimmune gastritis in type 1 diabetic patients.

Synthesis

Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by: 1) atrophy of the corpus and fundus; 2) autoantibodies to the parietal cell and to intrinsic factor; 3) achlorhydria; 4) iron deficiency anemia; 5) hypergastrinemia; 6) pernicious anemia may result from vitamin B12 deficiency; and 7) in up to 10% of patients, autoimmune gastritis may predispose to gastric carcinoid tumors or adenocarcinomas. This provides a strong rationale for screening, early diagnosis, and treatment. The management of patients with autoimmune gastritis implies yearly determination of gastrin, iron, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. Iron or vitamin B12 should be supplemented in patients with iron deficiency or pernicious anemia. Whether regular gastroscopic surveillance, including biopsies, is needed in patients with autoimmune gastritis/pernicious anemia is controversial. The gastric carcinoids that occur in these patients generally do not pose a great threat to life, whereas the danger of developing carcinoma is controversial. Nevertheless, awaiting a consensus statement, we suggest performing gastroscopy and biopsy at least once in patients with autoantibodies to the parietal cell, iron-, or vitamin B12-deficiency anemia, or high gastrin levels.

Conclusion

The high prevalence of autoimmune gastritis in type 1 diabetic patients and its possible adverse impact on the health of the patient provide a strong rationale for screening, early diagnosis, periodic surveillance by gastroscopy, and treatment.

### Autoimmune mechanisms in pernicious anaemia&thyroid disease [^08ef8148]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Pernicious anaemia (PA) and some types of thyroid disease result from autoimmune processes. The autoimmune mechanisms in these conditions have not been fully elucidated. This review discusses the autoimmune mechanisms involved in PA and how these affect diagnosis and disease progression. In addition to gastric antibodies, antibodies to the vitamin B12 binding protein transcobalamin which can result in high serum B12 levels are also addressed with regard to how they affect clinical practice. The role of autoimmune susceptibility is investigated by comparing PA to one of its most common comorbidities, autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Thyroid disease (although not exclusively AITD) and B12 deficiency are both also implicated in the pathology of hyperhomocysteinemia, an elevated homocysteine in plasma. Since hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular occlusive disease, this review also addresses how thyroid disease in particular leads to changes in homocysteine levels.

Analysis of associated phenotypes in EstBB

Using the individual level data in the EstBB, we conducted an analysis to find ICD10 diagnosis codes associated with the D51.0 diagnosis. We tested the association between pernicious anemia status (defined as ICD10 D51.0) and other ICD10 codes using logistic regression and adjusting for sex, age, and ten PCs. Bonferroni correction was applied to select statistically significant associations (Number of tested ICD main codes—1944, corrected p value threshold—2.5 × 10 −5). Results were visualized using the PheWas library. All analyses were carried out in R 3.6.1. The results of this analysis are presented in Supplementary Data 6.

Analysis of autoimmune disease prevalence

To test the prevalence of other autoimmune diseases in pernicious anemia cases, we made a list of 40 autoimmune diagnoses(Supplementary Data 7) and checked their cumulative prevalence (% of individuals having at least one of these diagnoses) among the EstBB and UKBB cohorts, for which we had access to individual level data.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^02fee509]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To clarify the overlap between genetic regulation of pernicious anemia and natural B12 levels, we did a look-up of eleven variants associated with vitamin B12 levels in a large Icelandic whole genome sequence dataset combined with Danish exome sequencing data (Supplementary Data 5). None of these variants were genome-wide significant in our data, but 8/11 showed nominally significant association p values, with the allele decreasing serum B12 levels consistently also increasing the risk of pernicious anemia (Supplementary Data 5). Finally, parietal cell antibody positivity (a biomarker for autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia) has been associated with the ABO locus at 9q34and T1D risk loci. The lowest p value (p = 0.005) for the ABO region in our meta-analysis was for rs8176760. Six of the nine T1D risk loci showing significant PCA associations were at least nominally significant in our meta-analysis (Supplementary Data 5), including rs2476601 (PTPN22), which is one of our top associated variants.

Associated phenotypes

We used the individual level data in EstBB to evaluate the association between pernicious anemia and other diseases (defined by ICD-10 codes). According to our analysis, individuals with pernicious anemia have more diagnoses of other anemias and vitamin deficiencies (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 6), thyroid problems (thyroiditis and hypothyroidism), gastrointestinal tract diagnoses (gastritis, malignant neoplasm of stomach, intestinal malabsorption, irritable bowel syndrome), but also of vitiligo, dermatitis, osteoporosis, and spontaneous abortion. Majority of these diagnoses reflect the etiology of pernicious anemia (gastritis) or symptoms (skin problems, syncope and collapse, depression, and stomatitis), known comorbidities (vitiligo and thyroid issues,), or diseases where pernicious anemia is a known risk factor (such as osteoporosisand stomach cancer). The association with spontaneous abortion is interesting, as although there is some evidence B12 deficiency and pernicious anemia could cause recurrent miscarriage –, the data is scarce and the link with spontaneous miscarriage has not been explored in depth.

### The frequency of gallbladder stones in patients with pernicious anemia [^a6f564c3]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Ineffective erythropoiesis and intramedullary hemolysis are the two important results of pernicious anemia. Hemolysis is one of the risk factors in the formation of gallbladder stones.

Patients and Methods

The frequency of gallstones was searched in 59 patients with pernicious anemia and in 54 healthy subjects.

Results

Nineteen (32.2%) patients in the pernicious anemia group and three (5.5%) patients in the control group were detected to have gallstones. Pernicious anemia patients with and without gallbladder stones were also compared for mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, and vitamin B12 levels but no statistically significant difference was encountered.

Conclusion

Apart from other risk factors, pernicious anemia itself increases the frequency of gallbladder stones. Should patients with pernicious anemia develop upper-abdominal pain or other symptoms referable to biliary tract disease, a high index of suspicion for gallstone-related disease should be maintained.

### Definition of pernicious anemia-NCI dictionary (...) [^455e6490]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

pernicious anemia A condition in which the body is unable to properly absorb vitamin B12, leading to a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells in the body. Vitamin B12 binds to a protein in the stomach called intrinsic factor. This allows vitamin B12 to be absorbed in the small intestine and then released into the bloodstream. Pernicious anemia occurs when there is too little intrinsic factor to bind enough vitamin B12 for it to be used by the body to make red blood cells. In most cases, this happens when the body’s immune system attacks the intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the lining of the stomach that make it. It may also occur in people with atrophic gastritis, a condition marked by chronic inflammation and thinning of the inner lining of the stomach. If not treated, pernicious anemia can lead to serious problems, including damage to the nervous system.

People with pernicious anemia may have an increased risk of stomach cancer, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, or some other types of cancer.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^22e1aea6]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^d872e4cc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For additional analyses requiring individual-level data (cohort descriptive statistics, sex-stratified analysis of lead signals, and look-up of additional autoimmune diseases in pernicious anemia cases, we used data under the application 17085. No additional ethics approval were needed for this dataset and UKBB’s Ethics and Governance Council provides guidelines for conducting studies with this dataset. We focused on samples of genetically confirmed British European ancestry. We excluded individuals who had withdrawn their consent, were labeled with poor heterozygosity or missingness as defined by UKBB, had excess (>10) relatives, were not included in autosome phasing, had putative sex chromosome aneuploidy, or had sex mismatch between self-reported and genotype data. Pernicious anemia cases were extracted using the ICD10 D51.0 code in HES (Hospital Episodes and Spells) data (downloaded on July 11, 2020). Since the phenotype data was extracted at different timepoints and using slightly different (exclusion) criteria, the follow-up analyses included a larger number of pernicious anemia cases (n = 1192) compared to the original GWAS analysis (n = 754). The descriptive characteristics of the follow-up dataset in the UKBB were: cases—384 men (age 61.9 ± 15.7 years) and 808 women (age 59.1 ± 7.7 years), controls 187,056 men (age 57.1 ± 8.1 years) and 219,756 women (age 56.7 ± 7.9 years).

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^7ce65bc0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

Estimates of AIG prevalence vary depending on the study and rigor of the diagnostic criteria—that is, whether the diagnosis was based on serology, medical coding, or endoscopy with biopsy confirmation. Indeed, some studies have classified patients as having AIG based solely on the presence of low serum vitamin B12, which has a broad differential diagnosis, without confirming the diagnosis on gastric histopathology. Other studies base the diagnosis on the presence of parietal cell antibodies (PCAs) or anti-intrinsic factor (IF) antibodies, which is also incorrect, given that these lack specificity (PCA) and sensitivity (IF) and patients may have seronegative AIG. With these considerations in mind, the prevalence of AIG is estimated to range from 0.1% to 1–2% in the general population, but higher in certain populations including women and those >60 years old (estimated 2–3%). There is at least a 2:1 female versus male predominance of AIG,and some data suggest that non-white individuals might have an earlier onset of AIG compared to white individuals.

### Treatment of vitamin b (12)-deficiency anemia: oral versus parenteral therapy [^0086fc69]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of oral cyanocobalamin therapy in the treatment of cobalamin (vitamin B(12))-deficient anemia.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-May 2000) and through secondary sources.

Data Synthesis

Cobalamin-deficient anemia is among the most common diagnoses in older populations. Cobalamin-deficient anemia may be diagnosed as pernicious anemia, resulting from the lack of intrinsic factor required for cobalamin absorption or as protein malabsorption from the inability to displace cobalamin from protein food sources. Several studies provide evidence that daily oral cyanocobalamin as opposed to monthly parenteral formulations may adequately treat both types of cobalamin-deficient anemias.

Conclusions

Daily oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 1000-2000 microg can be used for treatment in most cobalamin-deficient patients who can tolerate oral supplementation. There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of oral cyanocobalamin replacement in patients with severe neurologic involvement.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^050290fa]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach, with a primary focus on atrophic gastritis due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection-the most common etiology-or due to autoimmunity. To date, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports. Nevertheless, atrophic gastritis represents an important stage with distinct histopathologic alterations in the multistep cascade of gastric cancer pathogenesis.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented herein were developed from a combination of available evidence from published literature and consensus-based expert opinion. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. These statements are meant to provide practical advice to clinicians practicing in the United States. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Atrophic gastritis is defined as the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity. Regardless of the etiology, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Providers should be aware that the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. There should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: When endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis. Providers should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making. A surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The optimal surveillance interval for individuals with autoimmune gastritis is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Individuals with autoimmune gastritis should be screened for type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors with upper endoscopy. Small neuroendocrine tumors should be removed endoscopically, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 1-2 years, depending on the burden of neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Providers should evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies in patients with atrophic gastritis irrespective of etiology, especially if corpus-predominant. Likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, atrophic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with autoimmune gastritis, providers should recognize that concomitant autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, are common. Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be performed.

### Autoimmune gastritis [^c09cb912]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context.—

Autoimmune gastritis (AG) is a corpus-restricted chronic atrophic gastritis associated with intrinsic factor deficiency, either with or without pernicious anemia. Autoimmune gastritis is a microscopic disease because patients present with no or vague symptoms, and clinicians rarely find endoscopic changes. Autoimmune gastritis only becomes a clinical disease when pathologists diagnose it in gastric biopsies performed for a variety of clinical indications. Unfamiliarity with this disease can result in misdiagnosis of patients, and thus inadequate patient management.

Objective.—

To review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, sequelae, and surveillance recommendations for AG.

Data Sources.—

The sources of the study include a review of the pertinent literature for AG.

Conclusions.—

Autoimmune gastritis is an important disease characterized by a loss of oxyntic mucosa and presence of metaplastic epithelium and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Awareness and proper diagnosis are critical to prevent mismanagement of patients.

### Neuromuscular complications of nutritional deficiencies [^d07e26f4]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

For many nutrition deficiencies, a direct cause and effect of different symptoms and diseases has been established. These are known as primary nutritional deficiencies. Secondary deficiencies occur when the vitamin or nutrient requirement may be increased, such as in patients who have pernicious anemia who lack the intrinsic factor needed to absorb vitamin B12. Less well recognized are the effects of nutritional deficiencies on chronic disease, especially acute and chronic neuromuscular diseases. This article identifies some of the causative factors and provides the reader with a guideline for what to consider in the evaluation of individuals who have neuromuscular problems. The context of these disorders is best understood on a foundation of basic nutrition information.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^3fd4e125]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) management—testing and surveillance: Among individuals diagnosed with AIG, we recommend assessment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with a nonserological test, eradication treatment if positive, and posttreatment testing to confirm eradication (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). There is insufficient evidence to make a formal recommendation on endoscopic surveillance in individuals with AIG; given the increased risk of type I neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and the possible increased risk of GC, individualized surveillance may be considered (Low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation). There are no RCTs of surveillance vs no surveillance for the purpose of early neoplasia detection in patients with histologically confirmed AIG, and endoscopic surveillance is suggested in the context of shared decision-making. In patients with pernicious anemia, the risk of GC is highest within the first year of diagnosis; thus, endoscopy should be considered in patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia, with particular consideration of women 50 years or older.

Anemia

The anemia of AIG (with or without PA) may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, although macrocytic is the classic association (Figure 3).Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, with the most often etiologies iron and vitamin B12 deficiency.Gastric acid is important for enzyme activation and freeing micronutrients from dietary sources. Gastric acid is also important for the reduction and absorption of iron. As previously described, vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with AIG may be attributed to parietal cell loss as well as autoantibodies targeting IF. IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating uptake in the terminal ileum. Iron stores are depleted more quickly than vitamin B12 stores and thus iron deficiency anemia is often an early manifestation of AIG. While the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia often prompts an AIG workup,, it should be equally appreciated that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should be evaluated in patients.The diagnosis of anemia may also be confounded by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism. To this end, one multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients, nearly 50% of whom had anemia, demonstrated that certain patient characteristics were associated with patterns of anemia.PA was more common in males and older patients, whereas iron deficiency anemia was more common in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in both those with and without anemia. These findings were similar to another cohort study of 160 patients with AIG based on serologies.In this study, 83 of the 160 patients with AIG were also diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. Again, those with iron deficiency were more often women, younger (median age 41 vs 62 with macrocytic anemia), and had a higher prevalence of H. pylori (41.3% vs 28.6%).

In vitamin B12 deficiency, patients may be asymptomatic while other patients can have sequalae of symptoms as the disease progresses. This includes subtle findings including glossitis or more catastrophic symptoms of infertility, early recurrent miscarriages, or even thrombosis as well as the neurologic symptoms described above.

### Folate, multivitamin (menatrol) [^78bfc642]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Tell your doctor if you have: kidney problems, thyroid disease. This medication should be used as directed during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. Consult your doctor. Administration of folate alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient.

Precautions

Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. The patient’s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

Box 1 
Criteria for referring to genetic services

Many genetic polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, in particular related to inflammatory response genes, such as interleukins, interleukin receptors and tumour necrosis factor.There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine DNA genotyping to inform clinical decisions outside cases that meet the criteria for familial gastric cancer.A detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this guideline.

Pernicious anaemia is another strong risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma development. A systematic review by Vannella and coworkers found that the pooled incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma in patients with pernicious anaemia is 0.27% a year with a relative risk (RR) of 6.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 18.1).A more recent population-based case–control study on 1 138 390 cancer cases compared with 100 000 matched controls found that in patients with pernicious anaemia, the ORs for gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric neuroendocrine tumours were 2.18 (95% CI 1.94 to 2.45) and 11.4 (95% CI 8.9 to 14.7), respectively.Since these were unverified cases of pernicious anaemia, this was probably a marked underestimate of the cancer risk in patients with definite pernicious anaemia. Substantiating a diagnosis of pernicious anaemia, however, can be challenging. Megaloblastic anaemia and vitamin B 12 deficiency can depend on a multitude of clinical conditions, and the diagnostic accuracy of autoantibodies is low (low specificity for antiparietal cell antibodies and low sensitivity for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies).Therefore, in order to stratify cancer risk, it is essential that histopathological evidence of autoimmune atrophic gastritis corroborates the serological diagnosis.

Furthermore, gastrin levels are influenced by multiple factors, including use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are commonly prescribed among older adults. The use of PPIs can increase plasma gastrin levels by 3–5 times, dependent on treatment duration, necessitating suspension before testing, yet the 2024 guidelines do not address this. Additionally, gastrin levels may also be elevated by H. pylori infection. Finally, commercially available kits often measure only one gastrin form, potentially yielding false negatives. Dottori et al. propose a diagnostic pathway for patients suspected of having AIG, which we would recommend to guide the diagnosis of both PA and AIG.

Once AIG and/or PA are suspected and/or test results are positive, individuals should undergo a gastroscopy/endoscopy with histological sampling to determine the presence of AIG. This is essential and routinely practised in many countries around the world for confirmation of PA diagnosis and for the atrophy to be graded for risk stratification in the case of the development of gastric lesions. However, this procedure is rarely performed for PA patients in the UK. Although a positive result for IF-ABs can confirm a diagnosis of PA, gastroscopy remains important for confirming AIG and assessing the degree of gastric atrophy. Results from a recent study found that only 9% of PA patients were offered an gastroscopy/endoscopy at diagnosis, highlighting an important gap in the diagnostic approach for PA (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837). A previous survey also reported that 131 out of 561 (23.3%) patients had undergone endoscopy following a diagnosis of PA, with biopsies taken in 108 of the endoscopies. While the exact reasons are not well-documented, it is likely due to a combination of factors, including cost/limited availability of resources, and poor knowledge of the disease. Additionally, some patients may be hesitant to undergo the procedure due to concerns about its invasiveness or perceived risks despite it being a procedure with minimal risk.

Diagnosis

Diagnostic delay is not uncommon for AIG, particularly because the condition is often asymptomatic or associated with mild nonspecific symptoms. Often, it is incidental laboratory findings such as anemia, which may occur in later stages that prompt diagnostic workup. One study of consecutive patients with AIG at an Italian center found that the median diagnostic delay was 14 months.Factors associated with diagnostic delay included female sex, previous misdiagnosis, history of infertility or miscarriages, as well as initial evaluation by a gastroenterologist (vs hematologist or internist).One study of patients who had been referred to a center in Japan for H. pylori eradication found that a significant proportion (19.5%, n = 43/220) of patients met the criteria for AIG. A majority of these patients (76.7%) had been previously treated twice for H. pylori, even though they were colonized with non- H. pylori urease-producing bacteria.In a study of 99 consecutive patients with AIG based on histology and positive PCA serology, the features which were associated with the diagnosis and may have prompted further evaluation were concomitant autoimmune disorders, neurologic symptoms, family history, vitamin B12 deficiency, and abnormal findings on gastric biopsies.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^c8902d81]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 5—Implementation considerations for folate and vitamin B12 in CKD—states that because absorption of vitamin B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor and normal gut function and the latter is often at least partially impaired in older individuals, assessment of serum vitamin B12 may be necessary if folate supplementation is considered, and that Vitamin B deficiencies may be identified by clinical signs and symptoms and assessment of serum vitamin B12 should be considered if folate supplementation is administered. The guideline notes that high folic acid intake may mask signs of pernicious anemia and undetected progression of neurologic disease, and thus folate and vitamin B12 levels should be monitored if folate is being supplemented, and that suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (eg, RDA) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Individualization of therapy, including supplementation of folate, should be based on monitoring of severity of nutrient depletion, and individualization should include patient age because adults older than 50 years may have increased needs due to the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in this population. For monitoring and evaluation, serum/plasma/RBC folate and serum vitamin B12 levels should be assessed as appropriate.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency presenting with neurological dysfunction in an adolescent [^3830a410]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency is classically encountered in the adult Caucasian population and manifests as a subacute combined degeneration in the presence or absence of macrocytic anemia. However, B12 deficiency is extremely rare in children in developed countries, and pernicious anemia is even rarer etiology of this deficiency. The clinical presentation of B12 deficiency in children is not as easily recognizable or well-characterized and may result in missed or delayed diagnosis.

Patient Description

We describe a previously healthy adolescent girl who presented with emotional lability, mental status changes, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. She was found to have megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration secondary to B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia.

Conclusion

Though B12 deficiency is uncommon in pediatrics, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion because early recognition and treatment of B12 deficiency are key to preventing long-term neurological sequelae.

### Expanding clinical profiles and prognostic markers in stiff person syndrome spectrum disorders [^733f76f4]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are frequent mis-diagnoses as well as delay in diagnosis of SPSD, thus recognizing the salient features of the history and examination are important for timely and accurate diagnosis. This is especially true for patients who present with non-classical features (e.g. median time for diagnosis of PERM was 53.3 months vs. classic SPS was 33.1 months). On the other hand, misdiagnosis and/or over-diagnosis of SPSD is also problematic. Future work, including development of international consensus-based diagnostic criteria, may help aide in improving SPSD diagnosis.

There is frequent co-occurrence of other disorders, many presumed to be autoimmune in nature, most commonly insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorder (such as thyroiditis), and pernicious anemia. Given the frequency of these conditions, it is recommended to screen for and continue to monitor for their development over time. Consider obtaining a set of specific labs (e.g. HgA1c, thyroid function tests, thyroid antibodies, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid) on follow-up visits in order to monitor for the development of these co-morbidities.

Population-based studies of patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy are available from several areas around the world. Prevalence varies from 0.3% to 2.7%. For example, a single-center retrospective study from the United States (1988–2008) reported an overall prevalence of AIG of 1.1% based on gastric biopsies from 41,245 patients with varying indications for endoscopy. The median age of diagnosis was 67.0 (range 18–94) years old with 2:1 female to male predominance. The prevalence was highest in non-white Hispanics (2.7%) but still approximately 1% in self-identified whites, Asians, and African Americans.In Japan, a study of 6,739 asymptomatic individuals who underwent a routine medical examination that included upper endoscopy with biopsies reported AIG prevalence to be 0.49% (0.65% in females and 0.40% in males); none of the patients diagnosed with AIG had anemia, nor did likelihood of AIG vary by H. pylori infection status.A large prospective study from China of 97,341 patients undergoing endoscopies with biopsies diagnosed AIG in 320 (based on histopathologic evidence. While the prevalence of AIG was lower compared to other studies, the same female: male predominance was demonstrated, albeit with a median age of diagnosis of 61 years (range: 26–86 years).Among the 56.9% of patients enrolled in the multi-center histoGERD trial found to have gastritis on endoscopy, approximately 2% had AIG diagnosed based on histology.Patients more commonly had alternative etiologies for the diagnosis of gastritis/gastropathy including H. pylori (18.7%) and reactive gastropathy (20.8%). One cross-sectional study of surgical specimens from 248 patients, who had undergone sleeve gastrectomy in which 12% (n = 30), were found to have gastritis of any type, reported that 0.8% (n = 2) had AIG with microcarcinoids (0% had AIG without microcarcinoids) versus 5.2% (n = 10) had H. pylori associated gastritis.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^bc841073]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There have been several case–control and cohort studies confirming this elevated risk; that being said, it is possible that the risk might even be underestimated, given the heterogeneity with respect to terminology and rigor in confirming a diagnosis of AIG/PA. For example, the US population-based study by Murphy and colleagues described above defined AIG solely on having an ICD-9 code for PA without endoscopic and histologic confirmation (or concordant serologic antibodies). It should also be noted that since this was a Medicare-linked population, only patients > 66 years old were included and thus might not reflect the risk among younger patients.Another large study from Sweden among 21,265 patients hospitalized with PA (unverified diagnosis based on ICD coding) followed for a mean of 7.1 years reported a standardized incidence rate of gastric adenocarcinoma of 2.4 (95% CI: 2.1–2.7) and NETs of 26.4 (95% CI: 14.8–43.5).A retrospective study of stomach biopsy specimens over 20 years at one institution, reported that 143 of 461 (31%) patients had lesions including polyps, neuroendocrine neoplasms, lymphoma, GI stromal tumor, and adenocarcinoma that were identified on endoscopy, 17 of whom had polyps requiring close follow-up, and 11 (2%) had gastric adenocarcinoma.A recent meta-analysis that included 14 studies and 2688 patients found that PA (as defined based on the individual study) was associated with a 2.84-fold (95% CI 2.30–3.50) higher risk of gastric cancer compared to patients without PA.The histology was not specified. A different meta-analysis that included 27 studies and 22,417 patients reported that PA was associated with 6.8-fold (95% CI: 2.6–18.1) higher relative risk of gastric cancer versus patients without PA.This meta-analysis also did not specify the cancer histology, as many included studies did not provide that information.

### A treatable cause of ataxia in children [^319e8d9e]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old black male presenting with severe subacute sensory ataxia, unusual skin hyperpigmentation, megaloblastic anemia, low serum B12 levels, and an abnormal part I Schilling test was diagnosed with pernicious anemia in the context of a polyglandular syndrome. Intrinsic factor and thyroid microsomal antibodies were positive, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were undetectable. There was a strong familial aggregation because the mother, a maternal aunt, the maternal grandfather, and the maternal great-grandmother had been diagnosed with pernicious anemia, albeit of unspecified etiology. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive demyelination of the posterior columns along the entire length of the cord, as well as areas of contrast enhancement. Treatment with cobalamin produced complete remission of the neurologic deficits and normalization of the MRI findings in the short space of 2 months. Although rare, childhood pernicious anemia is a treatable disease that should be included in the differential diagnosis of the sensory ataxias in children. In this article, we review the causes of pernicious anemia in children and discuss the MRI findings.

Other nutrient deficiencies

Achlorhydria/hypochlorhydria may also lead to other micronutrient deficiencies, in addition to iron and vitamin B12 described above. One single-center study of 122 patients with AIG on endoscopic biopsy found that 76 had at least one nutritional deficiency (vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, and folic acid) and 52 had more than one.The progression of vitamin deficiencies occurs over a long period of time due to natural reserves in the body and can present with vague, non-localizing symptoms. Thus, providers should be attuned to other nutritional deficiencies in patients with AIG and manage these appropriately.

Concomitant autoimmune diseases

As noted, AIG not uncommonly coexists with other autoimmune conditions, some of which have GI manifestations. Concomitant thyroid disease is most common, with two recent retrospective cohort studies of AIG patients showing 36–44% of these patients had autoimmune thyroiditis. Conversely, among patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, approximately 40% had atrophic body gastritis and 16% had PA. Among patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the risk of AIG is elevated 3–5 times that of the general population. – Similarly, another study of other autoimmune disease include Addison’s disease (4.8% of Addison’s patients also had PA),T1DM (5–10% with AIG, 2–4% with PA),and some other diseases such as vitiligo, chronic spontaneous urticarial, myasthenia gravis, and perioral cutaneous autoimmune conditions.Indeed, in patients with an autoimmune disease who present with anemia, a diagnosis of AIG should be considered.

### Ferrous fumarate, folic acid (pretrate) [^bf08a7f9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Administration of folic acid alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12is deficient.

Precautions

Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia.

The patient’s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^0ef57a36]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 5—Folate status assessment and safety—describes that folate status is most often assessed through measurement of folate levels in plasma, serum, or red blood cells (RBCs), and that RBC folate levels are more reflective of folate tissue status than serum folate and represent vitamin status at the time the RBC was synthesized. It notes that usually RBC folate concentrations diminish after about 4 months of low folate intake, reflecting the 120-day life span of RBCs in healthy individuals, and that in patients with CKD such concentrations often decrease more rapidly, reflecting the shorter RBC life span in CKD. Safety considerations include that excessive folate intake inhibits zinc absorption in the gut by forming a complex with zinc in the intestinal lumen and that high intake of folic acid may mask signs of pernicious anemia, leading to undetected progression of neurologic disease.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^2e93f21d]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Regulatory T cells in diabetes and gastritis [^dd98e07d]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) have an increased prevalence of associated organ-specific autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia whose histological substrate is a chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). Latent pernicious anemia precedes clinically-manifest pernicious anemia and may be difficult to detect solely on simple analytical grounds. We recently described an increased prevalence of clinically-latent pernicious anemia in T1D using low concentrations of pepsinogen I, a zymogen of pepsin present in gastric mucosa, as a useful additional diagnostic marker, besides parietal cell antibodies, for screening latent pernicious anemia in T1D. The failure of peripheral tolerance mechanisms such as regulatory T cells (Treg) might be involved in CAG development in T1D patients. Indeed, functional defects in Tregs have been described in T1D patients. To this end, the percentage of Tregs in peripheral blood of T1D-CAG patients was analyzed and compared with those of a group of T1D without associated autoantibodies and a healthy control group. Tregs levels were also analyzed in gastric biopsies of T1D-CAG patients. The results obtained have led to new questions regarding the pathogenic mechanisms implicated in the development of associated autoimmune diseases in T1D.

### Pernicious anemia (...) [^ad53012c]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

• When patients are examined for possible cobalamin deficiency, great stress is often placed on the presence or absence of macrocytosis and anemia and on how low the serum cobalamin level is. The present study, however, shows that only 45 of 70 consecutively diagnosed patients with pernicious anemia, the most common cause of cobalamin deficiency, had very low cobalamin levels. Anemia was absent in 13 of the patients, and macrocytosis was absent in 23 of the patients; such absence was particularly common when cobalamin levels were only slightly or moderately low. Coexisting iron deficiency was responsible for the absence of macrocytosis in nine patients. Of the ten patients with neither anemia nor macrocytosis, neurological disturbance was prominent in six, including four whose only noticeable abnormality was cerebral.

These observations indicate that macrocytosis and anemia, two classic features of pernicious anemia, may be overstressed in our diagnostic approach. All subnormal serum cobalamin results are best viewed as pathological until proved otherwise. Emphasis on only very low cobalamin levels risks delaying the diagnosis of pernicious anemia in a substantial proportion of cases, particularly in those without anemia or macrocytosis. Carmel R.

### Unusual case of pernicious anaemia masquerading as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the setting of multiple normal vitamin B12 deficiency parameters: preventing anchoring and overdiagnosis [^eff8bded]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (pseudo- thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)) is a rare presentation of B12 deficiency. Overlapping features like elevated LDH/total bilirubin with low haemoglobin/haptoglobin/platelets could deceivingly suggest thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) resulting in avoidable procedures/treatments.

Case Presentation

A 36-year-old female with hypothyroidism initially presented to clinic with fatigue, palpitations, lightheadedness, and dyspnoea over a 3-month duration and was found to have a haemoglobin of 5.7 g/dL. She received two packed red blood cell units in the emergency room and subsequently discharged with outpatient follow-up and empiric oral iron. During her follow-up visit, she was found to have easy bruisability, gum bleeding, and generalized weakness from hemolytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 90 fL, haptoglobin <8 mg/dL, LDH >4,000 U/L and schistocytosis on CBC) and thrombocytopenia of 52 K/uL. Due to PLASMIC score of 6 and suspicion for TTP, she was transferred to our facility and tr eated with three cycles of plasma exchange and prednisone but were discontinued when ADAMTS13 levels returned normal. While the patient had normal B12 levels, further testing revealed positive intrinsic factor antibodies (IF-Ab) and an elevated MMA level of 1.56 umol/L. Replacement with cobalamin led to normalization of labs and symptoms.

Conclusions

Timely diagnosis of pseudo-TMA was exceptionally challenging due to several overlapping features with TTP including normal B12 and normal MCV. B12 levels may falsely appear normal in pernicious anemia due to IF-Ab interference with chemiluminescent immunoassay. Schistocytes lower the MCV in automated cell counters. Lower reticulocyte index (<2%), presence of immature/large platelets and teardrop cells, elevated MMA and a higher LDH (>2500) are indicative of B12 deficiency.

### Patterns of autoimmunity and subsequent chronic lymphocytic leukemia in nordic countries [^70ae6912]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

A population-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) associated with personal and/or family history of autoimmune and related diseases. Data were obtained for all (n = 7764) patients diagnosed with CLL in Sweden and Denmark over a 40-year period and with linkable relatives, 16,658 matched control subjects, and first-degree relatives of patients (n = 17,991) and control subjects (n = 39,388). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to quantify risk of CLL in relation to personal/family history of 32 autoimmune and related disorders. The risk of CLL was significantly increased among subjects with a personal history of pernicious anemia (OR = 1.94; 1.18-3.18), mainly in the 0- to 1-year latency period. A significantly decreased risk of CLL was found among individuals with a personal history of chronic rheumatic heart disease (OR = 0.55; 0.33-0.93), particularly persons with a long latency (10+ years) between the 2 conditions. We found no association between personal or familial occurrence of other autoimmune or related disorders and CLL. If our results are confirmed, mechanistic studies examining how pernicious anemia might promote increased occurrence of CLL and how chronic rheumatic heart disease protects against CLL, perhaps related to long-term antibiotics use, may provide insights to the as-yet-unknown etiology of CLL.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^b65e78bd]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Screening for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T1DM

Among patients with T1DM, there are no clear guidelines regarding screening for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, due to the high prevalence of pernicious anaemia and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency among T1DM patients reported in most cross sectional studies, it would be pragmatic to screen at diagnosis and then later yearly for 3 years, then five yearly thereafter or in presence of any clinical indication since vitamin B12 deficiency can develop at anytime. Screening should involve assessment of serum vitamin B12 levels and markers of gastric autoimmunity like PCA and AIF especially among T1DM patients with GAD-65 and thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Presence of these auto antibodies increases the propensity to developing vitamin B12 deficiency.

Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients

Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency does not differ regardless of the aetiology. All patients deficient of vitamin B12 should receive replacement therapy with either oral or parenteral vitamin B12. Both formulations have been demonstrated to induce comparable desirable haematological and neurological improvements regardless of the aetiology of the deficiency. In adult patients with T2DM, intra muscular or oral vitamin B12 in doses of 1000 μg daily for a week then once every week for 4 weeks are sufficient to correct vitamin B12 deficiency.

Among young patients with T1DM and co-existing vitamin B12 deficiency, replacement therapy with daily intra muscular or oral vitamin B12 in the dose of 100μg for a week and then monthly is satisfactory. In severe cases, parenteral or oral administration of 1000 μg/day of vitamin B12 for a week, followed by the similar dose given every week for 1 month and then later monthly is advised.

Concomitant folate deficiency should be treated with oral folate replacement in doses of 5 mg daily for 1–4 months. Folate administration prior to correcting vitamin B12 deficiency should be avoided because it results into progression and / worsening of the associated neurological manifestations.

### High-risk gastric pathology and prevalent autoimmune diseases in patients with pernicious anemia [^a7ee70e0]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Pernicious anemia (PA) develops from atrophic gastritis due to autoimmune destruction of parietal cells and results in achlorhydria, vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies, anemia, neurologic deficits, and premalignant and malignant stomach lesions. We report the presentation, diagnosis and gastric complications of PA in patients from an endocrinology practice.

Methods

Thirty-four patients (31 female, 3 male) with PA who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or gastrectomy were identified. Pertinent clinical, laboratory, and pathology findings were reviewed and summarized.

Results

The mean age of patients was 58.6 ± 14.2 years; the onset of PA was age 50.2 ± 15.3 years. Anemia reflected vitamin B12 and/or iron deficiencies. Parietal cell antibodies (PCA) were detected in 97% of patients, and intrinsic factor blocking antibody (IFBA) was found in 52%. Fasting gastrin and chromogranin A levels were elevated (1,518.0 ± 1,588.3 pg/mL, and 504.9.1 ± 1,524.9 ng/mL respectively). Autoimmune or immunologic diseases (AIDs) were present in 32/34 patients. Stomach pathology showed premalignant or malignant lesions in 26 patients, including gastric neuroendocrine tumors (GNETs) in 6 and adenocarcinoma in 1. One patient presented with neurologic symptoms and subacute combined degeneration of the posterior column of the spinal cord.

Conclusion

PA should be suspected in patients with unexplained anemia or neurologic symptoms. The diagnosis of PA relies on fasting gastrin and gastric auto-antibody testing, in addition to hematologic evaluation. EGD with measurement of gastric pH and biopsies of the fundus and antrum identifies patients with achlorhydria, atrophic gastritis, and premalignant and malignant stomach lesions. EGD surveillance of patients with high-risk stomach lesions is recommended.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^18d0cbcc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Histology (Figure 2(a) and (b))

On histopathology, the early phase of AIG is characterized by inflammatory cell invasion of the parietal cells (the non-atrophic phase); over time, there is progressive destruction of oxyntic glands (atrophic phase). The presence of relatively normal antral mucosa with inflammatory infiltrates in the oxyntic mucosa, including plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells, with patchy oxyntic gland destruction is characteristic of AIG.With ongoing inflammation, the mucosa atrophies, and glands are replaced by fibrous tissue.The hypochlorhydric environment also leads to increased gastrin secretion, which in turn exerts a trophic effect on both parietal cell glands and enterochromaffin-like cells (ECLs), evidence of which may also be seen on histopathology in the early stages. – A prospective longitudinal study of 270 patients with AIG showed that the histopathology of all patients progressed over time, from mild (mild atrophy of oxyntic mucosa with lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration) to florid (moderate atrophy of oxyntic mucosa with lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration) to end stage (severe atrophy of oxyntic mucosa), generally within 3 years.No patients had regression to milder stages. In this study, patients with ECL dysplasia, neuroendocrine dysplasia or neoplasia, or adenocarcinoma were defined as “complicated stage.”

Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus

Type 1 DM (T1DM) is an auto immune condition that results from auto immune destruction of insulin secreting beta cells of the pancreas. It is invariably associated with other organ and non organ specific auto immune and endocrine conditions leading to development of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes.

Pernicious anemia resulting from chronic autoimmune gastritis is highly frequent among patients with T1DM. Chronic autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia occurs in about 2% and up to 1% of the general population respectively. Among patients with T1DM, the prevalence is increased by 3 to 5 folds.

Vitamin B12 deficiency due to pernicious anemia occurs frequently among patients with T1DM. In one cross sectional study done in South India among 90 patients with T1DM, low vitamin B12 levels were noted among 45.5% of the study subjects as defined by the manufactures’ cut off point of <180 pg/ml and among 54% using the published cut off point of <200 pg/ml. No positive correlation was noted between low vitamin B12 levels and gender, age, duration of DM and level of glycemic control.

Patients with T1DM actively exhibit auto antibodies to intrinsic factor (AIF) type 1 and 2 and parietal cell antibodies (PCA) especially those with glutamate decarboxylase-65 (GAD-65) antibodies and HLA-DQA1*0501-B1*0301 haplotype.

The PCA inhibit secretion of intrinsic factor resulting into pernicious anemia, a condition which is 10 times more prevalent among type 1 diabetic patients than non diabetic patients. Type 1 AIF result into vitamin B12 deficiency by blocking the binding of vitamin B12 to IF. This prevents its transportation to its absorption site, the terminal ileum. These auto antibodies are found in 70% of patients with pernicious anemia.

Primary autoimmune hypothyroidism and celiac disease are frequent co morbidities among patients with T1DM [-] and directly affect vitamin B12 metabolism. In one cross sectional study among 504 ambulatory T1DM patients in South Africa, the overall prevalence of co-existing auto immune hypothyroidism was 20.2%, especially among female patients (30.9% Vs 10.1%-males, p<0.0002). Celiac disease in this study cohort was reported in 3 (0.6%) patients.
