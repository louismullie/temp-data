## Question

A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician because of hair loss on her frontal scalp over the past year. Menses have occurred at irregular 40- to 60-day intervals since menarche at the age of 17 years. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is 162 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 73 kg (158.7 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Her pulse is 75/min and blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows scattered pustules on her face and patches of velvety hyperpigmentation on her axilla and groin. Her morning serum cortisol concentration is 18 μg/dL. This patient's condition is most likely associated with increased stimulation of which of the following types of cells?
A. Zona fasciculata cells
B. Theca interna cells
C. Granulosa cells
D. Follicular thyroid cells

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cell type is most likely to be overstimulated in a 21-year-old woman with frontal hair loss, oligomenorrhea, acne, acanthosis nigricans, and a normal morning cortisol, and to choose among zona fasciculata, theca interna, granulosa, or follicular thyroid cells. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and its most likely diagnosis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of androgen excess in that disorder. Next, I will examine which ovarian cell type produces androgens and how it is regulated. After that, I need to check whether the other options plausibly explain the phenotype. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly consider why the alternatives do not fit, including any red flags that would change management.

> Let me first synthesize the clinical picture. Frontal scalp hair loss with acne and oligomenorrhea in a young woman points toward hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans is a classic marker of insulin resistance. Obesity and an elevated BMI further increase the likelihood of insulin resistance. A normal morning cortisol makes Cushing's syndrome less likely, which otherwise could present with androgen excess and skin changes. Collectively, this fits polycystic ovary syndrome as the most common cause of androgen excess in reproductive-age women, with insulin resistance amplifying the phenotype [^25cbae1d] [^d529b260] [^3cf5912d].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before jumping to the cell type. In PCOS, hyperandrogenism arises from dysregulated ovarian androgen production, with both increased luteinizing hormone drive and insulin/IGF-1 signaling enhancing androgen synthesis. Insulin resistance lowers sex hormone–binding globulin, increasing free androgens and worsening clinical manifestations such as hirsutism, acne, and female-pattern hair loss. This mechanistic framework aligns with the patient's features and supports an ovarian source of androgens rather than adrenal or thyroid etiologies [^25cbae1d] [^c6f87e42] [^3cf5912d].

> I will now examine which ovarian cell is responsible for androgen synthesis. Theca interna cells are the ovarian steroidogenic cells that produce androgens in response to LH, and in PCOS both the number of theca cells and their enzymatic capacity for androgen synthesis are increased. Insulin acts synergistically with LH to amplify thecal androgen production, which explains the clinical triad of hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and insulin resistance seen in this patient. Therefore, increased stimulation of theca interna cells best accounts for the phenotype [^25cbae1d] [^d523dbfd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the other options. Zona fasciculata cells produce cortisol, and while adrenal androgens can contribute to hyperandrogenism, the normal morning cortisol argues against clinically significant Cushing's physiology, and adrenal androgens alone would not explain the full PCOS phenotype. Granulosa cells primarily aromatize androgens to estrogens and are not the source of excess androgens in this context. Follicular thyroid cells are unrelated to androgen synthesis and would not explain hair loss, acne, or oligomenorrhea, so these alternatives do not fit the pathophysiology here [^25cbae1d] [^3cf5912d].

> But wait, what if this were an androgen-secreting tumor or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. I should double-check for red flags that would prompt evaluation beyond PCOS, such as rapidly progressive virilization, markedly elevated androgens, or a postmenopausal presentation. None are present here, and the normal cortisol makes Cushing's unlikely, reinforcing PCOS as the leading diagnosis and theca cell hyperstimulation as the key mechanism in this case [^3cae3b20] [^77d8f453].

> Final answer: B. Theca interna cells. The patient's clinical picture is most consistent with PCOS-related hyperandrogenism driven by increased LH and insulin stimulation of ovarian theca interna cells, which synthesize androgens and are pathologically upregulated in PCOS, explaining the hair loss, acne, oligomenorrhea, and acanthosis nigricans [^25cbae1d] [^c6f87e42].

---

The patient's presentation — frontal hair loss, oligomenorrhea, acne, acanthosis nigricans, and elevated BMI — is most consistent with **PCOS and hyperandrogenism** [^25cbae1d]. In PCOS, **elevated LH and insulin** drive increased androgen production by ovarian theca interna cells, which is the key pathophysiologic mechanism here [^25cbae1d] [^683368c7]. Granulosa cells convert androgens to estrogens and are not the source of excess androgens; zona fasciculata cells produce cortisol, which is normal here; and follicular thyroid cells are unrelated to androgen synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. Theca interna cells**.

---

## Clinical reasoning and pathophysiology

- **Clinical features**: The patient exhibits classic signs of hyperandrogenism — frontal hair loss (female pattern hair loss), acne, and oligomenorrhea — alongside acanthosis nigricans and elevated BMI, strongly suggesting insulin resistance and PCOS [^25cbae1d] [^d529b260].

- **Pathophysiology of PCOS**: PCOS is characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance. Elevated LH and insulin synergistically stimulate ovarian theca interna cells to produce androgens, while insulin resistance lowers SHBG, increasing free androgens and worsening clinical hyperandrogenism [^25cbae1d] [^c6f87e42].

- **Role of theca interna cells**: Theca interna cells are the ovarian steroidogenic cells that synthesize androgens in response to LH. In PCOS, both the number of theca cells and their enzymatic capacity for androgen synthesis are increased, explaining the hyperandrogenic phenotype [^25cbae1d] [^d523dbfd].

- **Normal cortisol level**: The normal morning cortisol (18 μg/dL) effectively excludes Cushing's syndrome, which would otherwise cause hyperandrogenism via adrenal androgens from zona fasciculata cells [^notfound].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Relevance to patient's condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Zona fasciculata cells | Incorrect | - Zona fasciculata cells produce cortisol, not androgens<br/> - Normal cortisol level excludes Cushing's syndrome |
| B. Theca interna cells | Correct | - Primary source of ovarian androgens<br/> - Increased stimulation in PCOS due to elevated LH and insulin |
| C. Granulosa cells | Incorrect | - Granulosa cells convert androgens to estrogens<br/> - Not the source of excess androgens |
| D. Follicular thyroid cells | Incorrect | - Thyroid cells are unrelated to androgen synthesis<br/> - No evidence of thyroid dysfunction in the vignette |

---

## Conclusion

The patient's hyperandrogenic features are best explained by **increased stimulation of ovarian theca interna cells** driven by elevated LH and insulin in PCOS [^25cbae1d]. The other options either produce different hormones or are not implicated in androgen excess in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. Theca interna cells**.

Mast cell activation is common and possibly necessary for maintenance of survival. Disordered mast cell activation occurs when mast cells are pathologically overproduced or if their activation is out of proportion to the perceived threat to homeostasis. Mast cell activation syndrome refers to a group of disorders with diverse causes presenting with episodic multisystem symptoms as the result of mast cell mediator release. Despite introduction of diagnostic criteria and some advances in treatment in the last decade, many areas of mast cell activation syndrome are in need of research. This article reviews our current knowledge about the various types of mast cell activation disorders, their treatment, and areas of uncertainty in need of future investigation.

### Overstimulation and β-cell function [^a8eae213]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

Previous and present evidence ascribes an important role to overstimulation of beta-cells for the secretory abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes. The abnormality most clearly linked to overstimulation is the elevated ratio of circulating proinsulin to insulin. Evidence obtained in human pancreatic islets suggests that aberrations in insulin oscillations that occur in type 2 diabetes could at least in part be linked to abnormalities in cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations induced by overstimulation. Furthermore, in a transplantation model, we have obtained evidence for long-lasting, perhaps irreversible, effects of overstimulation, implying that this is a causative factor for the well-recognized deterioration of insulin secretion with increasing duration of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms behind the effects of overstimulation are only partly clarified, but it is clear that reduced insulin secretion after overstimulation is only partly explained by decreased insulin stores. In cultured human pancreatic islets, overstimulation by high glucose leads to a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, which persists after normalization of the glucose levels. Persistent elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ may trigger apoptosis, thus participating in long-term irreversible deterioration of beta-cell function. These data provide sufficient rationale for clinical studies to test the beneficial effects of relative beta-cell rest in type 2 diabetic patients.

### Beta-cell replication is increased in donor organs from young patients after prolonged life support [^1e0ca05b]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Human diabetes is a heterogeneous group of disorders with increased glycemia levels and a decreased functional β-cell mass in common. Type 1A diabetes is characterized by a T-cell–mediated autoimmune destruction of 50–70% of β-cell mass at clinical onset, whereas type 2 diabetes is characterized by a smaller decrease in β-cell mass in association with insulin resistance and loss of β-cell function. Clinical interventions aimed at restoring a functionally adequate endogenous β-cell mass are therefore of considerable interest, but they are hampered by a relative lack of knowledge about the in vivo conditions that stimulate β-cell replication and neoformation in the adult pancreas. Quantification of β-cell replication in the developing human pancreas shows that replication is high in the early fetal pancreas, but decreases rapidly after birth and is only rarely observed in the adult pancreas (–). Interestingly, several cases have been described in which patients with a variety of diseases, including lobar pneumonia, hemochromatosis, or acute liver disease, were reported to display prominent mitotic activity in adult islet tissue (–). Such chance observations indicate that although replication in the adult pancreas is normally low, adult human islet cells apparently do retain a capacity for replication that can be activated under selected clinical conditions. To characterize such conditions we investigated β-cell replication in a large consecutive series of human organ donors and correlated our findings to the preterminal clinical characteristics of the patients involved.

### Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients exhibit hyperactive cytokine responses associated with effector exhausted senescent T cells in acute infection [^2812bf3f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can progress to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and is aggravated by the deregulation of the immune system causing an excessive inflammation including the cytokine storm.

Methods

In this study, we report that severe acutely infected patients have high levels of both type-1 and type-2 cytokines.

Results

Our results show abnormal cytokine levels upon T-cell stimulation, in a nonpolarized profile. Furthermore, our findings indicate that this hyperactive cytokine response is associated with a significantly increased frequency of late-differentiated T cells with particular phenotype of effector exhausted/senescent CD28-CD57+ cells. Of note, we demonstrated for the first time an increased frequency of CD3+CD4+CD28-CD57+ T cells with expression of programmed death 1, one of the hallmarks of T-cell exhaustion.

Conclusions

These findings reveal that COVID-19 is associated with acute immunodeficiency, especially within the CD4+ T-cell compartment, and points to possible mechanisms of loss of clonal repertoire and susceptibility to viral relapse and reinfection events.

### Early stimulated immune responses predict clinical disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^f73329d1]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The immune pathogenesis underlying the diverse clinical course of COVID-19 is poorly understood. Currently, there is an unmet need in daily clinical practice for early biomarkers and improved risk stratification tools to help identify and monitor COVID-19 patients at risk of severe disease.

Methods

We performed longitudinal assessment of stimulated immune responses in 30 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We used the TruCulture whole-blood ligand-stimulation assay applying standardized stimuli to activate distinct immune pathways, allowing quantification of cytokine responses. We further characterized immune cell subsets by flow cytometry and used this deep immunophenotyping data to map the course of clinical disease within and between patients.

Results

Here we demonstrate impairments in innate immune response pathways at time of COVID-19 hospitalization that are associated with the development of severe disease. We show that these impairments are transient in those discharged from hospital, as illustrated by functional and cellular immune reconstitution. Specifically, we identify lower levels of LPS-stimulated IL-1β, and R848-stimulated IL-12 and IL-17A, at hospital admission to be significantly associated with increasing COVID-19 disease severity during hospitalization. Furthermore, we propose a stimulated immune response signature for predicting risk of developing severe or critical COVID-19 disease at time of hospitalization, to validate in larger cohorts.

Conclusions

We identify early impairments in innate immune responses that are associated with subsequent COVID-19 disease severity. Our findings provide basis for early identification of patients at risk of severe disease which may have significant implications for the early management of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Adaptive immune system

In addition to releasing large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells, the adaptive immune system generates virus‐specific CD4 + T‐cells, CD8 + T‐cells, and Bcells, which are crucial for mounting an effective immune response. However, the adaptive immune response can become dysregulated, leading to organ and tissue damage. This immune imbalance may be a significant factor contributing to life‐threatening conditions in COVID‐19 patients and persistent adaptive immune dysregulation is suspected to play a crucial role in PCC. Patients experiencing PCC often exhibit alterations in both cellular and humoral immune mediators, particularly in T‐cell populations. These changes may contribute to ongoing immunopathology, potentially explaining long‐term symptoms such as chronic fever and muscle and joint pain. For instance, specific T‐cell subsets, including CD8 + ‐T‐cells, may remain activated long after the initial infection. This persistent activation might result from virus‐specific responses to residual viral antigens or from polyclonal/bystander activation driven by the chronic inflammatory environment. While virus‐specific activation suggests the presence of lingering viral proteins or RNA fragments, polyclonal or bystander activation could reflect dysregulated immune signalling or the influence of elevated proinflammatory cytokines. Both mechanisms are hypothesised to contribute to the chronic inflammation and tissue damage observed in PCC. Additionally, CD4 + effector memory T‐cells may be involved in sustaining this inflammatory environment by continuously providing help to B cells and other immune cells.

The adaptive immune system's dysregulation in PCC is also reflected in altered cytokine and chemokine production. For instance, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL‐6, TNFα, and IFNα were observed in the plasma of PCC patients, which may contribute to the chronic inflammatory state and contribute to the ongoing symptoms of PCC, including fatigue and respiratory difficulties. The dysregulation of memory T and B cells in PCC may also contribute to persistent symptoms. Effector memory T‐cells are crucial for providing long‐term protection against pathogens, but in PCC these cells may become dysfunctional due to prolonged antigen stimulation or chronic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines, leading to a state of exhaustion. This dysfunction may impair their ability to respond effectively to new infections or reactivations of latent viruses. Similarly, memory B cells may contribute to the production of autoantibodies through mechanisms such as molecular mimicry or cross‐reactivity, where antibodies generated against SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens inadvertently recognise self‐antigens. This aberrant antibody response can further contribute to the pathology of PCC by promoting autoimmune reactions and tissue damage.

### Hair loss: common causes and treatment-AAFP (...) [^e4f6ccd7]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Specific Disorders ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss in men and women and is a normal physiologic variant. It is most prevalent in white men, with 30%, 40%, and 50% experiencing androgenetic alopecia at 30, 40, and 50 years of age, respectively.
2. Although this condition is less common in women, 38% of women older than 70 years may be affected
3. Many patients with androgenetic alopecia have a family history of this condition. Hair thinning occurs in a sex-specific pattern. Men typically present with bitemporal thinning, thinning of the frontal and vertex scalp, or complete hair loss with residual hair at the occiput and temporal fringes. 5 Women typically present with diffuse hair thinning of the vertex with sparing of the frontal hairline. Some women experience thinning over the lateral scalp.

Common conditions that mimic androgenetic alopecia include thyroid disease, iron deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Treatment is based on patient preference. Topical minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Hair regrowth is more robust at the vertex than in the frontal area, and will take six to 12 months to improve. 5 Treatment should continue indefinitely because hair loss reoccurs when treatment is discontinued. Minoxidil 2% solution is recommended for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women. 6 Adverse effects include irritant and contact dermatitis. Finasteride, 1 mg per day orally, is approved to treat androgenetic alopecia in men for whom topical minoxidil has been ineffective. Adverse effects of finasteride include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia. 11 Treatment may be repeated every four to six weeks until resolution or for a maximum of six months.

Local adverse effects include transient atrophy and telangiectasia. Other therapies for the treatment of alopecia areata include topical mid- to high-potency corticosteroids, minoxidil, anthralin, immunotherapy, and systemic corticosteroids. 12 Currently available therapies often yield unsatisfactory results, and some clinicians rely on the high rate of spontaneous remission or recommend a hairpiece or wig if remission does not occur.
13. TELOGEN EFFLUVIUM Telogen effluvium is a nonscarring, noninflammatory alopecia of relatively sudden onset, with similar incidences between sexes and age groups. It occurs when large numbers of hairs enter the telogen phase and fall out three to five months after a physiologic or emotional stressor. The list of inciting factors is extensive and includes severe chronic illnesses, pregnancy, surgery, high fever, malnutrition, severe infections, and endocrine disorders.

Causative medications include retinoids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, and antithyroid medications; discontinuation of oral contraceptive agents is another possible cause. 17 Patients with telogen effluvium may have symptoms of an underlying condition, but are often asymptomatic. They often notice clumps of hair coming out in the shower or in their hairbrush. They should be asked to recall any potential trigger two to five months before the onset of the condition. Examination of the scalp in patients with telogen effluvium typically shows uniform hair thinning. The presence of erythema, scaling, or inflammation; altered or uneven hair distribution; or changes in shaft caliber, length, shape, or fragility may suggest other diagnoses. Laboratory investigations are indicated if the history and physical examination findings suggest underlying systemic disorders.

ASCO/ASH ESA target hemoglobin—Among adults receiving ESAs for chemotherapy-associated anemia, HbG may be increased to the lowest concentration needed to avoid or reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which may vary by patient and condition. An optimal target HbG concentration cannot be definitively determined from the available literature. Dose modification to reduce ESA exposure is appropriate when HbG reaches a level sufficient to avoid transfusion or the increase exceeds 1 g/dL in any 2-week period.

### Defective activation and regulation of type I interferon immunity is associated with increasing COVID-19 severity [^6a4e20ab]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Poor results in randomized placebo-controlled treatment studies have further divided opinions on the importance of IFN-I in COVID-19,. No clinical benefit was observed in these studies where either IFNα or IFNβ were given alone, or in combination with antivirals. However, a major caveat of these studies is the late initiation of treatment when patients were unlikely to benefit from further antiviral signaling. Moreover, at this stage of infection, IFN-I may even suppress adaptive immunity, further compromising any apparent clinical benefit. This is supported by results from our study where COVID-19 patients with elevated ISG expression did not respond to ex vivo IFN stimulation, and hospitalized patients in particular showed an inflammatory gene expression pattern that was not downregulated by IFN-I. Direct testing of this hypothesis may be provided by clinical studies testing early intervention prior to the appearance of symptomsor targeted to patients with known risk factors, or retrospective testing of pre-treatment IFN-I levels. Reflecting multiple perturbations in the IFN-I response with increasing COVID-19 severity was our striking observation that severe patients failed to secrete IFN-I proteins after stimulation with diverse viral agonists. This supports previous results showing a reduced ability of pDCs and monocytes from COVID-19 patients to respond to TLR stimulation. IFNβ secretion was even more strikingly perturbed than IFNα, which was surprising given its low levels in patient plasma. However, the relatively low number of studies implicating this IFN subtype in COVID-19 are indicative of the challenges in accurately detecting and quantifying this interferon in the blood, and may reflect its greater importance in the infected tissues.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^25cbae1d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Causes of Androgen Excess in Women (Table 1)

3.1 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

PCOS, with a prevalence between 8% and 13% in women of reproductive age, is the most common cause of androgen excess in women. Hyperandrogenism is one of the key features of PCOS and is directly responsible for most of its features. The 2023 evidence‐based international PCOS guideline based on the Rotterdam criteria require two out of three features for the diagnosis of PCOS: (1) ovulatory dysfunction with irregular menstrual cycles, (2) polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) with increased numbers of antral follicles detected by ultrasonography or increased anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) and (3) clinical or biochemical features of hyperandrogenism. Therefore, hyperandrogenism is not required for the diagnosis of PCOS and up to 20% of those with PCOS do not display features of androgen excess. However, as androgens are thought to have a role in the development of PCOM, it is unclear if those women have increased androgen synthesis or action within the ovary.

Table 1 
Causes of androgen excess in women.

Androgens are synthesised in the theca cells of the ovarian follicle under the influence of LH. Although the increased numbers of antral follicles means that there are increased numbers of theca cells in the polycystic ovary, in PCOS each theca cell also has an increased capacity to synthesise androgens. The mechanism of this is unclear but it is likely to be linked to the increased LH concentrations seen in PCOS as well as increased concentrations of insulin which enhances LH‐stimulated androgen synthesis. The aetiology of the increased LH and insulin concentrations is not well understood but it is likely to be prenatally programmed. Free androgens in the circulation are increased when SHBG concentrations are reduced. This is associated with insulin resistance and obesity which are both common in PCOS thereby exacerbating the hyperandrogenic phenotype.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with decreased CD4 +&CD8 + T cells and increased growth&differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) in peripheral blood [^12544f1f]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, debilitating and highly prevalent condition that is believed to result from an abnormal response to inhaled oxidants and which is characterized by lung destruction, airways remodeling, and mucus hypersecretion. COPD is punctuated by episodic worsening in respiratory function and symptoms, termed acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD). These events are associated with accelerated lung function decline, reduced quality of life, plus increased mortality, which is appreciable for events requiring hospitalization and which persists for at least five years. AE-COPD also drive the majority of the economic burden of this common disease. Preventing these expensive and potentially lethal events should be a major public health goal.

Despite this great impact of AE-COPD, understanding of the responsible pathogenic mechanisms remains incomplete. There is consensus that a plurality of AE-COPD are associated with isolation of respiratory microbes, with some contribution from environmental triggers, and some events lacking evidence of inflammation, currently of incompletely understood etiology. However, the acute beneficial role of systemic steroid therapy suggests that overly-exuberant inflammation, rather than simply presence of microbes, might determine symptomatology in most AE-COPD. Hence, continued investigation of inflammatory mechanisms during AE-COPD remains important.

We have hypothesized that AE-COPD would be associated with systemic evidence of inappropriate immune activation, especially of the adaptive immune system. Lung T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis, but data on their role in AE-COPD are limited. During AE-COPD, numbers of lymphocytes increase in both sputum and airway biopsies and a CD8+ type-2-mediated immune reaction has been identified in sputum. However, in the peripheral blood, a practical sample for monitoring systemic responses, there are few data during AE-COPD on the activation status and phenotype of immune cells or on their correlation with circulating biomarkers. The lack of universally-accepted animal models of AE-COPD necessitates use of human samples to address this question.

To that end, we designed a prospective cohort study to investigate subjects during the stable state and at onset of AE-COPD. Peripheral blood was used for both immunophenotyping of various leukocytes populations and to analyze 41 analytes in serum. Sputum supernatants were used to analyze 36 analytes. Our results provide novel data supporting AE-COPD as systemic inflammatory events to which T cells contribute, and which even when not requiring hospitalization, are associated with pulmonary vascular stress.

### Beta-cell-mediated signaling predominates over direct α-cell signaling in the regulation of glucagon secretion in humans [^0e7eba71]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We tested the hypothesis that increased β-cell–mediated signaling of α-cells negates direct α-cell signaling in the regulation of glucagon secretion in humans. To do so, we contrasted the plasma glucagon responses to the ingestion of a mixed meal and sulfonylurea glimepiride, conditions that normally stimulate both β-cells and α-cells, in nondiabetic individuals and patients with type 1 diabetes, i.e. in individuals with normal and virtually absent β-cell function, respectively. The data support our hypothesis. Plasma glucagon concentrations were unchanged or decreased in the nondiabetic individuals with intact β-cell function but were increased in the patients with β-cell failure after ingestion of both the mixed meal and glimepiride.

We attribute these dichotomous plasma glucagon concentration responses to the presence and virtual absence of β-cell function in the nondiabetic individuals and the patients with type 1 diabetes, respectively. It is likely that that was not the only difference between the two groups. For example, appropriate provocative testing would most likely have demonstrated reduced autonomic (adrenomedullary, sympathetic, and parasympathetic) responses in the patients with type 1 diabetes. However, reduced autonomic responses, which are all normally stimulatory, could not explain the observed increased glucagon responses. In the present study, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations (measures of sympathoadrenal activity) and plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentrations (a measure of parasympathetic activity) were comparable in both groups under both conditions. Therefore, differences in autonomic signaling could not explain the observed differences in the glucagon responses. Among the gut incretins, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), but not glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), normally suppresses glucagon secretion. Thus, reduced GLP-1, but not GIP, actions in patients with diabetes could explain less suppression of glucagon secretion after a mixed meal. However, that suppression would not explain the observed increased glucagon responses to a mixed meal or those to glimepiride in the patients. Thus, we conclude that our data are consistent with the interpretation that indirect reciprocal β-cell–mediated signaling predominates over direct α-cell signaling in the regulation of glucagon secretion in humans. That conclusion does not exclude an additional role for δ-cell somatostatin.

### T-cell exhaustion, co-stimulation and clinical outcome in autoimmunity and infection [^e0cdb5e9]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

The clinical course of autoimmune and infectious disease varies greatly, even between individuals with the same condition. An understanding of the molecular basis for this heterogeneity could lead to significant improvements in both monitoring and treatment. During chronic infection the process of T-cell exhaustion inhibits the immune response, facilitating viral persistence. Here we show that a transcriptional signature reflecting CD8 T-cell exhaustion is associated with poor clearance of chronic viral infection, but conversely predicts better prognosis in multiple autoimmune diseases. The development of CD8 T-cell exhaustion during chronic infection is driven both by persistence of antigen and by a lack of accessory 'help' signals. In autoimmunity, we find that where evidence of CD4 T-cell co-stimulation is pronounced, that of CD8 T-cell exhaustion is reduced. We can reproduce the exhaustion signature by modifying the balance of persistent stimulation of T-cell antigen receptors and specific CD2-induced co-stimulation provided to human CD8 T cells in vitro, suggesting that each process plays a role in dictating outcome in autoimmune disease. The 'non-exhausted' T-cell state driven by CD2-induced co-stimulation is reduced by signals through the exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptor PD-1, suggesting that induction of exhaustion may be a therapeutic strategy in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Using expression of optimal surrogate markers of co-stimulation/exhaustion signatures in independent data sets, we confirm an association with good clinical outcome or response to therapy in infection (hepatitis C virus) and vaccination (yellow fever, malaria, influenza), but poor outcome in autoimmune and inflammatory disease (type 1 diabetes, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and dengue haemorrhagic fever). Thus, T-cell exhaustion plays a central role in determining outcome in autoimmune disease and targeted manipulation of this process could lead to new therapeutic opportunities.

### Early stimulated immune responses predict clinical disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^cd65b433]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While its role as a predictive clinical tool warrants further study, we propose that the LPS + R848 stimulated immune signature represents a valuable explanatory model indicating an important role of these immune pathways (activating TLRs 4 and 7/8 respectively) in early COVID-19 pathogenesis. Induction of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines through activation of TLRs constitutes a key mechanism of the initial innate host defense against infectious threats. With LPS being a TLR4 agonist, and R848 being an agonist of TLR7/8,, our findings point toward early impairments in such key innate immune activation cascades. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to activate both TLR7/8, and TLR4, therefore both the R848 and LPS stimulated responses may mimic the in vivo anti-COVID-19 responses. In line with previous studies demonstrating impaired type I IFN-responses being associated with developing severe COVID-19,, LPS-stimulated IFN-α was included in the LPS + R848 model, indicating lower levels a potential predictor for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to interfere with the crucial early type I IFN-response, permitting further replication and tissue damage. This may delay the infiltration of inflammatory cells into infected tissues, which may further on elicit an imbalanced inflammatory exacerbation driving the progression of severe disease. Assembly of the inflammasome with subsequent induction of IL-1β and further downstream IL-6, constitutes a key downstream effector mechanism of type I IFNs in activating an acute inflammatory anti-viral response. LPS-stimulated IL-1β displayed the strongest negative association with peak severity, and stimulated IL-1β (LPS and R848) and IL-6 (LPS) were included in the LPS + R848 model. This may imply a lack of adequate inflammasome activity in the early defense against SARS-CoV-2 –. IL-12 derived from innate cells including monocytes and dendritic cells constitute a crucial component in the activation and polarization of IFN-γ producing type 1 T helper (Th1) cells, which characterize the SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 + T cell population previously described,. Importantly, R848-stimulated IL-12 and IFN-γ were included in the LPS + R848 model, and R848-stimulated IL-12 alone exhibited a significant negative association with COVID-19 severity, indicating early defects in this crucial link between innate and adaptive immune responses significantly impacting disease severity. The importance of this IL-12 mediated link is being exploited to improve vaccination responses in a current clinical trial of a DNA-vaccine containing an added IL-12-plasmid (NCT04627675). Thus, the LPS- and R848 stimulated TruCulture responses likely capture several steps of an early immune cascade that lacks appropriate activation, possibly due to initial impairments in the induction of an adequate type I IFN response.

### Type I interferons affect the metabolic fitness of CD8T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^6386bee4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have high expression of type I IFN-stimulated genes. Mitochondrial abnormalities have also been reported, but the contribution of type I IFN exposure to these changes is unknown. Here, we show downregulation of mitochondria-derived genes and mitochondria-associated metabolic pathways in IFN-High patients from transcriptomic analysis of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. CD8 + T cells from these patients have enlarged mitochondria and lower spare respiratory capacity associated with increased cell death upon rechallenge with TCR stimulation. These mitochondrial abnormalities can be phenocopied by exposing CD8 + T cells from healthy volunteers to type I IFN and TCR stimulation. Mechanistically these 'SLE-like' conditions increase CD8 + T cell NAD+consumption resulting in impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced cell viability, both of which can be rectified by NAD+supplementation. Our data suggest that type I IFN exposure contributes to SLE pathogenesis by promoting CD8 + T cell death via metabolic rewiring.

### Type I interferons affect the metabolic fitness of CD8T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^0d6ca35e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

It is recognized that most SLE patients have an increased expression of ISGs, but the biological and clinical implications of this remains unclear. Our T cell transcriptomic and metabolic studies in a clinically well-defined group of SLE patients with biopsy-proven nephritis showed that, high IFN signaling can drive changes in the mitochondrial metabolic pathways of CD8 + T cells making them bioenergetically unfit and more prone to die. Using a combination of in silico and in vitro methods, here, we demonstrated that the metabolic rewiring observed in CD8 + T cells from SLE patients was the result of prolonged IFNα exposure and TCR stimulation. Under the persistent combination of these two stimuli, a condition probably unique to SLE patients, the CD8 + T cells displayed increased PARP gene expression associated with enhanced NAD+ consumption, reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity and decreased survival (Fig. 7). Collectively, our findings demonstrated a link between high ISG signature and the metabolic fitness of SLE CD8 + T cells, and their ability to survive under stress or in response to antigen rechallenges.

Fig. 7 
Type I interferons modulate the metabolic fitness of CD8 + T cells in patients with SLE.

In HC, TCR signaling (signal 1) is essential for CD8 + T cell survival. In IFN-High SLE patients, persistent activation of the TCR (signal 1) and the type I IFNα pathways (signal 2) triggers mitochondrial changes via increasing NAD+ consumption in CD8 + T cells resulting in lower spare respiratory capacity (SRC) and thus decreased bioenergetic fitness. Upon increased energy demand such as in response to antigen challenge or stress, IFNα-stimulated CD8 + T cells are more prone to die, and this could perpetuate autoimmunity by increasing the autoantigen load. NAD+ supplementation with NMN restored the NAD+ pool, increased the mitochondrial respiration, decreased mROS, and improved cell viability upon TCR restimulation.

### Stimulatory MAIT cell antigens reach the circulation and are efficiently metabolised and presented by human liver cells [^1e6a2e27]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are the most abundant T cells in human liver. They respond to bacterial metabolites presented by major histocompatibility complex-like molecule MR1. MAIT cells exert regulatory and antimicrobial functions and are implicated in liver fibrogenesis. It is not well understood which liver cells function as antigen (Ag)-presenting cells for MAIT cells, and under which conditions stimulatory Ags reach the circulation.

Design

We used different types of primary human liver cells in Ag-presentation assays to blood-derived and liver-derived MAIT cells. We assessed MAIT cell stimulatory potential of serum from healthy subjects and patients with portal hypertension undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt stent, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Results

MAIT cells were dispersed throughout healthy human liver and all tested liver cell types stimulated MAIT cells, hepatocytes being most efficient. MAIT cell activation by liver cells occurred in response to bacterial lysate and pure Ag, and was prevented by non-activating MR1 ligands. Serum derived from peripheral and portal blood, and from patients with IBD stimulated MAIT cells in MR1-dependent manner.

Conclusion

Our findings reveal previously unrecognised roles of liver cells in Ag metabolism and activation of MAIT cells, repression of which creates an opportunity to design antifibrotic therapies. The presence of MAIT cell stimulatory Ags in serum rationalises the observed activated MAIT cell phenotype in liver. Increased serum levels of gut-derived MAIT cell stimulatory ligands in patients with impaired intestinal barrier function indicate that intrahepatic Ag-presentation may represent an important step in the development of liver disease.

### Defective activation and regulation of type I interferon immunity is associated with increasing COVID-19 severity [^63c787e6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Host immunity to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable, dictating diverse clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease and death. We previously reported reduced type I interferon in severe COVID-19 patients preceded clinical worsening. Further studies identified genetic mutations in loci of the TLR3- or TLR7-dependent interferon-I pathways, or neutralizing interferon-I autoantibodies as risk factors for development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here we show in patient cohorts with different severities of COVID-19, that baseline plasma interferon α measures differ according to the immunoassay used, timing of sampling, the interferon α subtype measured, and the presence of autoantibodies. We also show a consistently reduced induction of interferon-I proteins in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon immune stimulation, that is not associated with detectable neutralizing autoantibodies against interferon α or interferon ω. Intracellular proteomic analysis shows increased monocyte numbers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but impaired interferon-I response after stimulation. We confirm this by ex vivo whole blood stimulation with interferon-I which induces transcriptomic responses associated with inflammation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, that is not seen in controls or non-hospitalized moderate cases. These results may explain the dichotomy of the poor clinical response to interferon-I based treatments in late stage COVID-19, despite the importance of interferon-I in early acute infection and may guide alternative therapeutic strategies.

### Immunology of COVID-19 and disease-modifying therapies: the good, the bad and the unknown [^d2b8040f]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Immunopathology of COVID‐19

The spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 interacts with the abundant angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐related carboxypeptidase 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cell using the cellular serine protease transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) for priming. Other potential entry routes have also been described, including the interaction of viral spike protein and CD147, which is widely expressed along with inflamed tissue and lymphocytes. Once having entered the host cell, viral replication commences, leading to the formation of virus‐containing vesicles, which are subsequently released to facilitate viral spread.

To date, the exact mechanism of the specific antigen presentation and the humoral and cellular as well as innate immune responses to SARS‐CoV‐2, are far from being fully elucidated. The cytopathic properties of SARS‐CoV‐2 probably trigger the innate immune system via damage‐associated molecular patterns and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns, leading through different pathways, e.g. the nuclear factor‐ĸB pathway, to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and mounting a type I interferon (IFN) response. The closely related SARS‐CoV uses the nucleocapsid protein to antagonize IFN‐β, which is likely to be a similar escape mechanism also in SARS‐CoV‐2. Indeed, a recent report suggests an impaired IFN type I response in the case of SARS‐CoV‐2, which was associated with a high viral load, while cellular responses to stimulation were preserved. In general, severely affected patients demonstrate a rapid activation of innate immune pathways with significantly elevated levels of circulating cytokines. Interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐1Ra, IL‐6, IL‐7, IL‐10, IP‐10 and tumor necrosis factor‐α, in particular, have been associated with disease progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with this dysfunctional immune response known as a ‘cytokine storm’. Increased IL‐6 serum levels, especially, are correlated with poor clinical outcome. The exact cellular source, however, still needs to be determined. Two, not necessarily mutually exclusive, scenarios might provide an explanation: ‘primary hypercytokinemia’, characterized by a hyper‐inflammatory response to primary viral infection by monocytes and resident macrophages, and ‘secondary hypercytokinemia’, driven by hyper‐activated T cells. There is evidence supporting both hypotheses as shown by (i) expansion of highly inflammatory monocytes as well as monocyte‐derived macrophage with concomitant loss of tissue‐resident macrophages, further associated with disease progression and secretion of IL‐6 and IL‐1β and (ii) expansion of pro‐inflammatory CD4 T cells, although the total number of circulating T cells is reduced.

### Severe COVID-19 patients have impaired plasmacytoid dendritic cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 [^350f9bc0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Insights on several hallmarks of IFN-I/λ pathway as being critical in COVID-19 severity are emanating from recent publications. First, neutralizing autoantibodies against several cytokines and genetic defects affecting the IFN-I pathway have been identified in life-threatening COVID-19, as autosomal disorders of IFN-I immunity and autoantibodies underlie at least 10% of critical COVID-19 pneumonia cases –,. Second, patients with severe diseases exhibit reduced circulating pDCs and low plasma IFN-I/λ levels when compared to mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients,,, yet the impact of pDC response on the severity is still elusive in other publication. Third, IL-3, which increases innate immunity likely by promoting the recruitment of circulating pDCs into the airways, is reduced in the plasma of patients with high viral load and severity/mortality. This evidence highlighted that several biomarkers of IFN-I/λ response are diminished in COVID-19 patients, and hereby pointed to pDCs as a primary candidate in the progression of COVID-19. Here, using an original approach to study innate immunity in ex-vivo-stimulated PBMCs from COVID-19 patients, we report that the functionality of pDCs is markedly blunted in severe patients, as observed upon their stimulation by contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as well as other TLR agonists. Nonetheless, owing to the technical challenge to perform these functional analyses for a larger cohort of patients, future investigations including a larger diversity of groups (e.g. additional patients with anti-IFN antibody, with immunosuppressive treatments, children etc.) will enable to reach definitive conclusion across diverse human populations.

### Severe T cell hyporeactivity in ventilated COVID-19 patients correlates with prolonged virus persistence and poor outcomes [^54df4f9a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Current data on polyclonal T-cell reactivity in COVID-19 are conflicting and indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 can have either insufficient, or excessive – T-cell responses, as recently summarized. T-cell responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining of PBMCs, cultured with phorbolesters and ionomycin, by quantification of cytokines after polyclonal stimulation, or by expression of surface markers on T cells. IFN-gamma expression for example was found to be unchanged, increased,, or decreased,. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were repeatedly reported to be reduced in critically ill and older COVID-19 patients and associated with an unfavorable outcome,.

We applied a sensitive method to analyze polyclonal T-cell reactivity in COVID-19 patients and controls. T-cell activation was measured by downstream effects on responder cells, such as basophils, pDCs, monocytes, and neutrophils in whole blood. These assays turned out to be much more sensitive and consistent than classical readouts with PBMCs. We found that impaired T-cell reactivity is already evident in mild disease, caused by plasma components present in COVID-19 patients and, strongly associated with disease severity and prolonged viral replication. Gender-specific differences in T-cell-induced downstream effects on monocytes were observed. Finally, we developed a score to predict the fatal outcome to identify patients that may benefit from strategies to overcome T-cell hyporeactivity.

### Biologic therapies targeting type 2 cytokines are effective at improving asthma symptoms and control-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5337e653]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory disease, affecting nearly 300 million people worldwide.In the United Kingdom, the treatment of asthma costs between £2912 and £4217 per patient per year,and despite medical advances, asthma costs the National Health Service at least £1.1 billion every year.The most common type of asthma is allergic asthma, induced by aeroallergen exposure in susceptible individuals and associated with chronic T H 2-polarized eosinophilic inflammation. In a subset of patients with “difficult-to-treat” asthma (estimated to be up to one-third of asthmatic patients), poor symptom control and a high rate of exacerbations are associated with insensitivity to inhaled corticosteroids, the criterion standard medication prescribed for this disease,, indicating an important unmet clinical need in this subgroup of patients as well as an increased economic burden. Targeted therapies that pinpoint critical disease pathways are a novel approach to tackling severe asthma and improving symptom control.

Allergic asthma occurs following sensitization to aeroallergens, leading to an inflammatory cascade involving airway epithelial cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and T H 2-polarized T H cells. Over time, this chronic inflammatory response to aeroallergen induces profound changes to the structure of the conducting airways, characterized by increased mucus production, collagen deposition, and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypersensitivity. Collaboratively, allergic inflammation and airway structural changes induce airway hyperreactivity (wheeze), which has an important detrimental effect on quality of life. Lung function changes are measured using spirometry, most often by measuring the FEV 1, that is, the volume of air expelled from the lungs in 1 second.

IL-5 is one of the most important cytokines involved in allergic asthma. When airway epithelium-derived alarmins or antigen-presenting dendritic cells are activated, type 2 innate lymphoid cells and T H 2 lymphocytes release IL-5.IL-5 promotes eosinophil differentiation and maturation from CD34 + hematopoietic cells and contributes to eosinophil recruitment by upregulating adhesion molecules including CD11a, CD11b, and CD18.When activated, IL-5 can moreover upregulate the expression of extracellular matrix components, thereby contributing to airway wall remodeling.This pathway is strongly associated with severe asthma and its symptoms; it is distinguished by increased eosinophils in the sputum and blood, despite corticosteroid treatment.Understanding this pathway has enabled researchers to develop anti–IL-5 therapies as novel treatments in IL-5–driven allergic diseases such as severe asthma.

### Induction of CD56 + T cells after prolonged activation of T cells in vitro: a possible mechanism for CD4 + T-cell depletion in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients [^668b099c]. Human Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for depletion of CD4(+) T cells in aquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are not fully understood. Systemic immune activation mediated by persistent infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seems to be one of the predictors of disease progression. We predicted that certain lymphocytes responsible for CD4(+) T-cell depletion could be induced in patients during prolonged activation of lymphocytes. Therefore, we have established an in vitro long-term culture system for peripheral blood mononuclear cells with PHA-P stimulation and Herpesvirus saimiri infection, and examined what types of cells having strong cytotoxic activity to be emerged under the activated conditions. We observed that percentage of CD56(+) T cells was gradually increased in cultures from 30 days after stimulation and exhibited a cytotoxic activity against both autologous and allogeneic targets. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection enhanced the susceptibility of CD4(+) T cells to their cytotoxic effectors, and CD4(+) T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals showed decreased survival rate in the presence of autologous CD56(+) T cells. These findings raised the possibility that induction of autoreactive CD56(+) T cells in consequence of immune activation might be contributed to the depletion of CD4(+) T cells in HIV-1-infected patients.

### Cell-based interventions to halt autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^8572219c]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from death of insulin-secreting β cells mediated by self-immune cells, and the consequent inability of the body to maintain insulin levels for appropriate glucose homeostasis. Probably initiated by environmental factors, this disease takes place in genetically predisposed individuals. Given the autoimmune nature of T1DM, therapeutics targeting immune cells involved in disease progress have been explored over the last decade. Several high-cost trials have been attempted to prevent and/or reverse T1DM. Although a definitive solution to cure T1DM is not yet available, a large amount of information about its nature and development has contributed greatly to both the improvement of patient's health care and design of new treatments. In this study, we discuss the role of different types of immune cells involved in T1DM pathogenesis and their therapeutic potential as targets and/or modified tools to treat patients. Recently, encouraging results and new approaches to sustain remnant β cell mass and to increase β cell proliferation by different cell-based means have emerged. Results coming from ongoing clinical trials employing cell therapy designed to arrest T1DM will probably proliferate in the next few years. Strategies under consideration include infusion of several types of stem cells, dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, either manipulated genetically ex vivo or non-manipulated. Their use in combination approaches is another therapeutic alternative. Cell-based interventions, without undesirable side effects, directed to block the uncontrollable autoimmune response may become a clinical reality in the next few years for the treatment of patients with T1DM.

### Defective activation and regulation of type I interferon immunity is associated with increasing COVID-19 severity [^37059cfe]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To better clarify how different IFN-I measures might be used to understand COVID-19 pathogenesis, we compared cases of moderate COVID-19 with patients hospitalized for severe disease across different countries and clinical centers. For baseline responses, we characterized IFNα proteins with highly sensitive assays recognizing either specifically IFNα2 or all 13 alpha subtypes, as well as IFN function, ISGs, and autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-I. In a subgroup of these patients, we stimulated whole blood with relevant viral agonists to further assess the functional capacity of their immune system to respond to an external perturbation. We highlight the importance of using sufficiently sensitive and qualified assays for measuring IFN-I proteins and report defective IFN-I induction that is consistent in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Defective IFN-I induction in response to these stimuli was not due to autoantibodies potentially masking the protein, except in one patient. We also demonstrate that ex vivo IFN-I stimulation of blood from hospitalized patients induces a non-canonical inflammatory response, perhaps explaining the poor clinical outcome of IFN-I-based treatments previously reported. Our study highlights the importance of this crucial anti-viral immune response in host protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supports strategies for earlier more targeted therapeutic intervention, and highlights the importance of using consistent technical approaches for the investigation of IFN-Is in human cohort studies.

### Stimulation of α-1 adrenoceptors may intensify cutaneous inflammation in complex regional pain syndrome [^2562c64c]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Alpha-1 adrenoceptors are overexpressed in the epidermis of a subgroup of patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Activating α 1 -adrenoceptors in epidermal cells increases production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), a mediator of inflammation. To investigate whether this might exacerbate inflammation in CRPS, primary keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts were cultured from skin biopsies obtained from the affected limb of 25 patients and a similar site in 28 controls. The fundamental proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha, was administered for 24 hours to initiate inflammation. After this, cells were incubated for 6 hours with the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Exposure to tumor necrosis factor alpha induced proinflammatory cytokine mRNA production and protein secretion in keratinocytes and fibroblasts and enhanced α 1B -adrenoceptor mRNA expression in keratinocytes. Additional stimulation of α 1 adrenoceptors with phenylephrine increased the production of IL-6 mRNA and protein secretion in both cell types. Under all conditions, gene and protein α 1 -adrenoceptor levels and cytokine gene expression and protein secretion were similar, overall, in patients and controls, except for abnormally high α 1 -adrenoceptor protein levels in the keratinocytes of 3 of 17 patients. These findings suggest that persistent inflammation in CRPS is not due to dysfunction of skin cells but is a normal response to extrinsic signals. After α 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation of keratinocytes, increases in IL-6 mRNA but not protein were proportional to basal α 1 -adrenoceptor protein levels. Skin cells play an important role in persistent inflammation in CRPS. Potentially, a positive feedback loop between α 1 -adrenoceptors and IL-6 production in skin cells contributes to this inflammatory state.

### Patients with STAT1 gain-of-function mutations display increased apoptosis which is reversed by the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib [^02c9395c]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients with STAT1-GOF mutations exhibit a broad spectrum of infectious, inflammatory, vascular, and neoplastic manifestations. The conventional treatments include antimicrobial prophylaxis, appropriate treatment of acute or chronic infections, and immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune/autoinflammatory manifestations. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may represent a curative strategy in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency or non-responders to various immunosuppressive agents, but the prognosis remains poor also considering the elevated morbidity when the transplant had been considered after infancy. As for most inborn errors of immunity, the younger age at transplant seems the strongest positive indicator of overall and event free survival. JAK inhibitors (i.e. ruxolitinib) may represent a target therapy in STAT1-GOF patients. Currently, its use is promising in terms of treating severe forms of candidiasis, alopecia areata, autoimmune/autoinflammatory phenomena, and in controlling IFNs-induced inflammation in the setting of transplantation, in order to improve engraftment rate and overall outcome. However, some authors have reported the therapeutic failure of ruxolitinib in treating severe fungal infections other than CMC, or early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting that larger cohort studies are recommended to support the efficacy of JAK inhibitors in STAT1-GOF patients. In the STAT1-GOF syndrome, lymphopenia has been variably reported [,,–]. Previous studies have investigated the role of STAT1 in cell growth and apoptosis : STAT1-negative U3A fibroblast line underwent growth arrest upon transfection with wild type STAT1α and treatment with interferon-γ, and prolonged nuclear localization of activated STAT1 resulted in apoptosis involving specific regulation of caspase pathway. Romberg et al. reported progressive B-cell lymphopenia in two patients carrying the E235A allele, that was associated with increased Annexin V staining of CD19 + B cells after 24 h of culture and elevated caspase activity. In the present study, we investigated T cell apoptosis in STAT1-GOF patients and the risk of lymphopenia in these patients, despite normal human thymic output. We observed that, compared to healthy subjects, T lymphocytes from all analyzed STAT1-GOF patients presented increased T cell apoptosis both in unstimulated condition and after 48-hour stimulation with mitogens, particularly augmented with the combination of signals via CD3, CD28 and IFNα pathways. Regarding T cells, there is evidence that either anti-TCR or anti-CD3 can enhance or maintain lymphocyte viability, or in some circumstances induce apoptosis. STAT1 hyperfunction in mitogen-activated T cells might accelerate the pathway of programmed cell death via caspase activation in response to IFNs stimulation. Our observation of an increased expression of CASP3 in STAT1-GOF patients was limited to the condition of CD3, CD28 and IFNα stimulation, with a trend toward an increase of IRF expression but without any significant differences in the low number of analyzed patients and our experimental settings. The apoptotic signaling should be furtherly investigated in larger cohort of patients to characterize the role of the gain-of-function of STAT1 in regulating the transcription and expression of apoptotic markers and the effect of JAKinib in regulating apoptosis in STAT1-GOF patients. Consistent with previous reports, we confirmed that treatment of IFNα-cultured T cells with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib significantly reversed the hyperphosphorylation of STAT1 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that ruxolitinib reduced T cell apoptosis that was induced by cellular stimulation in vitro; in the unstimulated condition, ruxolitinib variably reduced T cell apoptosis but without any significant difference. The precise mechanism of ruxolitinib in reverting apoptosis in vitro remains uncertain, thus explaining why the effect in vivo may be variable but influenced by the modulation of other signaling pathways. in vivo, STAT1 L351F P3 benefited from the JAKinib treatment in terms of control of relapsing visceral leishmaniosis and stably normalized platelet count; the total lymphocyte count did not normalize but remained stable above 500 cells/mms. However, the time of follow-up is too short to get prove of efficacy of ruxolitinib regarding reduced risk of infections, including visceral leishmaniosis. STAT1 L283M P2 showed normalization of total lymphocytes count (above 1000 cells/mmc) and improvement of mucocutaneous candidiasis after initiation of ruxolitinib. In patients with STAT1-GOF mutations, lymphopenia represents a negative prognostic factor because it may cause higher risk of infections, also sustained by opportunistic pathogens. Meanwhile, we may hypothesize that the recurrence of infections may contribute to the development of lymphopenia following stimulation-induced T cell apoptosis. Although we could not identify a specific mechanism linking lymphopenia to apoptosis, our results may suggest that the use of a JAK/STAT inhibitor may control the signaling unbalance in the STAT1-GOF disorder and revert the increased T cell apoptosis. The evidence that STAT1-GOF patients exhibit increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased T cell apoptosis even in the unstimulated state suggests that in certain circumstances patients with GOF-STAT1 syndrome display overlapping features with type I interferonopathies. This group of inborn errors of immunity includes genetic conditions associated with hyper-regulation of type I interferon. In patients with interferonopathies, the analyses of mRNA expression of genes regulated by type I interferon, which is also known as IFN score, constitutes a specific marker of disease activity. In our study, we have shown that STAT1-GOF patients can exhibit increase of mRNA expression of the same subset of genes which are upregulated in patients with interferonopathies even in unstimulated cells. Interesting, we have observed that the IFN score was higher in the STAT1-GOF patients with autoimmune manifestations, albeit a correlation between the IFN score and the occurrence of clinical manifestations remains uncertain. The IFN score decreased from the first months after initiating the JAK inhibitor in our two treated STAT1-GOF patients. We propose that the analysis of IFN score in STAT1-GOF patients might be a useful marker to identify those patients with an increased risk of developing autoimmune complications. In these STAT1-GOF patients, treatment with JAKinib should be considered as a target therapy that may modulate the inflammatory response. Within our cohort, P3 experienced COVID-19 pneumonia: despite completing the vaccination cycle, he had B lymphopenia and lacked S1-specific antibody levels; in his case, the steroid treatment during SARS-CoV2 infection could have contributed to pulmonary aspergillosis. P2 experienced mild SARS-CoV2 infection without secondary complications. Recently, fatal COVID-19 infection has been reported in two children with STAT1-GOF variants due to overwhelming deregulated immune response. In our STAT1-GOF patients, we can hypothesize thatthe concomitant treatment with a reduced dose of JAKinib during SARS-CoV2 infection might have balanced the risk of hyperinflammatory complications after COVID-19. A major limitation of the present study is the small sample size that may affect the significance of the results that should be confirmed in larger cohorts.

### Gene and cell-replacement therapy in the treatment of type 1 diabetes: how high must the standards be set? [^c9fdd6e6]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

Recent advances in molecular and cell biology may allow for the development of novel strategies for the treatment and cure of type 1 diabetes. In particular, it is now possible to envisage restoration of insulin secretion by gene or cell-replacement therapy. The beta-cell is, however, remarkably sophisticated, and many of the features of this highly differentiated secretory cell will have to be faithfully mimicked in surrogate cells. In particular, insulin is normally secreted in a well-regulated fashion in rapid response to the metabolic needs of the individual and most specifically (but not exclusively) to changes in circulating levels of glucose. Such regulated secretion will be indispensable in order to avoid both hyper- and hypoglycemic episodes and depends on the ability of cells to store insulin in secretory granules before exocytosis in response to physiological stimuli. Furthermore, any newly created insulin-secreting cell will have to be able to adapt to alterations in insulin requirements that accompany changes with exercise, body weight, and aging. Fine tuning of insulin secretion over the longer term will also be important to avoid "clinical shifting" that could be caused by over-insulinization, including increased adiposity and cardiovascular disease. Finally, it will be necessary to ensure that newly created or implanted (surrogate) beta-cells are protected in some way from recognition by the immune system and in particular from autoimmune destruction.

T Lymphocyte Apoptosis is Significantly Increased in STAT1-GOF Patients

The clinical characteristics of the seven STAT1-GOF patients who were investigated in the present study are summarized in Table 1. In our cohort, the two adult patients (STAT1 L283M P2 and STAT1 L351F P3, as named in Dotta et al.), had lymphopenia (absolute total lymphocyte count below 1.000 cells/mmc), while the three other adolescent/young adult patients (STAT1 T385M P4, STAT1 T385M P5 and STAT1 L400V P6) presented borderline counts of total lymphocytes, all with a consensual reduction of both CD4 + and CD8 + subsets. We had previously analyzed that the thymic output of all STAT1-GOF patients of our cohort was normal by evaluating the T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) production and the quantification of the recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) subset of peripheral T cells by flow-cytometry assay (data not shown); meanwhile, T cell proliferation in response to stimulation with mitogens (anti-CD3, anti-CD28, IFNα, IL-2) was normal in STAT1-GOF patients compared to healthy subjects (data not shown). To investigate T lymphopenia, we analyzed if STAT1-GOF T cells exhibited an abnormal pattern of apoptosis in response to stimuli. The Annexin V-FITC binding assay was used to detect apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry in T lymphocytes that were left unstimulated or stimulated for 48 h with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, or with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 plus IFNα, or IFNα alone, to specifically analyze the cellular response to type I IFNs. In the evaluation of the percentage of apoptotic T cells we included both early apoptosis (positive to annexin V, negative to PI T lymphocytes) and late apoptosis (positive to annexin V and PI T lymphocytes) (Fig. 1). Data showed that T cell apoptosis was significantly higher in STAT1-GOF patients compared to healthy controls in basal condition without stimulation (median of percentage of apoptotic cells 29.2 versus 17.2, respectively, p 0.01). 48-hour cellular stimulation induced an increase of T lymphocyte apoptosis both in healthy controls and patients, but in the STAT1-GOF patients the T cell apoptosis was significantly higher with all types of combination of stimuli (median of percentage of apoptotic cells for anti-CD3/anti-CD28 76.3 versus 56.1, p 0.004; anti-CD3/anti-CD28 with IFNα 79 versus 56.4, p 0.006; and IFNα alone 41.3 versus 18.1, p 0.011, respectively). Next, we evaluated the mRNA expression of the gene encoding interferon regulatory factor (IRF-1) (Fig. 2 a), a transcription factor that mediates caspase activation and induction of T lymphocyte apoptosis, and of CASP3 gene (Fig. 2 b) in STAT1-GOF patients. We observed a significant increase of CASP3 expression after anti-CD3/anti-CD8/IFNα 48-hour stimulation as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01). Beside IRF1 expression upregulation in STAT1-GOF patients, we failed to detect a significant difference in these experimental conditions.

In this study, using high-throughput RNA sequencing in T cells from SLE patients, we show a link between type I IFN signature and mitochondrial changes in CD8 + T cells. We demonstrate that the metabolic abnormalities seen in the CD8 + T cells are the result of the combined prolonged type I IFN exposure and TCR stimulation. Together these two stimuli increase the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), alter the morphology and function of the mitochondria in CD8 + T cells, making them metabolically unfit and more prone to die, especially under stress conditions or in response to an antigen rechallenge.

The functional cellular endophenotype strategy for neuropsychiatric drug discovery

The functional cellular endophenotype (see Text box) strategy aims to directly identify abnormal functional responses in patient-derived live cells, relative to healthy individuals, and subsequently use these responses as novel drug screening targets (Fig. 2). First, live cells (e.g. iPSC-derived neurons, PBMCs; Fig. 2a) from patients and controls are incubated with mechanistically diverse ligand libraries (e.g. CNS receptor agonists, cytokines, hormones, growth factors, antigens or intracellular signaling modulators; Fig. 2b). Second, responses for each ligand treatment relative to the vehicle are assessed across multiple functional readouts (e.g. phosphorylation of cell signaling proteins or mRNA expression) in parallel using single-cell high-content screening (e.g. flow cytometry, mass cytometry, high-content microscopy or single-cell RNA sequencing; Fig. 2c). Third, immunophenotyping is used to resolve responses across different cell subpopulations (e.g. PBMC subsets or iPSC-derived cell subtypes; Fig. 2d) within the heterogeneous cell sample. This creates a combinatorial expansion of the number of functional assays performed in each cell sample (Fig. 2e). Each ligand-readout-cell subtype combination represents a cellular response ‘node’. All nodes together provide a profile of the functional repertoire of the cells from each donor. In addition, the same matrix can be applied at different time points or with different ligand doses to provide kinetic resolution or functional titration of the cellular responses.

### The diabetic phenotype is conserved in myotubes established from diabetic subjects: evidence for primary defects in glucose transport and glycogen synthase activity [^7bdcd363]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

The most well-described defect in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is reduced insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles. It is unclear whether this defect is primary or acquired secondary to dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperglycemia. We determined the glycogen synthase (GS) activity; the content of glucose-6-phosphate, glucose, and glycogen; and the glucose transport in satellite cell cultures established from diabetic and control subjects. Myotubes were precultured in increasing insulin concentrations for 4 days and subsequently stimulated acutely by insulin. The present study shows that the basal glucose uptake as well as insulin-stimulated GS activity is reduced in satellite cell cultures established from patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, increasing insulin concentrations could compensate for the reduced GS activity to a certain extent, whereas chronic supraphysiological insulin concentrations induced insulin resistance in GS and glucose transport activity. Our data suggest that insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes comprises at least two important defects under physiological insulin concentrations: a reduced glucose transport under basal conditions and a reduced GS activity under acute insulin stimulation, implicating a reduced glucose uptake in the fasting state and a diminished insulin-mediated storage of glucose as glycogen after a meal.

Results

Increased type-2 cytokine production by circulating Tc cells in asthma patients

To compare the functional phenotype of the Tc and Th cell compartment in asthma, we measured the cytokine profile of peripheral blood (PB) T cells in a cohort of 55 clinically well-characterized asthma patients and 17 healthy controls (HC; Table S1) using flow cytometry (gating strategy in Supplementary Fig. 1A). Whereas total Tc/Th cell frequencies were similar between asthma patients and HCs (Supplementary Fig. 1B), production of the type-2 cytokines IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 by both Tc and Th cells was significantly higher in asthma patients than in HCs (Fig. 1A). By contrast, IFNγ, IL-4, and IL-17A production did not differ (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D). Interestingly, we observed elevated frequencies of IFNγ + IL-5 +, IFNγ + IL-9 +, and IFNγ + IL-13 + double-producing Tc cells, supporting type-2 skewing of IFNγ + Tc1 cells in asthma (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained for Th cells (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1D, F). Previous work indicated that Tc2 cells express the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2,, which is in line with the increased abundance of CRTH2 + CD4 - T cells we detected in a different asthma patient cohort (Supplementary Fig. 2A). To rule out that type-2 cytokine production by Tc cells was merely a consequence of PMA/ionomycin stimulation, we induced T-cell receptor (TCR) activation in cultured Tc cells using anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Also in the absence of PMA/ionomycin restimulation, Tc cells produced similar levels of type-2 cytokines, which were highest in the CRTH2 + fraction (Supplementary Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that Tc2 cells produce type-2 cytokines when stimulated under physiologically relevant conditions.

### Mast cell chymase is a possible mediator of neurogenic bladder fibrosis [^2aed85aa]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

Urinary bladders of patients with myelomeningocele, owing to spina bifida, are often functionally impaired, fibrotic organs. Common to this condition are repeated occurrences of bladder infection and inflammation. Since mast cells have been associated with a fibrogenic response in inflammatory conditions, we investigated the role of mast cell granule product, chymase, as a mediator of myleodysplastic bladder fibrosis.

Methods

Human control and myelodysplastic bladder tissues were stained with Unna's stain and chymase antibody to determine mast cell number and localization. Cell specific localization of collagen mRNAs was determined by in situ hybridization (ISH). In vitro, normal human bladder fibroblasts were treated with recombinant chymase, heparin and inhibitors, and collagen subtype concentration was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Results

Myelodysplastic bladders were characterized by increased mast cells in the detrusor muscle layer compared to control bladders, as well as mast cell degranulation and increased connective tissue deposition. Both types I and III collagen mRNA localized to fibroblasts surrounding detrusor muscle fascicles, whereas only collagen III mRNA localized to cells within connective tissue infiltrated muscle bundles in myelomeningocele bladder tissue. Chymase treatment of bladder fibroblasts, in vitro, was dose-dependent and resulted in significant increases in both types I and III collagen. Heparin did not alter collagen protein expression, whereas heparin-chymase combination modulated type III collagen expression. Serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonlyfluoride, did not inhibit collagen synthesis, whereas denatured chymase resulted in decreased collagenous protein levels.

Conclusions

Bladder fibrosis may be mediated by mast cell chymase stimulation of collagen synthesis.

### Early T cell activation correlates with expression of apoptosis markers in patients with end-stage renal disease [^56f104a9]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT. End-stage renal failure (ESRF) and chronic hemodialysis (HD) induce a state of immunodeficiency that involves T cell-mediated responses. A decreased T cell number combined with a reduced T cell lifespan and an increased T cell activation might play a role in the immune impairment associated with ESRF and chronic HD. Increased T cell activation associated with immunodeficiency suggests that activated T cells may be driven to apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, CD3+ T cell activation (CD69) and apoptosis (annexin V, CD95 (Fas), and DNA fragmentation) were analyzed in a case control study after blood draw sampling (ex vivo), in culture conditions, and after phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 stimulation. Ex vivo evaluation of T cells showed an increased number of activated CD69+ T cells in chronic HD patients (142 +/- 5 cells/mm3) compared with patients with ESRF (115 +/- 2 cells/mm3, P = 0.04) and controls (74 +/- 2 cells/mm3, P = 0.0006). These data were confirmed in culture conditions and after stimulation. Similarly, annexin V and CD95 (Fas)-positive T cells were more numerous in both patient groups than in controls, irrespective of the experimental conditions (P < or = 0.005 for both markers), and their percentage was always significantly higher in chronic HD patients than in patients with ESRF. The amount of DNA fragmentation was also significantly higher in the cultured resting T cells of chronic HD patients (37 +/- 3%) than in those of patients with ESRF (25 +/- 3%) and controls (20 +/- 2%) (P = 0.01). Percentage of cultured resting T cells expressing both CD69 and annexin V markers was higher in chronic HD patients (17 +/- 4%) than in patients with ESRF (10 +/- 4%) and controls (6 +/- 2%), (P = 0.005). After stimulation (phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3), CD69+ T cell apoptosis increased by 2.4-fold in chronic HD patients compared with 1.8-fold in patients with ESRF and only 1.2-fold in controls (P = 0.001). T cells from chronic HD patients and patients with ESRF thus showed an aberrant state of early activation that contrasted with an increased proportion of annexin V and CD95 (Fas)-positive T cells engaged in apoptosis, as confirmed by DNA fragmentation. Increased susceptibility to early activated T cell apoptosis is not only associated with uremia, but is also enhanced by HD procedure. This may account for the T lymphopenia, progressive immunodeficiency, and increased infection risk seen in these patients.

Functional Characterization of PLCγ2 Variants

Analyses of Ca 2+ flux in CD19 + cells after IgM crosslinking and ionomycin stimulation were performed in both patients using Fluo-3 flow cytometric assay. In patient 1, no firm conclusions were drawn from these analyses due to the nearly complete absence of circulating B cells (data not shown). By contrast, analyses performed in patient 2 revealed a significantly higher release of Ca 2+ into the cytosol of B cells after IgM crosslinking stimulation than in cells from control subjects, whereas no significant differences were observed after ionomycin stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3 A-C).

Further analysis of novel APLAID variants was performed in a standard PLC assay, similar to that previously used to measure the activity of PLAID and APLAID variants. In this type of analysis, using model cell systems, the substrate is presented in native membranes and the production of inositol phosphates measured under basal or stimulated conditions. As shown in Fig. 3a, both variants have higher PLC activity compared with the wild type with the p.Ala708Pro substitution showing a greater increase in basal and stimulated activities. When analyzed in the context of CLL resistance to ibrutinib, p.Ala708Pro mutation had a pronounced effect, consistent with our observations.

### Functionally impaired plasmacytoid dendritic cells and non-haematopoietic sources of type I interferon characterize human autoimmunity [^e56bacda]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In order to confirm this cellular source of IFN, we studied the IFN-producing capacity of keratinocytes in At-Risk individuals and SLE patients in vitro. We isolated human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts from non-lesional skin of healthy controls (n = 3), At-Risk individuals (n = 5), and SLE patients (n = 5). Keratinocytes isolated from lesional skin biopsies of patients with cutaneous discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), who were ANA-negative and had minimal IFN score A expression in blood, were also used as a disease control (n = 3). Cells were cultured and stimulated with TLR3 or RIG-I agonists, Poly(I:C) (1 μg/mL) or Poly(dA:dT) (100 ng/mL), respectively, for 6 and 24 h before the expression of three subtypes of type I IFNs (IFNK, IFNA2, and IFNB1) as well as type III IFN (IFNL1) was measured by qRT-PCR.

At baseline, without exogenous stimulation, IFNK was expressed by keratinocytes from At-Risk and SLE skin, but not from healthy controls or CDLE. After either Poly(I:C) or Poly(dA:dT) stimulation, this expression of IFNK by At-Risk and SLE keratinocytes was further increased (Fig. 8c). For IFNB1, there was no expression at baseline in any sample. However, after stimulation with Poly(I:C) there was a trend to increased expression for At-Risk keratinocytes and a significant increase for keratinocytes from SLE and CDLE patients. IFNB1 expression was also increased in keratinocytes of SLE patients after Poly(dA:dT) stimulation but not in other conditions (Fig. 8d). In contrast, IFNL1 expression was only observed in CDLE keratinocytes following Poly(I:C) stimulation but not in the other conditions or following Poly(dA:dT) stimulation (Fig. 8e). Finally, IFNA2 expression by keratinocytes was not found in any sample or condition.

### GDF15 mediates the effect of skeletal muscle contraction on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [^48554aff]. Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

Exercise is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and preserves β-cell function by hitherto unknown mechanisms. We postulated that proteins from contracting skeletal muscle may act as cellular signals to regulate pancreatic β-cell function. We used electric pulse stimulation (EPS) to induce contraction in C2C12 myotubes and found that treatment of β-cells with EPS-conditioned medium enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Transcriptomics and subsequent targeted validation revealed growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a central component of the skeletal muscle secretome. Exposure to recombinant GDF15 enhanced GSIS in cells, islets, and mice. GDF15 enhanced GSIS by upregulating the insulin secretion pathway in β-cells, which was abrogated in the presence of a GDF15 neutralizing antibody. The effect of GDF15 on GSIS was also observed in islets from GFRAL-deficient mice. Circulating GDF15 was incrementally elevated in patients with pre- and type 2 diabetes and positively associated with C-peptide in humans with overweight or obesity. Six weeks of high-intensity exercise training increased circulating GDF15 concentrations, which positively correlated with improvements in β-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. Taken together, GDF15 can function as a contraction-induced protein that enhances GSIS through activating the canonical signaling pathway in a GFRAL-independent manner.

Article Highlights

Exercise improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through direct interorgan communication. Contracting skeletal muscle releases growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is required to synergistically enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. GDF15 enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by activating the canonical insulin release pathway. Increased levels of circulating GDF15 after exercise training are related to improvements in β-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Gallium nitrate (Ganite) [^403231b5]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Cancer-Related Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia is a common problem in hospitalized patients with malignancy. It may affect 10-20% of patients with cancer. Different types of malignancy seem to vary in their propensity to cause hypercalcemia. A higher incidence of hypercalcemia has been observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, kidney cancer, and cancer of head and neck. Hypercalcemia of malignancy seems to result from an imbalance between the net resorption of bone and urinary excretion of calcium. Patients with extensive osteolytic bone metastases frequently develop hypercalcemia: this type of hypercalcemia is common with primary breast cancer. Some of these patients have been reported to have increased renal tubular calcium resorption. Breast cancer cells have been reported to produce several potential bone-resorbing factors which stimulate the local osteoclast activity. Humoral hypercalcemia is common with the solid tumors of the lung, head and neck, kidney, and ovaries. Systemic factors (e.g., PTH-rP) produced either by the tumor or host cells have been implicated for the altered calcium fluxes between the extracellular fluid, the kidney, and the skeleton. About 30% of patients with myeloma develop hypercalcemia associated with extensive osteolytic lesions and impaired glomerular filtration. Myeloma cells have been reported to produce local factors that stimulate adjacent osteoclasts.

### Zoledronic acid [^e94e17a0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical studies in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) showed that single-dose infusions of Zoledronic acid Injection are associated with decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus and increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion.

Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM, tumor-induced hypercalcemia) and metastatic bone disease. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Reducing excessive bone resorption and maintaining adequate fluid administration are, therefore, essential to the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved: humoral hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia due to tumor invasion of bone. In humoral hypercalcemia, osteoclasts are activated and bone resorption is stimulated by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which are elaborated by the tumor and circulate systemically. Humoral hypercalcemia usually occurs in squamous cell malignancies of the lung or head and neck or in genitourinary tumors such as renal cell carcinoma or ovarian cancer. Skeletal metastases may be absent or minimal in these patients.

Extensive invasion of bone by tumor cells can also result in hypercalcemia due to local tumor products that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Tumors commonly associated with locally mediated hypercalcemia include breast cancer and multiple myeloma.

Total serum calcium levels in patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy may not reflect the severity of hypercalcemia, since concomitant hypoalbuminemia is commonly present. Ideally, ionized calcium levels should be used to diagnose and follow hypercalcemic conditions; however, these are not commonly or rapidly available in many clinical situations. Therefore, adjustment of the total serum calcium value for differences in albumin levels (corrected serum calcium, CSC) is often used in place of measurement of ionized calcium; several nomograms are in use for this type of calculation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic data in patients with hypercalcemia are not available.

### Apoptosis and schizophrenia: a pilot study based on dermal fibroblast cell lines [^c8a576f1]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an increased susceptibility to apoptosis in cultured fibroblasts from patients with schizophrenia.

Method

Dermal fibroblasts were collected and cultured from three groups: patients with schizophrenia, patients with non-schizophrenic psychosis, and healthy comparison subjects. Susceptibility to apoptosis was measured at the level of degradation product (proportion of cells in the sub-G0 cell cycle fraction in which apoptotic bodies accumulate), pro-apoptotic effector (activated caspase-3), and molecular regulators (P53, Bax and Bcl-2). Cell lines were studied under both basal culture and cycloheximide (an apoptotic inducer) exposure conditions.

Results

Consistent with increased susceptibility to apoptosis, the proportion of sub-G0 cells under basal conditions was significantly larger in the schizophrenia group, compared to the non-schizophrenic psychosis group. However when apoptosis was stimulated with cycloheximide, the schizophrenia group showed an attenuated caspase-3 response. The pattern of correlations between regulators, caspase-3 and the proportion of sub-G0 cells was different in the schizophrenia group, consistent with group-specific apoptotic pathway dysregulation.

Conclusion

The study demonstrated anomalous apoptotic mechanisms in schizophrenia, which appear not to affect non-schizophrenia psychosis patients. The detection of these anomalies in fibroblasts suggests that altered apoptosis may be observable in all somatic cell types in schizophrenia.

Dysfunctionalproduction in response to‐18 stimulation bycells and

To assess the capacity of NK cells and hILCs to produce IFNγ in patients with sJIA as compared to HC, we stimulated PBMCs and measured intracellular IFNγ in these subsets by flow cytometry (Figure 3A–D, Supplementary Figure 3, and Supplementary Figure 4A–D). To evaluate the intrinsic cellular potential to synthesize cytokines, we used PMA/ionomycin as a nonspecific stimulus (Supplementary Figure 3A). Alternatively, we stimulated cells with IL‐18 in the presence of IL‐12 (Supplementary Figure 3B). We found that in patients with sJIA, the frequency of NK cells capable of producing IFNγ in response to both PMA/ionomycin and IL‐18/IL‐12 was comparable to that of HC (Figure 3A). However, we found that, on ex vivo cell stimulation with IL‐18 and IL‐12, patients with sJIA clustered into two distinct subgroups: 5 of 14 patients were hyperresponders (% IFNγ + median = 62.8), whereas the remaining 9 of 14 patients were hypo‐ or null responders (% IFNγ + median = 3.4) (Figure 3A). The median treatment duration did not differ significantly between hyperresponsive and hyporesponsive patients. Interestingly, we found a negative correlation between the percentage of IFNγ + NK cells and the circulating levels of IL‐18 (Figure 3 B). In line with these data, we observed that preincubating ex vivo NK cells from HC with increasing IL‐18 concentrations reduced their subsequent ability to produce IFNγ in response to IL‐18/IL‐12 stimulation in a dose‐dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 4E and F). This desensitization was independent of the presence of IL‐1β and IL‐6, other cytokines that characterize sJIA milieu (Supplementary Figure 4E and F).

### Ovarian hyperandrogenism and response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in primary severe insulin resistance [^fb68a435]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

“Insulin resistance” is usually defined in terms of attenuated ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake. Until beta cell failure occurs, this is compensated for by hyperinsulinemia, with plasma insulin concentration raised by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude in severe cases. “Insulin resistance” does not apply equally to all of insulin’s actions, however, as evidenced by differences between simple insulin deficiency and IR. Some consequences of IR, including acanthosis nigricans and ovarian enlargement, require hyperinsulinemia, and presumably reflect increased insulin action. The ovary may thus be viewed as an “innocent bystander” in IR, suffering adverse trophic actions of the high insulin concentration required to maintain euglycemia. This is supported by hyperandrogenism and PCOS described in patients with insulinoma, and in hyperinsulinemic patients with glycogen storage disease, and by increased prevalence of hyperandrogenism and PCOS-like ovarian appearances in patients with type 1 diabetes, attributed to supraphysiological exogenous insulin in peripheral circulation.

Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the mixed profile of insulin resistant and insulin sensitive phenomena seen in “insulin resistance.” One possibility is that different arms of the insulin signaling pathway are differentially affected by IR. For example, it has been suggested based on studies of muscle insulin signaling in PCOS that “metabolic” insulin signaling through the PI3K pathway is selectively impaired, leaving “mitogenic” signaling intact. Another model holds that high concentrations of insulin activate mitogenic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptors, which may be compounded by alterations in IGF binding proteins in IR.

If a selective defect in metabolic actions of insulin were critical to pathogenesis of IR-associated ovarian phenotypes, then defects in the insulin receptor, affecting all insulin signaling equally, would be associated with a less severe ovarian phenotype than defects in the PI3K/AKT2 arm of the signaling pathway. This was not observed. The ovarian phenotype we describe in an infant with Donohue syndrome, characterized by minimal residual insulin receptor function, suggests moreover that ovarian effects of extreme hyperinsulinemia are not mediated through the insulin receptor. These findings favor the hypothesis that insulin drives hyperandrogenism and PCOS via action on ovarian IGF1 receptors.

### Hyperandrogenism and cardiometabolic risk in pre-and postmenopausal women-what is the evidence? [^6b2461d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Obesity

Insulin resistance is associated with accumulation of abdominal fat, which is a common clinical feature even in normal-weight women with PCOS, although not included in the diagnostic criteria. In addition to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, other factors may contribute to obesity in PCOS, including testosterone-dependent appetite regulation and lipolytic function, as well as genetic factors, whereas changes in energy expenditure appear less significant. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis including 35 studies, the pooled estimated prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women with PCOS is 49%, and the corresponding prevalence of abdominal obesity is 54% (Table 1). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis in peri- and postmenopausal women with PCOS also showed greater BMI, waist circumference, and insulin resistance than controls (Table 2). However, less is known about older women with a history of PCOS. In a small cohort of women with PCOS and controls followed up to a mean age of 81 years, there was no difference in BMI and waist-hip ratio between groups. Thus, the enhanced risk of obesity in women with PCOS might diminish at older age.

Table 2. 
Evidence of cardiometabolic outcomes in pre- and postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism (mainly women with PCOS) as based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses

Severe hyperandrogenism (ie, virilizing symptoms of endogenous cause, such as ovarian hyperthecosis in a peri- or postmenopausal woman) is clearly associated with insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. In fact, insulin resistance and secondary hyperinsulinemia have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. High levels of insulin can induce stromal luteinization and stimulate androgen production in ovarian theca cells. Usually, the metabolic symptoms of ovarian hyperthecosis are more pronounced than in PCOS and often manifested as acanthosis nigricans, a darkening of the skin in intertriginous areas, which is pathognomonic of insulin resistance. Androgen-secreting tumors also seem to be associated with metabolic disorders. Clinical manifestations of insulin resistance and abdominal obesity have been reported for both androgen-secreting ovarian and adrenal tumors, respectively. Adrenal tumors may also secrete cortisol in increased amounts, which may contribute to insulin resistance in these patients.

Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies‚ administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)‚ subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemiluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl‑phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro.

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however‚ the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)‚ including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

### Altered response of skeletal muscle to IL-6 in type 2 diabetic patients [^c76f4e87]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

IL-6 activation of intracellular signaling pathways.

To assess whether the reduced IL-6–mediated increase in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism was also evident for other effects of IL-6, we assessed acute effects of IL-6–mediated signaling in skeletal muscle cells. In cultures established from normal glucose tolerant subjects, an acute (20 min) IL-6 exposure increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, in muscle cultures established from type 2 diabetic patients, this effect was markedly blunted (Fig. 4 A). IL-6 increased JAK2 phosphorylation in cultured myotubes from individuals with normal glucose tolerance, but not type 2 diabetes (Fig. 4 B).

FIG. 4.

### Salivary gland hypofunction and / or xerostomia induced by nonsurgical cancer therapies: ISOO / MASCC / ASCO guideline [^13b16174]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ISOO/MASCC/ASCO guideline—management options for xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction induced by nonsurgical cancer therapies include the following conditional recommendations with stated evidence ratings: Topical mucosal lubricants or saliva substitutes may be offered to improve xerostomia induced by nonsurgical cancer therapies (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong). Gustatory and masticatory salivary reflex stimulation by sugar-free lozenges, acidic (nonerosive and sugar-free special preparation if dentate patients) candies, or sugar-free, nonacidic chewing gum may be offered to produce transitory increased salivary flow rate and transitory relief from xerostomia (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate). Oral pilocarpine, and cevimeline where available, may be offered after radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer for improvement of xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction; however, improvement of salivary gland hypofunction may be limited (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong). Acupuncture may be offered after radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer for improvement of xerostomia (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Transcutaneous electrostimulation or acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrostimulation of the salivary glands may be offered after radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer for improvement of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Evidence remains insufficient for a recommendation for or against extract of ginger and mesenchymal stem cell therapy for improvement of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^6ea09716]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Airway remodeling in asthma—illustrated triggers and structural elements are summarized as follows: Initiation of asthma results from a variety of triggers, with allergic, infectious, and environmental factors playing a role, and agonist-induced bronchoconstriction with associated mechanical forces can trigger airway changes. Asthma induction leads to a sustained cycle of chronic inflammation, cell–cell interactions, and secreted factors from immune and structural cells, yielding chronic disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness and structural changes that represent remodeling. Remodeling includes changes to epithelial thickness and composition with a greater proportion of mucus-producing cells, thickening and fibrosis of the lamina propria, increased numbers and size of airway smooth muscle cells, increased fibroblasts and altered extracellular matrix composition, and increased microvasculature in the asthmatic airway wall.

### Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: pathogenesis and treatment [^193a71de]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is not an independent disease but rather a life-threatening clinical syndrome that occurs in many underlying conditions and in all age groups. HLH is the consequence of a severe, uncontrolled hyperinflammatory reaction that in most cases is triggered by an infectious agent. Persistent stimulation of lymphocytes and histiocytes results in hypercytokinemia, leading to the characteristic symptoms of HLH. Genetic defects in familial HLH and in immunodeficiency syndromes associated with albinism affect the transport, processing, and function of cytotoxic granules in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This leads to defective killing of target cells and a failure to contract the immune response. The defects are increasingly found also in adolescents and adults. Acquired HLH occurs in autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases (macrophage activation syndrome) and in patients with iatrogenic immunosuppression or with malignancies, but also in otherwise healthy persons with infections. Treatment of HLH aims at suppressing hypercytokinemia and eliminating the activated and infected cells. In genetic HLH, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is needed for the correction of the immune defect. Treatment modalities include immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory, and cytostatic drugs; T-cell antibodies; and anticytokine agents. Using immunochemotherapy, familial HLH, which had been invariably fatal, has become a curable disease with more than 50% survivors. Reduced intensity conditioning for HSCT, which is associated with less transplantation-related mortality, will further improve cure rates.

### Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity [^e85fb3b3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Epidemiological and clinical reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virulence hinges upon the triggering of an aberrant host immune response, more so than on direct virus-induced cellular damage. To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we perform cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in COVID-19 patients. We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity.

### Fludeoxyglucose f 18 [^fb0681ba]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration. After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration.

In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes. However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F18.

In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging.

In the brain, cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure, glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic.

### Fecal luminal factors from patients with irritable bowel syndrome induce distinct gene expression of colonoids [^ca94a8a1]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of genes explored in our study, related to antibacterial response, inflammation and cell junctions, were more highly expressed by the colonoid monolayers stimulated with fecal supernatants from IBS patients compared to healthy subjects. The pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL‐1βand TNF‐α,the receptor TLR9 sensing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides of microbial DNA,the antibacterial enzyme lysozymeand transcription factors for type 1 interferons IRF5 and IRF7reflect activation of the immune response and were all expressed to a higher degree in IBS patients. Interestingly, fecal supernatants from IBS patients also induced higher gene expression of CD1D, which encodes an MHC class I‐like molecule presenting bacterial lipid antigens to natural killer T cells (NKT cells). Activated NKT cells rapidly secrete a plethora of cytokines aiming to direct other immune cells to fight infections.Also, gene expression of TNFSF13 (known as APRIL),a cytokine supporting class switching to IgA, was higher in colonoid monolayers stimulated with fecal supernatants from IBS patients. Altogether, this suggests that fecal supernatants from IBS patients induce immune activity of epithelial cells. While an impaired barrier function is considered to be central for IBS pathophysiology, it is somewhat surprising to note a higher gene expression of TJP2, DSC2 and CLDN15, known to be involved in maintaining epithelial integrity,in colonoid monolayers stimulated with fecal supernatants from IBS patients. Our findings are not yet corroborated by other studies, potentially due to the fact that only a few previous studies have addressed the effects of luminal factors on intestinal epithelium, represented by cell lines, organoids or biopsies, in relation to IBS.Still, soluble mediators from colonic biopsies from patients decreased the gene expression of ZO‐1, but not occludin, both important components of tight junctions, and induced increased the permeability in Caco‐2 cultures.Further, fecal supernatants from IBS patients increased the paracellular permeability, assessed by FITC‐Dextran flux, in colonoid cultures.In parallel, the increase of paracellular permeability in enteroid cultures following stimulation with the proinflammatory stimuli IFN‐γ corresponded with a decrease of the gene expression of the tight junctions ZO‐1 and occludin in the same study.Similarly, another study provided evidence of impaired barrier function when adding fecal supernatants from IBS patients to intestinal biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers.In the above mentioned studies, cell function and gene expression was dependent on the type of stimuli,as well as concentration and time,indicating the complexity of studying regulation of barrier function. Hence, the contradictory results may depend on different culture conditions, including concentration of fecal supernatants and time of culture, but also on the different cell systems or tissues. Furthermore, the increased gene expression of junctional complexes recorded in our study may reflect an attempt to regulate expression of tight junction proteins needed to maintain epithelial integrity under IBS‐like conditions. Whether addition of fecal supernatants from IBS patients and healthy subjects, respectively, gives rise to functional differences related to epithelial integrity of the colonoids in our model system remains to be further elucidated. Still, our results support the notion that fecal supernatants from IBS patients have a distinct effect on the intestinal epithelium, regulating genes maintaining epithelial barrier integrity.

### Islet-derived eATP fuels autoreactive CD8T cells and facilitates the onset of type 1 diabetes [^c56ab752]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Extracellular ATP (eATP) activates T cells by engaging the P2X7R receptor. We identified two loss-of-function P2X7R mutations that are protective against type 1 diabetes (T1D) and thus hypothesized that eATP/P2X7R signaling may represent an early step in T1D onset. Specifically, we observed that in patients with newly diagnosed T1D, P2X7R is upregulated on CD8 + effector T cells in comparison with healthy control subjects. eATP is released at high levels by human/murine islets in vitro in high-glucose/inflammatory conditions, thus upregulating P2X7R on CD8 + T cells in vitro. P2X7R blockade with oxidized ATP reduces the CD8 + T cell-mediated autoimmune response in vitro and delays diabetes onset in NOD mice. Autoreactive CD8 + T-cell activation is highly dependent upon eATP/P2X7R-mediated priming, while a novel sP2X7R recombinant protein abrogates changes in metabolism and the autoimmune response associated with CD8 + T cells. eATP/P2X7R signaling facilitates the onset of autoimmune T1D by fueling autoreactive CD8 + cells and therefore represents a novel targeted therapeutic for the disorder.

Methods

Study subjects and sampling

A total of 55 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by qPCR and 42 adult healthy volunteers without any clinical signs of COVID-19 infection were enrolled from March to July 2020 at the University Hospital Regensburg. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee from the University Hospital Regensburg (Study and Approval Number: 20-1785-101). The study was performed in accordance with all relevant ethical regulations for work with human participants. Informed consent and consent to publish were obtained from all enrolled patients (or their legal representatives) and healthy volunteers.

The cohort of COVID-19 patients was stratified into non-ventilated (n = 25) and mechanically ventilated (n = 30) patients. Ventilated patients were further subgrouped according to their outcome (discharged from the ICU = “survived”, or death on the ICU = “dead”) (Table 1). In most patients, several consecutive blood samples were available resulting in a total of 188 samples. In total, 14 patients were first sampled on mechanical ventilation and also after discharge from the ICU. Samples of these patients were assigned into the subgroup “ventilated” or “non-ventilated” according to the ventilation status at the time of sampling (Supplementary Table 1). None of the patients received prednisolone equivalents ≥40 mg/day for treatment of COVID-19.

Fresh whole-blood samples for immediate immunophenotyping by flow cytometry with at least one antibody panel were available from all participants. Sufficient amounts of fresh blood to also perform whole-blood stimulation were available from 38 healthy controls (38 samples), 33 non-ventilated COVID-19 patients (58 samples), and 21 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (77 samples). For subgroup analysis the mechanically ventilated patients were again stratified according to their outcome into the groups “survived” (17 patients, 69 samples) and “dead” (4 patients, 8 samples). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from 25 non-ventilated patients (36 samples) and 16 ventilated COVID-19 patients (42 samples). For subgroup analysis, the mechanically ventilated patients were again stratified according to their outcome into the groups “survived” (n = 14, 39 samples) and “dead” (n = 2, 3 samples). The exact numbers of patients and samples for each readout are provided in the figure legends, as for some readouts, not enough material was available.

### The serine phosphorylation hypothesis of polycystic ovary syndrome: a unifying mechanism for hyperandrogenemia and insulin resistance [^ee64cbe5]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy affecting 4%-8% of reproductive-aged women. The syndrome is characterized by hyperandrogenemia and disordered gonadotropin secretion and is often associated with insulin resistance. However, rather than being one disease entity caused by a single molecular defect, PCOS under its current diagnostic criteria most likely includes a number of distinct disease processes with similar clinical phenotypes but different pathophysiologic mechanisms. The serine phosphorylation hypothesis can potentially explain two major features of PCOS--hyperandrogenemia and insulin resistance. Further defining the molecular mechanisms regulating androgen biosynthesis and insulin action in PCOS patients will permit a better understanding of the syndrome and may lead to the generation of novel specific pharmacologic therapies.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—evaluation of markedly elevated androgens: If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS, including ovarian and adrenal neoplastic growths, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis (after menopause), iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, should be considered. The guideline further notes that some androgen-secreting neoplasms are associated with only mild to moderate increases in androgen levels, and that the clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen-secreting tumour.

### Beyond weight loss: a review of the therapeutic uses of very-low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diets [^2fd2dacd]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in females, with a high prevalence (6–10%);symptoms include hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, obesity, insulin resistance and subfertility. Insulin resistance and related hyperinsulinaemia is actually a very common feature affecting about 65–70% of women with PCOS;it is seen most frequently in obese patients, affecting 70–80%, compared with only 20–25% of lean PCOS sufferers.Despite this observation, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia appear to be linked to PCOS independently of obesity, and modifications in the normal cellular mechanisms of insulin signalling have been demonstrated in both lean and obese patients. Furthermore, high blood levels of insulin can act by increasing androgenous hormonal stimulation of the ovarian theca cells as well as potentiating gonadotropin-stimulated ovarian androgen steroidogenesis—although recent data has suggested that the insulin-induced increase in ovarian hormone secretion is not accompanied by increased steroid metabolism.Hyperinsulinaemia may also affect the central actions of androgen by impairing progesterone inhibition of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator.Insulin has also been shown to increase expression of adrenal steroidogenic enzyme mRNAas well as adrenal responsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone.

Women with PCOS frequently demonstrate many of the signs related to metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance, T2D, dyslipidemia and also high levels of inflammation. Suggested treatments include those that reduce insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia, such as lifestyle modifications (exercise, diet and weight loss) and pharmacological treatments that include the administration of thiazolidinediones or metformin. It is evident that any interventions that improve insulinaemia and reduce body weight may also be effective in reducing hyperandrogenism, normalizing ovulation and reducing the various symptoms of PCOS.

Finally, although we only have preliminary evidence of the positive effects of VLCKD in PCOS,there are clear mechanisms that are consistent with the physiological plausibility of such dietary therapy.

### Hyperandrogenism and cardiometabolic risk in pre-and postmenopausal women-what is the evidence? [^3cf5912d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperandrogenism, defined as androgen excess originating from the ovaries and/or the adrenal glands, is a common condition in premenopausal women, and may also persist or develop in postmenopausal women. The symptoms include hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia, and in severe and more rare cases, virilizing symptoms, also including deepening of the voice, breast atrophy, increased muscle mass, and enlargement of the clitoris.

The present review focuses on the clinical diagnoses of hyperandrogenism described later in the article. However, references are also made to associations between testosterone levels, or derived measures such as free androgen index (FAI; 100 × total testosterone SHBG) and cardiometabolic outcomes. In this context, it should be acknowledged that the methodology of testosterone determination has varied among studies and today only liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is considered accurate, whereas immunoassays are burdened with cross-reactivity and are not sensitive enough for determination at low concentrations. Furthermore, although FAI is recommended for clinical use in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it is a derived measure of testosterone that lacks certified reference ranges and may reflect changes in SHBG as well as testosterone.

PCOS is considered the most common cause of hyperandrogenism in women and is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Based on the Rotterdam definition of PCOS, the global prevalence in premenopausal women ranges between 10% and 13%. A history of oligo/amenorrhea and ovarian hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years can be used for diagnosing PCOS in postmenopausal women, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline. Although symptoms of hyperandrogenism in PCOS are relatively mild to moderate and often improve after menopause, it is recognized that postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS are more likely to have elevated serum androgen levels (total testosterone, FAI, androstenedione) and higher prevalence of hirsutism than women without PCOS. Ovarian hyperthecosis is considered the peri- and postmenopausal woman's variant of PCOS. It is caused by nests of luteinized theca cells in the ovarian stroma, producing excess amounts of testosterone. Ovarian hyperthecosis is a rare disorder and the symptoms of hyperandrogenism are usually more extreme with slow progression to virilization, which is not the case in PCOS.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)—ambrisentan background (selective ET-A endothelin receptor antagonist): clinically significant endothelin receptors include endothelin type (ET-A) receptors, which induce vasoconstriction and are usually found on vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelin type B1 (ET-B1) receptors in endothelial cells that stimulate release of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin to produce vasodilation; ET-A receptors have been shown to propagate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leading to a profibrotic state, and ET-B2 receptors antagonize ET-B1 and vasoconstrict through an unknown mechanism. Clinically available endothelin receptor antagonists include selective ET-A antagonists (e.g., ambrisentan) and dual antagonists (e.g., bosentan and macitentan), and increased ET-A and ET-B receptor levels have been found in IPF-affected fibrotic lung, motivating investigation of both selective and dual antagonists for potential benefit in treating patients with IPF.

### Increased number of islet-associated macrophages in type 2 diabetes [^f42506e9]. Diabetes (2007). Low credibility.

Activation of the innate immune system in obesity is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the notion that increased numbers of macrophages exist in the islets of type 2 diabetes patients and that this may be explained by a dysregulation of islet-derived inflammatory factors. Increased islet-associated immune cells were observed in human type 2 diabetic patients, high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice, the GK rat, and the db/db mouse. When cultured islets were exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu or when islets were isolated from high-fat-fed mice, increased islet-derived inflammatory factors were produced and released, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, chemokine KC, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha. The specificity of this response was investigated by direct comparison to nonislet pancreatic tissue and beta-cell lines and was not mimicked by the induction of islet cell death. Further, this inflammatory response was found to be biologically functional, as conditioned medium from human islets exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu could induce increased migration of monocytes and neutrophils. This migration was blocked by IL-8 neutralization, and IL-8 was localized to the human pancreatic alpha-cell. Therefore, islet-derived inflammatory factors are regulated by a type 2 diabetic milieu and may contribute to the macrophage infiltration of pancreatic islets that we observe in type 2 diabetes.

### Hyperandrogenism and cardiometabolic risk in pre-and postmenopausal women-what is the evidence? [^c6f87e42]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Along with ovarian hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance is a key factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The prevalence of insulin resistance in women with PCOS as assessed by the glucose clamp technique is estimated to 65% to 95%. Insulin resistance can occur in both normal-weight and overweight individuals with PCOS but is exacerbated by obesity. Furthermore, insulin resistance is dependent on PCOS phenotype. The highest occurrence is described in phenotype A with all 3 diagnostic criteria (oligo-anovulation [OA], hyperandrogenism [HA], polycystic ovaries [PCO]) as well as B (OA, HA), followed by C (HA, PCO), and lowest incidence in phenotype D lacking the criterion of hyperandrogenism (OA, PCO).

The molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in PCOS seem to be selective and tissue specific. There is evidence of a postreceptor defect in insulin signaling that involves increased serine phosphorylation and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 causing dysfunction of the metabolic pathway but sparing the mitogenic pathway. In skeletal muscle, which is the major insulin-dependent peripheral glucose uptake tissue, insulin-resistant mechanisms in PCOS also include mitochondrial dysfunction and intramuscular lipid accumulation. In adipose tissue, insulin acts via aldoketo reductase type 3 to stimulate local testosterone production and thereby promotes systemic insulin resistance. Furthermore, decreased levels of adiponectin produced by adipose cells result in decreased protein kinase C activity and insulin signaling. In ovarian tissue, data suggest selective insulin resistance resulting in impaired insulin-dependent glucose metabolism in granulosa-theca lutein cells but unchanged insulin-stimulated steroid hormone production. In addition, there is evidence of defective insulin signaling in the endometrium of women with PCOS as demonstrated by lower endometrial expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transporter 4 in comparison to body mass index (BMI)-matched controls.

### Different combinations of cytokines and activating receptor stimuli are required for human natural killer cell functional diversity [^90de5f64]. Cytokine (2013). Low credibility.

Although cytokine induced NK cell activation protocols are commonly used in many laboratories worldwide, a systematic study of the effect of different cytokines either alone or in combination on NK cell function is lacking. In this study we performed a comparative evaluation of several cytokines potentially important for NK cell stimulation, focusing particularly on IL21 because of its promising role in anti-tumor therapy. To simulate in vivo physiological condition, we evaluated cytokine stimulation in total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as accessory cells are responsible for the secretion of many soluble factors and can simultaneously trigger multiple activation signals through engagement of NK cell activating receptors. We show here that NK cell responses are finely regulated by several incoming stimuli and that combinations of IL21+IL2 or IL21+IL15 strongly induced NK cell function. Cytokine stimulation combined with NK receptor engagement can be helpful in the dissection of NK cell responses in health and disease.

Murine models and translation to human disease—panel discussion highlights: The panel addressed whether murine models are appropriate for understanding human lung disease and how current research can be translated, noting that many animal species, including mice and humans, experience comparable pathological lung disorders and that similar types of injury elicit comparable repair and regeneration outcomes across species. They cautioned that current animal models typically reflect only the earliest stages of disease pathogenesis whereas most human lung diseases present as end-stage conditions, and differences between human and murine lung physiology may complicate direct clinical translation. An improved understanding of mechanisms regulating normal murine lung homeostasis and disease was suggested as a means to establish and identify new targets for pharmacological interventions in human disease.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^77d8f453]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction and Methodology

Androgen excess is defined as clinical or biochemical evidence of increased production of androgenic steroids in women. It is observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age and less commonly in postmenopausal women. Androgen excess typically manifests clinically as hirsutism or acne, but more severe and prolonged exposure can lead to overt virilisation, including clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, female pattern hair‐loss (FPHL) or erythrocytosis. Most adolescents and women of reproductive age who present to secondary or tertiary care with androgen excess will have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, other primary underlying pathologies must be excluded in a subset of patients harbouring red flag clinical features. These include severe biochemical disturbances, rapidly progressive symptoms or signs or presentation in the postmenopausal phase of life. This cohort of patients have increased likelihood of underlying neoplastic ovarian, adrenal or pituitary disease, or occasionally monogenic disorders of insulin signalling or androgen metabolism, compared to those with milder disturbances in the PCOS range. A detailed clinical history, targeted physical examination and careful interrogation of the pattern and severity of biochemical disturbances are critical to rationalise the requirement and strategy for further biochemical, radiological and, where appropriate, genetic investigations. Although androgen excess in women with PCOS is closely correlated with adverse metabolic health outcomes throughout their life course, severe biochemical disturbances or overt virilisation are rarely observed in PCOS. Therefore, a systematic diagnostic approach is required to investigate patients with typical red flag signs and symptoms.

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) therapy—benefits, harms, and candidacy considerations in obstructive sleep apnea include that the Work Group considered benefits and harms related to referral for surgical evaluation and the procedure itself; potential harms of referral include the patient foregoing other types of OSA therapy during evaluation, while benefits of referral include increased discussion of both surgical and non-surgical options, and benefits of receiving HGNS include a reduction in AHI. The evidence is consistent but variability exists in provider and patient preferences regarding surgery and implantable devices; resource utilization includes the cost of surgery and the device, the need for a specially trained surgeon, and staff for follow-up management, and limited specialized resources may restrict access. This therapy has mostly been tested in patients with a BMI less than 40 kg/m2 (most rigorously tested for BMI <32 kg/m2) and a specific pattern of pharyngeal collapse during sleep endoscopy, and not every patient is a good surgical candidate based on comorbid conditions, general health status, and adequate psychosocial support for attending procedure-related visits.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^4289cf33]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Patient Information

MENOPUR (Men-oh-pyoor) (menotropins for injection) for subcutaneous use

Read this Patient Information before you start using MENOPUR®(menotropins for injection) and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is MENOPUR?

MENOPUR is a prescription medicine that contains follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). MENOPUR causes your ovaries to make multiple (more than 1) eggs as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) cycle.

Who should not use MENOPUR?

Do not use MENOPUR if you:

are allergic to menotropins or any of the ingredients in MENOPUR. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in MENOPUR.
have ovaries that no longer make eggs (primary ovarian failure)
are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. If MENOPUR is taken while you are pregnant, it may harm your baby.
have problems with your thyroid gland, adrenal gland or pituitary gland that are not controlled by taking medicine.
have a tumor in your female organs, including your ovaries, breast, or uterus that may get worse with high levels of estrogen
have a tumor of your pituitary gland or hypothalamus
have abnormal bleeding from your uterus or vagina and the cause is not known
have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries, not due to a problem called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

### Ovarian volume, not follicle count, is independently associated with androgens in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome [^d523dbfd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

In accordance with the previous reports, our results indicated that increased ovarian volume could also serve as a biomarker of the raised LH/FSH ratio in the PCOS women. In the ovary, androgens are produced by theca cells in response to LH stimulation ; defects of gonadotropins secretion, including elevated levels of LH or an elevated LH/FSH ratio, are the key factors associated with the persistence of the anovulatory cycles in the PCOS patients. Additionally, it has been shown that the measurement of the serum LH level and the LH/FSH ratio may reflect the ovarian volume better than the serum AMH level in the PCOS subjects.

Excess 2–9 mm antral follicle number, a marker of follicle arrest, is known to be an oligo-anovulation risk factor that can predict hyperandrogenism and PCOS. However, based on our results, the number of 2–9 mm follicles, as evaluated by AFC or FNPO, could not predict hormonal (total testosterone, FAI and LH/FSH ratio) or metabolic disturbance (HOMA-IR). Even after a subanalysis of the FNPO parameter with the use of different follicle sizes (2–5 or 6–9 mm), we did not find any association between follicle count and testosterone, FAI, LH/FSH ratio, or HOMA-IR. Our findings were, thus, in contrast with the previous works which focused on the follicle numbers in the range of 2–5 mm and 6–9 mm; for example, Brink et al. observed that the number of follicles with the size of 6–9 mm was predictive of total testosterone in healthy women with normal menstrual cycles, but not among those with irregular menstrual cycles ; meanwhile, Jonard et al. found that this relationship was limited to the number of follicles with the range of 2–5 mm. These conflicting findings could be due to differences in the techniques used for measuring testosterone levels, population of study and sample size.

### Glioma synapses recruit mechanisms of adaptive plasticity [^e6e4c918]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

BDNF regulates neuron–glioma interactions

We previously found that BDNF is one of multiple paracrine factors that can increase glioma proliferation in response to neuronal activity,, albeit not as robustly as other neuron–glioma signalling mechanisms. To confirm the relative contribution of activity-regulated BDNF ligand to the mitogenic effect of activity-regulated secreted factors, we optogenetically stimulated cortical explants from Bdnf -TMKI or Bdnf wild-type mice, collected conditioned medium, and tested the effects of conditioned medium on glioma cell proliferation in vitro using our well-validated experimental paradigm. Exposure of patient-derived glioma cultures to conditioned medium from optogenetically stimulated Bdnf wild-type cortical explants increased tumour cell proliferation rate, as we have previously shown(Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Conditioned medium collected from optogenetically stimulated Bdnf -TMKI cortical explants elicited a mildly reduced proliferative response of glioma cells in monoculture compared with conditioned medium from wild-type cortical explants, indicating a small direct mitogenic effect of activity-regulated BDNF ligand secretion (Extended Data Fig. 3b), as expected.

Health risks

Polycystic ovary syndrome is well established as a reproductive disorder associated with hyperandrogenism, and is the leading cause of oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea.Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are at increased risk of mental health disorders,endometrial cancer,and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after induction of ovulation.Consistent with our understanding of the pathogenesis, however, polycystic ovary syndrome is also recognised as a metabolic disorder, with long term health risks, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and obesity.These health risks could be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular eventsand several adverse pregnancy outcomes.Although the reproductive aspects might diminish with age, metabolic features typically persist or can worsen.

### Stromal and immune cells in gut fibrosis: the myofibroblast and the scarface [^122b8a7a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Increased expression of IL-1β and IL-6 has been detected in inflamed tissue from IBD patients, produced mostly by lamina propria mononuclear cells Okuno et al showed that intestinal SEMFs overexpress collagen type I and type IV, as well as MCP-1 and MMP-1, in response to IL-1β stimulation. In a more recent study, IL-1β upregulated the mRNA levels of IL-36γ in human SEMFs, a cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family that was recently found to be elevated in active inflamed tissues of patients with IBD. The role of IL-1β in intestinal wound repair is highlighted by an in vitro study where conditioned media from CCD-18Co previously stimulated with IL-1β induced the migration and differentiation of epithelial cell line Caco-2. Furthermore, IL-1β induced the overexpression of Wnt5a in CCD-18Co, an essential molecule of epithelium integrity and regeneration. Conditioned media depleted from Wnt5a failed to promote epithelial migration and differentiation, indicating that IL-1β indirectly induces epithelial migration through its direct action on myofibroblasts’ ability to express Wnt5a. However, increased local and systemic IL-6 levels have been mainly associated with disease activity and severity. SEMFs isolated either from inflamed or non-inflamed tissue of patients with CD expressed elevated levels of IL-6, compared with SEMFs isolated from non-IBD patients. Nonetheless, a link between IL-6 and fibrosis in IBD has not yet been established.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: antimüllerian hormone and its role in the pathophysiology of the syndrome [^adfe6330]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age, with a prevalence estimated between 10-13%. It is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) plays a key role in regulating normal reproductive function in both males and females. Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in understanding AMH, with numerous studies revealing its unexpected roles throughout the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis. AMH and its receptor are also produced in the forebrain, where they contribute to the proper migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons during development. At the hypothalamic and pituitary levels, AMH has been shown to increase the frequency of GnRH pulses, which in turn leads to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. In PCOS, this regulatory mechanism appears to be disrupted. The LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio is often elevated due to altered GnRH pulse frequency. Elevated AMH levels contribute to this dysregulation by increasing GnRH pulsatility, which leads to enhanced LH secretion. This, in turn, stimulates theca cells to produce excessive androgens, resulting in hyperandrogenism, follicular arrest, and anovulation. AMH levels are strongly correlated with these clinical features of PCOS and are predictive of outcomes in assisted reproductive treatments (ART), including a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, offspring born to mothers with PCOS tend to have elevated levels of AMH and androgens at birth, which may alter the HPG axis and contribute to the development of PCOS later in life.

### Therapeutic manipulation of iNKT cells in autoimmunity: modes of action and potential risks [^0d253721]. Trends in Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are a unique T cell subset that upon activation promptly produce copious amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to both innate and acquired immunity. Animal models of autoimmune diseases suggest that iNKT cells favor immune regulation because their absence enhances autoimmunity in some models, whereas their enrichment alleviates autoimmune manifestations. Moreover, convergent experiments indicate that therapeutic targeting of iNKT cells can potentiate their immunoregulatory properties. Therefore, iNKT cells are considered an attractive target for the treatment of human autoimmune disorders. However, in our opinion several concerns must be addressed before iNKT cell manipulation can be safely used for treating patients with autoimmune diseases. Here, we discuss the therapeutic potential of this approach, and its possible pitfalls.

### Treating autoimmune disease by targeting CD8 (+) T suppressor cells [^1ce7cf93]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Current treatments for autoimmune disease are hampered by the non-specificity of immunomodulatory interventions, having to accept broad suppression of immunoresponsiveness with potentially serious side effects, such as infection or malignancy. The development of antigen-specific approaches, downregulating pathogenic immune responses while maintaining protective immunity, would be a major step forward. One possible approach involves the targeting of physiological regulatory mechanisms, such as inhibitory CD8 T cells that are now recognized to fine-tune many aspects of immune responses. CD8 T suppressor (Ts) cells may directly inhibit other T cells or condition antigen-presenting cells in such a way that immune amplification steps are dampened. The promise of CD8 Ts cells lies in their potential to disrupt host-injurious immune responses in a targeted fashion. For therapeutic purposes, such CD8 Ts cells could either be generated in vitro and transferred into the host or their numbers and activity could be modulated by treating the patient with established or novel immunomodulators. Emerging evidence shows that several subsets of CD8 Ts cells exist. While there is still considerable uncertainty about the molecular mechanisms through which CD8 Ts cells can reset immune responses to protect the host, their potential diagnostic and therapeutic use is intriguing and has generated renewed interest.

### Discovery of novel lipid profiles in PCOS: Do insulin and androgen oppositely regulate bioactive lipid production? [^a84e003d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex multisystem syndrome that occurs in postpubertal women. According to diagnostic criteria of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/National Institutes of Health, 4% to 10% of women of reproductive age have PCOS. The major manifestations of PCOS are dilute ovulation/anovulation, polycystic ovaries, and hyperandrogenism. PCOS is often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, abnormal glucose tolerance, lipid metabolic disorders, and other metabolic abnormalities. The prevalence of obesity in women with PCOS is approximately 50% to 80%. Obesity is associated with abnormal adipokine secretion, elevated serum free fatty acids (FFAs), and metabolic disorders associated with abnormal steroid hormone function in adipose tissue, resulting in low-grade chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and abnormal glucose tolerance. Approximately 20% of obese patients with PCOS have impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) ; in addition, lean patients with PCOS show increased prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM compared with women without PCOS. The prevalence of insulin resistance is between 44% and 70%, and it manifests as impaired insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis and lipid oxidation, resulting in increased serum FFAs in obese women with PCOS that are matched for body mass index (BMI).

### Polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance [^cf216cda]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Results from recent basic and clinical research investigations have greatly improved our understanding of insulin resistance in general and insulin resistance associated with PCOS in particular. With this understanding has come the possibility of using new methods to treat PCOS. This is particularly true when discussing the use of insulin-sensitizing drugs. Caution must be exercised in using these drugs because of unforeseen acute or remote adverse side effects. Postulated relationships among PCOS, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance do not completely solve the endocrinologic mystery of the patient with PCOS. For example, how does the partial destruction of the ovary (e.g., wedge biopsy or ovary drilling by laser or cautery), which does not affect insulin resistance, result in ovulatory cycles? Why does the administration of excessive exogenous insulin in the case of the insulin-dependent diabetic fail to cause hyperandrogenism? Certainly, much remains to be learned about the reproductive endocrine disturbance we now call PCOS.

### Hair loss: common causes and treatment | AAFP (...) [^ec506de2]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Specific Disorders ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss in men and women and is a normal physiologic variant. It is most prevalent in white men, with 30%, 40%, and 50% experiencing androgenetic alopecia at 30, 40, and 50 years of age, respectively.
2. Although this condition is less common in women, 38% of women older than 70 years may be affected
3. Many patients with androgenetic alopecia have a family history of this condition. Hair thinning occurs in a sex-specific pattern. Men typically present with bitemporal thinning, thinning of the frontal and vertex scalp, or complete hair loss with residual hair at the occiput and temporal fringes. 5 Women typically present with diffuse hair thinning of the vertex with sparing of the frontal hairline. Some women experience thinning over the lateral scalp.

Common conditions that mimic androgenetic alopecia include thyroid disease, iron deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Treatment is based on patient preference. Topical minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Hair regrowth is more robust at the vertex than in the frontal area, and will take six to 12 months to improve. 5 Treatment should continue indefinitely because hair loss reoccurs when treatment is discontinued. Minoxidil 2% solution is recommended for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women. 6 Adverse effects include irritant and contact dermatitis. Finasteride, 1 mg per day orally, is approved to treat androgenetic alopecia in men for whom topical minoxidil has been ineffective. Adverse effects of finasteride include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia. 11 Treatment may be repeated every four to six weeks until resolution or for a maximum of six months.

Local adverse effects include transient atrophy and telangiectasia. Other therapies for the treatment of alopecia areata include topical mid- to high-potency corticosteroids, minoxidil, anthralin, immunotherapy, and systemic corticosteroids. 12 Currently available therapies often yield unsatisfactory results, and some clinicians rely on the high rate of spontaneous remission or recommend a hairpiece or wig if remission does not occur.
13. TELOGEN EFFLUVIUM Telogen effluvium is a nonscarring, noninflammatory alopecia of relatively sudden onset, with similar incidences between sexes and age groups. It occurs when large numbers of hairs enter the telogen phase and fall out three to five months after a physiologic or emotional stressor. The list of inciting factors is extensive and includes severe chronic illnesses, pregnancy, surgery, high fever, malnutrition, severe infections, and endocrine disorders.

Causative medications include retinoids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, and antithyroid medications; discontinuation of oral contraceptive agents is another possible cause. 17 Patients with telogen effluvium may have symptoms of an underlying condition, but are often asymptomatic. They often notice clumps of hair coming out in the shower or in their hairbrush. They should be asked to recall any potential trigger two to five months before the onset of the condition. Examination of the scalp in patients with telogen effluvium typically shows uniform hair thinning. The presence of erythema, scaling, or inflammation; altered or uneven hair distribution; or changes in shaft caliber, length, shape, or fragility may suggest other diagnoses. Laboratory investigations are indicated if the history and physical examination findings suggest underlying systemic disorders.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities [^ac6610f5]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common reproductive and metabolic disorder resulting from polygenic and environmental influences. Key pathological changes include neuroendocrine dysregulation, excess production of androgens, insulin resistance, and changes in adipose tissue biology, with variation in dysfunction of these pathways contributing to differences in phenotypic expression and severity of the disease. Advances in genetic understanding, together with new techniques to assess the steroid metabolome, have identified new biological targets, challenged the perception of polycystic ovary syndrome as one entity, and could facilitate an individualised approach to long term cardiometabolic surveillance based on the metabolomic signature. These advances could, for the first time, enable the development of specific drug treatments for the disorder based on an improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Well designed, multicentre, patient centred clinical trials of neurokinin receptor antagonists, kisspeptin based treatments, and repurposed antidiabetic drugs are now needed to investigate new therapeutic options for polycystic ovary syndrome.

Questions for future research

Should polycystic ovary syndrome be classified based on the steroid metabolomic signature, and specific treatments developed accordingly?
Does the steroid metabolome predict which patients are at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease?
Can reduction of 11-oxygenated androgens (eg, by inhibition of aldo-keto reductase type 1C3 (AKR1C3)) improve metabolic risk in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome?
Can later phase clinical trials of neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists show improvements in clinical hyperandrogenism and reproductive outcomes?
