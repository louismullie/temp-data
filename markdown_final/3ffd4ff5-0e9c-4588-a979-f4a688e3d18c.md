## Question

What are the typical features of a right hemispheric stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical features of right hemispheric stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and how it contrasts with left hemisphere stroke. Then, I should verify the most prevalent deficits (especially spatial neglect) and their subtypes. Next, I will review awareness disorders (anosognosia, body ownership), followed by oculomotor and vestibular signs, neuropsychiatric manifestations, attention/executive deficits, and known assessment biases that affect prognosis and treatment. Finally, I will synthesize outcomes and a succinct clinical summary, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and double-checking points that might be overgeneralized or sample-bound estimates.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Right hemisphere stroke typically disrupts spatial cognition, attention, and awareness more than language, producing a syndrome centered on hemispatial neglect and related attentional-executive impairments, whereas left hemisphere stroke more often yields aphasia; this reflects fundamental hemispheric asymmetries relevant to bedside diagnosis and rehabilitation planning [^114JpSVv] [^113sS4pk]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — the expression is variable and depends on lesion topography and network disconnection, so I should anchor prevalence and severity claims to studies using sensitive behavioral measures rather than single paper-and-pencil tests [^113zsVaf] [^11297YWZ].

> I will now examine core contralesional motor-sensory deficits. Left hemiparesis and hemisensory loss are expected, but wait, let me verify how impaired proprioception shapes awareness; in right hemisphere stroke, proprioceptive loss is a major determinant of anosognosia in the hyperacute phase, with visuospatial neglect contributing more in the subacute period, indicating multi-determined unawareness of deficit [^114wgmW1]. I need to check for motor neglect as well — underuse of the left limb not explained by primary weakness can arise from right putaminal and motor association cortex injury, implicating disrupted inhibition of ipsilesional motor programs during contralesional movement planning [^113c24ZX].

> Next, I should review visual field defects and their relationship to attentional syndromes. Initially, I was going to say that left hemianopia or quadrantanopia is common at a rate of 3–5%, but wait, I should double-check — those figures reflected small sample counts in extinction cohorts rather than population prevalence; the key point is that extinction and neglect are typically assessed after accounting for field cuts, and extinction can be quantified even when unilateral detection is intact, so I must avoid overinterpreting raw percentages from selected samples [^113HZvkp] [^111SnDDG]. Let me reconsider: visual field loss can co-occur and compound spatial deficits, but extinction and neglect are dissociable phenomena with partially distinct substrates, so conflating them would be misleading [^117NiC5c].

> Now, I need to characterize the spatial cognitive syndrome. Hemispatial neglect is the most prevalent feature when measured with sensitive, ecologically valid tools; in a 742-patient right hemisphere stroke rehabilitation cohort, 86% had neglect on the Catherine Bergego Scale, and moderate–severe neglect predicted poorer functional gains and lower community discharge rates, underscoring the clinical impact in daily activities [^11297YWZ]. I should confirm subtypes and neural correlates: viewer-centered neglect relates to angular gyrus hypoperfusion, while stimulus-centered neglect aligns with superior temporal cortex involvement — lesion perfusion studies support this dissociation and highlight that severity depends on both location and hypoperfusion burden [^114t7Xmy]. Age amplifies both frequency and severity of neglect even after adjusting for infarct volume and NIHSS, which I need to account for when counseling families about recovery prospects [^115uxUsy].

> Let me check visual extinction carefully. Extinction occurs frequently after right hemisphere stroke, at rates comparable to neglect in some series, and can double dissociate from neglect; lesion-symptom mapping ties extinction most strongly to right inferior parietal cortex, whereas neglect engages broader dorsal frontoparietal systems, consistent with a more focal attentional competition deficit versus network-level disengagement failures [^111FpGVc] [^117NiC5c]. I should confirm with independent analyses that extinction paradigms carefully control for field cuts and bilateral competition, which the multivariate and Bayesian lesion studies did using stringent uni- versus bilateral stimulation protocols [^113HZvkp] [^111SnDDG].

> I will now examine spatial working memory. Neglect entails reduced spatial working memory capacity beyond mere leftward encoding failures; when vertical stimuli and non-motor responses are used to minimize encoding and motor confounds, neglect patients still show a true capacity reduction, indicating a domain-specific working memory deficit that likely worsens functional navigation and search behaviors [^111JiKp4]. Hold on, I should verify that these procedures dissociate maintenance from selection — yes, probe-based tasks without ordered reproduction support a maintenance deficit account in a subset of patients [^111JiKp4].

> Next, I should review awareness and embodiment disorders. Anosognosia for hemiplegia is most frequent hyperacutely (about one-third), declines subacutely, and becomes uncommon chronically; it correlates early with proprioceptive loss, later with visuospatial disorientation and neglect, supporting a shift in determinants over time that the bedside examiner should reassess at each phase [^114wgmW1]. Disturbances in body ownership and agency, including somatoparaphrenia-like phenomena, often reflect subcortical-cortical network disconnection, with converging evidence for roles of thalamus, basal ganglia, and insula within frontoparietal circuits, highlighting the need to consider subcortical lesions rather than attributing everything to cortical hubs alone [^117J5KgR] [^112QvTgL].

> I need to check oculomotor and vestibular features next. Conjugate eye deviation toward the right is more frequent and persistent after right hemisphere stroke and associates with larger infarcts and frontal involvement, dovetailing with spatial attention and gaze control networks; this sign is clinically useful acutely and often coexists with neglect [^1139MTM9] [^1176qoPe]. Vestibular symptoms such as dizziness or subjective visual vertical tilts can occur with right insular and parietal opercular involvement, sometimes clustering with neglect and anosognosia; pusher behavior and three-dimensional spatial orientation disturbances have also been linked to right insular participation within multisensory vestibular networks [^114nNjjc] [^112QvTgL].

> Let me consider neuropsychiatric manifestations with right lateralization. Post-stroke psychosis and delusions are overrepresented after right hemisphere lesions, including right inferior frontal and broader fronto-parietal-temporal networks, with premorbid psychiatric vulnerability increasing risk; lesion overlap and network mapping implicate right IFG and belief/familiarity network decoupling in persistent psychosis, so I should screen proactively in at-risk patients [^112TQy7j] [^113nwubd]. Spatial delusions such as reduplicative paramnesia are particularly characteristic of right hemisphere stroke; most patients mislocalize places closer to home, and the duration correlates with structural–functional decoupling of belief-associated networks, emphasizing a network-level pathophysiology rather than a single node lesion [^113oUPQg] [^116ZgmpY].

> Next, I should review attention and executive control more broadly. Right brain–damaged patients, with and without neglect, exhibit non-lateralized attentional impairments alongside lateralized spatial deficits, while executive dysfunction in set-shifting and inhibition commonly complicates rehabilitation engagement, aligning with broader cognitive morbidity after stroke that requires targeted screening and therapy planning [^115Dkkuf] [^113sS4pk]. Wait, I should confirm that non-spatial attentional deficits persist beyond the acute window; longitudinal observations indicate partial recovery of spatial attention in fewer than half, with persistent non-spatial deficits contributing to functional limitations, which guides outpatient follow-up priorities [^115Dkkuf].

> I need to ensure we address measurement bias and its clinical consequences. The NIHSS undervalues right hemisphere deficits by awarding many more points for language than for neglect, leading to underestimation of lesion volume and risk; right hemisphere strokes show higher post-thrombolysis parenchymal hematoma risk at similar NIHSS scores, and modifying neglect scoring improves lesion volume prediction, so clinicians should interpret NIHSS cautiously and consider augmented neglect scoring or ancillary metrics [^117Qfhto] [^117GVzVU] [^115E4SJp]. Hold on, I should verify system-level recognition biases too; right hemisphere strokes are underrepresented among hospitalized cohorts, likely due to subtler symptom recognition and delayed presentation, which has implications for triage and reperfusion eligibility [^1119CWjV] [^1123TC6Z].

> Next, I should review prognostic and functional outcomes. Moderate-to-severe neglect predicts reduced daily functional gains and lower community discharge, and although partial spontaneous recovery of neglect occurs, chronic residual deficits are common and negatively influence contralesional motor recovery trajectories, necessitating early, tailored neglect rehabilitation strategies and realistic counseling [^11297YWZ] [^115Dkkuf]. I should confirm cognitive screening practices; in cohorts with severe left-hemisphere aphasia bias, cognitive follow-up in right hemisphere stroke often uses the MMSE to capture visuospatial and attention domains, though this tool is limited and should be complemented by neglect-specific assessments where feasible [^111SJ24N] [^113zsVaf].

> Finally, let me synthesize the right hemisphere stroke phenotype while I double-check that each element is reference-supported. Cardinal features include left-sided sensorimotor deficits often accompanied by impaired awareness, high-prevalence hemispatial neglect with egocentric and allocentric subtypes, frequent visual extinction, rightward gaze deviation, vestibular and verticality disturbances, body ownership disruptions, right-lateralized neuropsychiatric syndromes including spatial delusions, non-spatial attention and executive deficits, and systematic underestimation by standard severity scales with age-related exacerbation and prognostic implications; this constellation reflects right-hemisphere specialization for spatial attention, multisensory integration, and self-related processing and mandates sensitive, behaviorally anchored assessments such as the CBS to guide targeted rehabilitation [^114t7Xmy] [^117NiC5c] [^1176qoPe] [^112QvTgL] [^11297YWZ] [^115uxUsy] [^117Qfhto].

Right hemispheric stroke typically presents with **left-sided hemineglect** [^11297YWZ] and **anosognosia for hemiplegia** [^114wgmW1], often with left visual field deficits, left hemiparesis, and left hemisensory loss. Patients may show **conjugate eye deviation to the right** [^1139MTM9] [^1176qoPe], impaired spatial orientation [^112QvTgL], constructional/apraxic errors [^113sS4pk], and prosopagnosia [^114JpSVv]. Right hemisphere strokes are frequently under-recognized [^1119CWjV], leading to delayed treatment and worse outcomes.

## Cognitive and perceptual deficits

### Hemispatial neglect

- **Definition**: Failure to attend to the left side of space or body.
- **Prevalence**: 86% in right hemisphere stroke [^11297YWZ]; severity predicts poorer functional outcomes.
- **Types**: Egocentric (viewer-centered) and allocentric (stimulus-centered) neglect [^114t7Xmy].
- **Associated regions**: Right inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal cortex, posterior frontal cortex [^114t7Xmy].

---

### Anosognosia

- **Definition**: Unawareness or denial of deficits, especially hemiplegia.
- **Prevalence**: 32% hyperacute, 18% subacute, 5% chronic [^114wgmW1].
- **Associated regions**: Right inferior parietal lobule, insula, subcortical structures (thalamus, basal ganglia) [^117J5KgR].

---

### Visual extinction

- **Definition**: Failure to perceive left stimuli when presented bilaterally.
- **Prevalence**: 24.3% [^111FpGVc] in right hemisphere stroke.
- **Associated regions**: Right inferior parietal cortex [^117NiC5c].

---

### Spatial disorientation and navigational deficits

Spatial disorientation and navigational deficits involve **impaired spatial orientation and navigation**. These impairments are associated with the right posterior hippocampus [^113s49rg] and parietal cortex.

---

### Constructional and dressing apraxia

Constructional and dressing apraxia involve **difficulty with spatial tasks and dressing**. They are linked to the right parietal and frontal lobes [^113sS4pk] [^114JpSVv].

---

### Prosopagnosia

Prosopagnosia is **impaired recognition of familiar faces**. It localizes to the right fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital cortex.

---

## Motor and sensory deficits

### Left hemiparesis and hemisensory loss

Left hemiparesis and hemisensory loss describe **weakness and sensory loss on the left**. These deficits arise from involvement of the right motor and sensory cortices, internal capsule, and thalamus.

---

### Conjugate eye deviation

Conjugate eye deviation is characterized by **rightward gaze deviation** [^1139MTM9]. It is associated with the right frontal eye fields and temporoparietal cortex [^1176qoPe].

---

### Motor neglect

Motor neglect denotes **underuse of the left limb** that is not explained by weakness. It is associated with the right putamen and motor association areas [^113c24ZX].

---

## Emotional and behavioral changes

### Emotional lability and flat affect

Emotional lability and flat affect present as **emotional instability** or a blunted affect. These changes are linked to involvement of the right frontal and temporal lobes [^114JpSVv].

---

### Impulsivity and disinhibition

Impulsivity and disinhibition present as **inappropriate behavior and poor impulse control**. They are associated with right frontal lobe dysfunction [^113sS4pk].

---

### Depression and anxiety

Depression and anxiety are **mood disturbances** after stroke. They are associated with right frontal and temporal lobe involvement.

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Diagnostic challenges

Diagnostic challenges include **under-recognition**, as neglect and anosognosia lead to delayed presentation and treatment [^1119CWjV] [^1123TC6Z]. The NIHSS also underestimates right hemisphere deficits [^117Qfhto], leading to underestimation of severity [^117GVzVU] [^115E4SJp].

---

### Rehabilitation strategies

Rehabilitation employs a **multidisciplinary approach** with occupational, physical, and speech therapy [^113sS4pk]. Neglect-specific interventions include visual scanning, prism adaptation, and optokinetic stimulation. Management of anosognosia emphasizes education, safety training, and caregiver involvement.

---

### Prognosis

Prognosis is influenced by neglect and anosognosia, which predict **poorer recovery and higher dependency** [^11297YWZ] [^115uxUsy]. Although partial improvement occurs over time, persistent deficits are common [^115Dkkuf].

---

Right hemispheric stroke features include **left-sided neglect**, anosognosia, visual extinction, spatial disorientation, constructional and dressing apraxia, prosopagnosia, left hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, conjugate eye deviation, motor neglect, emotional lability, impulsivity, and mood disturbances. These deficits are linked to specific right hemisphere regions and require **targeted assessment and rehabilitation** [^114JpSVv] [^113sS4pk].

### How we assess spatial neglect matters: Prevalence of spatial neglect as measured by the Catherine Bergego Scale and impact on rehabilitation outcomes [^11297YWZ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and functional impact of unilateral spatial neglect on right hemisphere stroke patients in an inpatient rehabilitation facility using a multidimensional, functionally based behavioral measure (Catherine Bergego Scale [CBS]).

This was a retrospective cohort study of 742 consecutive admissions of patients with right hemispheric stroke to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Spatial neglect was assessed using the CBS. Functional impact of neglect was measured by hospital length of stay, Functional Independence Measure change per day, discharge destination, and number of falls.

As measured by the CBS, 86% of the right hemisphere stroke patients had symptoms of spatial neglect. Moderate and severe neglect was associated with less Functional Independence Measure change per day and lower rates of community discharge. The presence of neglect was not significantly associated with fall rate or length of hospital stay after controlling for admission Functional Independence Measure scores and age. The "difficulty looking left" CBS item had the strongest relationship with total CBS scores and effectively predicted Functional Independence Measure change per day and discharge destination.

Using a sensitive measure, the CBS, rates of spatial neglect are extremely high in right hemisphere stroke patients entering inpatient rehabilitation. Both identification and determination of neglect severity are extremely important given their significant relationship to rehabilitation outcomes and discharge.

### Hemispheric asymmetry of gaze deviation and relationship to neglect in acute stroke [^1139MTM9]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Using data from the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), the authors studied the anatomy of gaze deviation (GD) after stroke and its co-occurrence with neglect. GD was more frequent and persistent after right hemisphere damage. GD was most common with lesions involving the frontal lobes, although rates with lesions restricted to other hemispheric regions were not significantly different. There was no difference in its rate of co-occurrence with neglect between right- and nonright-handed patients.

### Cognitive deficits after stroke [^113sS4pk]. Stroke (2023). Low credibility.

Cognition is a central feature of human existence and brain function. Cognitive deficits are common after stroke and may strongly impact functional outcomes. Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of cognitive functions in the healthy state, and this new body of knowledge promises to open new avenues for understanding and treating post-stroke impairments, including cognitive deficits. The five reviews in this Focused Update from an international cast of experts provide excellent updates on cognitive syndromes that commonly contribute to post-stroke disability: neglect, aphasia, apraxia, loss of executive function, and memory disorders.

Cognitive impairment remains a major source of morbidity after stroke; these reviews approach this problem by considering clinical presentations, pathophysiology, measurement tools, and treatment approaches. In doing so, they highlight a number of key questions and critical gaps. A number of issues emerge as common across cognitive domains post-stroke and are summarized herein. There is a need for improved methods to measure cognitive impairments, as well as improved insights into the pathophysiology of symptom onset and mechanisms of recovery after stroke, including validated biomarkers. These five state-of-the-art summaries are sure to prove useful toward these goals.

### Anosognosia for hemiplegia: a clinical-anatomical prospective study [^114wgmW1]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Anosognosia for hemiplegia is a common and striking disorder following stroke. Because it is typically transient and variable, it remains poorly understood and has rarely been investigated systematically at different times. Our study evaluated a prospective cohort of 58 patients with right-hemisphere stroke and significant motor deficit of the left hemibody, who were examined using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at 3 days (hyperacute), 1 week (subacute), and 6 months (chronic) after stroke onset. Anosognosia for hemiplegia was frequent in the hyperacute phase (32%), but reduced by almost half 1 week later (18%) and was only rarely seen at 6 months (5%).

Anosognosia for hemiplegia was correlated with the severity of several other deficits, most notably losses in proprioception, extrapersonal spatial neglect, and disorientation. While multiple regression analyses highlighted proprioceptive loss as the most determinant factor for the hyperacute period, visuospatial neglect and disorientation were more determinant for the subacute phase. Patients with both proprioceptive loss and neglect had a significantly higher incidence of anosognosia for hemiplegia than those with only one deficit or no deficits, although a few double dissociations were observed.

Personal neglect and frontal lobe tests showed no significant relation with anosognosia for hemiplegia, nor did psychological traits such as optimism and mood. Moreover, anosognosia for neglect and prediction of performance in non-motor tasks were unrelated to anosognosia for hemiplegia, suggesting distinct monitoring processes.

### Difference in recognition of right and left hemispheric stroke [^1119CWjV]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cerebrovascular events vary depending on the hemisphere where the lesion occurs, influencing disease recognition and management. We aimed to determine whether left and right hemispheric strokes are unequally distributed among inpatients. Data were obtained from a large hospital-based stroke registry in Germany. This registry included 11,328 patients (56%) with left hemispheric events and 8,769 (44%) with right-sided lesions (p < 0.0001).

- **Factors associated with left hemispheric stroke**: Age, stroke severity, and time from symptom onset to admission were significantly linked to left hemispheric stroke. This may suggest a selection effect.

- **Challenges in stroke management**: Difficulties in recognizing symptoms due to right hemispheric stroke hinder efforts to optimize stroke management, particularly in the critical early hours following a stroke.

### Mentalizing the body: Spatial and social cognition in anosognosia for hemiplegia [^11299Ev2]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia following a right-hemisphere stroke deny the existence of contralesional motor deficits. Besharati et al. show that such patients are impaired in social cognition tasks requiring third-person perspective-taking. A reduced ability to disengage from the first-person perspective may explain the patients' reduced bodily self-awareness.

### Predictors of cognitive level and depression severity are different in patients with left and right hemispheric stroke within the first year of illness [^115sMiSP]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Causes of cognitive impairment after stroke are not yet clear because a large number of sociodemographic and clinical variables complicate the understanding of the phenomenon. We aim to evaluate sociodemographic and clinical predictors of cognitive level and depression in subjects with different lesion laterality. We assessed 153 right (n = 87) and left (n = 66) unilateral first-ever stroke patients within the first year of illness using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Patient Edition, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Barthel Index, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Sociodemographic variables were also measured. Sixty-two (41%) patients suffered from Major Depression (MDD), and 26 (17%) suffered from Minor Depression (MIND). An univariate analysis of variance showed that MMSE scores differed throughout the groups of left and right stroke patients with MDD, MIND, and without depression. Left stroke patients with MDD were more cognitively impaired than all the other groups, and this was valid after controlling for the effect of lesion location on cognitive level differences between the groups. A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that depression severity was a predictor of cognitive level and vice-versa in left hemispheric stroke patients only. Moreover, educational level in right hemispheric stroke patients, as well as state-anger and the number of regions affected in left hemispheric stroke patients, were other predictors of cognitive level.

### Crossed right hemisphere syndrome following left thalamic stroke [^1156dV5T]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

In most right-handed people, language and motor functions rely more on the systems of the left hemisphere, while several non-linguistic visuo-spatial and attentional processes depend more on the right hemisphere. The rare exceptions to these rules provide important clues as to what functions co-lateralize and are thus crucial for models of cerebral specialization.

Here, we report on the case of a patient who, following a lesion restricted to the left thalamic region, showed signs normally associated with right hemispheric injury, including motor impersistence, visuo-spatial dysfunction, and poor comprehension of facial expression. Language abilities were spared, and no signs of apraxia were present, despite his right hand, foot, and eye preference — a pattern normally associated with conventional cerebral dominance.

Despite his other right hemispheric signs, the patient showed no signs of hemi-spatial neglect. The patient's pattern of spared and impaired abilities is compared and contrasted with other rare cases of crossed right hemisphere syndrome.

### The role of the right inferior frontal gyrus in the pathogenesis of post-stroke psychosis [^113nwubd]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Psychosis is a syndrome involving one or more of delusional beliefs, hallucinations, and thought disorder. Psychotic symptoms have been consistently noted in the context of neurodegenerative disease and focal cerebral lesions, particularly those affecting the right cerebral hemisphere. Post-stroke delusions have often been reported in the context of abnormal bodily perception, such as somatoparaphrenia or anosognosia, but behavior more characteristic of psychotic disorders has also been described, albeit infrequently.

At the time of writing, there has been no clear association of a specific neuroanatomical locus with psychotic symptoms, although delusions have been reported following strokes affecting the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as subcortical structures. To our knowledge, there has been no use of lesion overlap analysis with a standardized MRI-based template to identify a common region of damage in a group of patients with persistent symptoms. Furthermore, no previous reports have indicated why only a small proportion of right hemisphere strokes cause delusions, although it has been suggested that pre-existing cerebral atrophy may play a role.

Here we describe three individuals with a history of psychiatric disorder, but without previous hallucinations or delusions, who had right hemisphere strokes causing persistent delusions unrelated to body awareness or anosognosia. We conducted a lesion overlap analysis in order to identify specific brain loci involved in the generation of psychosis.

### Lesioned hemisphere-specific phenotypes of post-stroke fatigue emerge from motor and mood characteristics in chronic stroke [^113Fbt2C]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Post-stroke fatigue is a significant and highly prevalent symptom in chronic stroke. Although commonly seen alongside other post-stroke disturbances such as depression, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and motor impairment, fatigue is an independent symptom and is poorly understood.

An extensive body of literature is dedicated to studying the relationship between fatigue, lesion location, impairment, and mood disorders. Fatigue incidence is greater when the lesion includes the thalamus, when there is significant depression and anxiety, and sometimes in the presence of physical and cognitive impairment. However, it is still unclear how these different factors interact and, in combination, explain fatigue incidence and severity. For example, in some chronic stroke survivors, fatigue can emerge in the absence of physical, cognitive, or mood deficits, while in others it occurs in the presence of one or more deficits. It is critically important to identify the contexts — i.e. the combination of factors that co-present with fatigue — and establish if there are certain contexts more conducive to fatigue. This need for understanding is highlighted in intervention studies that show responsiveness to treatment is dependent on the context (phenotype) of fatigue. In this study, we aimed to identify fatigue phenotypes based on factors related to post-stroke fatigue.

Low motor cortical excitability of the stroke-lesioned hemisphere is seen in high post-stroke fatigue and was included as the neural correlate of fatigue for phenotyping.

### Evolution of neuropsychological deficits in first-ever isolated ischemic thalamic stroke and their association with stroke topography: A case-control study [^115FGmtY]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, most studies retrospectively assessed cognitive deficits in smaller cohorts or case reports, and the majority of them used chronic stroke patients without matched control subjects. Longitudinal studies comparing neuropsychological deficits of patients with thalamic stroke with age- and sex-matched control subjects at predefined time points with a standardized comprehensive neuropsychological test battery were lacking.

Whereas our longitudinal design with 24 months follow-up allows for the assessment of long-term stroke recovery, we were able to track the complete cohort of 37 patients only for 12 months. A total of 8 patients were missing at the 24-month follow-up (5 refused participation, 2 had reinfarcts, 1 died). This could lead to systematic bias in the patient evaluation at the 24-month time point. The 8 patients lost to follow-up, however, did not statistically differ in age, sex, and each of the cognitive domains before their dropout from patients who completed the 24-month follow-up.

We did not perform any systematic assessment of prestroke cognitive performance in patients with thalamic stroke. Yet, in the detailed patient interview upon admission, neither the patients nor accompanying relatives nor previous medical records reported prestroke cognitive deficits. The 3 thalamic stroke topographies evaluated in our study had different age, sex, and vascular risk profiles: patients with paramedian thalamic stroke were younger, more often female, and healthier than anterior and inferolateral thalamic stroke patients.

### Postthrombolysis hemorrhage risk is affected by stroke assessment bias between hemispheres [^117Qfhto]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Stroke symptoms in right hemispheric stroke tend to be underestimated in clinical assessment scales, resulting in greater infarct volumes in right as compared to left hemispheric strokes despite similar clinical stroke severity. We hypothesized that patients with right hemispheric nonlacunar stroke are at higher risk for secondary intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis despite similar stroke severity.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data of two stroke cohorts with CT-based and MRI-based imaging before thrombolysis. Initial stroke severity was measured with the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Lacunar strokes were excluded through either the presence of cortical symptoms (CT cohort) or restriction to patients with prestroke diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion size greater than 3.75 mL (MRI cohort). Probabilities of having a parenchymal hematoma were determined using multivariate logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 392 patients in the CT cohort and 400 patients in the MRI cohort were evaluated. Although NIHSS scores were similar in strokes of both hemispheres (median NIHSS: CT: 15 vs. 13, MRI: 14 vs. 16), the frequencies of parenchymal hematoma were higher in right hemispheric compared to left hemispheric strokes (CT: 12.4% vs. 5.7%, MRI: 10.4% vs. 6.8%). After adjustment for potential confounders (but not pretreatment lesion volume), the probability of parenchymal hematoma was higher in right hemispheric nonlacunar strokes (CT: odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–4.89; p = 0.032) and showed a borderline significant effect in the MRI cohort (OR 2.1; 95% CI 0.98–4.49).

### The neuroanatomy of visual extinction following right hemisphere brain damage: insights from multivariate and Bayesian lesion analyses in acute stroke [^113HZvkp]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Low credibility.

Visual extinction was assessed with a variation of the clinical confrontation technique, where the patient was required to detect a movement of the examiner's left and/or right index finger presented in the patient's left and/or right visual field. Each patient was presented with 10 unilateral left, 10 unilateral right, and 10 bilateral movements. If a patient displayed a visual field defect, care was taken to present the movements in the intact part of the visual field.

In patients with lower or upper left visual field quadrantanopia (n = 3), movements were presented in the intact upper or lower visual field, respectively. In patients with left visual field hemianopia (n = 5), movements were presented in the near and/or far periphery of the intact ipsilesional visual field. An extinction score was calculated as the percentage of bilateral trials in which the patient failed to detect the contralesional movement. The percentage of correct detection of contralesional movements during unilateral stimulation and ipsilesional movements was not recorded during the neuropsychological assessment for visual extinction. However, the extinction assessment protocol stipulated that any patient who correctly detected less than 90% of the contralesional movements during unilateral stimulation was classified as "not assessable", and these patients were excluded from the study. Moreover, trials in which the patient did not respond to the ipsilesional movement were excluded, and in those instances, a check was performed to ensure the patient understood the task.

As such, all patients in the study were assessed with the established protocol to ensure the integrity of the results.

### Right hemisphere structural adaptation and changing language skills years after left hemisphere stroke [^114W3PgZ]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Stroke survivors with acquired language deficits are commonly thought to reach a 'plateau' within a year of stroke onset, after which their residual language skills will remain stable. Nevertheless, there have been reports of patients who appear to recover over years. Here, we analyzed longitudinal changes in 28 left-hemisphere stroke patients, each more than a year post-stroke when first assessed. We tested each patient's spoken object naming skills and acquired structural brain scans twice. Some patients appeared to improve over time, while others declined. Both directions of change were associated with, and predictable given, structural adaptation in the intact right hemisphere of the brain. Contrary to the prevailing view that these patients' language skills are stable, these results imply that real changes continue over years.

The strongest brain-behavior associations (the 'peak clusters') were in the anterior temporal lobe and the precentral gyrus. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we confirmed that both regions are actively involved when neurologically normal control subjects name visually presented objects; however, neither appeared to be involved when the same participants used a finger press to make semantic association decisions on the same stimuli. This suggests that these regions serve word-retrieval or articulatory functions in the undamaged brain. We teased these interpretations apart by reference to change in other tasks. Consistent with the claim that the real change is occurring here, change in spoken object naming was correlated with change in t…

### Lesioned hemisphere-specific phenotypes of post-stroke fatigue emerge from motor and mood characteristics in chronic stroke [^111bXG6j]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The emergence of four distinguishable clusters in mild to moderately impaired chronic stroke survivors shows, for the first time, that it is possible to categorize high fatigue into smaller non-overlapping groups. In other disorders which present with complex behavioral profiles, such as autism spectrum disorder and psychosis, phenotyping has been useful in identifying the underlying pathophysiology and in developing phenotype-specific interventions. Here, we propose that phenotyping post-stroke fatigue serves a similar purpose by helping define the characteristics of high fatigue groups, and this aligns with recommendations for post-stroke fatigue research.

The difference in the hemisphere affected, accompanied by differences in function and mood in the different clusters of high fatigue, is a novel finding of this study. The relationship between post-stroke fatigue, impairment, and mood has been previously investigated. However, the results have been conflicting, with some showing no relationship between fatigue and impairment and others revealing more nuanced interactions; for example, controlling for gender allowed significant relationships with impairment and mood to emerge. In some studies where impairment was not included, mood appeared to be the main driver of post-stroke fatigue. While most previous investigations have included stroke hemisphere as a factor of interest, they all failed to reveal a role of stroke side in fatigue, possibly because patients with strokes of either hemisphere are equally likely to develop high fatigue, as shown by equal overall numbers.

### Spatial orienting by left hemisphere language areas: a relict from the past [^115PbyE5]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

During evolution, the human brain developed remarkable functional differences between left and right hemispheres. Due to this lateralization, disorders of spatial orienting occur predominantly after right brain damage and disorders of language after left brain damage. In contrast to this general pattern, few individuals show disturbed spatial orienting (spatial neglect) after left brain damage. Using a voxel-based lesion analysis approach, we found that neglect after acute left brain damage is represented in areas typically serving language functions, namely the superior and middle temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, and insula. Since all except one of these patients also suffered from aphasia, we conclude that lateralization is not just reversed but that both functions (language and spatial orienting) are rather represented in the same left hemisphere regions. We speculate that a representation of spatial orienting in left hemisphere language areas might be a phylogenetic relict in humans, though this representation stays subdominant in the vast majority of individuals.

### Subcortical contributions to the sense of body ownership [^117J5KgR]. Brain (2024). High credibility.

Disturbances in bodily awareness can offer important insights into the processes underlying the development of a sense of body ownership. Right-hemisphere stroke can result in disorders of self-awareness, such as disturbances of body ownership or disturbances of body agency, as well as anosognosia for hemiplegia, defined as the unawareness of sensorimotor deficits following stroke. Anosognosia for hemiplegia has been linked to distortions in the sense of body ownership.

Traditionally, there has been a relatively strong focus on cortical functions in the neuropsychological literature on disorders of body ownership. For example, subcortical lesions damaging white matter tracts have often been interpreted as interrupting cortical functions of the areas connected by the damaged anatomical pathways (e.g. frontoparietal connections). Still, there is a growing interest in the involvement of subcortical structures themselves and their connections to cortical areas.

Lesions caused by subcortical strokes are typically relatively large and involve damage to multiple cortical and subcortical regions as well as cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical white matter connections. Noteworthy is an examination of 85 patients with anosognosia following right-hemisphere stroke, which showed the involvement of subcortical damage. The areas implicated include the thalamus, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata, insula, lateral ventricles, and amygdala. In particular, lesions of the basal ganglia and thalamus were most likely to account for una…

### Severity of hypoperfusion in distinct brain regions predicts severity of hemispatial neglect in different reference frames [^114t7Xmy]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Hemispatial neglect is among the most common and disabling consequences of right hemisphere stroke. A variety of variables have been associated with the presence or severity of neglect; however, the independent effects of location, severity, and volume of ischemia have not been fully evaluated. Few studies have determined the areas involved in different types of neglect. This study identified the contributions of these variables to the severity of viewer-centered versus stimulus-centered neglect in acute ischemic right hemisphere stroke.

We studied 137 patients within 24 hours of stroke onset using MR diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, alongside a test of hemispatial neglect that distinguishes between viewer-centered and stimulus-centered neglect. Using multivariable linear regression, we identified the independent contributions of the severity of ischemia in specific locations, volume of ischemia, and age in accounting for the severity of each neglect type.

- **Results**: Severity of hypoperfusion in the angular gyrus was the only variable that significantly and independently contributed to the severity of viewer-centered neglect. Volume of dysfunctional tissue and hypoperfusion in the posterior frontal cortex also accounted for some variability in the severity of viewer-centered neglect. Severity of hypoperfusion in the superior temporal cortex was the only variable that independently and significantly contributed to the severity of stimulus-centered neglect.

- **Conclusions**: Location, severity, and volume of ischemia together determine the type and severity of neglect after right hemisphere stroke. Results also show that…

### Conjugate eye deviation in acute stroke: incidence, hemispheric asymmetry, and lesion pattern [^1176qoPe]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

The authors studied clinical features and lesion patterns associated with conjugate eye deviation (CED) in acute stroke. Consecutive patients with supratentorial stroke (< 6 hours after symptom onset) were prospectively recruited. CED was classified according to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) item "gaze palsy" as being forced, partial, or absent. Lesion patterns on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were analyzed in 46 patients using a normalization procedure for direct comparisons between patients, and perfusion data were analyzed for a subset of patients.

Partial CED was found in 7 (6%) and forced CED in 31 (26.7%) of 116 patients. Forced and partial CED were associated with higher initial NIHSS scores compared with patients without CED (16 and 10 versus 5; P < 0.05). DWI lesion volume was larger in patients with CED (103.24 ± 102.4 mL, mean ± SD) compared with patients without CED (17 ± 34.98 mL, P < 0.001). CED was more frequent in right hemispheric stroke (44.6% versus 23%, P < 0.02). DWI pattern analysis in patients with CED with right hemispheric stroke revealed a network of affected regions, including basal ganglia and temporoparietal cortex. In left hemispheric CED, lesions were larger than in patients without CED, but no consistent pattern could be established. In a subset of selected patients with CED, a small temporoparietal perfusion deficit was sufficient to elicit CED.

Selective dysfunction of cortical areas involved in spatial attention and control of eye movements is sufficient to cause CED.

### Clinical implications of brain asymmetries [^114JpSVv]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2024). High credibility.

No two human brains are alike, and with the rise of precision medicine in neurology, there is an increased emphasis on understanding the individual variability in brain structure and function that renders every brain unique. Functional and structural brain asymmetries are a fundamental principle of brain organization. Recent research suggests substantial individual variability in these asymmetries that needs to be considered in clinical practice.

In this review, we provide an overview of brain asymmetries, variations in such asymmetries, and their relevance in the clinical context. We explore recent findings on brain asymmetries in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as in specific learning disabilities, with an emphasis on large-scale database studies and meta-analyses. Additionally, we highlight the relevance of asymmetries for disease symptom onset in neurodegenerative diseases and their implications for lateralized treatments, including brain stimulation.

We conclude that while alterations in brain asymmetry are not sufficiently specific to act as diagnostic biomarkers, they can serve as meaningful symptom or treatment response biomarkers in certain contexts. Based on these insights, we provide several recommendations for neurological clinical practice.

### The importance of the insular cortex for vestibular and spatial syndromes [^112QvTgL]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to identify the neuroanatomical correlates and associations of neuropsychological syndromes after acute unilateral right-hemisphere brain lesions. The neuropsychological syndromes considered were orientation in three-dimensional space, such as tilts of the subjective visual vertical or of the subjective haptic vertical, pusher syndrome, visual neglect, and unawareness of paresis (anosognosia for hemiparesis). These neuropsychological phenomena have been found to occur separately or in different combinations after lesions to the right insular cortex.

- **Method**: Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 82 patients with acute right-hemispheric stroke. A lesion-behavior mapping analysis was conducted to specify the neuroanatomical correlates of the above-mentioned neuropsychological syndromes.

- **Results**: In all analyses of the individual neuropsychological syndromes, the insular cortex was affected.

- **Conclusions**: Thus, the insular cortex is involved in (self-)perception and orientation within a three-dimensional space. Since isolated lesions of the insular cortex did not induce the above neuropsychological phenomena, there have to be other regions involved.

### The neuroanatomy of visual extinction following right hemisphere brain damage: Insights from multivariate and Bayesian lesion analyses in acute stroke [^111SnDDG]. Human Brain Mapping (2024).

For a subset of 39 patients without visual field defects (mean age = 56.7 years, SD = 11.2; 15 females, mean time between stroke and testing 3.4 days, SD = 2.1, range 0–7 days), visual extinction was additionally assessed using a computerized test with time-critical target presentation that allowed measurement of performance during both unilateral and bilateral trials, and the calculation of a so-called "extinction index" (Vossel et al.). Each trial started with a central white fixation cross (0.6° × 0.6° visual angle) presented on a black background for a duration of 500 ms. Patients were instructed to continuously fixate this fixation cross.

This was followed by the presentation of a peripheral white target stimulus on the horizontal midline at an eccentricity of 10.0° visual angle for a duration of 180 ms. The target stimulus was a white geometrical shape (circle, square, triangle, or diamond; 1.5° × 1.5° visual angle), that was presented either unilaterally left, unilaterally right, or bilaterally. During bilateral presentations, the target stimuli were never identical. Patients were required to vocally report the location and shape of the target(s) presented (i.e. "circle left" or "diamond left and triangle right") while the neuropsychologist logged these vocal responses on a sheet of paper. Finally, after ensuring the patient was fixating on the central fixation cross, the next trial was initiated by the neuropsychologist with a keyboard response.

In a single session, patients were presented with 10 unilateral left, 10 unilateral right, and 10 bilateral trials.

### Sensitivity of clinical and behavioural tests of spatial neglect after right hemisphere stroke [^113zsVaf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The lack of agreement regarding assessment methods is responsible for the variability in the reported rate of occurrence of spatial neglect after stroke. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of different tests of neglect after right hemisphere stroke.

- **Methods**: Two hundred and six subacute right hemisphere stroke patients were given a test battery, including a preliminary assessment of anosognosia and of visual extinction, a clinical assessment of gaze orientation and personal neglect, and paper and pencil tests of spatial neglect in the peripersonal space. Patients were compared with a previously reported control group. A subgroup of patients (n = 69) received a behavioural assessment of neglect in daily life situations.

- **Results**: The most sensitive paper and pencil measure was the starting point in the cancellation task. The whole battery was more sensitive than any single test alone; about 85% of patients presented some degree of neglect on at least one measure. An important finding was that behavioural assessment of neglect in daily life was more sensitive than any other single measure of neglect. Behavioural neglect was considered moderate to severe in 36% of cases. A factorial analysis revealed that paper and pencil tests were related to two underlying factors. Dissociations were found between extrapersonal neglect, personal neglect, anosognosia, and extinction. Anatomical analyses showed that neglect was more common and severe when the posterior association cortex was damaged.

### Critical brain regions for action recognition: lesion symptom mapping in left hemisphere stroke [^114BKDco]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

A number of conflicting claims have been advanced regarding the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, and posterior middle temporal gyrus in action recognition, driven in part by an ongoing debate about the capacities of putative mirror systems that match observed and planned actions. We report data from 43 left hemisphere stroke patients in two action recognition tasks in which they heard and saw an action word ('hammering') and selected from two video clips the one corresponding to the word.

In the spatial recognition task, foils contained errors of body posture or movement amplitude/timing. In the semantic recognition task, foils were semantically related (sawing). Participants also performed a comprehension control task requiring matching of the same verbs to objects (hammer).

Using regression analyses controlling for both the comprehension control task and lesion volume, we demonstrated that performance in the semantic gesture recognition task was predicted by the percent damage to the posterior temporal lobe, whereas the spatial gesture recognition task was predicted by the percent damage to the inferior parietal lobule. A whole-brain voxel-based lesion symptom-mapping analysis suggested that the semantic and spatial gesture recognition tasks were associated with lesioned voxels in the posterior middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, respectively. The posterior middle temporal gyrus appears to serve as a central node in the association of actions and meanings. The inferior parietal lobule, held to be a homologue of the monkey parietal cortex, is critical for spatial aspects of gesture recognition.

### Task-induced brain activity in aphasic stroke patients: What is driving recovery [^117Damei]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

In the UK and the United States, the estimated prevalence of aphasia is 250,000 and 1,000,000, respectively. The most common aetiology is stroke. The impairment may improve with behavioural therapy, and trials using cortical stimulation or pharmacotherapy are undergoing proof-of-principle investigation with mixed results. Aphasia is a heterogeneous syndrome, and simple classifications according to the Broca-Wernicke-Lichtheim model inadequately describe the diverse communication difficulties with which patients may present. Greater knowledge of how intact neural networks promote recovery after aphasic stroke, either spontaneously or in response to interventions, will result in clearer hypotheses about how to improve the treatment of aphasia.

Twenty-five years ago, a pioneering study on healthy participants heralded the introduction of functional neuroimaging to the study of mechanisms of recovery from aphasia. Over the ensuing decades, such studies have been interpreted as supporting one of three hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive. The first two predate the introduction of functional neuroimaging: that recovery is the consequence of the reconstitution of domain-specific language systems in tissue around the lesion (the 'perilesional' hypothesis) or by homotopic cortex in the contralateral hemisphere (the 'laterality-shift' hypothesis). The third is that loss of transcallosal inhibition to contralateral homotopic cortex hinders recovery (the 'disinhibition' hypothesis).

These different hypotheses at times provide conflicting views about rehabilitative intervention.

### Right hemisphere language network plasticity in aphasia [^11775jKv]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

The role of the right hemisphere in aphasia recovery has been controversial since the 19th century. Imaging studies have sometimes found increased activation in right hemisphere regions homotopic to canonical left hemisphere language regions, but these results have been questioned due to small sample sizes, unreliable imaging tasks, and task performance confounds that affect right hemisphere activation levels even in neurologically healthy adults.

Several principles of right hemisphere language recruitment in aphasia have been proposed based on these studies: the right hemisphere is recruited primarily by individuals with severe left hemisphere damage; transcallosal disinhibition results in recruitment of right hemisphere regions homotopic to the lesion; and increased right hemisphere activation diminishes to baseline levels over time. It is debated whether engagement of language homotopes reflects upregulation of weakly active right hemisphere processors in a bihemispheric language network, versus recruitment of new processors into the network.

We address these issues in 76 chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors with ongoing or prior aphasia and 69 neurologically healthy older adults using a semantic decision fMRI paradigm that elicits reliable and strongly left-lateralized individual-participant language activation and adapts to require effortful performance irrespective of participant ability levels. Right hemisphere activation was greater in stroke survivors than controls, and related to younger age, left-handedness, and higher education.

### Pure representational neglect after right thalamic lesion [^117FfNs4]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

After a right thalamic stroke, an 86-year-old man presented with acute pure left representational neglect in the absence of any perceptual neglect. On spatial mental imagery tasks, the patient systematically omitted items located on his left side, but only when a vantage point was provided. This suggests that:

- **Pure representational neglect**: This is not just a residual finding after recovery from global (perceptual and representational) neglect.

- **Space representation**: It can be coded by two independent processes: in viewer-centered or world-based (allocentric) coordinates.

- **The right thalamus**: It serves as a relay in the processing of spatial visual imagery.

### Poststroke psychosis: A systematic review [^112TQy7j]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of patients were found to have right hemisphere lesions, in line with a large body of evidence suggesting that right hemisphere pathology is associated with a range of perceptual anomalies and pathologies of belief. The regions most affected included the right frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, as well as the right caudate nucleus. This supports findings from previous case series on poststroke psychosis and mirrors findings in psychosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is important to consider that left hemisphere strokes are more likely to result in language and communication problems, which may impede the assessment of psychosis, leading to an under-representation of these patients in the literature.

It is also worth noting that these findings are largely based on clinical radiological assessments. At the time of writing, we are aware of only two studies that have used voxel-based lesion mapping across patients with strokes to generate maps of common lesions associated with psychosis. Devine et al. examined lesion location in three patients with poststroke psychosis, finding that damage to the right inferior frontal gyrus and connecting white matter tracts were common across patients. More recently, Darby et al. used lesion network mapping in 17 stroke patients with misidentification delusions, identifying the left retrosplenial cortex as the only brain area functionally connected to all lesion sites, potentially highlighting its role in the etiology of poststroke psychosis. Additional studies using these more systematic approaches are clearly needed to better clarify how damage to specific brain areas contributes to poststroke psychosis.

### Contralesional motor deficits after unilateral stroke reflect hemisphere-specific control mechanisms [^114Uuu7Q]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

We have proposed a model of motor lateralization, in which the left and right hemispheres are specialized for different aspects of motor control: the left hemisphere for predicting and accounting for limb dynamics, and the right hemisphere for stabilizing limb position through impedance control mechanisms. Our previous studies, demonstrating different motor deficits in the ipsilesional arm of stroke patients with either left or right hemisphere damage, provided a critical test of our model. However, motor deficits following a stroke are most prominent on the contralesional side. Post-stroke rehabilitation has also naturally focused on improving contralesional arm impairment and function.

Understanding whether contralesional motor deficits differ depending on the hemisphere of damage is, therefore, of vital importance for assessing the impact of brain damage on function and for designing rehabilitation interventions specific to the laterality of damage. We asked whether motor deficits in the contralesional arm of unilateral stroke patients reflect hemisphere-dependent control mechanisms. Our model of lateralization predicts that contralesional deficits will differ depending on the hemisphere of damage; thus, this study also served as an essential assessment of our model.

Stroke patients with mild to moderate hemiparesis in either the left or right arm due to contralateral stroke and healthy control subjects performed targeted multi-joint reaching movements in different directions. As predicted, our results indicated a double dissociation, though left hemisphere dama…

### Strategies for feature extraction from structural brain imaging in lesion-deficit modelling [^113hgeJ6]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

Structural CT or MRI was obtained as part of clinical stroke protocols an average of 3.5 days (SD = 4.6) after stroke onset in the sample tested for spatial neglect and 2.1 days (SD = 2.7) in the sample tested for hemiparesis. For multiple available imaging sessions, scans were selected to be as acute as possible while clearly depicting lesion borders. For patients with MRI, areas of acute damage were visualized using diffusion-weighted imaging in the first 48 hours after stroke onset and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging later. If possible, these images were co-registered with a high-resolution T1 MRI to be used in the normalization process.

Lesions were delineated on axial slices of the scans semi-automatically using Clusterize or manually using MRIcron. Scans were warped into 1 × 1 × 1 mm³ MNI space using age-specific templates from the Clinical Toolbox and normalization algorithms in SPM 12. Depending on the situation, we used either cost-function masking or enantiomorphic normalization to control for the lesioned area. Normalization parameters were then applied to the lesion maps to obtain normalized binary lesion maps. Patients tested for spatial neglect all suffered from unilateral right hemispheric lesions; patients tested for hemiparesis had a unilateral stroke to either the left or the right hemisphere.

In this study, we did not aim to investigate possible hemisphere-specific contributions to primary motor functions.

### Unilateral neglect is more severe and common in older patients with right hemispheric stroke [^115uxUsy]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Unilateral neglect after acute right hemispheric stroke significantly impedes post-stroke recovery. We studied patients with right hemispheric stroke to determine whether increasing age was associated with more frequent or more severe neglect.

- **Methods**: Eight neglect tests were conducted within five days of symptom onset (and within 24 hours of admission) on 204 subjects with acute right hemispheric stroke. The size of infarct was measured, and neglect tests were scored as percent error. "Any neglect" was defined by an elevated neglect test score, standardized relative to a group of normal controls.

- **Results**: When tested for neglect soon after acute stroke admission, 69.6% of subjects older than 65 years had "any neglect" compared to 49.4% of subjects aged 65 years and younger (p = 0.008). For every additional 10 years of age, patients were 1.83 times as likely to have neglect, even after adjusting for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (95% CI 1.38–2.43). DWI volume and NIHSS independently predicted neglect. Scores on virtually all neglect tests worsened as an effect of age. The percentage error on a line cancellation task was 3.8% higher for every additional 10 years of age, after adjustment for DWI volume and NIHSS (p = 0.006). Similar results were found for other neglect tests.

- **Conclusions**: Increasing age in patients with acute right hemispheric stroke significantly increases the odds of unilateral neglect as well as severity of neglect.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^114T5JaX]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

There is widespread acceptance that patients demonstrating neglect/hemi-inattention (HI) following right hemisphere stroke (RHS) underachieve functionally compared to their counterparts without neglect. However, empirical evidence for this view needs examination. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise relevant studies that compared outcomes from RHS patients with and without hemi-attention and suggest more robust follow-up research.

Twelve studies published between 1995 and 2013 were critically reviewed. Two independent reviewers appraised design features, including sample representation, assessment, and data analysis methods. Strengths and limitations were highlighted.

Results were largely inconsistent. Considerable heterogeneity within patient groups and across studies complicated interpretation. Evidence suggested average group disparity in scores between patients with and without HI at discharge, but the cause of functional disparity could not be attributed specifically to HI from the data and modelling results available.

The relationship between HI status and functional recovery warrants further investigation in studies with stronger methodology to ensure rigour and robustness in the results. Pending further research, HI status should not be regarded as a key predictor of functional recovery or rehabilitation potential in patients with RHSs. This group should continue to receive appropriate therapeutic intervention aimed at maximising their functional recovery post-stroke.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^111SJ24N]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Follow-up**: According to our in-house protocol, patients were followed up at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years. At each follow-up, we evaluated the functional status with mRS and neurological deficit with NIHSS, and we performed a cognitive screening using MMSE. MMSE was administered by an experienced stroke specialist to all patients who attended the on-site follow-up appointment. Being one of the most widely used screening tests for cognitive functions, MMSE is composed of 11 questions encompassing orientation, attention, memory, visuospatial, and language skills, with scores ranging from 0 to 30. When patients were not able to attend the outpatient clinic, they were interviewed by telephone to record vital status, and the mRS was assessed with the help of their caregivers, attending physician, or both.

- **Cognitive outcome definition**: We set a cutoff of MMSE < 24 to define cognitive impairment. For the purpose of this study, we analyzed data from patients alive 3 months after DH who underwent at least one cognitive screening using MMSE over the 3-year follow-up. Because only a minority of patients with left-side strokes (15%) were able to undergo cognitive screening, we only included patients with right-sided strokes to avoid biases attributable to severe aphasia. For the same reason, we also excluded patients undergoing DH for a right-hemisphere MCA infarction who also had contralateral territory ischemic involvement.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^112bwMHa]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

- **Critical evaluation**: The evaluation of reviewed studies is discussed, with important abbreviations defined in Appendix 2. The studies are assessed on the GRADE scale, where:
	- A denotes high credibility and is assigned to well-performed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that report consistent results and/or strong effects.
	- B is considered moderate, indicating serious design flaws where the estimated effect might differ significantly from the true effect.
	- C is low, referring to studies with serious limitations, leading to a likelihood that the true effect greatly varies from the estimate, such as the failure to include significant confounding factors.
	- D is very low, similar to C, but where any estimated effect is highly uncertain and unlikely to reflect the true effect accurately.

The text details the significance of differentiating the study outcomes and provides a critical narrative about further research directions needed in the field.

### Distribution pattern analysis of cortical brain infarcts on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: A hypothesis-generating approach to the burden of silent embolic stroke [^1123TC6Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

It is well known that left hemisphere stroke lesions are overrepresented among hospitalized patients, although ischemic strokes disperse equally among both hemispheres in the general population. This lateralization inequality is commonly attributed to linguistic, dominant-hemisphere cortical symptoms in territorial MCA and thalamic stroke. In the study, no significant differences between the left and the right side were found in small infarctions. In all likelihood, lesions (2640 cc) — assumably associated with territorial infarcts.

### Prevalence of acute dizziness and vertigo in cortical stroke [^114nNjjc]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

In posterior circulation stroke, vertigo can be a presenting feature. However, whether isolated hemispheric strokes present with vertigo is less clear, despite a few single case reports in the literature. Here, the prevalence of vertigo/dizziness in acute stroke is explored, and the cortical distribution of the lesions in relation to both the known vestibular cortex and the evolution of the symptoms are considered.

- **Methods**: Structured interviews were conducted with 173 consecutive unselected patients admitted to the hyperacute stroke unit at the University College London Hospitals. The interview evaluated whether the patient was suffering from dizziness and/or vertigo before the onset of the stroke and at the time of the stroke (acute dizziness/vertigo), and the nature of these symptoms.

- **Results**: A total of 53 patients had cortical infarcts, of which 21 patients reported acute dizziness. Out of these 21, five patients reported rotational vertigo. Seventeen of the total 53 patients had lesions in known vestibular cortical areas distributed within the insular and parietal opercular cortices.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of vertigo in acute cortical strokes was 9%, with no single locus of lesion overlap. There is growing evidence supporting a lateralized vestibular cortex, with speculation that cortical strokes affecting the right hemisphere are more likely to cause vestibular symptoms than left hemispheric strokes. A trend was observed for this association, with the right hemisphere affected in four of five patients who reported spinning.

### Neglect scoring modifications in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improve right hemisphere stroke lesion volume prediction [^115E4SJp]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) does not equitably assess stroke severity in the two cerebral hemispheres. By attributing a maximum of two points for neglect and seven for language, it undervalues right hemisphere deficits. We aimed to investigate if NIHSS equally predicts right hemisphere lesion volumes in patients with and without neglect, and if a modification of the neglect scoring rules could increase its predictive capacity.

- **Methods**: We analyzed a prospective cohort of acute right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke patients. First, we calculated the correlation between NIHSS scores and lesion volume and analyzed the partial correlation of neglect. Then, we applied different modifications in the neglect scoring rules and investigated how they interfered with lesion volume predictive capacity.

- **Results**: A total of 162 ischemic stroke patients were included, 108 with neglect and 54 without. The correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS was lower in patients with neglect (r = 0.540 vs. r = 0.219, p = 0.004), and neglect was a statistically significant covariate in the partial correlation analysis between NIHSS and lesion volume (p = 0.017). With the neglect score tripled and with the duplication or triplication of all neglect modalities, the correlation was significantly higher than with the standard NIHSS (p = 0.043, p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively). With these modifications, neglect was no longer a significant covariable in the partial correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS.

- **Conclusion**: A modification of NIHSS neglect scoring might improve right hemisphere stroke lesion volume prediction.

### Right hemisphere dominance for understanding the intentions of others: Evidence from a split-brain patient [^115WiztQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Understanding the actions performed by other people is a key aspect of social interaction, including in clinical settings where patients learn from therapists and caregivers. While lesions of the left cerebral hemisphere induce praxic disorders, the hemispheric specialization of intention understanding remains unclear. Do patients with a right hemispheric lesion understand the intentions of other people properly?

The present study investigates how a split-brain patient understands the means (what) and intentions (why) of the actions of other people. Results show a significant left hemispheric dominance for understanding what is done and a significant right hemispheric dominance for understanding why an action is carried out. This discovery might have important clinical implications for neurological patients, especially when those with right hemisphere lesions face important decisions related to the interpretation of others' intentions.

### Right-hemispheric processing of non-linguistic word features: Implications for mapping language recovery after stroke [^112ioeRG]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

Verbal stimuli often induce right-hemispheric activation in patients with aphasia following a left-hemispheric stroke. This right-hemispheric activation is commonly attributed to functional reorganization within the language system. Yet, previous evidence suggests that functional activation in right-hemispheric homologues of classic left-hemispheric language areas may partly be due to processing non-linguistic perceptual features of verbal stimuli.

We used functional MRI (fMRI) to clarify the role of the right hemisphere in the perception of non-linguistic word features in healthy individuals. Participants made perceptual, semantic, or phonological decisions on the same set of auditorily and visually presented word stimuli.

- **Perceptual decisions**: Required judgments about stimulus-inherent changes in font size (visual modality) or fundamental frequency contour (auditory modality).
- **Semantic judgment**: Required subjects to decide whether a stimulus is natural or man-made.
- **Phonologic decision**: Required a decision on whether a stimulus contains two or three syllables.

Compared to phonologic or semantic decisions, non-linguistic perceptual decisions resulted in stronger right-hemispheric activation. Specifically, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), an area previously suggested to support language recovery after left-hemispheric stroke, displayed modality-independent activation during perceptual processing of word stimuli. Our findings indicate that activation of the right hemisphere during language tasks may, in some instances, be driven by "non-linguistic perceptual processing".

### Ipsilesional motor deficits following stroke reflect hemispheric specializations for movement control [^112b7Sbb]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Recent reports of functional impairment in the 'unaffected' limb of stroke patients have suggested that these deficits vary with the side of the lesion. This not only supports the idea that the ipsilateral hemisphere contributes to arm movements but also implies that such contributions are lateralized. It has been previously suggested that the left and right hemispheres are specialized for controlling different features of movement. In reaching movements, the non-dominant arm appears better adapted for achieving accurate final positions, and the dominant arm for specifying initial trajectory features, such as movement direction and peak acceleration.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether different features of control could characterize ipsilesional motor deficits following stroke. Healthy control subjects and patients with either left- or right-hemisphere damage performed targeted single-joint elbow movements of different amplitudes in their ipsilateral hemispace. It was predicted that left-hemisphere damage would produce deficits in the specification of initial trajectory features, while right-hemisphere damage would produce deficits in final position accuracy. Consistent with these predictions, patients with left, but not right, hemisphere damage showed reduced modulation of acceleration amplitude. However, patients with right, but not left, hemisphere damage showed significantly larger errors in final position, which corresponded to reduced modulation of acceleration duration. Neither patient group differed from controls in terms of movement speed.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^111y9rCT]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

The accuracy of results depended heavily on the precision of instruments and consistency in measurement. Only 50% of studies followed evidence-based recommendations in favor of diagnosing neglect/hemi-inattention with validated test batteries rather than single cancellation tasks; the rationale is that several tests are more likely to detect neglect than a single test. To this end, the proportion of the HI+ (hemi-inattention positive) patients detected in studies that assessed with the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) is considerably higher than in those that used single tests. Like other test batteries, the BIT has measurement limitations in that it is restricted to assessment of hemi-inattention in activities conducted within close proximity (arm's length) of surrounding body space and possibly mental representation of objects.

In addition, similar to other test batteries (e.g. Catherine Bergego scale), the BIT cannot distinguish between different sub-types of the disorder because all the assessed tasks inherently draw on visual, sensory, motor, spatial, perceptual, and cognitive function to varying degrees. These components are intricately intertwined and dependent on one another, which makes it virtually impossible to determine the relative contribution of individual components to the results or behavior observed. Consequently, and of relevance to clinicians and researchers, it is not possible to accurately explain test results in terms of specific sub-types of hemi-inattention in routine rehabilitation settings. That being said, assessment batteries provide an overall score of hemi-inattention severity and are indicative of the type of perceptual, cognitive, and other functional impairments present.

### Clinical presentation and neural correlates of stroke-associated spatial delusions [^116ZgmpY]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

In this work, we analyzed the clinical phenomenology and neural correlates of stroke‐associated spatial delusions. First, we characterized the location of misidentified places and described the general phenotypic features of the syndrome. We demonstrated that the duration of spatial delusions is moderately correlated with the structural decoupling of belief‐associated functional networks. Second, we reported associated clinical features, such as the patients' knowledge about the location of the misidentified places and their orientation in time. Third, we described the most common patterns of patients' response according to spatial delusion subtypes and provided representative examples to facilitate recognition and diagnosis. Finally, we showed that case clustering based on structural disruption of familiarity/unfamiliarity‐associated functional regions poorly matches the clinical classification.

The large majority of patients localized the misidentified place closer to their homes than to the hospital. Limbic‐related models of delusional misidentifications support that misidentified stimuli tend to be emotionally relevant for patients, and an association between spatial delusions and structural disconnection of limbic structures has been established.

Belief, as a neural process, can be defined as the integration of perceived information with internal representations of personal significance and emotional value. Distinct neural systems in the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system mediate the states of assent, dissent, and uncertainty.

### Clinical presentation and neural correlates of stroke-associated spatial delusions [^113oUPQg]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Incongruent beliefs about self‐localization in space markedly disturb patients' behavior. Spatial delusions, or reduplicative paramnesias, are characterized by a firm conviction of place reduplication, transformation, or mislocation. Evidence suggests they are frequent after right hemisphere lesions, but comprehensive information about their clinical features is lacking.

- **Methods**: We prospectively screened 504 acute right‐hemisphere stroke patients for the presence of spatial delusions. Their behavioral and clinical features were systematically assessed. We then analyzed the correlation of their duration with the magnitude of structural disruption of belief‐associated functional networks. Finally, we described the syndrome subtypes and evaluated whether the clinical categorization would be predicted by the structural disruption of familiarity‐associated functional networks using an unsupervised k‐means clustering algorithm.

- **Results**: Sixty patients with spatial delusions were identified and fully characterized. Most (93%) localized the misidentified places closer to home than the hospital. The median time duration was 3 days (interquartile range = 1–7 days), and it was moderately correlated with the magnitude of structural–functional decoupling of belief‐associated functional networks (r = 0.39, p = 0.02; beta coefficient regressing for lesion volume = 3.18, p = 0.04). Each clinical subtype had characteristic response patterns, which were reported, and representative examples were provided. Clustering was based on structural disruption.

### Neglect scoring modifications in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improve right hemisphere stroke lesion volume prediction [^117GVzVU]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) does not equitably assess stroke severity in the two cerebral hemispheres. By attributing a maximum of two points for neglect and seven for language, it undervalues right hemisphere deficits. This study aimed to investigate if NIHSS equally predicts right hemisphere lesion volumes in patients with and without neglect, and if a modification of the neglect scoring rules could increase its predictive capacity.

A prospective cohort of acute right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke patients was analyzed. The correlation between NIHSS scores and lesion volume was calculated, and the partial correlation of neglect was analyzed. Different modifications in the neglect scoring rules were applied, and their impact on lesion volume predictive capacity was investigated.

A total of 162 ischemic stroke patients were included, 108 with neglect and 54 without. The correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS was lower in patients with neglect (r = 0.540 vs. r = 0.219, p = 0.004), and neglect was a statistically significant covariate in the partial correlation analysis between NIHSS and lesion volume (p = 0.017). With the neglect score tripled and with the duplication or triplication of all neglect modalities, the correlation was significantly higher than with the standard NIHSS (p = 0.043, p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively). With these modifications, neglect was no longer a significant covariable in the partial correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

In the guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) for acute ischemic stroke, the 2019 update emphasizes recommendations specific to pregnant patients, particularly regarding lipid-lowering therapy. The guidelines advise that sexually active females of childbearing age treated with statin therapy should use a reliable form of contraception.

### Hypoperfusion without stroke alters motor activation in the opposite hemisphere [^113kpfmq]. Annals of Neurology (2004).

To specifically investigate the effect that large-vessel disease may have on cortical reorganization, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study patients with unilateral hemispheric hypoperfusion and impaired vasomotor reactivity from critical internal carotid or middle cerebral artery disease but without stroke. We hypothesized that when these patients used the hand contralateral to the hypoperfused hemisphere they would show unique activation in motor-related areas of the normally perfused hemisphere, that is, ipsilateral activation. We found that normal performance of two motor tasks was associated with increased ipsilateral hemispheric activation in the patients compared with age-matched controls. In addition, although task difficulty had an effect on ipsilateral activation, the increased ipsilateral activation seen in patients was not dependent on task difficulty. Our findings demonstrate that hemodynamic compromise alone is sufficient to cause atypical ipsilateral activation. This activation may serve to maintain normal motor performance.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^1162NTCQ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

- **Purpose**: There is widespread acceptance that patients demonstrating neglect/hemi-inattention (HI) following right hemisphere stroke (RHS) underachieve functionally compared to their counterparts without neglect; however, empirical evidence for this view needs examination. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise relevant studies that compared outcomes from RHS patients with/without hemi-attention and suggest more robust follow-up research.

- **Method**: Twelve studies published between 1995 and 2013 were critically reviewed. Two independent reviewers appraised design features, including sample representation, assessment, and data analysis methods. Strengths and limitations were highlighted.

- **Results**: Results were largely inconsistent. Considerable heterogeneity within patient groups and across studies complicated interpretation. Evidence suggested an average group disparity in scores between patients with and without HI at discharge; however, the cause of functional disparity could not be attributed specifically to HI from the data and modelling results available.

- **Conclusion**: The relationship between HI status and functional recovery warrants further investigation in studies with stronger methodology to ensure rigor and robustness in the results. Pending further research, HI status should not be regarded as a key predictor of functional recovery or rehabilitation potential in patients with RHSs. This group should continue to receive appropriate therapeutic interventions aimed at maximizing their functional recovery post-stroke.

### Spatial working memory capacity in unilateral neglect [^111JiKp4]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

It has been proposed recently that a deficit in keeping track of spatial locations may contribute to the severity of unilateral neglect in some right hemisphere stroke patients. However, performance on traditional spatial working memory (SWM) tasks (e.g. Corsi blocks) might be confounded by failure to encode leftward locations, rather than a true deficit of maintaining locations in SWM. Here we introduced new procedures for circumventing this to measure SWM capacity in neglect.

- **First experiment**: 20 right hemisphere stroke patients (10 with and 10 without neglect) were tested on a computerized vertical variant of the Corsi task. Sequences of spatial locations in a vertical column were displayed, and participants had to tap out the remembered sequence on a touchscreen. Patients with left neglect were impaired on this vertical SWM task compared with all control groups. However, poor performance on this task (as for Corsi blocks) might involve impaired memory for stimulus sequence or poor visuomotor control of manual responding, rather than reduced SWM capacity per se.

- **Second experiment**: A purer measure of vertical SWM was employed. After the displayed sequence, a single location was now probed visually, with observers judging verbally (yes/no) if it had been in the preceding sequence. Hence order no longer mattered, and no spatial motor response was required. Again, the neglect group was impaired relative to all others, now with very little overlap between the performances of individual neglect patients versus individuals in control groups.

### Lesioned hemisphere-specific phenotypes of post-stroke fatigue emerge from motor and mood characteristics in chronic stroke [^111x8zCw]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

No clear differences were observed in motor thresholds that could enable us to distinguish left- and right-hemisphere strokes with high fatigue, despite the overall sample showing a positive relationship between threshold and fatigue level in left-hemisphere strokes. CSE assessed using TMS thresholds is highly variable in the general population, which was evident from the threshold values of the entire cohort in the present study.

CSE of the left and right hemispheres behaves differently during motor control, with asymmetries in CSE seen between the two hemispheres. The left hemisphere plays a dominant role in motor control, which is characterized by higher CSE when compared to the right hemisphere, broader activation patterns during movement, and greater thickness of the motor cortex. The asymmetry in CSE between the two hemispheres is driven by inter-hemispheric connectivity. In a normal brain, inter-hemispheric connectivity is characterized by a net left-to-right inhibitory dominance and right-to-left excitatory dominance within the motor cortices and outside primary motor areas, resulting in higher CSE of the left hemisphere when compared to the right.

In post-stroke fatigue, opposite patterns of inter-hemispheric connectivity in primary motor cortices are seen, with a shift from net left-to-right to a net right-to-left inhibitory dominance. Given the shift in inter-hemispheric inhibition balance, those with high fatigue and left-hemisphere stroke will present with lower excitability than those without fatigue. The results of the present study are in line with this expectation.

### Patterns of spontaneous recovery of neglect and associated disorders in acute right brain-damaged patients [^115Dkkuf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The evolutionary pattern of spontaneous recovery from acute neglect was studied by assessing cognitive deficits and motor impairments. Detailed lesion reconstruction was performed to correlate the presence of and recovery from neglect to neural substrates.

- **Methods**: A consecutive series of right brain-damaged (RBD) patients with and without neglect underwent weekly tests in the acute phase of the illness. The battery assessed neglect deficits, neglect-related deficits, and motor impairment. Age-matched normal subjects were also investigated to ascertain the presence of non-lateralised attentional deficits. Some neglect patients were available for later investigation during the chronic phase of their illness.

- **Results**: Partial recovery of neglect deficits was observed at the end of the acute period and during the chronic phase. Spatial attention was impaired in acute neglect patients, while non-spatial attentional deficits were present in RBD patients with and without acute neglect. A strong association was found between acute neglect and fronto-parietal lesions. Similar lesions were associated with neglect persistence. In the chronic stage, neglect recovery was paralleled by improved motor control of the contralesional upper limb, emphasizing that neglect is a negative prognostic factor in motor functional recovery.

These findings show that spatial attention deficits partially improve during the acute phase of the disease in less than half the patients investigated. There was an improvement in left visuospatial neglect at a later stage.

### The role of the right inferior frontal gyrus in the pathogenesis of post-stroke psychosis [^116wJohP]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings are preliminary; the number of cases is small due to the rarity of the condition, and premorbid schizotypy was not specifically examined. In future large-scale studies of post-stroke psychosis, it would be informative to screen for schizotypal personality as well as premorbid psychiatric disease. Both our study and previous studies predict that individuals with schizotypal features would be at a substantially higher risk of developing post-stroke psychosis if the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved. Additional cases are needed to determine other risk factors, whether behavioral or structural, that predispose individuals to psychosis following a stroke.

To summarize, our study provides the most precise lesion data available at the time of writing, corroborating existing structural and functional studies that indicate right IFG damage is a critical component in the development of clinical psychosis in at-risk individuals. Moreover, from a practical perspective, in a clinical setting, it is worth the effort to clarify an individual's previous psychiatric history when they appear to manifest delusions in the context of a hemispheric stroke.

### Attentional reorientation along the meridians of the visual field: Are there different neural mechanisms at play [^111zG7pX]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

Unilateral lesions following a stroke can lead to an inability to allocate attention to the visual field contralateral to the lesion — a phenomenon often referred to as hemispatial neglect. Neglect is more frequent and severe following right-hemispheric lesions and causes symptoms predominantly in contralesional space. This lateralization suggests a unique role for orienting and reorienting attention along the horizontal meridian and has motivated research focused on that particular spatial dimension.

Attentional orienting along the vertical meridian, on the other hand, seems understudied. Despite this, there is evidence for a vertical component in hemispatial neglect, including cases of vertical neglect of the upper visual field after bilateral lesions to the inferior temporal lobes. Vertical neglect commonly affects the lower left visual field after right hemispheric lesions. The extent of horizontal and vertical neglect along the meridians appears to be additive, becoming more pronounced at oblique positions, such as the lower left visual field, which has also been observed for pseudoneglect in healthy participants. Thus, the allocation of attention along the two meridians may rely on distinct neural mechanisms.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^112xJWHq]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

A literature search was conducted from 1995 to February 2015 using the databases MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and COCHRANE. Several descriptors of neglect subtypes were used in the literature search, including HI, spatial, visual, unilateral, personal, extra-personal, motor, sensory, hemi, and representational. The terms stroke, CVA, functional*, and activities of daily living (ADL) were added to the search so that studies focusing on specific functional activities were included. Children or young adults (≤ 18 years) and non-human samples were excluded.

The search yielded three Cochrane reviews and 195 publications: AMED (70), CINAHL (86), MEDLINE (102), and PsycINFO (57). In line with the aims of the review and supported by recommendations from Jehkonen et al, only studies that compared homogeneous patient groups with respect to hemispheric lesion site (RHS) and presented comparisons of patients with or without HI were selected, including intervention designs. All other studies with heterogeneous patient samples and no HI group comparison were excluded. Additionally, functional ability had to be quantifiably measured so that the HI ± group differences in scores could be calculated. Two reviewers read the abstracts and, when in doubt, the full publication to determine relevance. This process led to the selection of 12 international studies.

The following information was extracted from each study: source, aims, design type, demographic data, assessment tools, data analysis method, results, and findings.

### Incidence of visual extinction after left versus right hemisphere stroke [^111FpGVc]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Generally, it is accepted that spatial neglect occurs predominantly following a stroke in the human right hemisphere. In contrast, it remains controversial whether extinction follows the same hemispheric asymmetry. The prevailing opinion is that the laterality of visual extinction is not as pronounced as it is for spatial neglect.

- **Methods**: To directly compare the incidence of the two disorders within the same sample, spatial neglect and visual extinction were investigated during a 1-year period in 83 consecutively admitted patients with unilateral right or left hemisphere stroke.

- **Results**: The incidence of visual extinction and spatial neglect was not significantly different, neither after left hemisphere (2.4% neglect; 4.9% extinction) nor after right hemisphere (26.2% neglect; 24.3% extinction) stroke.

- **Conclusions**: Visual extinction seems to be as asymmetrically associated with the human right hemisphere as is spatial neglect.

### Motor neglect associated with loss of action inhibition [^113c24ZX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Motor neglect, the underuse of one side of the body not explained by weakness or sensory impairment, is a common consequence of stroke that is surprisingly little understood. The behavioral and neuroanatomical hallmarks of the disorder are investigated. Using a masked prime task, it was shown that when patients with left motor neglect plan to move their left hand, irrelevant right limb motor programs intrude, causing delay. Lesion analysis reveals that such asymmetry of motor programming occurs after infarcts of the right putamen and motor association areas. This demonstration of failure to inhibit ipsilesional limb motor plans suggests potential benefit from interventions that might act to restore balance in action planning.

### Acute loss of spatial navigational skills in a case of a right posterior hippocampus stroke [^113s49rg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

The ability to accurately navigate within an environment, whether known or new, involves numerous complex cognitive processes related to both central and peripheral nervous system structures and neuronal networks. We describe a patient who developed a loss of spatial navigational skills associated with an acute ischemic right posterior hippocampal lesion. Neuropsychological assessment displayed clear evidence of impaired visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities, with relative preservation of many other cognitive functions, including orientation, language, and verbal memory. The underlying anatomy responsible for the navigational impairment observed in our patient could be due to impaired function of the right hippocampus, affecting its ability to form, store, and retrieve new cognitive or spatial maps. To our knowledge, this is one of the few documented cases demonstrating impaired navigational abilities with a relatively discrete right-sided, posterior hippocampal lesion.

### Visual extinction in relation to visuospatial neglect after right-hemispheric stroke: Quantitative assessment and statistical lesion-symptom mapping [^117NiC5c]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Visual neglect and extinction are two common neurological syndromes in patients with right-hemispheric brain damage. Whether and how these two syndromes are associated or share common neural substrates is still a matter of debate.

- **Methods**: To address these issues, the authors investigated 56 patients with right-hemispheric stroke using a novel diagnostic test to detect extinction and neglect. In this computerized task, subjects had to respond to target stimuli in uni- and bilateral stimulation conditions, with detection probabilities being assessed. A cluster-analytical approach identified 18 patients with neglect and 13 patients with extinction. Statistical lesion-symptom mapping analyses with measures for extinction and neglect were performed.

- **Results**: Extinction and neglect co-occurred in a subset of patients but were also observed independently from each other, thereby constituting a double dissociation. Lesions within the right inferior parietal cortex were significantly associated with the severity of visual extinction. Visuospatial neglect was related to damage of fronto-parietal brain regions, with parieto-occipital areas affecting line bisection and dorsal fronto-parietal areas affecting cancellation task performance, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Quantifying lesion-induced symptoms with this novel paradigm shows that extinction and neglect are dissociable syndromes in patients with right-hemispheric stroke. Furthermore, extinction and neglect can be related to differential neural substrates, with extinction being related to focal brain damage within the right parietal cortex and neglect associated with broader fronto-parietal damage.
