## Question

What are the prevention and management strategies for a 4.8 cm ascending aortic dilatation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prevention and management strategies for a 4.8 cm ascending aortic dilatation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline risk stratification by valve morphology, genetic/connective tissue syndromes, body size, and growth rate. Then, I should quantify where 4.8 cm sits on contemporary risk curves and guideline thresholds. Next, I will lay out the medical management priorities and surveillance cadence. After that, I need to define when surgery becomes indicated and how special populations (women of small stature, pregnancy planning, bicuspid aortic valve) change thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical action plan and emphasize multidisciplinary, shared decision-making with the patient [^1134r3aJ] [^113Hw3fc] [^1135FpfQ] [^116zv8jq] [^117QjaFW] [^1137uyPu] [^112FdKp5] [^1139ooSz].

> Let me first confirm key risk modifiers before jumping to thresholds. I need to check aortic valve morphology (tricuspid vs bicuspid), the presence of heritable or syndromic aortopathy (Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Ehlers-Danlos), family history of dissection, and clinical context (age, hypertension control, pregnancy considerations), because these can lower the size at which surgery is reasonable or indicated [^1134r3aJ] [^1113qUb3] [^114fPvH7] [^112t23yw].

> Hold on, I should verify patient size adjustments because a smaller person may reach indexed thresholds at a smaller absolute diameter. ACC/AHA endorses the aortic size index (ASI ≥ 3.08 cm/m²), the aortic height index (AHI ≥ 3.21 cm/m), or the cross-sectional area/height ratio ≥ 10 cm²/m as alternate triggers for considering prophylactic surgery with experienced teams; in very short or small BSA patients, a 4.8 cm aorta may meet these indices, so I need to calculate them carefully before concluding [^1135FpfQ] [^116zv8jq] [^11525zpo].

> Next, I should review growth dynamics, because rapid enlargement changes management irrespective of absolute size. Let me verify the growth criteria: confirmed rapid growth of ≥ 3 mm/year in two consecutive years or ≥ 5 mm in one year is a surgical trigger even if the diameter is below 5.5 cm, so I must compare serial measurements with consistent modality and technique to avoid measurement noise before labeling someone a "fast grower" [^113Hw3fc] [^1137uyPu].

> Now, where does 4.8 cm actually fall on risk curves and thresholds? I should double-check: standard Class I surgical thresholds for sporadic tricuspid-valve ascending aortic aneurysm remain at 5.5 cm in ACC/AHA and ESC guidance, so 4.8 cm is below this bar; importantly, the best available risk data suggest a 5-year risk of dissection/rupture of roughly 0.4% at 45 mm and ~1.1% at 50 mm, placing 4.8 cm in a low but non-zero risk range around ~0.5–0.7% over 5 years for stable patients without high-risk features [^1134r3aJ] [^112FdKp5] [^117QjaFW].

> Wait, let me verify whether mid-ascending "hinge points" affect this case. Observational analyses suggest steeper risk acceleration around 5.25–5.5 cm, with root dilation behaving more "malignant" than the mid-ascending segment; this supports that 4.8 cm is in a moderate-risk surveillance zone rather than at an inflection point, but I should keep in mind this literature is observational and center-specific [^111bENgG] [^116VUjGL].

> I will now examine the broader context that a large fraction of dissections occur below classic thresholds, which means meticulous surveillance matters. Contemporary cohorts emphasize that more than 60–80% of type A dissections present below 5.5 cm, underscoring the importance of growth tracking and comprehensive risk control; however, hold on, I should confirm this is specific to sporadic disease and not overgeneralized across phenotypes, and use it to justify vigilance rather than premature surgery at 4.8 cm [^113synBD] [^113zJnoS].

> Next, I should review medical management priorities. Blood pressure control is the highest-yield intervention; I need to ensure an on-target BP < 130/80 mmHg using beta-blockers as first-line and adding an ARB if needed to achieve goals, provided there are no contraindications; this is reasonable across etiologies and aims to reduce aortic wall stress and adverse events [^1137uyPu] [^111V3MAS] [^114VgrMy].

> Let me think about lifestyle and activity counseling as adjunct risk reduction. I should advise avoiding heavy isometric exertion and Valsalva-type straining, favoring moderate aerobic activity, and reinforce smoking cessation and weight management; although precise exercise prescriptions vary, the common-sense approach is to limit peak aortic wall stress while maintaining cardiovascular fitness under BP control [^1137uyPu].

> I need to ensure surveillance imaging is set appropriately. For a 4.8 cm stable ascending aneurysm, repeating gated CT or MRI at 6–12 months with consistent measurement planes and modality is standard; wait, I almost cited an ESC recommendation that was for post-repair follow-up — let me correct that and anchor this interval to ACC/AHA guidance and contemporary practice emphasizing reliable, comparable measurements over time to calculate true growth rates accurately [^1137uyPu].

> Now, I will delineate when surgery becomes indicated despite a current size of 4.8 cm. Absolute or relative triggers include: confirmed rapid growth (≥ 3 mm/year over 2 years or ≥ 5 mm/year once), concomitant tricuspid aortic valve surgery when the ascending aorta is ≥ 5.0 cm, and lower thresholds for specific heritable syndromes (for example, Loeys-Dietz often at ≥ 4.5 cm, and many nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic diseases at ≥ 5.0 cm if otherwise low risk); indices such as ASI ≥ 3.08 cm/m² or AHI ≥ 3.21 cm/m can also justify earlier surgery with experienced teams [^113Hw3fc] [^116jwZqJ] [^114fPvH7] [^1113qUb3] [^1135FpfQ].

> But wait, what if the patient is planning pregnancy or is very young with additional risks? I should confirm that pregnancy planning meaningfully lowers thresholds in guidelines; indeed, pre-pregnancy repair can be considered around 4.0–4.4 cm depending on genotype, family history, and growth, given the hemodynamic stress of gestation; likewise, ESC suggests considering earlier intervention around 50 mm in low-surgical-risk patients when high-risk features like resistant hypertension, young age, or desire for pregnancy are present [^112t23yw] [^111FW4Cv] [^117UZouF].

> Hold on, I should verify bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) considerations. Although classic thinking favored lower thresholds, current major guidelines generally align BAV thresholds with tricuspid in many scenarios (5.5 cm), with consideration of 5.0 cm at expert centers when additional risk factors exist or when concomitant valve surgery is planned; shared decision-making is essential here due to heterogeneity in phenotypes and institutional experience [^112FdKp5] [^113Em6Wy] [^1134r3aJ].

> Next, I should review the role of concomitant surgery. If this patient needs aortic valve surgery and the ascending aorta measures ≥ 5.0 cm, concomitant ascending replacement is recommended; many centers individualize decisions between 4.5 and 5.0 cm based on valve pathology, root versus tubular phenotype, age, and surgical risk; I should confirm the center's expertise in valve-sparing and root techniques if the root is involved [^116jwZqJ] [^115WmRvh].

> I should double-check that multidisciplinary and shared decision-making principles are integrated. Management at experienced centers with a dedicated aortic team and a formal shared decision process improves alignment of operative risk, anatomy, and patient preferences; this is particularly critical when considering indexed thresholds or earlier intervention for special circumstances [^1139ooSz] [^111xLu3x] [^114kyDGw].

> Specific action plan for a stable 4.8 cm ascending aneurysm without high-risk features: optimize BP to < 130/80 with beta-blocker ± ARB, institute lifestyle guidance to avoid heavy isometrics, and schedule repeat gated CT or MRI in 6–12 months using the same modality and measurement protocol; at follow-up, I should explicitly compute growth and re-evaluate for any new high-risk modifiers that would lower surgical thresholds or trigger referral [^1137uyPu] [^111V3MAS] [^114VgrMy].

> If high-risk features are present now or emerge — such as rapid growth, index thresholds met in a small-stature patient, heritable aortopathy, or pregnancy planning — I would refer promptly to an experienced aortic surgeon to discuss prophylactic repair timing and approach, using the 4.5–5.0 cm range as appropriate for syndromic disease, 5.0 cm for many heritable but nonsyndromic cases, 5.0 cm with concomitant valve surgery, and 5.5 cm otherwise for sporadic disease in tricuspid valves, individualized by ASI/AHI and patient factors [^114fPvH7] [^1113qUb3] [^116jwZqJ] [^1134r3aJ] [^1135FpfQ].

> Final clinical check: at 4.8 cm, the absolute near-term risk is low but not negligible; most patients will be managed medically with vigilant surveillance unless growth, genetics, indexed size, concomitant surgery, or pregnancy considerations lower the operative threshold; I should document the shared plan, educate the patient on symptoms of acute aortic syndromes, and ensure tight BP adherence because the balance of data shows low annual event rates in this size range but meaningful benefit from meticulous risk control and follow-up [^117QjaFW] [^1137uyPu] [^112FdKp5].

For a 4.8 cm ascending aorta [^117QjaFW], emphasize **medical management and surveillance** over immediate surgery unless high-risk features are present [^1137uyPu]. The priorities are **blood pressure control** and monitoring for growth or symptoms [^113synBD] [^1134r3aJ].

- **Blood pressure control** — target < 130/80 mmHg [^1137uyPu] with beta-blockers as first-line [^111V3MAS]; add ARBs if needed [^114VgrMy].
- **Imaging surveillance** — repeat CT or MRI every 6–12 months; shorten to 3–6 months if growth ≥ 2 mm/year or high-risk features.
- **Lifestyle modifications** — avoid heavy lifting/straining; maintain healthy weight; stop smoking; limit alcohol; manage lipids and diabetes.
- **Surgical thresholds** — consider surgery at ≥ 5.5 cm [^1134r3aJ], or ≥ 5.0 cm with rapid growth (≥ 3 mm/year) [^113Hw3fc], family history, or connective tissue disease.
- **Patient education** — teach symptoms of dissection (sudden severe chest/back pain) and ensure prompt emergency response.

Routine **follow-up** and strict **risk-factor control** are essential; reserve surgery for rapid growth or high-risk features [^113Hw3fc].

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^111bENgG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In view of the ascending aorta as a single unit, the slope of both curves increases considerably at a diameter of about 5.5 cm, thus reproducing the surgical cutoff value recommended by guidelines. There was no correction for the mid-ascending aorta size, as this notion was proposed recently. Considering the success rates of repair at expert centers and the 15% risk of the first composite endpoint between 5.0 and 5.5 cm, the surgical threshold of 5.5 cm is arguably high. The aortas with low diameters demonstrate pseudo-high risk because of selection bias with the underrepresentation of healthy individuals. The R² values are very close to 1, suggesting that the trend lines almost perfectly fit the data.

- **Lifetime risk analysis**: Lifetime risk of the first composite endpoint (red line) and the second composite endpoint (black line) are plotted against the mid-ascending aorta diameter of the 1162 patients. Mid-ascending aorta diameter > 5.25 cm poses a considerable increase in risk for the first and second composite endpoints. Aortas with low diameters demonstrate different degrees of pseudo-high risk because of selection bias with the underrepresentation of healthy individuals. At diameters > 4.5 cm, the sample becomes representative. Note that the risk of the first composite endpoint, attributed to a mid 5.0 cm width, is almost 6%. The R² values are very close to 1, indicating that the trend lines almost perfectly fit the data.

### Early impact of aortic wrapping on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with mild to moderate ascending aorta dilatation [^112p5Hbp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The management of mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta, measuring less than 5 cm, is controversial, particularly when concomitant surgical correction of the aortic valve is required. We investigate the impact of a simple method of aorta reduction using Dacron graft wrapping during aortic valve replacement on the rest of the aorta.

- **Methods**: We studied 14 patients who had ascending aorta dilatation of 4–5 cm before undergoing aortic wrapping during their aortic valve replacement and compared their post-operative imaging within a month.

- **Results**: The diameters of the ascending aorta wrapped with the Dacron graft were significantly reduced within 4 weeks after surgery, from 44.7 ± 2.6 to 33.6 ± 3.9 mm (p < 0.001). This was associated with a significant reduction in the diameter of the rest of the ascending aorta: coronary sinuses (from 37.9 ± 4.9 mm to 33.3 ± 6.1 mm; p < 0.001), sinotubular junction (from 33.2 ± 4.7 mm to 30.6 ± 4.4 mm, p = 0.02), and aortic arch (from 34.7 ± 4.3 mm to 32.6 ± 4.1 mm, p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Reduction of ascending aortic dilatation by wrapping with a Dacron graft in this preliminary study is associated with favourable early reversed aortic remodelling. This supports the hypothesis that correcting mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta with Dacron wrapping at the time of aortic valve surgery may prevent the progression of the dilatation. However, a long-term study on a larger population is needed to confirm its benefits.

### A critical review of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines on bicuspid aortic valve with dilated ascending aorta [^1139jQQi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The 2006 practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend prophylactic aortic replacement for even an asymptomatic patient with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) when the aortic dimensions exceed arbitrary ranges based on Marfan syndrome, without comparing risk estimates of aortic dissection with operative risks. In the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection, which includes more than 1,000 autopsied subjects, the average age is 63 years; BAVs are found in only 3%, compared with histories of hypertension in 72%. The risk for valve-sparing aortic replacement is 4% and that for late mortality is 10%, based on five publications. The aortic dimensions are from guidelines for Marfan syndrome, with a proved genetic weakness of connective tissue, whereas no culprit genes have been demonstrated in BAV.

Although cystic medial necrosis is seen in dilated aortas associated with Marfan syndrome and BAV, it is also seen in dilated aortas with other causes. There is no convincing proof that cystic medial necrosis causes dissection or is simply an effect of dilation. BAV is not associated with dilation of the pulmonary arteries, in contrast to Marfan syndrome. Hemodynamic explanations for dilation of the ascending aorta have been largely ignored because of a belief that it requires severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation. In conclusion, vascular dilation without a genetic weakness is caused by coarse periodic vibrations from even trivial valve disorders, demonstrated experimentally.

### Quality-of-life implications of immediate surgery and watchful waiting in asymptomatic aortic stenosis: a decision-analytic model [^112XE4aF]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2011). Low credibility.

Traditional management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) is based on delaying aortic valve replacement (AVR) until symptoms develop. Surgery for asymptomatic AS has been proposed to reduce the small risk of sudden death before AVR and to avoid heart failure (HF) after AVR. Because a trial to compare these options is unlikely, we developed a Markov model to inform the choice between immediate surgery and watchful waiting in asymptomatic AS.

- **Methods and results**: We defined health states as preoperative, postoperative, postcomplication, and death. We calculated the implications of watchful waiting, tissue, and mechanical AVR based on risks, transitions, utilities, and costs derived from a literature review. Further analyses evaluated situations thought to favor immediate surgery and watchful waiting. Sensitivity analyses were based on the likelihood of preoperative death and HF in follow-up. In the reference case (age 65 years; post-AVR utility, 0.9; annualized pre-AVR mortality, 1%; and post-AVR HF, 11.3%), the utility of watchful waiting was superior to that of immediate mechanical or tissue AVR (quality-adjusted life-years: 7.4 versus 5.3 versus 5.3, respectively), and the cost was less than immediate surgery. Sensitivity analyses showed immediate surgery was not likely to be more effective regardless of the yearly probability of post-AVR HF in the watchful waiting group (range: 0% to 80%). Immediate surgery was likely to be effective when pre-AVR annual mortality reached 13%.

- **Conclusions**: Immediate surgery in asymptomatic severe AS does not improve outcomes.

### Highlights and perioperative implications from the 2022 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of aortic disease [^111xLu3x]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). High credibility.

As the understanding of aortic diseases and their complications grows, the importance of uniformity in diagnosis and management is increasingly crucial for optimal patient care. The 2022 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of aortic disease discuss these considerations in detail. The purpose of this review is to highlight essential recommendations that are relevant to the perioperative physician who manages these patients.

Notable points include shared decision-making with patients, the creation of multidisciplinary aortic teams, lower diameter thresholds for surgery in certain situations, and increased testing for patients with heritable aortic diseases. In addition to briefly reviewing the basics of aortic diseases, the authors discuss changes to guidelines that are especially relevant to perioperative care.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113synBD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Despite the guideline-recommended practice of maximal diameter-driven prophylactic surgical repair, studies have shown that over 80% of thoracic aortic aneurysm dissections (TAAD) occur below surgical diameter thresholds and are therefore not preventable by these approaches. Attempts have been made to improve diameter-based risk estimates by adjusting for patient height or body surface area. However, a recently published study of over 6,000 patients with sporadic ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA) did not find improved risk discrimination using such adjusted size metrics. It did find that the occurrence of aTAA growth during surveillance increased the risk of TAAD by a factor of 2 to 3, supporting guidelines recommending prophylactic repair in the presence of rapid growth (≥ 3 mm/year in two consecutive years or ≥ 5 mm in any year) regardless of aneurysm size.

Given that methods for risk stratification in aTAA rely on both aneurysm diameter and growth rate, a clear understanding of the relationship between these metrics is important for more clearly depicting disease severity and determining optimal imaging surveillance. Growth of aTAA has commonly been reported to increase with diameter. This association has been widely justified by the law of Laplace (wall tension is proportional to vessel diameter, assuming negligible change in wall thickness) and referenced in the recent 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease. However, this approach does not take into consideration the aortic wall's ability to remodel over time through well-regulated biological processes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection-treatment planning and follow-up: 2024 update [^1129zuZi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Diseases of the thoracic aorta include two broad categories: aneurysmal dilation involving all three layers of the intact aortic wall and acute aortic syndromes, wherein at least one layer of the aortic wall is disrupted, such as in aortic dissection. These diseases carry a variable risk of subsequent aortic rupture, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Imaging is critical in the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of this constellation of diseases.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Dilatation of the remaining aorta after aortic valve or aortic root replacement in patients with bicuspid aortic valve: A 5-year follow-up [^1141u3cW]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The natural history and management of ascending aorta (AA) and arch dilatation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) or aortic root replacement (ARR) remain controversial. Our aim is to identify dilatation of the remaining aorta after AVR or ARR in patients with BAV compared with patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV).

- **Methods**: Three hundred ninety-five patients who underwent AVR or ARR between 2002 and 2009 were studied. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were performed in 192 patients with BAV, and the results were compared with those of 203 patients with TAV. An AA diameter of 4.5 cm or greater was regarded as aneurysmal. Postoperative echocardiograms, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance images were compared with subsequent imaging at a median follow-up of 4.6 years (2.2–9.8 years).

- **Results**: Median ages of patients with BAV and patients with TAV were 57 ± 14 and 65 ± 16 years, respectively (p < 0.05). The preoperative diameter of the AA in the BAV group with no aneurysm (3.5 cm; range, 3.0–4.0 cm; n = 143) was significantly higher than in the TAV group (3.3 cm; range, 3.1–3.8 cm; n = 129) (p < 0.001). In both BAV and TAV groups with nonaneurysmal aortas who underwent AVR, there was no significant expansion of the AA and arch at 5 years' follow-up. In patients with aneurysmal aorta (BAV group, n = 49; TAV group, n = 74) who underwent ARR, there was also no significant difference in the growth of the remaining aorta at 3 and 5 years' follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: No significant dilatation of the remaining aorta was observed in these patient groups at follow-up intervals.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^111biNCD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

As a very novel approach, the 4.3 cm index TAA threshold will require external validation, application, and evaluation in a different MTAA patient population. However, this study's threshold has the potential to aid clinicians in identifying "at-risk" versus "not-at-risk" patient subgroups with MTAA. This is in contrast to the strategy which is based on best clinical judgment. A data-driven patient care plan will guide an optimal surveillance strategy for these patients and spare many the risk and exposure of unnecessary CT imaging.

### Long-term experience of girdling the ascending aorta with Dacron mesh as definitive treatment for aneurysmal dilation [^113fdCYk]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The management of the mildly to moderately dilated ascending aorta (3.5 to 4.9 cm) in cardiac surgery remains controversial. Therapeutic options have included radical aortic resection with synthetic graft substitution, external aortic reinforcement or wrap, with or without partial aortic wall excision, and a watch-and-wait approach. We reviewed our institutional experience with Dacron (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) mesh wrap support of dilated ascending aortas.

- **Methods**: During the last 20 years, 102 patients with aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta underwent wrapping of the ascending aorta with a fine Dacron mesh from the ventricular-aortic junction to the origin of the innominate artery. For the last 10 years, the wrap was anchored to the aortic annulus with pledgeted sutures. Aortic diameters up to 6 cm, without focal areas of thinning, were wrapped. Aortic diameters exceeding 6 cm, or with focal thinning, underwent tailored aortic wall resection and wrapping. Primary endpoints of the study included mortality, aortic diameter growth, dissection or rupture, or both.

- **Results**: The mean age of the group was 54.7 ± 19 years (range, 12 to 90 years). A single patient underwent aortic wrapping without cardiopulmonary bypass. Sixty-six patients (65%) required additional aortic valve surgery. Five patients (5%) had reinforcement of dilated sinuses with glutaraldehyde-treated pericardial patches combined with wrapping. Twenty-seven patients (26%) had combined coronary and valve surgery, and 2 patients had coronary revascularization alone. There was neither early termination nor deviation from protocol requirements.

### Surgical treatment of mild to moderately dilated ascending aorta in bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy: The art of safety and simplicity [^113HemgG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Management of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and associated complications remains controversial; however, strategies for management according to several clinical guidelines are evolving. For patients with BAV, an ascending aortic diameter over 4.0 cm should be considered for concomitant aortic replacement at aortic valve replacement (AVR) and if there is dilatation of the ascending aortic diameter over 0.5 cm per year. The reparative method that has gained popularity in recent years is the extravascular wrapping of the ascending aorta. This simple and effective prophylactic or corrective technique, though controversial, is useful in managing mild-to-moderately dilated ascending aorta patients who are at unacceptably high risk for more complex radical procedures. Examples of such patients include geriatric individuals or those with bleeding disorders, who benefit from reduction ascending plasty.

This method principally decreases the aortic diameter by excising an oval segment, placing a well-tailored Dacron vascular graft around the ascending aorta, and anchoring it with previously placed sutures driven through the sewing ring of the valve prosthesis and the aortic wall, or by simply conducting extravascular wrapping. This approach is far superior to the "wait-and-watch" method. Girding of the external aorta with a synthetic graft or mesh in selected cases of aneurysms is favorable because the native epithelial lining is maintained and the integrity of the aortic wall is improved. Therefore, it is reasonable and life-saving to offer patients undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery the opportunity to correct any aortic dilatation to prevent adverse future events.

### Decision-making algorithm for ascending aortic aneurysm: Effectiveness in clinical application [^1121e71r]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The risk of rupture and dissection in ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms increases as the aortic diameter exceeds 5 cm. This study evaluates the clinical effectiveness of a specific algorithm based on size and symptoms for preemptive surgery to prevent complications.

- **Methods**: A total of 781 patients with nondissecting ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms who presented electively for evaluation to our institution from 2011 to 2017 were triaged to surgery (n = 607, 77%) or medical observation (n = 181, 24%) based on a specific algorithm: surgery for large (> 5 cm) or symptomatic aneurysms. A total of 309 of 781 patients did not undergo surgery. Of these, 128 (16%) had been triaged to prompt repair but did not undergo surgery for a variety of reasons ("surgery noncompliant and overwhelming comorbidities" group). Another 181 patients (24%) were triaged to medical management ("medical" group).

- **Results**: In the "surgery noncompliant and overwhelming comorbidities" versus the "medical" group, mean aortic diameters were 5 ± 0.5 cm versus 4.45 ± 0.4 cm and aortic events (rupture/dissection) occurred in 17 patients (13.3%) versus 3 patients (1.7%) (P < .001). Later elective surgeries (representing late compliance in the "surgery noncompliant and overwhelming comorbidities group" or onset of growth or symptoms in the "medical" group) were conducted in 21 patients (16.4%) versus 15 patients (8.3%) (P = .04), respectively. Death ensued in 20 patients (15.6%) versus 6 patients (3.3%) (P < .001).

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^113zJnoS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Aortic dissection is a devastating disease that threatens life without premonitory signs. The surgical guidelines of the American Heart Association, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, and European Society of Cardiology recommend preemptive repair of ascending aorta aneurysms at a diameter of 5.5 cm and 5.0 cm for patients with connective tissue aortopathies whose malevolent behavior dictates a more aggressive approach and earlier intervention. The cutoff value of 5.5 cm corresponds to a steep rise in the respective risk curve. The threshold for intervention for patients with bicuspid aortic valve has varied over the years, with the most recent dedicated bicuspid valve guidelines from the American Heart Association, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, and European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery recommending a return to 5.5 cm for intervention.

Beyond intervention criterion values, the major adverse aortic events (MAAEs), defined as dissection, rupture, and death, pose a considerable threat to patients, exceeding operative risk at experienced centers.

Despite improved access to healthcare services, increased awareness of clinicians, implemented screening policies, and improved surgical outcomes, the prevalence of thoracic aortic disease has been reported on the increase. The study by Evangelista et al. from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection demonstrated that 60% of acutely dissected ascending aortas present with a diameter < 5.5 cm and 40% < 5.0 cm. Our recent study showed that population dynamics at least partially explain this phenomenon.

### Surgery for aortic dilatation in patients with bicuspid aortic valves: A statement of clarification from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^111wM1kd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Two guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and collaborating societies address the risk of aortic dissection in patients with bicuspid aortic valves and severe aortic enlargement. These are the "2010 ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Thoracic Aortic Disease" (J Am Coll Cardiol 2010;55:e27–130) and the "2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease" (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;63:e57–185).

However, the two guidelines differ with regard to the recommended threshold of aortic root or ascending aortic dilatation that would justify surgical intervention in patients with bicuspid aortic valves. The ACC and AHA therefore convened a subcommittee representing members of the two guideline writing committees to review the evidence, reach consensus, and draft a statement of clarification for both guidelines. This statement of clarification uses the ACC/AHA revised structure for delineating the Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence to provide recommendations that replace those contained in Section 9.2.2.1 of the thoracic aortic disease guideline and Section 5.1.3 of the valvular heart disease guideline.

### Correlation of structural defects in the ascending aortic wall to ultrasound parameters: benefits for decision-making process in aortic valve surgery [^112kydig]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Botzenhardt et al. have described a reduction of the aortic diameter in 10 patients with a pre-operative aortic diameter ≥ 4 cm, 4.8 years after the isolated valve surgery.

In contrast to these studies, Matsuyama et al. concluded that the clinical course of patients with a dilated ascending aorta is unpredictable and that aortic events may occur in patients with an aortic diameter of < 5 cm. The author also found that patients with TAV stenosis and a slightly dilated aorta are at risk of late aortic events. Therefore, they suggested preventive aortic surgery and AVR, even in patients with a slightly dilated ascending aorta with a diameter of 4 cm to 5 cm, except in cases of high operative risk.

Ergin et al. advocate for more liberal ascending aorta replacement in conjunction with AVR since it significantly improves postoperative outcomes compared to patients with AVR and an already dilated aorta.

Only a few studies have investigated histopathological defects of the aortic wall elastic skeleton in patients with aortic valve dysfunction, utilizing a limited number of elastic skeleton parameters. Roberts et al, using a semi-quantitative method, found that there is no significant loss of elastic fibers in patients with stenosis of the TAV compared to the control group. Bauer et al. showed that the thickness of elastic lamellae is decreased and the distance between elastic lamellae is increased significantly in patients with dilatation of the ascending aorta and TAV stenosis. Bechtel et al. found that patients with TAV stenosis and ascending aorta dilatation have more severe defects.

### Risk of aortic dissection in the moderately dilated ascending aorta [^117QjaFW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that many patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AD) present with aortic diameters of less than 55 mm, prompting discussion on the need to lower the prophylactic surgical guidelines. However, the risk of dissection at these smaller diameters is poorly defined.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study is to understand the risk of AD in moderately dilated ascending aortas using a large echocardiographic data set.

- **Methods**: Using an institutional echocardiography database, we identified 4,654 nonsyndromic adults (age: 68.6 ± 13.1 years; 1,003 women) with maximal ascending aortic diameters of 40 to 55 mm. We performed a competing risk analysis to determine the independent risk factors of AD or aortic rupture.

- **Results**: Five hundred eighty-six individuals (12.6%) had bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs). During follow-up (14,431.5 patient-years), AD and rupture occurred in 13 and 1 patients, respectively, demonstrating a linearized incidence of AD and/or rupture of 0.1% per patient-year. Elective ascending aortic repair was performed in 176 individuals. On multivariable analyses, independent predictors of AD and/or rupture were age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.12; p = 0.024) and baseline aortic diameters (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.36; p = 0.006). The presence of a BAV was not a significant factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.10 to 8.40; p = 0.95). Estimated risks of AD and/or rupture within 5 years were 0.4%, 1.1%, and 2.9% at baseline aortic diameters of 45, 50, and 55 mm, respectively.

Regarding surgical interventions for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, particularly concerning aortic repair, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend considering surgery to replace the intact aortic arch, descending aorta, or abdominal aorta at a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm. This is specifically for patients with LDS attributable to a pathogenic variant in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, or SMAD3. The specific genetic variant, patient age, aortic growth rate, family history, presence of high-risk features, and surgical risk should all inform the decision.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^116VUjGL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection indicate that the guideline criterion of 5.5 cm for ascending aortic intervention misses many dissections occurring at smaller dimensions. Furthermore, studies of natural behavior have generally treated the aortic root and the ascending aorta as one unit despite embryological, anatomical, and functional differences. This study aims to disentangle the natural histories of the aforementioned aortic segments, allowing natural behavior to define specific intervention criteria for root and ascending segments of the aorta.

- **Methods and results**: Diameters of the aortic root and mid‐ascending segment were measured separately. Long‐term complications (dissection, rupture, and death) were analyzed retrospectively for 1,162 patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Cox regression analysis suggested that aortic root dilatation (P = 0.017) is more significant in predicting adverse events than mid‐ascending aortic dilatation (P = 0.087). Short stature posed as a serious risk factor. The dedicated risk curves for the aortic root and the mid‐ascending aorta revealed hinge points at 5.0 and 5.25 cm, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The natural histories of the aortic root and mid‐ascending aorta are uniquely different. Dilation of the aortic root imparts a significantly higher risk of adverse events. A diameter shift for intervention to 5.0 cm for the aortic root and to 5.25 cm for the mid‐ascending aorta should be considered at expert centers.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113h2NTr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that the aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for 3-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size–adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was a significant factor.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to patients with other heritable aortic diseases, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend performing aortic repair when the maximal diameter of the aneurysm reaches ≥ 50 mm in asymptomatic patients. This applies to those with aneurysms of the aortic root or ascending aorta with nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease and no identified genetic cause. Additionally, there is no information on aortic diameters at the time of dissection or aneurysm repair in affected family members, and these patients have no high-risk features for adverse aortic events.

### Challenges in prompt identification and surgical correction of Marfan syndrome aortic disease in a middle-income country: a case series study [^116mNPj9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The guidelines emphasize monitoring the aortic root and ascending aorta in patients with MFS. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations, elective repair is advised when the diameter reaches 5.0 cm (Class 1, Level C-LD). Nevertheless, key risk factors for aortic complications have been identified; these factors include a family history of aortic dissection, rapid aortic growth (≥ 0.3 cm/year), diffuse dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, and marked vertebral arterial tortuosity. The guidelines suggest elective aortic root surgery after reaching 4.5 cm when these risk factors are present (Class 2, Level B-NR).

Additionally, dilation of other anatomical locations of the aorta is more likely to occur after aortic root replacement or previous dissection. For aneurysms in other aortic segments (arch, descending, or abdominal), operative intervention is considered reasonable when the aortic diameter reaches ≥ 5.0 cm for patients at acceptable operative risk or with a long life expectancy (Level 2a, Class C-EO).

However, optimal surgical timing and surgical outcomes are a concern. These guideline recommendations are based on observational studies and experts' opinions with mainly short-term and mid-term results. Moreover, the literature on the adequate treatment of MFS aortic disease in Latin America is even scarcer and limited.

Therefore, we aim to describe population characteristics, long-term survival, and re-intervention patterns in patients who underwent aortic surgery with a previously confirmed clinical diagnosis of MFS.

### Management of adults with normally functioning congenitally bicuspid aortic valves and dilated ascending aortas [^115eEc9q]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

We describe herein a 65-year-old woman who underwent resection of a dilated (5.1 cm) ascending aorta associated with a normally functioning congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. The patient provided the framework to discuss proper management — operative versus non-operative — of the dilated ascending aorta associated with a normally functioning bicuspid aortic valve. Unfortunately, there is inadequate data to provide an unequivocal answer to this dilemma. Operative intervention requires that the short-term risk of the prophylactic procedure be considerably lower than the long-term risk of aortic dissection/rupture without operative intervention. Because there is no proof that operative intervention provides less morbidity and lower mortality, non-operative management at this time seems to be the better approach.

### Not so NICE guidelines for patients with aortic aneurysms [^114TAvAn]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). High credibility.

Recent draft guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) regarding the management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have proven to be controversial, leading to a prolonged period of consultation and review. NICE was established to reduce variation in the availability and quality of treatments provided by the National Health Service (NHS). While government-funded, it represents an independent body. The legislation relating to NICE means that any guidance produced only applies in England.

Guidance is drawn up by independent guideline development groups. Once a specific topic is referred to NICE, the group is selected to include medical professionals with clinical and academic expertise, and representatives of patient and carer groups. They follow a defined rigorous process of literature analysis, weighted towards randomized controlled trials. This approach aims to assess value for money by calculating additional 'Quality Adjusted Life Years' (QALYs) that each treatment modality confers. For aortic aneurysms, QALYs are calculated by estimating the number of years each treatment modality provides benefits and any change in the quality of life each provides.

The number of extra QALYs is then compared against the calculated cost of open repair (OR) or endovascular repair (EVAR), to determine a 'cost per QALY' for each. The net health benefit can then be derived. When combined with the cost of treatment, this is used to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

Traditional criterion for intervention on an asymptomatic ascending aortic aneurysm has been a maximal aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or more. The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association aortic guidelines adopted cross-sectional aortic area/height ratio, aortic size index, and aortic height index as alternate parameters for surgical intervention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of using these newer indices on patient eligibility for surgical intervention in a prospective, multicenter cohort with moderate-sized ascending aortic aneurysms between 5.0 and 5.4 cm.

Patients enrolled from 2018 to 2023 in the randomization or registry arms of the multicenter trial, Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance (TITAN: SvS), were included in the study. Clinical data were captured prospectively in an online database. Imaging data were derived from a core computed laboratory.

Among the 329 included patients, 20% were female. The mean age was 65.0 ± 11.6 years, and the mean maximal aortic diameter was 50.8 ± 3.9 mm. In the one-third of all patients (n = 109) who met any one of the three criteria (i.e. aortic size index ≥ 3.08 cm/m², aortic height index ≥ 3.21 cm/m, or cross-sectional aortic area/height ≥ 10 cm²/m), their mean maximal aortic diameter was 52.5 ± 0.52 mm. Alternate criteria were most commonly met in women compared with men: 20% versus 2% for aortic size index (P < .001), 39% versus 5% for aortic height index (P < .001), and 39% versus 21% for cross-sectional aortic area/height (P = .002), respectively.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112cNPD4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for three-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size-adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was independently associated with growth rate.

### Management of dilated ascending aorta during aortic valve replacement: valve replacement alone versus aorta wrapping versus aorta replacement [^115Cmw25]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal management of a dilated ascending aorta during aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains controversial. This study compared the outcomes among three different management strategies: AVR alone, aorta wrapping, and aorta replacement for the dilated ascending aorta.

The study enrolled 499 consecutive non-Marfan patients undergoing AVR in the presence of ascending aorta dilation (40 to 55 mm). We evaluated rates of death and aortic events, and additionally assessed the aortic expansion rate through serial echocardiography.

The surgeries involved AVR alone (n = 362), aorta wrapping (n = 67), and aorta replacement (n = 70). Early mortality occurred in 1.2% (n = 6, P = .61). Throughout 1590.0 patient-years of follow-up, 47 deaths occurred. The 5-year survival rates were 90.1% ± 2.0%, 91.8% ± 3.5%, and 82.2% ± 7.5% in the AVR alone, aorta wrapping, and aorta replacement groups, respectively (P = .64).

One aortic event (acute type A dissection) occurred in the AVR alone group. For the AVR alone group, the median aortic expansion rate was -0.6 mm/year (interquartile range, -3.2 to 0.6 mm/year). The aortic expansion rates were influenced neither by the morphology of aortic valves (bicuspid vs tricuspid; p = 0.10) nor by the initial aorta diameter (γ = -0.31, P = .61). Clinically relevant aortic expansion (≥ 5 mm/year) was observed only in five patients; of these patients, two exhibited an aortic diameter of 60 mm or greater at the end of follow-up.

Compared with concomitant aortic wrapping or replacement, AVR alone achieved similar clinical outcomes.

Regarding surgical interventions for thoracic aortic aneurysm, specifically concerning aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysm repair, the EACTS/STS 2024 guidelines recommend surgery for low-surgical-risk patients with non-syndromic, tricuspid aortic valve with an 'ascending phenotype' and a maximum aortic diameter of ≥ 50 mm if any of the following conditions are present:

- **Age is associated with risk**: Consider if the patient's age is 11 years or older with corresponding risk factors.

- **Aortic diameter growth rate**: Surgery is recommended if the growth rate exceeds 3 mm per year.

- **Refractory hypertension**: Indicates the consideration of surgical intervention.

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage the patient in discussion about surgical options to ensure informed consent.

### Early surgical intervention versus watchful waiting and outcomes for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation [^111nkHey]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The management of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation remains controversial. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to assess the long-term outcomes and incidence of cardiac complications among asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation who either underwent early operation, in the absence of any class I or class IIa guideline triggers, or were managed conservatively and eventually underwent operation whenever these triggers appeared.

A total of 160 consecutive asymptomatic patients (50 ± 17 years) with severe aortic regurgitation were prospectively followed up for a median of 7.2 years. Overall and cardiovascular survivals and the need for repeat aortic regurgitation surgery were evaluated in both an "early surgery" group (n = 91) and a "conservatively managed" group (n = 69).

Ten-year overall (91% ± 4% vs. 89% ± 5%, P = .87) and cardiovascular (96% ± 2% vs. 96% ± 3%, P = .79) survivals were similar among the early surgery and conservatively managed groups. Conservatively managed patients were further sub-stratified according to the regularity and quality of their follow-up. Patients who were regularly followed up by a certified cardiologist had better 10-year overall survival than patients undergoing no or looser follow-up (95% ± 5% vs. 79% ± 10%, P = .045). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified age (P = .003) and male gender (P = .024) as independent predictors of survival. Early surgical management was not a predictor of outcome (P = .45).

Our results show that the outcome of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation is largely dependent on the quality and regularity of follow-up with a certified cardiologist.

### EACTS/STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^115ihn4j]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^114x6MGu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection indicate that the guideline criterion of 5.5 cm for ascending aortic intervention misses many dissections occurring at smaller dimensions. Furthermore, studies of natural behavior have generally treated the aortic root and the ascending aorta as one unit despite embryological, anatomical, and functional differences. This study aims to disentangle the natural histories of the aforementioned aortic segments, allowing natural behavior to define specific intervention criteria for root and ascending segments of the aorta.

- **Methods and results**: Diameters of the aortic root and mid-ascending segment were measured separately. Long-term complications (dissection, rupture, and death) were analyzed retrospectively for 1162 patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Cox regression analysis suggested that aortic root dilatation (P = 0.017) is more significant in predicting adverse events than mid-ascending aortic dilatation (P = 0.087). Short stature posed as a serious risk factor. The dedicated risk curves for the aortic root and the mid-ascending aorta revealed hinge points at 5.0 and 5.25 cm, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The natural histories of the aortic root and mid-ascending aorta are uniquely different. Dilation of the aortic root imparts a significantly higher risk of adverse events. A diameter shift for intervention to 5.0 cm for the aortic root and to 5.25 cm for the mid-ascending aorta should be considered at expert centers.

### Indications for repair of the aneurysmal aorta [^11538at2]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Aneurysmal dilation is one of the primary pathologies necessitating surgical intervention on the ascending aorta. Aortic aneurysms are largely asymptomatic; thus, knowledge of the natural history and risks associated with surgical intervention is critical. Surgical replacement is indicated when the risk of spontaneous rupture or dissection surpasses the risk of significant complications associated with surgical intervention. Maximum diameter is the major predictor of complications for aortic aneurysm. The presence of a connective tissue disorder modifies this effect. For the purposes of this article, we will discuss aneurysms of the aorta proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Indications for patients with and without connective tissue disorder will be discussed separately.

### Descending threshold for ascending aortic aneurysmectomy: Is it time for a "left-shift" in guidelines [^112SQ45B]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the management of thoracic aortic disease recommend that the ascending aorta be replaced when it reaches the size of 5.5 cm. Recently emerging data suggest that this criterion may need to be shifted to the left, signifying a recommendation to operate on patients with smaller aortic sizes.

The data that support the need for a leftward shift in the guidelines include:

- **Novel and more granular data on the natural history**: Recent studies on ascending aortic aneurysms between 5 and 6 cm show that two hinge risk points exist — one at 5.25 cm and the other at 5.75 cm.
- **Aortic diameter considerations**: The aortic diameter before the moment of aortic dissection is at least 7 mm smaller than the post-dissection aortic size.
- **Imaging assessment advancements**: The advent of a semi-automated centerline method of imaging assessment seems to underestimate true ascending aortic size.
- **Surgical safety**: Aortic surgery in the present era is very safe, and its benefits outweigh the associated risks.
- **Genetic insights**: Genetic testing via high-throughput next-generation sequencing identifies genetic defects responsible for aortic catastrophes at smaller aortic sizes.
- **Familial aortic dissection**: Occurrence suggests that family members of an aortic dissection victim who harbor a sizable aneurysm should be operated on regardless of aortic size.

### Debate: Whether evidence supports reducing the threshold diameter to 5 cm for elective interventions in women with abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115RRP32]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines recommend repair of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms once they reach the 5.5-cm diameter threshold and are based on information from randomized controlled trials. However, because aneurysms are more common in men, women are under-represented in these trials, and questions persist about whether this repair threshold should apply to them. In addition, women have smaller aortas to begin with and in most aneurysm cohorts are older, have more atherosclerotic risk factors, are less likely to be anatomic candidates for endovascular repair, and do poorer after emergency or elective repair of their aneurysm. These are just some of the issues that our discussants address in determining whether the repair threshold should be at a smaller diameter for women.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113bVFup]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is typically defined as an aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger. The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past two decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries. The prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture, although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size. The associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of one-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0–5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening.

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years.

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA.

### A systematic review supporting the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines on the management of heritable aortopathies [^116CgXQ8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

To support the development of clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients with genetic aortopathies and arteriopathies, a writing committee from the Society for Vascular Surgery has commissioned this systematic review.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and searched multiple databases for studies addressing six questions identified by the Society for Vascular Surgery guideline committee about evaluating and managing patients with genetic aortopathies and arteriopathies. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers.

- **Results**: We included 12 studies in this systematic review. We did not identify studies about the long-term outcomes of endovascular repair for aortic aneurysm in patients with heritable aortopathy or about new aortic events in pregnant women with a history of aortic dissection (AD) or aneurysm. A small case series demonstrated a 100% survival rate and 100% aortic intervention-free survival at 15 months (range, 7–28 months) after endograft repair for type B AD. A positive genetic diagnosis was discovered in 36% of patients with aortic aneurysms and dissections who had no risk factors for hereditary aortopathies, and these patients had a mortality rate of 11% at a median follow-up duration of 5 months. Black patients had lower 30-day mortality than White patients (5.6% vs 9.0%, respectively), but they had a higher overall aortic reintervention rate at 30 days after AD repair (47% vs 27%, respectively). Aortic reinterventions owing to aneurysmal expansion and endoleak at 30 days were higher in Black patients.

### National adherence to medical management of aortic aneurysms [^114sx6mY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe levels of adherence to guideline-based medical management in patients with aortic aneurysms, using an analogous population with coronary artery disease as a comparator. Adherence among those with aortic aneurysms has never been studied.

Adult patients with an aortic aneurysm or coronary artery disease diagnosed between 2004 and 2018 in the Optum Clinformatics deidentified Datamart were queried. Aneurysms were subclassified as thoracic, abdominal, or both. Receipt of an antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic was determined through pharmacy claims. Adherence was determined as receipt of the indicated pharmacologic(s) following a diagnosis of aneurysm or coronary artery disease. Adherence was compared between those with aneurysms and coronary disease using univariable logistic regression.

After exclusions, 194,144 patients with an aortic aneurysm and 3,946,782 with coronary artery disease were identified. Overall adherence was low (45.0%) and differed significantly by aneurysm subtype: highest in isolated thoracic (45.9%) and lowest in isolated abdominal aneurysms (42.6%). Adherence levels declined significantly after one year by about 15% in each aneurysm subtype. All subtypes of aneurysm had a significantly lower odds of adherence compared to those with coronary disease with odds ranging from 0.61 in those with isolated abdominal aneurysms to 0.80 with isolated thoracic aneurysms.

Adherence among those with aortic aneurysms is very low, differs by subtype, and declines with time.

### Early impact of aortic wrapping on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with mild to moderate ascending aorta dilatation [^114q3ioR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

It is generally accepted that ascending aorta dilatation beyond 5 cm should be surgically replaced. However, opinions are divided on how mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta, less than 5 cm, should be treated. In these cases, considering the higher surgical risk of ascending aorta replacement, some surgeons favor a "watch and wait" approach until surgery is clearly indicated. Conversely, other surgeons recommend early surgical intervention, especially when patients also require surgical correction of aortic valve pathology, due to the increased risk of subsequent rupture and dissection. Various surgical options have been implemented in such circumstances, ranging from composite graft replacement to more conservative aortic reduction by aortoplasty with or without external reinforcement. However, there is limited information on the natural history of the remaining aorta following such procedures.

Here, we report our preliminary experience with a simple method of ascending aorta reduction using Dacron graft wrapping in patients with ascending aortic dilatation of 4.0–5.0 cm during aortic valve procedure, and its early favorable impact on the rest of the aortic dimensions following surgery.

### Dilatation of the ascending aorta - growth rate, risk factors and clinical outcomes in the long-term follow-up [^114Apfys]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the risk factors, growth rate, and outcomes of ascending aortic (AA) dilatation in patients scheduled for imaging follow-up, a retrospective study was conducted. It included 143 patients who were followed up with thoracic aortic CT-angiography. AA diameters were measured from the aortic root (sinus Valsalva) and mid-AA at baseline and after long-term follow-up. Risk factors and clinical outcomes were collected from medical records. The standard error of measurement (SEM) method was used to assess the statistical significance of the growth rate of AA dilatation.

The patients' mean age was 64.0 ± 10.0 years, with males constituting 80.4% (n = 115). The mean imaging follow-up time was 3.4 ± 1.6 years, and 5.7 ± 1.7 years in the clinical follow-up. According to the SEM method, 37.8% of the patients (n = 54) experienced significant AA growth; 18.9% (n = 27) in the aortic root (0.5 ± 0.7 mm/year) and 24.5% (n = 35) in the mid-AA (0.4 ± 0.5 mm/year). None of the patients experienced aortic rupture, dissection, or died due to aortic reasons during the follow-up. Eighteen patients (12.6%) underwent elective surgical AA reconstruction, and 10 patients (7.0%) died due to reasons not related to the aorta. Male gender was the only factor associated with significant accelerated growth (p = 0.047), while antihypertensive medication appeared to be a protective factor (p = 0.01).

In conclusion, less than half of the patients followed due to AA dilatation displayed significant AA growth during the long-term follow-up, and the growth rate per year was small.

### Sex-specific thoracic aortic dimensions and clinical implications [^113AhXYh]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with a dilated thoracic aorta are at risk for aortic complications such as aortic dissection or rupture. While these aortic complications result in high mortality rates, aortic dilatation often remains asymptomatic for a long period of time. Therefore, identification and treatment of individuals with a dilated aorta are of paramount importance, as diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options are available. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines define an aorta as dilated if the diameter exceeds 40 mm. Furthermore, preventive surgery is recommended for aortic diameters above 55 mm for both women and men.

Although thoracic aortic aneurysms are less prevalent in women compared to men, the consequences are more severe for women. Female patients with an aortic dissection have poorer surgical outcomes and a higher mortality rate than men. Additionally, the growth rate of a thoracic aneurysm is greater in women compared to men.

As medicine advances, personalized medicine is emerging as a significant development. The most relevant patient characteristics considered in medicine are age, sex, and comorbidities such as diabetes. However, for aortic complications, information on subgroups is limited, as data in older patients are sparse and currently used cut-off values are based on a cohort of relatively young people. In addition to the lack of data on age, thoracic aortic diameter values have been determined regardless of sex. Consequently, one-size-fits-all cut-off values are used, while the Framingham Heart Study indicates potential variations that should be considered.

### Spiral aortoplasty for dilated ascending aorta: a new technique for high-risk patients with combined procedures [^113k3nMj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Ascending aorta dilatation is sometimes concomitantly associated with aortic valve disease. It is generally recommended to surgically intervene on the ascending aorta once the maximum diameter is above 4.5 cm in the setting of other surgical cardiac procedures to avoid the possible risk of future aorta dilatation or the possibility of aortic dissection and rupture.

The dilated ascending aorta can be surgically addressed by radical ascending aorta replacement with a tube graft or by the less popular and more conservative reduction aortoplasty, with or without external wrapping. The following sections describe a modified reduction aortoplasty with concomitant cardiac procedures in high-risk patients.
