## Question

appendicitis differentials and work up for pediatric patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and workup for pediatric appendicitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why pediatric appendicitis is challenging. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis. Next, I will outline the initial clinical assessment, including history, exam, and labs. After that, I need to detail the imaging strategy, including ultrasound-first pathways and what to do when ultrasound is equivocal. Then, I should integrate risk stratification tools and decision support. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I verify each claim against high-quality guidelines and studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Pediatric appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children, yet diagnosis remains challenging because symptoms and signs are nonspecific and vary with age, leading to both missed diagnoses and unnecessary imaging or surgery; importantly, delays in diagnosis are associated with higher perforation rates and worse outcomes, so I need to ensure my approach balances timeliness with safety and stewardship [^851a0927] [^87214bb7] [^4e17acfa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a prioritized differential that reflects what commonly mimics appendicitis in children. Gastrointestinal causes include mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, constipation, intussusception, Meckel diverticulitis, and ileocecitis; genitourinary causes include urinary tract infection, ovarian torsion, and ectopic pregnancy in adolescents; respiratory causes like pneumonia can present with abdominal pain; and infectious mimics such as parasitic infections, particularly in newcomer populations, should be considered, especially when the presentation is atypical or refractory to initial management [^e143b235] [^c6747748] [^54888e46] [^075a2da6].

> I need to check the initial clinical assessment elements that meaningfully shift pretest probability. Fever increases the likelihood of appendicitis, while its absence decreases it; migration of pain from periumbilical to right lower quadrant is more informative than isolated right lower quadrant pain; rebound tenderness substantially increases risk; and a WBC less than 10,000/µL or an ANC 6,750/µL or lower meaningfully lowers risk, so I should document these features carefully and combine them rather than rely on any single sign or symptom [^affc2d07].

> Next, I should review the laboratory workup. Routine labs should include CBC with differential, CRP, and urinalysis; I initially thought to add procalcitonin routinely, but wait, let me verify availability and evidence — WSES notes procalcitonin and calprotectin may improve discrimination when available, yet they are not universally accessible, so I should not overstate their routine use; importantly, I should avoid routine blood cultures in non-immunocompromised children without systemic instability or concern for resistant organisms, and I should avoid routine intra-abdominal cultures in uncomplicated cases undergoing appendectomy [^c71b4783] [^c9619931] [^da8dbef4] [^43ff33e2].

> Now, I will examine the imaging strategy, and I need to ensure I anchor this to guideline hierarchies. Ultrasound is the preferred first-line modality in children because it avoids radiation, is safe, and has good diagnostic performance when performed and interpreted expertly; however, it is operator-dependent and can be nondiagnostic, so I should set expectations accordingly and plan for contingencies [^851a0927] [^062fd722] [^ab82e237] [^88e1d68e].

> Let me consider performance characteristics to calibrate decision thresholds. High-quality emergency medicine policies report ultrasound sensitivity around 78–100% and specificity around 88–97% depending on the cohort and operator expertise, while CT demonstrates sensitivity around 95–97% and specificity around 93–100%; MRI achieves comparable accuracy to CT in children without radiation but may require sedation and is not universally available, so modality choice after equivocal ultrasound should be individualized to local resources and patient factors [^f2a4449c] [^5027359e] [^206da35f] [^1042290c].

> I should double-check the second-line pathway when ultrasound is equivocal or nondiagnostic. Guidelines suggest MRI or CT as subsequent imaging rather than repeating ultrasound, with MRI preferred to avoid radiation when feasible; if MRI is unavailable or sedation is problematic, low-dose contrast-enhanced CT is acceptable, and some centers may use a short-interval repeat ultrasound with surgical consultation, though evidence quality varies and shared decision-making with families is essential [^79e78bc3] [^6db333cc] [^6f10c9e6].

> But wait, what if clinical suspicion is very high or very low. I need to ensure I do not over-image low-risk patients or delay care in high-risk patients. Risk-stratification tools such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score and, more recently, the pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC) can help; pARC has shown strong discrimination and can safely reclassify many patients, reducing unnecessary imaging and interventions, though I should confirm local validation and integration with EHR workflows before relying on it routinely [^79c027d7] [^c6d4a88a].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In children under 5, presentations are often atypical and perforation risk is higher, so I should maintain a lower threshold for imaging and surgical consultation; in adolescents, I must consider gynecologic etiologies and pregnancy testing; in children with obesity, ultrasound visualization is more challenging, so I should anticipate a higher need for second-line imaging; and in recently immigrated children, I should consider parasitic infections and, when appropriate, obtain stool ova and parasite testing, recognizing turnaround time limitations and the need for close follow-up [^5b999885] [^54888e46] [^075a2da6] [^74729654].

> I will now examine documentation and communication priorities. I need to record pretest probability, which clinical features push me toward or away from appendicitis, the imaging pathway and rationale, and the shared decision-making discussion with caregivers, especially when choosing between observation, repeat imaging, or transfer; this aligns with pediatric radiology and emergency medicine policies emphasizing stewardship and family-centered care [^fe78487b] [^5d451574].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with history, exam, and basic labs to assign initial risk; if risk is low and the child is well-appearing, consider discharge with return precautions; if risk is intermediate, obtain ultrasound; if ultrasound is positive, proceed to surgical consultation; if ultrasound is negative or equivocal, observe with serial exams or obtain MRI or CT based on availability and clinical concern; if risk is high, proceed directly to surgical consultation and consider early imaging only if it will change management or if the diagnosis is uncertain; throughout, use clinical judgment and avoid unnecessary radiation or delays [^851a0927] [^062fd722] [^ab82e237] [^635916cf].

> Finally, I should confirm key safety pearls to prevent common pitfalls. Do not rely on a single sign or symptom; do not delay necessary imaging or surgical consultation out of concern for radiation when the child is high risk; do not overuse CT in low-risk children; and do not forget age-appropriate differentials and the possibility of delayed diagnosis in children with subtle presentations, which is precisely where structured risk tools and careful follow-up can mitigate harm [^affc2d07] [^87214bb7] [^4e17acfa] [^851a0927].

In children with suspected appendicitis, the most common mimics are **mesenteric adenitis**, **gastroenteritis**, **constipation**, **urinary tract infection**, and **ovarian/testicular pathology** [^e143b235]. A **stepwise approach** is essential: start with clinical assessment and labs (CBC, CRP, urinalysis) [^c71b4783], then use ultrasound as first-line imaging [^851a0927]; if ultrasound is inconclusive, obtain MRI or CT based on availability and clinical urgency [^79e78bc3]. This strategy balances diagnostic accuracy with minimizing radiation and avoiding unnecessary surgery [^119fa287].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **key mimics** of appendicitis in children include:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal | - Mesenteric adenitis [^c6747748] <br/> - Gastroenteritis <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Intussusception <br/> - Meckel diverticulitis <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease [^e143b235] |
| Genitourinary | - Urinary tract infection <br/> - Pyelonephritis <br/> - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Ovarian torsion <br/> - Ectopic pregnancy (adolescents) <br/> - Testicular torsion [^e143b235] |
| Respiratory | - Pneumonia (lower lobe) <br/> - Pleurisy [^e143b235] |
| Infectious | - Parasitic infections (e.g. Dientamoeba fragilis) [^54888e46] <br/> - Yersinia enterocolitica <br/> - Tuberculosis [^notfound] |
| Other | - Henoch-Schönlein purpura <br/> - Sickle cell crisis <br/> - Diabetic ketoacidosis <br/> - Trauma [^e143b235] |

---

## Clinical assessment

A thorough **clinical assessment** is the foundation of diagnosis:

- **History**: Characterize pain (onset, location, migration, severity), associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, dysuria), and recent illnesses or trauma [^affc2d07].
- **Physical examination**: Assess for rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, and evaluate for dehydration or systemic toxicity [^affc2d07].
- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain CBC with differential, CRP, and urinalysis. Leukocytosis and elevated CRP support appendicitis, but normal values do not exclude it [^c71b4783] [^affc2d07].

---

## Imaging strategy

Imaging is critical when the diagnosis is uncertain. Ultrasound is **first-line** because it avoids radiation and is highly specific when positive [^851a0927] [^062fd722]; however, it is operator-dependent and may be inconclusive [^74729654]. MRI is preferred as **second-line** when available because it avoids radiation and has high accuracy, though access and sedation needs may limit use [^79e78bc3] [^bf36e630]. CT is reserved for **equivocal cases** or when MRI is unavailable, using low-dose protocols to minimize radiation [^79e78bc3] [^6db333cc].

---

## Clinical decision support tools

Clinical decision support tools, such as the **Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)** and the **pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC)**, can aid risk stratification and reduce unnecessary imaging and interventions [^c6d4a88a] [^c599e803].

---

## Management considerations

- **Uncomplicated appendicitis**: Operative management remains the gold standard, though nonoperative management with antibiotics is a reasonable alternative in selected cases [^2989b5d0] [^a26fa4b8].
- **Complicated appendicitis**: Operative management is generally recommended, with consideration of interval appendectomy after initial nonoperative management [^f6085c78] [^d1f8c67c].
- **Timing of surgery**: Early appendectomy within 8 hours is recommended for complicated cases, while uncomplicated cases may undergo delayed surgery without increased risk [^881ab8d6] [^29c92553].

---

## Conclusion

A structured approach to pediatric appendicitis — clinical assessment, selective labs, and imaging — effectively distinguishes appendicitis from its mimics. Ultrasound-first imaging with MRI or CT as needed balances accuracy with safety, and **clinical decision support** further improves diagnostic efficiency [^851a0927] [^79e78bc3] [^c6d4a88a].

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSuspected appendicitis-child [^bcd5a2f9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis represents the most common abdominal surgical urgency/emergency in children. Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and has been shown to facilitate management and decrease the rate of negative appendectomies. The initial consideration for imaging in a child with suspected acute appendicitis is based on clinical assessment, which can be facilitated with published scoring systems. The level of clinical risk (low, intermediate, high) and the clinical scenario (suspicion for complication) define the need for imaging and the optimal imaging modality. In some situations, no imaging is required, while in others ultrasound, CT, or MRI may be appropriate. This review frames the presentation of suspected acute appendicitis in terms of the clinical risk and also discusses the unique situations of the equivocal or nondiagnostic initial ultrasound examination and suspected appendicitis with suspicion for complication (eg, bowel obstruction). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Management of suspected appendicitis in children [^35f9bc6d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most important cause of abdominal pain in children and is the commonest that requires emergency surgery. Prompt diagnosis, immediate referral and expeditious surgery should be undertaken to reduce the risk of a perforated appendix. The initial presentation may be atypical or be similar to another pathological process which makes the diagnosis extremely difficult. Risk assessment forms an important part in the management of these cases. We consider the difficulties in making the diagnosis including: (A) the pitfalls of clinical examination; (B) the usefulness of laboratory testing; (C) the relevance of clinical scoring systems; and (D) the controversial issue of imaging.

### Pitfalls in appendicitis [^fb49f575]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is no single historical or physical finding or laboratory test that can definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the rational use of various imaging modalities, such as CT scanning and ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, and pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues to be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of all tests in suspected appendicitis can improve the emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease.

Introduction

Appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency, estimated to be the cause of roughly 10% of acute abdominal pain cases presenting to an emergency department. The condition is notoriously variable in presenting symptoms and as a result, has received sizeable investment in improved diagnostics, antibiotics, and surgical management to drastically reduce mortality and morbidity. In addition to a growing chorus of concern regarding parasitic causes of appendicitis, the rise in global migration with the emerging field of newcomer medicine in the United States has brought renewed attention to confounding presentations. Newcomers, who are children who immigrated less than 3 years prior, experience barriers to high quality health care and could be at greater risk for increased morbidity from unnecessary testing and delayed diagnosis. With an increasing understanding of parasitosis burden in recently immigrated children, there is a strong imperative to examine our current appendicitis differential diagnosis paradigms.

### Imaging of acute appendicitis in children: EU versus U.S… or US versus CT? A north American perspective [^2e65a431]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The timing, type, and technique of imaging evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children are all debated. This debate is both local and international. The fact is that choices in imaging evaluation will depend on both local and national influences, which are reasonable and to be expected. There still is a responsibility, though, for those involved with evaluation of patients with possible appendicitis to come to agreement about an appropriate diagnostic pathway that considers standards of care and available resources.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^635916cf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Suspected appendicitis — initial testing and consultation approach is outlined: Not every patient with possible appendicitis needs abdominal imaging, and not all patients with possible appendicitis require diagnostic tests. Patients with very low clinical suspicion for appendicitis may be discharged with minimal or no testing, whereas patients with high clinical suspicion may be referred to a surgeon, with minimal or no testing, and if the clinical presentation warrants, a surgical consultant should be notified as early as is clinically warranted.

### Current approach to the diagnosis and emergency department management of appendicitis in children [^d6bdc90b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Concerns about radiation exposure have led to a decrease in the use of computed tomography in suspected appendicitis, with increased reliance on ultrasound. Children with suspected appendicitis should be risk stratified using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, white blood cell count, and ultrasound in order to guide further evaluation and management. Magnetic resonance imaging is a promising imaging modality but remains costly. Ongoing research is evaluating the role of nonoperative management in children with confirmed appendicitis.

### Pediatric appendicitis [^31eb09de]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical pathologies in children. It can present with right lower quadrant pain. Scoring systems in combination with selective imaging and surgical examination will diagnose most children with appendicitis. Clinical pathways should be used. Most surgical interventions for appendicitis are now almost exclusively laparoscopic, with trials demonstrating better outcomes for children who undergo index hospitalization appendectomies when perforated. Nonoperative management has a role in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. This article discusses the workup and management, modes of treatment, and continued areas of controversy in pediatric appendicitis.

Pediatric appendicitis — certainty and applicability indicate that the certainty of the above evidence was evaluated as low for pediatrics, with critical outcomes primarily limited by small sample size and nonsignificant confidence intervals. This recommendation likely does not apply equally to adult and pediatric patients who are immunocompromised or have widely perforated appendicitis (i.e. purulent fluid in all quadrants of the abdomen), and particularly in the immunocompromised group, the initial presentation and morbidity of postoperative abscess may differ from the general population.

### Beyond acute appendicitis: imaging of additional pathologies of the pediatric appendix [^73483707]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary acute appendicitis is by far the most common pathological condition affecting the appendix. There are differential diagnoses, however, when an abnormal appendix is found by imaging. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the imaging and clinical manifestations of less common appendiceal abnormalities in children. Familiarity with these alternative diagnoses might be particularly helpful in guiding management of the child whose clinical presentation is not typical for primary acute appendicitis.

### Controversies in emergency radiology: acute appendicitis in children – the case for CT [^2aa17159]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgical intervention in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is often not straightforward and can be challenging. Approximately one-third of children with the condition have atypical clinical findings and are initially managed nonoperatively. There is currently great variability in the utilization of imaging for the assessment of suspected acute appendicitis in children. The principal imaging modalities utilized are graded-compression sonography and CT. Sonography has important diagnostic limitations that are addressed by CT. The principal advantages of CT include its operator independency, with resultant higher diagnostic accuracy, enhanced delineation of disease extent in perforated appendicitis, and improved patient outcomes including decreased negative laparotomy and perforation rates.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^87214bb7]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which clinical features are associated with delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis, and to what extent are delays preventable?

Findings

In this case-control study of 748 children, those who experienced delayed diagnosis had less clinically apparent symptoms; among children for whom imaging would have been cost-effective, 22% to 61% received it.

Meaning

These findings suggest that undertesting for appendicitis may account for a considerable fraction of cases of delayed diagnosis of appendicitis.

### Practical imaging strategies for acute appendicitis in children [^716de0d8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Diagnosing pediatric appendicitis is difficult because clinical findings are nonspecific. Improved accuracy can be obtained with ultrasound (US), CT, or MRI, despite considerable variation in their use at different institutions. This article reviews the evidence for best practices in imaging pediatric appendicitis.

Conclusion

When each modality is optimally used, a stepwise imaging approach that begins with graded compression US and proceeds to CT or MRI in select cases is currently best practice.

Q.1.6: What is the optimum pathway for imaging in pediatric patients with suspected acute appendicitis?

US is currently the recommended initial imaging study of choice for the diagnosis of AA in pediatric and young adult patients. US has been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy for AA as an initial imaging investigation and to reduce or obviate the need for further imaging without increased complications or unacceptable increases in length of stay.

However, the sensitivity and specificity of US for the diagnosis of pediatric AA varies across studies: it is well known that US is operator dependent and may be dependent on patient-specific factors, including BMI.

A retrospective study assessing the ability of US to identify complicated AA or an appendicolith showed that US has a high specificity and negative predictive value to exclude complicated AA and the presence of an appendicolith in children being considered for non-operative management of uncomplicated AA.

The study by Bachur et al. found that, among children with suspected AA, the use of US imaging has increased substantially (from 24.0% in 2010 to 35.3% in 2013), whereas the use of CT has decreased (from 21.4% in 2010 to 11.6% in 2013). However, important condition-specific quality measures, including the frequency of appendiceal perforation and readmissions, remained stable, and the proportion of negative appendectomy declined slightly.

The use of CT in the pediatric population can be reduced by using appropriate clinical and/or staged algorithm based on US/MRI implementation, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97% and by applying imaging scoring system, such as the Appy-Score for reporting limited right lower quadrant US exams, that performs well for suspected pediatric AA.

Educational Objectives

Appendicitis is a common presentation in pediatric urgent cares, emergency departments, and primary clinic sites that can have various confounding presentations, and this case directs the reader's attention to Dientamoeba fragilis, a parasite that can go overlooked when evaluating and working up acute abdominal pain.
With the rise of global migration and the burgeoning discipline of newcomer medicine, the case report concludes that the role of expanded infectious workups with the consideration of stool ova and parasite testing for abdominal pain in these vulnerable populations is critical for providing high-value care.

Acute appendicitis — adults: CT is advised as the initial imaging step, with the guideline specifying "CT as the initial imaging modality to diagnose acute appendicitis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". When CT is chosen, "Intravenous (IV) contrast is usually appropriate whenever a CT is obtained in adults with suspected acute appendicitis; however, CT without IV contrast also has high diagnostic accuracy in detecting acute appendicitis and may be appropriate". Additional testing is generally unnecessary because "immediate additional imaging studies beyond CT are usually not necessary", and if CT is negative but suspicion persists clinicians should "consider observation and supportive care, with or without antibiotics; if clinical suspicion is high, consider surgical intervention". The document also notes that "US, when definitively positive or definitively negative, and MRI are also reasonably accurate and may precede CT, depending on the patient and clinical circumstances".

- On the basis of class B evidence and consensus, ultrasonography is the test of choice when acute appendicitis is suspected but is unclear based on history, physical examination, and laboratory results. (17)(18)(19)
- On the basis of class B evidence and consensus, the use of computed tomography scan should be limited to cases of suspected complex appendicitis with abscess or when there is clinical suspicion for acute appendicitis but ultrasonography results are not helpful. (16)
- On the basis of class C evidence and consensus, children with possible appendicitis ideally should be treated in medical centers that have skilled sonographic personnel. (21)
- On the basis of class B evidence and consensus, simple appendicitis should be treated by appendectomy during normal operating hours. Preoperative treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids during the overnight hours halts disease progression and allows for the safest surgery with the benefit of a full and rested staff. (24)(25)(26)
- On the basis of class B evidence and consensus, complex appendicitis with a well-defined abscess can be treated nonoperatively initially, with the option of an interval appendectomy after recovery from the acute infection. (29)(30) (31)(32)(33)

Acute appendicitis — children/adolescents (subsequent imaging after equivocal US): "In children and adolescents with suspected acute appendicitis, if initial US is equivocal/non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, the panel suggests obtaining an abdominal MRI or CT as subsequent imaging to diagnose acute appendicitis rather than obtaining another US (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". The remarks state that US can remain equivocal and MRI may require sedation, while CT involves radiation: "US is generally available but is also operator-dependent and can yield equivocal results. MRI is not always readily available, and sedation may be required for young children. CT is generally readily available but involves radiation exposure and may require use of IV contrast or sedation". For CT technique, "CT with IV contrast is usually appropriate when performed in children with suspected acute appendicitis after equivocal ultrasound; however, CT without IV contrast may be appropriate". Alternatives to further imaging are also noted: "Depending on the clinical situation, observation may be appropriate instead of subsequent imaging", and "If there is a strong clinical suspicion for appendicitis after equivocal imaging, exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy may also be considered if subsequent imaging delays appropriate management".

Introduction

Appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency, with more than 75 000 cases in the United States each year. Despite its high frequency, distinguishing appendicitis from other causes of acute abdominal pain remains a challenge. Pressures to improve emergency department (ED) efficiency, while preventing negative appendectomies and missed appendicitis, have contributed to heavy utilization of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) in patients with suspected appendicitis.

During the past 2 decades, there have been incremental improvements in the evaluation of patients with suspected appendicitis, especially at pediatric EDs, where efforts to reduce ionizing radiation exposure have shifted imaging from CT to US. Clinical pathways for acute abdominal pain have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness, of US as first-line imaging. However, US can be problematic if applied indiscriminately, as it is operator dependent, and equivocal or nondiagnostic results are common. Unfortunately, CT use remains high for children with abdominal pain at community-based, general EDs. Differential management between pediatric and general EDs is concerning, considering that community-based sites are where most children across the United States present for emergent evaluation.

We previously developed and validated the pediatric appendicitis risk calculator (pARC). Subsequently, we created a clinical decision support (CDS) system, AppyCDS, integrating pARC with the electronic health record (EHR). Using EHR and web-based algorithms, AppyCDS prompts health care clinicians to screen patients at risk of appendicitis and recommends next steps in care based on calculated risk or pARC score. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AppyCDS on use of CT or US during an ED visit among pediatric and adolescent patients with acute abdominal pain. Secondary aims were to evaluate the impact of AppyCDS on health care costs and safety outcomes.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: ultrasound first [^1de990ca]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Adult patient population: In the adult and especially in the elderly patient, where the sensitivity of US might be limited and important differential diagnoses have to be considered, CT might be used as the first-line imaging technique. When US is the suggested first line for all patients, consideration should be made that this may be difficult in many countries and hospitals due to outsourcing of radiologic services at night, due to the limited availability of US-experienced radiologists, physicians or sonographers 24/7, or due to a combination of all of these factors.

Regarding the patient with nonvisualization of the appendix itself on US, or other reasons for non-diagnostic US examinations in this setting, careful clinical re-assessment of the patient is recommended and complementary imaging should follow, if necessary. Depending on the local environment and expertise, this might be a second US examination, an MRI examination when radiation protection is mandatory (paediatric and pregnant patients) or a CT examination where diagnostic criteria and high accuracy are well-established. It has been demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis that an imaging protocol using US as a first-line imaging tool, followed by CT, offers significant cost savings over a CT-only protocol, and avoids radiation exposure. In a Markov-based decision model of paediatric appendicitis, the most cost-effective method of imaging children with suspected AA was to start with US and follow each negative US examination with a CT examination. However, the economic and radiation burden considerations have to be translated to the specific healthcare system and cannot be transformed to all clinical and geographic settings.

Q.1.3: What is the role of serum biomarkers in evaluating adult patients presenting with clinical features evocative of acute appendicitis?

The diagnostic accuracy of several biomarker panels has been prospectively validated, showing high sensitivity and negative predictive values for AA in large cohorts of patients with right iliac fossa pain, thereby potentially reducing the dependence on CT for the evaluation of possible AA.

The diagnostic value of baseline and early change of CRP concentrations has been evaluated separately or in combination with the modified Alvarado score in patients with clinically suspected AA in the prospective observational study by Msolli et al. Early change of CRP had a moderate diagnostic value in patients with suspected AA, and even combining CRP values to the modified Alvarado score did not improve diagnostic accuracy. Recently, ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels have been used to determine the prediction of severity in AA patients. Kilic et al. found a strong positive correlation between IMA levels and CT findings in distinguishing gangrenous/perforated AA from uncomplicated AA. A combination of clinical parameters, laboratory tests, and US may significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and eventually replace the need for CT scan in both adults and children.

Statement 1.6 Biochemical markers represent a promising reliable diagnostic tool for the identification of both negative cases or complicated acute appendicitis in adults. However, further high-quality evidence is needed [QoE: Low; No recommendation].

Q.1.4: What is the role of serum biomarkers in evaluating pediatric patients presenting clinical features highly suggestive of acute appendicitis?

In pediatric patients, routine diagnostic laboratory workup for suspected AA should include WBC, the differential with the calculation of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), CRP, and urinalysis.

Although not widely available, the addition of procalcitonin and calprotectin to the above tests may significantly improve diagnostic discrimination.

Biomarkers have also been shown to be useful when used in association with the systematic adoption of scoring systems, as the addition of negative biomarker test results to patients with a moderate risk of AA based on the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) can safely reclassify many patients to a low-risk group. This may allow surgeons to provide more conservative management in patients with suspected AA and decrease unnecessary resource utilization.

Appendicitis — Risk-stratification tools can be used to assist with determining which patients are unlikely to have appendicitis and do not need imaging. When imaging is indicated, ultrasonography is the preferred first-line imaging modality, and if unavailable, physicians and physician assistants and nurse practitioners may incorporate shared decision-making to determine whether immediate CT imaging, transfer for ultrasonography or MRI, or watchful waiting with admission or observation at home with next-day follow-up is the best plan.

### Etiology… [^c6747748]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

MESENTERIC LYMPHADENITIS Mesenteric lymphadenitis often is associated with adenoviral infection. The condition mimics appendicitis, except the pain is more diffuse, signs of peritonitis often are absent, and generalized lymphadenopathy may be present. CONSTIPATION Acute constipation usually has an organic cause, while chronic constipation usually has a functional cause. Abdominal pain resulting from constipation is most often left-sided or suprapubic. Clinical Evaluation HISTORY Age of Onset Pain History Children who do not verbalize typically present with late symptoms of disease. Children up to the teenage years have a poor sense of onset or location of pain. The classic sequence of shifting pain usually occurs with appendicitis.

In children who cannot verbalize, the initial 24-hour history of vague nausea or periumbilical pain may be unreported or go unnoticed, so these children more often present at the second stage of more visceral pain. However, any child with pain that localizes to the right lower quadrant should be suspected of having appendicitis. Thus, inquiry into the location, timing of onset, character, severity, duration, and radiation of pain are all important points but must be viewed in the context of the child's age. Recent Trauma A history of recent trauma may indicate the cause of pain. Abdominal Examination The breathing pattern should be observed, and the patient should be asked to distend the abdomen and then flatten it. After the child is asked to indicate, with one finger, the area of maximal tenderness, the abdomen should be gently palpated, moving toward that area.

The physician should examine for Rovsing's sign, then gently assess muscle rigidity. Associated Signs Jaundice suggests hemolysis or liver disease. Pallor and jaundice point to sickle cell crisis. A positive iliopsoas test or obturator test suggests an inflamed retrocecal appendix, a ruptured appendix, or an iliopsoas abscess.

Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency and the diagnosis can often be made clinically; however, many patients present with atypical findings. For these patients, there are multiple imaging modalities available to aid in the diagnosis of suspected appendicitis in an effort to avoid a negative appendectomy. Computed tomography is the test of choice in most patients in whom the diagnosis is not certain. Ultrasonography is particularly useful in children and pregnant women. Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended when ultrasonography is inconclusive. Appropriate use of these imaging studies avoids delays in treatment, prolonged hospitalization, and unnecessary surgery.

Context

Evaluation of abdominal pain in children can be difficult. Rapid, accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in children reduces the morbidity of this common cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Clinical evaluation may help identify (1) which children with abdominal pain and a likely diagnosis of appendicitis should undergo immediate surgical consultation for potential appendectomy and (2) which children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

Objective

To systematically assess the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory test results for evaluating children with possible appendicitis.

Data Sources

We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE (January 1966-March 2007) and the Cochrane Database, as well as physical examination textbooks and bibliographies of retrieved articles, yielding 2521 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they (1) provided primary data on children aged 18 years or younger in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis was considered; (2) presented medical history data, physical examination findings, or basic laboratory data; and (3) confirmed or excluded appendicitis by surgical pathologic findings, clinical observation, or follow-up. Of 256 full-text articles examined, 42 met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Twenty-five of 42 studies were assigned a quality level of 3 or better. Data from these studies were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

Results

In children with abdominal pain, fever was the single most useful sign associated with appendicitis; a fever increases the likelihood of appendicitis (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–4.8) and conversely, its absence decreases the chance of appendicitis (LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.64). In select groups of children, in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected and evaluation undertaken, rebound tenderness triples the odds of appendicitis (summary LR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.3–3.9), while its absence reduces the likelihood (summary LR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.55). Midabdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant (LR range, 1.9–3.1) increases the risk of appendicitis more than right lower quadrant pain itself (summary LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5). A white blood cell count of less than 10,000/microL decreases the likelihood of appendicitis (summary LR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.17–0.30), as does an absolute neutrophil count of 6750/microL or lower (LR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.16). Symptoms and signs are most useful in combination, particularly for identifying children who do not require further evaluation or intervention.

Conclusions

Although the clinical examination does not establish a diagnosis of appendicitis with certainty, it is useful in determining which children with abdominal pain warrant immediate surgical evaluation for consideration of appendectomy and which children may warrant further diagnostic evaluation. More child-specific, age-stratified data are needed to improve the utility of the clinical examination for diagnosing appendicitis in children.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^c6d4a88a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This approach should only apply in equivocal presentations and not in patients who meet a high index of suspicion for acute appendicitis; in addition, a normal eosinophil count should not rule out parasite infection, as D. fragilis itself only shows eosinophil elevation in 50% of cases. Care should also be given to this diagnostic approach, as D. fragilis colonization can be present with an unrelated appendicitis. Notably, when risk stratifying appendicitis, pARC has been validated in multiple prospective studies across pediatric and community emergency departments, showing high diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87–0.92), 100% sensitivity and 98.6% negative predictive value in very low-risk groups, and 99.0% specificity in high-risk groups. Compared to the older Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS), pARC offers superior performance, providing continuous risk estimates and higher AUCs in both community (0.89 vs. 0.80) and pediatric (0.85 vs. 0.77) settings. It also classifies more patients into actionable risk categories, improving clinical utility and reducing unnecessary interventions.

Stool ova and parasite testing, while usually inexpensive and not difficult to interpret, can take time to provide results, which is a significant limitation when evaluating for acute abdomen. Nevertheless, this testing can be a valuable tool in situations when a patient can be discharged home with return precautions but should not supplant inpatient management if a higher level of care is indicated. Overall, this case is a salient reminder to maintain a broad differential that includes parasitic causes of abdominal pain in cases of suspected but equivocal appendicitis, particularly in vulnerable newcomer populations.

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^5d451574]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to clinical decision support, a recent joint policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American College of Radiology identified two additional strategies to reduce overimaging in suspected pediatric appendicitis. First, for patients with high likelihood of appendicitis who will require transfer regardless of the CT results (for appendectomy or further management of non‐surgical abdominal pain), it was recommended that imaging should be deferred to the pediatric specialty center. Second, when ultrasound is equivocal or unavailable, ED clinicians are encouraged to use shared decision making to explain the available diagnostic options and allow the family to make an informed choice, from watchful waiting at home with close follow‐up, ED/inpatient setting observation, and immediate CT imaging to transfer to a pediatric center for further management. Ultimately, for every child with abdominal pain, an ED clinician must use clinical judgment to balance the risks of diagnostic imaging with the potential harms of delayed diagnosis. Future studies should include a cost‐effectiveness analysis to compare these options based on an EDs available resources.

Perforated appendicitis continues to be a significant cause of morbidity for children. In most centers, ultrasound has replaced computed tomography as the initial imaging modality for this condition. Controversies surrounding optimal medical and surgical management of appendicitis are discussed. Management of intussusception begins with clinical assessment and ultrasound, followed by image-guided air or saline reduction enema. When surgery is required, laparoscopy is typically utilized unless bowel resection is required. The differential diagnosis for pediatric gastrointestinal bleeding is broad but often made with age, history, and physical examination. Endoscopy or laparoscopy is sometimes needed to confirm a diagnosis or for treatment.

Decision criteria and additional considerations — adult and pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis initially treated with antibiotics should weigh malignancy risk, age, preferences, and access to care. For both adult and pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis initially treated with antibiotics, one of the major considerations regarding interval appendectomy is the concern for missing a malignancy. Of note, patients with neoplasms were all over 40 years of age, and therefore the benefits of interval appendectomy may be less in pediatric patients or younger adults. The document notes strong patient, surgeon, or parental preference for an appendectomy, that patients with a family history of malignancy may benefit from stronger consideration of interval appendectomy, that patients with poor access to care may prefer a planned interval appendectomy, and that given the longer lifespan after appendicitis there could be a higher rate of recurrence in pediatric and younger adult patients.

No prospective, randomized comparisons of ultrasound and CT were found, and the value of using CT with oral and IV contrast remains unclear with no direct evaluation of the diagnostic performance of oral and IV contrast alone for appendicitis in children.

### Diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children… [^5b999885]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in children remains difficult, and delays in diagnosis lead to increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Rothrock and Pagane reviewed the presentation and evaluation of appendicitis in children. The appendix is a long, thin diverticulum arising from the inferior tip of the cecum. Appendicitis is precipitated by luminal obstruction or mucosal ulceration with bacterial infection. If surgery is delayed, the appendix perforates, and pus is spilled into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis or abscess formation. Appendicitis pain typically begins as a vague periumbilical discomfort followed by parietal peritoneum inflammation localized to the right lower quadrant. This classic migration of pain does not occur in one third of pediatric cases. The classic location of the appendix, known as McBurney's point, is one third of the distance from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. Nausea and vomiting with fever are common.

In neonates, the clinical features of appendicitis are nonspecific and include irritability or lethargy, abdominal distention, vomiting, a palpable abdominal mass and cellulitis of the abdominal wall. In infants and children up to two years of age, symptoms include vomiting, pain, diarrhea and fever. Diagnosis is more difficult in this age group because the symptoms are nonspecific. In children two to five years of age, symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, fever and anorexia. Tenderness of the right lower quadrant is more common in this age group than it is in younger children, who usually have diffuse tenderness. The incidence of appendicitis increases in children six to 12 years of age and in adolescents 13 years or older, with symptoms that include vomiting and abdominal pain that worsens with movement or cough. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant is common. A white blood cell count is nonspecific and insensitive for appendicitis.

Serum C-reactive protein, a nonspecific inflammatory mediator, may be useful in serial testing to identify appendiceal infection. The only mandatory laboratory test in patients with suspected appendicitis is a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age. The authors conclude that the diagnosis of appendicitis in children may be enhanced by more widespread use of ultrasonography and CT scanning. A knowledge of age-dependent physiology and clinical symptomatology will improve diagnostic accuracy.

However, the costs and the availability of MRI often prevent its use as the initial imaging investigation in cases of suspected AA.

As second-line imaging modalities after initial US for assessing AA in children and adults, repeated US, CT, and MRI showed comparable and high accuracy in children and adults. These three modalities may be valid as second-line imaging in a clinical imaging pathway for diagnosis of AA. In particular, pooled sensitivities and specificities of second-line US for the diagnosis of AA in children were 91.3% and 95.2%, respectively. Regarding second-line CT, the pooled sensitivities and specificities were 96.2% and 94.6%. Regarding second-line MRI, pooled sensitivities and specificities were 97.4% and 97.1%.

Statement 1.15 The use of US in children is accurate and safe in terms of perforation rates, emergency department re-visits, and negative appendectomy rates. CT use may be decreased by using appropriate clinical and/or staged algorithm with US/MRI. MRI has at least the same sensitivity and specificity as CT and, although higher costs, should be preferred over CT as second-line imaging in children. Recommendation 1.14.1 In pediatric patients with suspected appendicitis, we suggest the use of US as first-line imaging. In pediatric patients with inconclusive US, we suggest choosing the second-line imaging technique based on local availability and expertise, as there are currently no strong data to suggest a best diagnostic pathway due to a variety of options and dependence on local resources [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak: 2B]. Recommendation 1.14.2 Since in pediatric patients with equivocal CT finding the prevalence of true acute appendicitis is not negligible, we suggest against the routine use of CT as first-line imaging in children with right iliac fossa pain [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^4e17acfa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this case-control study, children with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis initially had milder symptoms and signs, were likely to have progression of symptoms before diagnosis, and had worse outcomes than those with timely diagnosis. Our findings suggest that cases of delayed diagnosis of appendicitis in children may represent an early missed opportunity to make a diagnosis. Decision support interventions could be useful in preventing delayed diagnosis without leading to overtesting because many delayed diagnoses occur in cases where testing is indicated.

### Clinical and imaging mimickers of acute appendicitis in the pediatric population [^e143b235]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present the imaging appearance of common mimickers of appendicitis in children with right lower quadrant pain.

Conclusion

The majority of children who undergo imaging for suspected appendicitis will end up having an alternative diagnosis. These mimickers can be gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or pulmonary. Familiarity with these alternative diagnoses can aid in the challenging task of imaging right lower quadrant pain in the pediatric population.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: ultrasound first [^6f10c9e6]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic algorithms

In order to keep radiation dose and financial cost low, various algorithms have been recently published for the work-up of a patient with suspected AA.

Ramajaran et al. report their retrospective outcomes analysis for suspected AA, at a children's hospital, over a six-year period. Their pathway established US as the initial imaging modality, and CT was recommended only if US was "equivocal". 407 (60%) of 680 study patients followed the pathway. Of these, 200 patients were managed definitively without CT. The NAR was 7%.

A protocol was implemented in another children's hospital with an algorithm relying on 24-hour US as the primary imaging study in children with suspected AA. The number of CT examinations per appendectomy decreased from 42% before, to 30% after implementation of the protocol, leading to reduced radiation exposure and imaging charges.

Another study reported on a set of clinical features that can rule out appendicitis in patients with suspected AA and non-diagnostic US results. Patients were discharged after inconclusive US if less than two predictors were present: male sex, migration of pain to right lower quadrant, vomiting and leucocyte count > 12.0 × 10⁹/l and re-evaluated the next day. The implemented clinical decision rule reduced the probability of AA in a large subgroup of patients with negative or inconclusive US results.

What if not only one initial US examination is performed, and an initial equivocal US examination is followed by clinical reassessment, a short-interval US and surgical consultation? This algorithm was studied prospectively in 294 children with a suspicion of AA and a baseline paediatric appendicitis score ≥ 2. Of the 111 children with AA, 108 were identified without use of CT. The short-interval US confirmed or ruled out AA in 22 of 40 children with equivocal initial US. The authors conclude that their approach is most useful in children with an equivocal initial US.

For a period from 2008 to 2013, another study reported a significant increase in the use of "US first" amongst 3353 children in Washington following national recommendations to use US for the diagnosis of AA when possible. However, over 40% of children were examined by CT. Of these, 35% of all CT examinations were performed after an indeterminate US examination.

Van Atta et al. have shown that implementation of an imaging protocol using US as the primary modality to evaluate paediatric patients with suspected AA leads to a decrease of CT utilization because 326 of 512 patients (63%) did not require a CT examination.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^74729654]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Appendicitis imaging — decision criteria and additional considerations emphasize that the increased radiation exposure with CT scans is less of a consideration in adults but is particularly important for the pediatric population, that facilities may not have expedient access to MRI and a pediatric MRI may require anesthesia for an adequate study, and that while ultrasound does not increase radiation exposure and is accessible in most hospitals, it is an operator-dependent study which may reduce its accuracy, leading to bias against it, further imaging, and delayed care; it is often difficult to identify complicated appendicitis with ultrasound alone, and ultrasound is also associated with a high rate of non-visualization of the appendix, particularly in patients with obesity, limiting its utility.

### Optimizing the role of imaging in appendicitis [^f8bcef90]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common acute abdominal condition that requires surgical intervention in childhood. From the diagnostic performance perspective, computed tomography (CT) has a significantly higher sensitivity than does ultrasound (US) for diagnosing appendicitis in children; from the safety perspective, however, one should consider the radiation associated with CT, especially in children. There is strong evidence supporting improved patient outcomes in children with suspected acute appendicitis who undergo CT scanning. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that for a single abdominal CT study in a 5-year-old child, the lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer would be 26.1 per 100,000 in female and 20.4 per 100,000 in male patients, based on probabilistic models designed with data from atomic bomb survivors. An integrated clinical-imaging approach, applying clinical scores that are able to predict which children with acute abdominal pain do or do not have a high probability of presenting with appendicitis may improve the effectiveness of the imaging diagnosis of appendicitis at the hospital level. Such an approach could avoid exposure of children who at low risk for appendicitis to unnecessary diagnostic tests and eventually, to radiation.

### A prospective study to evaluate the contribution of the pediatric appendicitis score in the decision process [^1cc26ffe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Most previous studies have primarily examined the utility of the PAS score within ED populations, without considering prior consultations in primary care. Primary care physicians often serve as the initial assessors, typically lacking immediate access to extensive laboratory and imaging resources. Depending on their expertise, they are aware of the seriousness and potential morbidity associated with AA. The key question they must address in their practice is: "Should I refer this child for further investigations?". The primary objective of this study was to compare the PAS scores of children presenting at the ED with clinical features suggestive of AA, taking into account whether or not they had a prior consultation in primary care. The secondary endpoint was to assess the potential of combined PAS scores and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels for diagnosing AA and alternative conditions.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^075a2da6]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To date, there is only 1 reported case of D. fragilis mimicking acute appendicitis. Additionally, literature suggests that parasitic involvement in appendicitis is often under-recognized — detected in only about 1.2% of cases — and the link to true inflammation remains debatable, highlighting significant gaps in epidemiological understanding and diagnostic protocols. Our case highlights 2 practical considerations in the workup of acute appendicitis: that in equivocal cases, D. fragilis should be considered, and more broadly, with the rise in global migration and the volume of newcomer children establishing care in the United States, parasitic infections should not be overlooked.

We present two cases of pediatric patients initially presenting with a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis. In these cases, point-of-care ultrasonography was performed early in the patient's emergency department course, leading to alternate diagnoses. This article highlights a role for point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnoses of two alternate conditions that clinically mimic appendicitis: Meckel diverticulitis and acute ileocecitis. We offer a brief overview of terminology, relevant literature, and ultrasound scanning technique for the right-lower-quadrant point-of-care ultrasound evaluation.

### Factors associated with potentially missed diagnosis of appendicitis in the emergency department [^84ff1eaf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What factors are associated with a potentially missed diagnosis of appendicitis in the emergency department among adults and children?

Findings

In this cohort study of 123 711 patients diagnosed with appendicitis, insurance claims data indicated that appendicitis was potentially missed in 6.0% of adults and 4.4% of children during the initial emergency department visit. Factors associated with potentially missed appendicitis included female sex, the coexistence of abdominal pain and constipation, and the presence of comorbidities.

Meaning

Population-based estimates of the rates of potentially missed appendicitis reveal opportunities for improvement and identify factors that may alert clinicians and mitigate the risk of missed diagnosis.
