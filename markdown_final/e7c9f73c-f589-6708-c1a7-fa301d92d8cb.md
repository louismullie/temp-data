## Question

Monteleukast indications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about montelukast indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and age ranges. Then, I should verify off-label uses and their evidentiary support. Next, I will review guideline positions and the boxed warning to frame risk–benefit. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing principles and a concise summary, making sure I double-check any conflicting age statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indications and the exact age ranges, because precision here is critical. Montelukast is indicated for prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and for relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, with age thresholds varying by formulation and indication, and I need to ensure I cite the correct labels for tablets versus chewables and granules [^c26f3faf] [^174113a4] [^c26f3faf].

> Wait, let me verify the asthma indication ages before I commit. Initially, I thought tablets were only for patients 15 years and older, but hold on, I should verify the chewable and granule formulations. The chewables are indicated for asthma from 2 years and older, and the granules are indicated from 12 months and older, so I should correct my earlier assumption that all oral formulations share the same lower age limit for asthma [^174113a4] [^c26f3faf].

> I will now examine exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The labeled indication is for prevention, not treatment of acute episodes, and it is approved in patients 6 years and older for chewables and 15 years and older for tablets, with dosing at least 2 hours pre-exercise and a strict 24-hour interval between doses; importantly, daily montelukast does not prevent acute EIB, so patients still need rescue SABA available [^174113a4] [^533d559e] [^82746ce4].

> Next, I should review allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is indicated for seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years and older and for perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months and older, but the FDA emphasizes reserving use for those with inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies due to neuropsychiatric risks; major guidelines similarly advise against first-line use and caution against routine add-on to intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines [^c26f3faf] [^31976e3a] [^14313060] [^5ddac2a3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about off-label uses; I need to check the strength of evidence. For chronic urticaria, data are mixed and guidelines generally do not support routine use, though some dermatology guidance allows consideration as an add-on to high-dose second-generation H1 antihistamines in refractory cases; for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, expert position papers suggest leukotriene modifiers can be considered for symptom control, but this remains off-label in the U.S.; for atopic dermatitis, randomized trials and systematic reviews show no consistent benefit, so it should not be used for this purpose outside trials [^cb5562c8] [^ea45b3e5] [^60f37e91] [^52b99330] [^8048e31f] [^950203d6].

> I should confirm the boxed warning and its practical implications. The FDA added a boxed warning for serious neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including suicidal ideation and behavior, and specifically restricted allergic rhinitis use to patients who fail or cannot tolerate alternatives; GINA also reminds clinicians to counsel about neuropsychiatric risks whenever montelukast is prescribed, which materially shifts the risk–benefit calculus in mild disease [^4ecb257c] [^5e342283] [^c4882889].

> Let me consider pediatric asthma positioning, because this is often where confusion arises. Guidelines consistently place inhaled corticosteroids as first-line controller therapy in children, with montelukast as an alternative when ICS are not feasible or not tolerated; the WAIT trial did not support intermittent montelukast for preschool wheeze, reinforcing that routine intermittent use should be avoided outside specific phenotypes or trials [^d2a30703] [^225020de] [^7f4035d3].

> I need to ensure I capture dosing and administration nuances correctly. For asthma, evening dosing is customary, though the pharmacokinetics are similar morning or evening; for EIB, a single dose at least 2 hours pre-exercise is used, with no additional dose within 24 hours; for allergic rhinitis, once-daily dosing can be morning or evening, individualized to patient preference, and patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one evening dose to cover both indications [^533d559e] [^c26f3faf].

> But wait, what if a patient presents with acute asthma symptoms; I should double-check that I do not overstate any acute role. Montelukast is not indicated for reversal of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus; patients must have rescue SABA available, and while small studies of IV montelukast in acute asthma show physiologic improvements, this remains investigational and is not a labeled use, so I should not recommend it for acute rescue [^a89de0b7] [^28008294] [^bfede4fa] [^2de240f8].

> Let me synthesize the indications succinctly. FDA-labeled uses are asthma maintenance for patients 12 months and older depending on formulation, EIB prevention for patients 6 years and older, and allergic rhinitis with age-appropriate labeling but reserved after failure or intolerance of alternatives; off-label uses with variable or insufficient evidence include adjunctive therapy in chronic urticaria, symptom control in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, and investigational roles in eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis, where routine clinical use is not supported [^eb06fd97] [^174113a4] [^c26f3faf] [^cb5562c8] [^52b99330] [^0bd99f38] [^8048e31f].

> Finally, I should confirm practical prescribing principles. Always screen for psychiatric history and counsel patients and caregivers about neuropsychiatric symptoms before starting, monitor closely during therapy, and discontinue if concerning changes occur; avoid using montelukast as first-line for allergic rhinitis or as routine add-on to intranasal corticosteroids; in asthma, prioritize ICS and consider montelukast when ICS are declined, not tolerated, or as an add-on in selected cases, balancing modest incremental benefit against boxed-warning risks [^2a39f315] [^31976e3a] [^5ddac2a3] [^ce27ddaa].

Montelukast is indicated for **chronic asthma maintenance** (≥ 12 months) [^c26f3faf], **exercise-induced bronchoconstriction prevention** (≥ 6 years) [^c26f3faf], and **allergic rhinitis symptom relief** (seasonal ≥ 2 years; perennial ≥ 6 months) [^c26f3faf]. It is **not for acute asthma attacks** [^a89de0b7] and should be reserved for allergic rhinitis only when alternatives fail or are not tolerated due to neuropsychiatric risks [^31976e3a] [^4ecb257c]. Off-label uses include chronic urticaria [^cb5562c8], aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^52b99330], and eosinophilic esophagitis (clinical trials only) [^0bd99f38]. Dosing is once daily: 10 mg for ≥ 15 years, 5 mg for 6–14 years, and 4 mg for 2–5 years; take in the evening for asthma, and ≥ 2 hours before exercise for EIB [^533d559e] [^6ebe972b].

### Montelukast treatment of urticaria [^cb5562c8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical trial data to determine the benefits of using montelukast alone or as combination therapy in the treatment of urticaria.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-March 2006) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-October 2005) were searched to find clinical trial publications that addressed the use of montelukast in urticaria.

Data Synthesis

Six clinical trials were identified. Montelukast was compared alone and as combination therapy with nonsedating histamine1-receptor antagonists to determine efficacy and safety. Patients had chronic or physical urticaria. The results were mixed. Some studies demonstrated that montelukast can decrease urticarial symptoms with minimal adverse effects, while others found no differences.

Conclusion

Large-scale, controlled trials are needed to determine which patients would likely benefit from treatment with montelukast.

Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one dose daily in the evening (2.4).

2.1 Asthma

For asthma, administer montelukast sodium tablets orally once daily in the evening, with or without food. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing.

The following doses are recommended:

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)

For prevention of EIB, administer a single dose of montelukast sodium tablets orally at least 2 hours, before exercise. The following doses are recommended:

An additional dose of montelukast sodium tablets should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium tablets daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist.

Daily administration of montelukast sodium tablets for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.

2.3 Allergic Rhinitis

For allergic rhinitis, administer montelukast sodium tablets orally once daily without regard to time of food ingestion. Time of administration in patients with allergic rhinitis can be individualized to suit patient needs.

The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended:

The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended:

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

2.4 Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis

For patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis, administer only one montelukast sodium tablets dose orally once daily in the evening.

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

### Inhaled corticosteroids should be the first line of treatment for children with asthma [^d2a30703]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Although montelukast is claimed to be preferable to inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis, virus-induced exacerbations, exercise induced asthma, and in those experiencing difficulties with inhalation therapy, there is no scientific evidence to support any of these claims. In comparative trials and systematic reviews, inhaled corticosteroids are clearly more effective than montelukast in reducing asthma exacerbations, improving lung function, symptom scores, and rescue medication use. The effects on exercise induced bronchoconstriction appear to be similar. Because of their superior efficacy and excellent long-term efficacy and safety profile, inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment of first choice for the maintenance therapy of childhood asthma, irrespective of age or clinical phenotype.

### A boxed warning for montelukast: the FDA perspective [^4ecb257c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of postmarketing reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events with Singulair (montelukast) use in 2007. Over the years, the FDA has conducted reviews of the clinical trial safety data, focused analyses of postmarketing reports, and reviews of the published literature. These activities have resulted in successive labeling updates and public communications. However, there has been continued concern among stakeholders about the risk of neuropsychiatric events and the lack of awareness among prescribers and patients/caregivers. On the basis of these concerns, the FDA embarked on another comprehensive review and also conducted a new observational study using claims data in the Sentinel Distributed Database. In September 2019, the FDA held a public Advisory Committee meeting to discuss its review and solicit recommendations from the panel regarding labeling and communication strategies. After careful consideration of the available data and feedback received during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA required a boxed warning and a revision specifically for the allergic rhinitis indication to reserve use of montelukast to patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. Based on benefit-risk considerations, the asthma indication was not changed. To provide insight into the process and rationale for the required labeling changes, we provide an overview of the decision-making framework we used.

Understanding guidance impact is especially important if a substantial change in established practice is recommended. It is possible that the next iteration of UK asthma guidance may follow the latest international Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidance and recommend anti-inflammatory reliever therapy (AIR), as well as maintenance and reliever therapy (MART), which are both based on ICS/formoterol combination therapy. AIR in particular would represent a major step change in asthma management in the UK. AIR is already recommended in the recent short guidelines from the European Respiratory Society, which endorse that adults with mild asthma use as-needed ICS/formoterol, instead of regular ICS maintenance treatment plus as-needed short-acting beta-2-agonists (SABAs), and that adolescents with mild asthma use either as-needed ICS/formoterol or ICS maintenance treatment plus as-needed SABA.

### MONTELUKAST SODIUM-montelukast sodium tablet, film… [^28008294]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reaction profile did not significantly change. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis. Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following reaction was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1. 9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. Blood and lymphatic system disorders increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders.

Nervous system disorders drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures Cardiac disorders palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia Gastrointestinal disorders diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, fexofenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers.

Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT 1receptor.

### The national montelukast survey [^1336be1f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of montelukast for treating asthma; whether this can be extrapolated to clinical effectiveness in routine practice has yet to be established.

Objective

To examine the use, effectiveness, and tolerability of montelukast in clinical practice for treating asthma and to explore prognostic factors that could predict a favorable response to the drug.

Methods

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of clinical outcomes seen in patients prescribed montelukast for asthma that used routinely collected clinical information. Data were collected on all consenting patients who had been prescribed montelukast for asthma irrespective of the continuation or duration of treatment. Independent observers, treating physicians, and patients assessed certain outcomes after the initiation of montelukast, including the general asthma response and changes in activity-related symptoms.

Results

Fifty-six centers in the United Kingdom (20 primary care and 36 secondary care) participated. The analysis was based on 1351 eligible patients for whom essential data were available. Eight hundred thirty patients (66.4%; 95% CI, 63.8% to 69.0%) were recorded as having shown an improvement in their asthma control, and 103 (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.8% to 9.9%) experienced a dramatic improvement. The greatest proportion of patients responding was seen in those with mild to moderate asthma. Montelukast was well tolerated; no new adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

Montelukast is an effective, well-tolerated treatment for asthma in routine practice. The overall response rate and tolerability seen in this survey are similar to those reported in randomized clinical trials.

Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist.

Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials.

Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers.

### Montelukast (montelukast sodium) [^9dd09e21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 	Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium for asthma have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Use of montelukast sodium for this indication is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies. Safety and efficacy data in this age group are similar to those seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Specific Populations (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

The effectiveness of montelukast sodium for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age and for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 years to 14 years of age have been established and is supported by extrapolation from the demonstrated effectiveness in patients 15 years of age and older with allergic rhinitis as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations.

The safety of montelukast sodium 4 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with asthma has been demonstrated by adequate and well-controlled data [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Effectiveness of montelukast sodium in this age group is extrapolated from the demonstrated effectiveness in patients 6 years of age and older with asthma and is based on similar pharmacokinetic data, as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations. Effectiveness in this age group is supported by exploratory efficacy assessments from a large, well-controlled safety study conducted in patients 2 to 5 years of age.

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^9e277e17]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Montelukast, the most widely used leukotriene-modifying agent (LTMA), is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist and is currently indicated for prophylactic and chronic treatment of asthma, relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Off-label uses include for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea. There is also increasing interest in repositioning montelukast for treating various other health conditions.,

The evidence base for adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes associated with LTMAs is mixed and inconclusive. Nevertheless, in 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a new warning about potential serious mental health outcomes associated with montelukast to promote further awareness of potential adverse effects and also advised reducing montelukast's use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Drug safety updates on montelukast have been published recently in Europe. On one hand, controlled clinical trials have reported mainly mild and infrequent adverse effects. This led to an initial conclusion that montelukast was a safe and well-tolerated medicine. Contrasting evidence, however, has come from postmarketing safety signals, which have included a range of severe neuropsychiatric outcomes, such as aggression, anxiety, depression, various sleep-related problems, and suicidal ideation, self-harm, and completed suicide. Some case studies have reported a positive montelukast dechallenge-rechallenge association, that is, that adverse symptoms have resolved after cessation of treatment and returned after restarting of treatment. Evidence from observational studies, which are often methodologically better suited for studying adverse outcomes, is also mixed and inconclusive. Several methodological limitations have been identified in the evidence base on the safety of montelukast in observational studies, including potential confounding by indication, comorbidities of asthma, and concurrent use of other medicines. Furthermore, because much of the evidence is based on pediatric and adolescent populations, relatively little is known about potential adverse outcomes among adults.

### Review of recent results of montelukast use as a monotherapy in children with mild asthma [^e28ad580]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic disease with a heterogeneous phenotype that is often associated with allergic sensitization in childhood. The earliest definable form of asthma is mild (intermittent or persistent), a severity level that may be characteristic of a majority of children with asthma. Several asthma controllers are indicated for use in children. International guidelines recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids as the preferred controller therapy in mild persistent asthma.

Objective

This article reviewed recent results from randomized, double-blind studies of children with mild asthma treated with montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is approved for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults.

Methods

A literature search of MEDLINE was conducted to gather relevant, English-language articles using search terms such as randomized controlled studies, double-blind studies, montelukast, leukotriene receptor antagonist, pediatric asthma, mild asthma, exercise-induced asthma, and bronchoconstriction. Recent articles (since 1998) that described the use of montelukast as a monotherapy were chosen for this review.

Results

Relevant studies included a 48-week, placebo-controlled study of 2- to 5-year-old mild intermittent asthmatics (N = 549); a 12-week, placebo-controlled study of 2- to 5-year-old mild persistent asthmatics (N = 689); an analysis of a mild persistent asthmatic cohort (N = 138) from an 8-week, placebo-controlled study of 6- to 14-year-old asthmatics; a 12-month study comparing montelukast with fluticasone in 6- to 14-year-old mild persistent asthmatics (N = 949); and 3 placebo-controlled studies in children with exercise-induced asthma (N = 123). The results from these studies, encompassing end points measuring lung function and symptoms, found that montelukast provided effective and beneficial asthma control to children aged 2 to 14 years with mild asthma.

Conclusion

The evidence suggests that montelukast is an effective monotherapy controller in children with mild asthma.

Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) for allergic rhinitis (AR) — We suggest that the clinician not select montelukast for the initial treatment of AR due to reduced efficacy compared with other agents, with strength of recommendation conditional and certainty of evidence very low; serious neuropsychiatric events have been reported, montelukast is approved down to 6 months of age, clinicians should monitor patients at elevated risk for suicidal ideation or psychiatric symptoms, and per FDA advice it should be used for AR only when other therapies are not effective or tolerated; considering comparative efficacy, clinicians should not routinely offer an LTRA as preferred therapy for AR.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of allergic rhinitis [^8bda7270]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature examining the clinical use of leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Data Sources

Biomedical literature accessed through MEDLINE (1990-November 2000) and Current Contents (week 35 of 1999 to week 48 of 2000). Key terms included leukotriene antagonists, montelukast, zafirlukast, and rhinitis (allergic).

Data Synthesis

Preliminary evidence on the clinical use of either montelukast or zafirlukast as monotherapy is equivocal, with one study noting benefit and another noting lack of benefit in symptom amelioration. A third study suggests that these agents may have a role in further modifying allergic rhinitis symptoms when used in combination with standard treatments.

Conclusions

Future large-scale studies should assess the efficacy of these agents in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, in particular, to identify subsets of patients likely to derive the most benefit. Available data suggest it is reasonable and safe to add these agents to standard therapy if symptomatology remains unresolved.

Leukotriene pathway inhibitors in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) and lipoxygenase inhibitors — attenuate EIB with variable effect, with 30% to 80% attenuation and about 50% of patients responding; diagnostic/protection thresholds referenced include FEV1 decrease > 10%, > 15%, or > 20%. For LTRAs, montelukast is approved by the FDA for adolescents and adults, acts within 1 to 2 hours and provides 24 hours of bronchoprotective activity. Lipoxygenase inhibitors can attenuate EIB when given orally but have relatively short duration and are not currently recommended for this indication.

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^d5c55ff7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

We observed a population-level association between new montelukast exposure and incident neuropsychiatric diagnoses within a subsequent year of the initial dispensed prescription among patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis compared with propensity score-matched patients not exposed to LTMAs. The association was mainly explained by an excess incidence of anxiety and insomnia in patients exposed to montelukast. The statistically significant excess of incident neuropsychiatric outcomes in patients prescribed montelukast was small in absolute terms. However, because montelukast is prescribed to several million patients in the US each year, a small excess risk can be relevant at a population level. Future research with representative samples should quantify the total population burden of potential montelukast-associated neuropsychiatric outcomes. Our findings suggest that clinicians prescribing montelukast and other LTMAs should discuss potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects with patients before starting treatment and consider monitoring for signs of neuropsychiatric symptoms during treatment regardless of treatment indication. This may be particularly important in individuals who have a history of mental health or sleep problems.

Second-generation oral antihistamine combinations and montelukast-specific cautions — OAH 2G + INCS have not been shown to have any additive benefit over using just the INCS. For OAH 2G + LTRA, there is lack of adequate evidence of added efficacy to make a specific recommendation for or against this combination versus monotherapy; with the serious neuropsychiatric events reported with montelukast, this combination should rarely be used, and montelukast should generally be reserved for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of asthma: an update [^9c9ef2ef]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), such as montelukast and zafirlukast, have been demonstrated in a number of studies to possess bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory properties, that make these drugs ideal candidates for the treatment of asthma. The last 1998-updating of the GINA Guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of asthma recommends the use of LTRAs in the treatment of moderate and mild asthma. In patients with moderate asthma not completely controlled with moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of a LTRA is indicated in alternative to either the increase of the inhaled corticosteroid dose or the addition of an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist. Both in vitro and in vivo evidences indicate that LTRAs possess an anti-inflammatory activity that is presumably complementary to that presented by corticosteroids. Moreover, clinical studies show that the addition of an LTRA, montelukast, is able to improve clinical and functional indexes in patients with asthma not controlled with inhaled corticosteroids, and to allow a reduction in corticosteroid dosage in patients with asthma well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. In patients with mild persistent asthma monotherapy with an LTRA is indicated in alternative to a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, an inhaled cromone, or an oral slow-release theophylline. Previous clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate asthma had demonstrated that monotherapy with LTRAs is able to improve airway function, asthma symptoms, use of as-needed medications, exacerbation rate, and quality of life, without evidence of tolerance with prolonged use. Recently, in a subgroup analysis of patients with mild persistent asthma, a 6-week treatment with oral montelukast or inhaled beclomethasone gave similar improvements in "rescue-free" days, days with well controlled asthma, FEV1, blood eosinophils, beta-agonist use, and nocturnal awakes due to asthma.

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^c7b32082]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

A major strength of our data was the relatively large number of patients initially prescribed montelukast. This allowed us to investigate associations between montelukast and various neuropsychiatric outcomes with improved precision and control for baseline confounders, establish associations separately for patients with asthma and those with allergic rhinitis, and examine associations for various different neuropsychiatric outcomes (ie, to triangulate outcomes).

This study also has several limitations. Because we used retrospective EHR data, we did not have control over treatment allocation. Our results thus represent treatment decisions made in the clinic. We did not have information on the duration of montelukast treatment or adherence, which may have confounded observed associations. Among patients in a clinical setting, there may be considerable delay in seeking care for neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly if symptoms are mild initially, which may obscure the correct sequence of events. We aimed to partly control for this by using a 14-day washout period after index prescription for measuring incident outcomes to reduce potential bias from conditions that were already present at the time of index prescription. This may have underestimated associations. Inclusion of patients with past montelukast exposures (ie, potential montelukast exposure earlier than the prior 6 months before index prescription) may have also underestimated observed associations because past use is likely associated with better tolerability of montelukast and thus decreased likelihood of adverse effects during follow-up. We focused on new treatment episodes with montelukast to reduce bias from exposure to LTMAs before the index prescription. Outcomes may be different among patients with continuous long-term exposure to montelukast. Because we used EHR data to identify neuropsychiatric outcomes, we identified only patients receiving treatment for these conditions. This has likely further underestimated the number of patients experiencing these outcomes because patients with less severe symptoms may not have been identified. This suggests that future observational research should investigate incidence of milder symptoms, in particular for sleep problems. By matching for various comorbidities and other prescription medicines separately by montelukast indication, we aimed to control for confounding by indication and potential differences in baseline health status. However, it is possible that some residual confounding by indication remained in the models for unmeasured risk factors not captured by EHR data, such as confounding by differences in disease progression and symptom severity.EHR data do not include information on all potential confounders, such as unemployment or living alone, which is a limitation in all studies using EHR data. If patients received treatment from health care organizations not participating in TriNetX before or after index prescription, this may have introduced bias owing to misclassification in exposure status or loss to follow-up for outcomes. We did not have information on mortality, except for inpatient deaths. This suggests that further research with similarly improved design is needed to investigate the association between montelukast and cause-specific mortality.

### Roflumilast combined with montelukast versus montelukast alone as add-on treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [^53811bf8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been shown to provide modest improvements in lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, but its efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma has not been assessed. We hypothesized that this drug might provide benefit if combined with montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in patients whose symptoms are uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists.

Objective

We sought to examine the efficacy, safety, and mode of action of the addition of roflumilast and montelukast versus montelukast alone in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.

Methods

In a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 2-sequence, crossover study, 64 patients were randomized to receive 500 μg of roflumilast plus montelukast followed by placebo plus 10 mg of montelukast (sequence AB) or placebo plus 10 mg of montelukast followed by 500 μg of roflumilast plus 10 mg of montelukast (sequence BA). All patients had a diagnosis of bronchial asthma inadequately controlled by at least a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting β-agonist.

Results

The analysis of FEV1 change from baseline to week 4 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment difference of 100 mL for roflumilast plus montelukast versus placebo plus montelukast. Also, improvements in patient-reported outcomes and a reduction in urinary leukotriene E4 levels were observed during roflumilast plus montelukast treatment compared with placebo plus montelukast treatment. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of roflumilast.

Conclusion

The combination of roflumilast with montelukast compared with montelukast alone improved lung function and asthma control in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and deserves further study for this indication.

5.2 Acute Asthma

Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist.

5.3 Concomitant Corticosteroid Use

While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.

5.4 Aspirin Sensitivity

Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Comparing LAMA with LABA and LTRA as add-on therapies in primary care asthma management [^1f235daf]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Much of the available evidence for asthma management is based on research carried out in adults, which leads to a greater restriction of licensing of medication in children, creating additional difficulties in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for paediatric patients with asthma. Despite advances in care, asthma still presents a burden within this population, with many children remaining symptomatic and uncontrolled. Data in patients aged < 18 years are currently limited due to inherent difficulties in the study of this population; however, available evidence suggests that LABAs and tiotropium have comparable effects with respect to lung function, asthma control and exacerbations. Of the LABAs, LTRAs and LAMAs reviewed here, the LTRA montelukast is the only add-on treatment that is indicated for use in patients aged < 4 years (as a chewable tablet) and the only add-on treatment recommended for use in patients aged ≤ 5 years as an optional controller treatment. Clinical trials of LTRAs in children aged ≤ 5 years have not demonstrated any safety concerns. However, in 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that a boxed warning for the LTRA montelukast was appropriate due to the risk of mental health side effects, and advised that healthcare professionals (HCPs) consider the benefits and risks of mental health side effects before prescribing montelukast. Despite less published evidence regarding use of add-on therapies in paediatric patients (aged < 18 years) than in adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years), current available data suggest that all three add-on therapies have comparable safety profiles, with LABAs and LAMAs providing greater improvements in lung function than LTRAs. When selecting the most appropriate add-on therapy for paediatric patients, it is important to consider the reported efficacy, safety data and subsequent post-marketing safety warnings (if applicable) and the indications of these add-on therapies, as not all are appropriate for all age ranges (Table 1).

From April 1998, montelukast was prescribed for 110 patients with persistent but controlled asthma, primarily for the corticosteroid-sparing effect. Outcomes after 1 year were determined from audits of medical records and responses to questionnaires.

Results

At least 56% of patients continued receiving montelukast for the entire year. However, compared to those patients who had discontinued montelukast therapy, those who continued receiving it had no difference in the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy.

Conclusion

Montelukast had marginal utility in the management of these adult patients with controlled persistent asthma.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

For the tablets, advise the patient and/or caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- Advise patients about the potential risk for serious neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral changes with montelukast sodium use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium with patients when prescribing or continuing treatment with montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Advise patients to monitor for changes in behavior or neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients taking montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Instruct patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately if changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient occur, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Advise patients to take montelukast sodium daily as prescribed, even when they are asymptomatic, as well as during periods of worsening asthma, and to contact their physicians if their asthma is not well controlled.

- Advise patients that oral montelukast sodium is not for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. They should have appropriate short-acting inhaled β-agonist medication available to treat asthma exacerbations. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- Advise patients to seek medical attention if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed.

- Instruct patients to continue other anti-asthma medications as prescribed unless instructed by a physician.

- Instruct patients with known aspirin sensitivity to continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### The expanding role of leukotriene receptor antagonists in chronic asthma [^6f1f8358]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive review of studies that evaluate the effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists in adult chronic asthma.

Data Sources

A literature search using MEDLINE, Clinical Evidence, and the Cochrane Library was performed using the following keywords: randomized controlled trial, asthma, cysteinyl leukotriene, leukotriene receptor antagonist, antileukotriene, montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast, inflammation, lung function, exacerbations, and symptoms.

Study Selection

Relevant peer-reviewed articles (mostly randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and reviews) published up to July 2006 were selected and extracted.

Results

Leukotriene receptor antagonists are beneficial across a range of asthma severities and may have a particular role in exercise-induced asthma, aspirin-sensitive asthma, and individuals with concomitant allergic rhinitis.

Conclusion

In the management of chronic asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists have emerged as a useful oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory adjunct both as monotherapy and in combination with other classes of drugs. Monitoring their effects in terms of lung function alone may result in clinicians missing beneficial effects on inflammatory biomarkers, airway hyperresponsiveness, and exacerbations.

In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n = 642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV1compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV1, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and "as-needed" β-agonist requirements.

In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n = 80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) in nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) and combination therapy — We recommend that the clinician not select an oral LTRA for the treatment of NAR (strength conditional; certainty ungraded as there are no studies), and the text states there is no evidence, mechanistic rationale, or expert opinion supporting LTRAs in NAR. For AR, an oral LTRA plus oral antihistamine may be more effective than LTRA monotherapy, and this combination is similarly effective as intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) monotherapy though likely more costly and burdensome; when considering montelukast, a shared‑decision making conversation should be utilized.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^21ef3f3d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast is FDA-approved for treatment of symptoms of seasonal AR in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older and perennial AR in adults and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older; evidence shows LTRAs are more effective than placebo, are as effective as oral antihistamines in some trials, but are less effective than oral antihistamines and INS. In a single randomized, double-blind study, montelukast had a similar effect to pseudoephedrine except for nasal congestion where pseudoephedrine was more effective; montelukast is generally well tolerated and is not associated with drowsiness, behavior-related adverse events were infrequent in placebo-controlled trials, but rare drug-induced neuropsychiatric events have been reported and suicidal ideation was reported in 1 of 9929 patients (0.01%) in clinical trials treated with montelukast. Because montelukast is currently more expensive and equally as effective as or less effective than oral antihistamines for AR and is less effective than INS, clinicians should not routinely offer an LTRA as primary therapy for patients with AR.

### Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of persistent asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years [^ed8630db]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The greatest prevalence of asthma is in preschool children; however, the clinical utility of asthma therapy for this age group is limited by a narrow therapeutic index, long-term tolerability, and frequency and/or difficulty of administration. Inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled cromolyn are the most commonly prescribed controller therapies for young children with persistent asthma, although very young patients may have difficulty using inhalers, and dose delivery can be variable. Moreover, reduced compliance with inhaled therapy relative to orally administered therapy has been reported. One potential advantage of montelukast is the ease of administering a once-daily chewable tablet; additionally, no tachyphylaxis or change in the safety profile has been evidenced after up to 140 and 80 weeks of montelukast therapy in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 to 14 years, respectively. To our knowledge, this represents the first large, multicenter study to address the effects of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in children younger than 5 years of age with persistent asthma, as well as one of the few asthma studies that incorporated end points validated for use in preschool children.

Objective

Our primary objective was to determine the safety profile of montelukast, an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, in preschool children with persistent asthma. Secondarily, the effect of montelukast on exploratory measures of asthma control was also studied. DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We conducted a double-blind, multicenter, multinational study at 93 centers worldwide: including 56 in the United States, and 21 in countries in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. In this study, we randomly assigned 689 patients (aged 2–5 years) to 12 weeks of treatment with placebo (228 patients) or 4 mg of montelukast as a chewable tablet (461 patients) after a 2-week placebo baseline period. Patients had a history of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring use of beta-agonist and a predefined level of daytime asthma symptoms. Caregivers answered questions twice daily on a validated, asthma-specific diary card and, at specified times during the study, completed a validated asthma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Physicians and caregivers completed a global evaluation of asthma control at the end of the study. Efficacy end points included: daytime and overnight asthma symptoms, daily use of beta-agonist, days without asthma, frequency of asthma attacks, number of patients discontinued because of asthma, need for rescue medication, physician and caregiver global evaluations of change, asthma-specific caregiver quality of life, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts. Although exploratory, the efficacy end points were predefined and their analyses were written in a data analysis plan before study unblinding. At screening and at study completion, a complete physical examination was performed. Routine laboratory tests were drawn at screening and weeks 6 and 12, and submitted to a central laboratory for analysis. Adverse effects were collected from caregivers at each clinic visit. An intention-to-treat approach, including all patients with a baseline measurement and at least 1 postrandomization measurement, was performed for all efficacy end points. An analysis-of-variance model with terms for treatment, study center and stratum (inhaled/nebulized corticosteroid use, cromolyn use, or none) was used to estimate treatment group means and between-group differences and to construct 95% confidence intervals. Treatment-by-age, -sex, -race, -radioallergosorbent test, -stratum, and -study center interactions were evaluated by including each term separately. Fisher's exact test was used for between-group comparisons of the frequency of asthma attacks, discontinuations from the study because of worsening asthma, need for rescue medication, and the frequencies of adverse effects. Because of an imbalance in baseline values for eosinophil counts for the 2 treatment groups, an analysis of covariance was performed on the eosinophil change from baseline with the patient's baseline as covariate.

Study Participants

Of the 689 patients enrolled, approximately 60% were boys and 60% were white. Patients were relatively evenly divided by age: 21%, 24%, 30%, and 23% were aged 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. For 77% of the patients, asthma symptoms first developed during the first 3 years of life. During the placebo baseline period, patients had asthma symptoms on 6.1 days/week and used beta-agonist on 6.0 days/week.

Results

In over 12 weeks of treatment of patients aged 2 to 5 years, montelukast administered as a 4-mg chewable tablet produced significant improvements compared with placebo in multiple parameters of asthma control including: daytime asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, trouble breathing, and activity limitation); overnight asthma symptoms (cough); the percentage of days with asthma symptoms; the percentage of days without asthma; the need for beta-agonist or oral corticosteroids; physician global evaluations; and peripheral blood eosinophils. The clinical benefit of montelukast was evident within 1 day of starting therapy. Improvements in asthma control were consistent across age, sex, race, and study center, and whether or not patients had a positive radioallergosorbent test. Montelukast demonstrated a consistent effect regardless of concomitant use of inhaled/nebulized corticosteroid or cromolyn therapy. Caregiver global evaluations, the percentage of patients experiencing asthma attacks, and improvements in quality-of-life scores favored montelukast, but were not significantly different from placebo. There were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups in overall frequency of adverse effects or of individual adverse effects, with the exception of asthma, which occurred significantly more frequently in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the frequency of laboratory adverse effects or in the frequency of elevated serum transaminase levels. Approximately 90% of the patients completed the study.

Conclusions

Oral montelukast (4-mg chewable tablet) administered once daily is effective therapy for asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years and is generally well tolerated without clinically important adverse effects. Similarly, in adults and children aged 6 to 14 years, montelukast improves multiple parameters of asthma control. Thus, this study confirms and extends the benefit of montelukast to younger children with persistent asthma.

### Clinical safety and tolerability of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in controlled clinical trials in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^dc4fa178]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist administered orally once daily for treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children. A comprehensive analysis of safety data from double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with montelukast has not been previously reported.

Patients and Methods

A pooled analysis of safety data from 11 multicentre, randomized, controlled montelukast Phase IIb and III trials and five long-term extension studies was performed. A total of 3386 adult patients (aged 15–85 years) and 336 paediatric patients (aged 6–14 years) were enrolled in the trials; 2031 adults received montelukast for up to 4.1 years, and 257 children received montelukast for up to 1.8 years. Summary statistics comparing incidences of adverse events among treatment groups were calculated.

Results

The overall incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events among montelukast-treated patients, both adult and paediatric, was similar to that among patients receiving placebo. There were no clinically relevant differences in individual adverse events, including infectious upper respiratory conditions and transaminase elevations, between montelukast and placebo groups. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred with similar frequencies during placebo, montelukast and inhaled beclomethasone therapy. No dose-related adverse effects of montelukast were observed in adults treated with dosages as high as 200 mg per day (20 times the recommended dose) for 5 months. This tolerability profile montelukast observed in clinical trials has been generally reflected in the post-marketing safety experience seen to date.

Conclusions

These data indicate a tolerability profile for montelukast similar to placebo during both short-term and long-term administration, even at doses substantially higher than the recommended clinical dose of 10 mg once daily for adults and 5 mg once daily for children aged 6–14 years.

### Comparison of ICS dose reduction vs. montelukast discontinuation for step-down therapy in well-controlled asthma: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^439bbb54]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease, affecting an estimated 300 million people globally. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, defined by a history of variable respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough. Diagnosis relies on characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation documented through bronchodilator reversibility testing or other objective tests.

The primary objective of asthma management aims to control of asthma symptoms, enhance lung function, and minimize the risk of long-term complications. This includes infrequent or absent asthma symptoms, preserving or improving personal best lung function, reducing exacerbations, avoiding maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy, and preventing medication side-effects.

The stepwise approach to asthma pharmacotherapy involves gradually increasing medication to achieve symptom control and prevent exacerbations, followed by stepping down after several months of good control. While under-treatment is a well-known issue in asthma management, it's important to recognize that over-treatment is also prevalent and can lead to adverse outcomes.

These consequences include an increased risk of side effects, high-cost burden, and poor adherence. By reducing or "stepping down" asthma pharmacotherapy, healthcare providers can decrease adverse events and financial burden while improving patient adherence. Moreover, stepping down can help re-evaluate the current asthma diagnosis. The minimally effective dose (the lowest dose that maintains good symptom control and minimizes exacerbation) should align with patient values and preferences.

Once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months, gradual stepping-down treatment to find the lowest effective ICS dose should be considered. Montelukast, an orally administered leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), is recommended in the recent GINA guideline as an option for maintenance therapy in patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite ICS use. It is also effective in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and in pediatric population.

Given montelukast's favorable tolerability, ease of use, and safety profile, some patients and physicians may prefer a trial of adding montelukast to ICS rather than increasing the ICS dosage. This preference is due to concerns about adrenal suppression, growth retardation, and bone loss associated with high-dose ICS therapy. A recent meta-analysis found that montelukast did not significantly increase neuropsychiatric events compared with placebo in patients with allergic airway disease. Considering montelukast's favorable safety profile compared to high-dose ICS, we examined ICS dose reduction and montelukast discontinuation as step-down strategies in adult patients with well-controlled asthma.

### A phase I randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-exploration study of single-dose inhaled montelukast in patients with chronic asthma [^6579407c]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of oral montelukast has been well established in asthma and allergic rhinitis in adults and children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate dose-related bronchodilation and tolerability of inhaled montelukast.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, crossover, adaptive-design study comparing single-dose administration of inhaled montelukast versus placebo in patients age 15–65 years with chronic asthma (n = 68). Montelukast was delivered as a witnessed dose through dry powder inhaler at doses of 25, 250, or 1000 μg, and doses of 50, 100, and 500 μg could be used if needed based on a prespecified dose-response algorithm. Each administration was followed by a 4- to 7-day washout period before crossing over to the next treatment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) over the first 4 hours after administration, calculated as a time-weighted average (ΔFEV₁ [0–4 hours]). Other endpoints included the onset and duration of bronchodilation and the effect of albuterol when added to inhaled montelukast.

Results

Over 4 hours postdose, and compared with placebo (least-squares [LS] mean 0.03 L), inhaled montelukast 100 μg (0.13 L; p ≤ .001), 250 μg (0.10 L; p < .01), and 1000 μg (0.12 L; p ≤ .001) had significantly greater ΔFEV₁ (0–4 hours). At 24 hours postdose, inhaled montelukast 100 μg (0.10 L) and 1000 μg (0.09 L) had significantly greater bronchodilation compared with placebo (0.02 L; p < .05 vs. montelukast). Montelukast 1000 μg provided significant bronchodilation versus placebo within 20 minutes of administration (0.03 L vs. -0.05 L), whereas montelukast 100 μg provided significant bronchodilation relative to placebo within 2 hours of dosing (0.09 L vs. 0.01 L). Montelukast (pooled doses) plus albuterol was significantly more effective than montelukast plus placebo for ΔFEV₁ (0–90 minutes) (0.34 L vs. 0.15 L; p = .015). The tolerability of inhaled montelukast was similar to that of placebo. No serious adverse experiences were reported.

Conclusions

Inhaled montelukast provided significant bronchodilation compared with placebo as early as 20 minutes after the administration that persisted for 24 hours and provided additive bronchodilation to albuterol.

### Oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbations: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^18299e6e]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although leukotriene receptor antagonists have an established role in the management of patients with chronic asthma, their efficacy in an acute asthma exacerbation is not fully known.

Methods

87 adults with acute asthma requiring hospitalisation were randomly assigned to receive either montelukast 10 mg or placebo on admission and every evening thereafter for 4 weeks (when they were reviewed as outpatients). All patients were admitted under the care of a consultant chest physician and received full care for acute asthma according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines. The primary end point was the difference in peak expiratory flow (PEF) between active and placebo treatment the morning following admission.

Results

Primary end point data were analysed for 73 patients. At study entry, patients who received montelukast (n = 37) had a mean (± SD) PEF of 227.6 (± 56.9) l/min (47.6% predicted) and those who received placebo (n = 36) had a PEF of 240.3 (± 99.8) l/min (49.6% predicted). The morning after admission, patients who received montelukast achieved a PEF of 389.6 (± 109.7) l/min (81.4% predicted) compared with 332.3 (± 124.9) l/min (69.8% predicted) for placebo (p = 0.046). The mean difference between treatment groups was 57.4 l/min (95% CI of 1.15 to 113.6 l/min or 1.95–21.2% predicted).

Conclusion

In acute asthma exacerbations the additional administration of oral montelukast results in a significantly higher PEF the morning after admission than that achievable with current standard treatment. Clinical trial number NCT01011452.

Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196).

### Add-on therapy options in asthma not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids: a comprehensive review [^25ac21d6]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)

Rationale

Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-antagonists (LTRA), such as montelukast, pranlukast and zafirlukast, are a new class of asthma medication, whose role in the stepwise management of asthma has not yet been fully established. Leukotriene antagonists blunt the obstructive response and have weak anti-inflammatory activity. In some studies corticosteroids are not very effective inhibitors of cysteinyl leukotriene pathways, at least when assessed by their inability to reduce cysteinyl leukotriene concentrations and thus combination of these therapeutic classes may offer some benefit.

Step 2

The preferred option is regular, daily, low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, given for at least 3 months (see Box 6–6 in Referencefor ICS doses). Regular montelukast is less effective than low-dose ICS, and parents/caregivers should be counseled about potential neurobehavioral adverse effects, as in a boxed warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Step 3

Before considering step-up to double the "low" ICS dose, check for concomitant or alternative diagnoses, check and correct inhaler technique and adherence, and ask about risk factors such as exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke. ICS–LABA is not recommended in children < 4 years old, as there are insufficient data about efficacy and safety.

Step 4

Refer the child for expert advice if symptoms and/or flare-ups persist, or at any time if side effects of treatment are observed or suspected, or if there are doubts about diagnosis. See Chapter 6 in Referencefor details about other therapeutic options.

### A randomized placebo-controlled study of intravenous montelukast for the treatment of acute asthma [^bfede4fa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Current treatments for acute asthma provide inadequate benefit for some patients. Intravenous montelukast may complement existent therapies.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy of intravenous montelukast as adjunctive therapy for acute asthma.

Methods

A total of 583 adults with acute asthma were treated with standard care during a ≤ 60-minute screening period. Patients with FEV(1) ≤ 50% predicted were randomly allocated to intravenous montelukast 7 mg (n = 291) or placebo (n = 292) in addition to standard care. This double-blind treatment period lasted until a decision for discharge, hospital admission, or discontinuation from the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted average change in FEV(1) during 60 minutes after drug administration. Secondary endpoints included the time-weighted average change in FEV(1) at various intervals (10–120 minutes) and percentage of patients with treatment failure (defined as hospitalization or lack of decision to discharge by 3 hours postadministration).

Results

Montelukast significantly increased FEV(1) at 60 minutes postdose; the difference between change from baseline for placebo (least-squares mean of 0.22 L; 95% CI, 0.17, 0.27) and montelukast (0.32 L; 95% CI, 0.27, 0.37) was 0.10 L (95% CI, 0.04, 0.16). Similar improvements in FEV(1)-related variables were seen at all time points (all P < .05). Although treatment failure did not differ between groups (OR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63, 1.34), a prespecified subgroup analysis suggests likely benefit for intravenous montelukast at US sites.

Conclusion

Intravenous montelukast added to standard care in adults with acute asthma produced significant relief of airway obstruction throughout the 2 hours after administration, with an onset of action as early as 10 minutes.

### Nationwide cohort study of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast and incident or recurrent cardiovascular disease [^e48daef5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The leukotriene pathway has been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. However, the effects of the antileukotriene treatment used in asthmatic patients on cardiovascular outcomes have remained largely unexplored.

Objective

We sought to examine a potential protective role of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast on future risk of incident and recurrent myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.

Methods

A nationwide population-based cohort of approximately 7 million persons integrating data from the Prescribed Drug, Patient, Cause of Death, Income, Educational, and Emigration Registers was followed from July 1, 2005, to December 31, 2008. Analyses were performed in the whole population after exclusion of subjects with a prior cardiovascular diagnosis (incident events; sample size, n = 6,910,923 for myocardial infarction and n = 6,932,578 for stroke) and in subjects with a prior diagnosis (recurrent events; n = 153,937 and n = 132,291 for stroke and myocardial infarction, respectively).

Results

Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) did not reveal an association of montelukast use with incident events. In contrast to these findings, montelukast use was associated with a lower risk for recurrent stroke (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38–0.99) accounting for age, sex, education level, and yearly income. Adjusting the latter finding also for respiratory and cardiovascular medications and diagnoses revealed similar point estimates (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–1.0). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant association of montelukast use with a lower risk for recurrent myocardial infarction in male subjects (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43–0.99).

Conclusion

These data provide a first indication for a potential role of the antiasthma drug montelukast for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Comparison of ICS dose reduction vs. montelukast discontinuation for step-down therapy in well-controlled asthma: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^bfeb1b56]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given these findings and the results of our studies, we advise against discontinuing montelukast therapy in patients who are well-controlled on both montelukast and ICS-LABA. This recommendation is particularly important for patients with more severe asthma, as they may not respond as favorably to a step-down treatment approach without montelukast.

Rationale for the study design

The recent GINA guideline recommends medium-dose ICS-LABA as the preferred Step 4 treatment. LRTAs are among the options that can be added to medium or high-dose ICS. Our study focused on comparing ICS dose reduction with montelukast discontinuation while maintaining LABA dosage. This design was chosen because discontinuing LABA could lead to poor asthma control. The as-needed ICS-Formoterol strategy could be advantageous in avoiding treatment with short-acting beta 2-agonist (SABA), and thus, maintaining a low-dose ICS-formoterol plus montelukast could potentially benefit patients by providing them with a single controller and reliever medication, thereby increasing their adherence. Our study aimed to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of reducing ICS doses in well-controlled asthma. Previous research has demonstrated that most of the benefits of ICS are achieved at low doses with minimal side effects. By reducing ICS doses, we hypothesized that we could potentially minimize the risk of adverse effects associated with high-dose ICS therapy.

### Step 4: stick or twist? A review of asthma therapy [^74bad641]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Evidence: addition of LTRA compared with placebo/usual care

Although ICS are used first line as a single agent for asthma, LTRA do have some beneficial effects when used with SABA aloneand the BTS/SIGN guidance reference seven studies that suggest LTRA may have a modest effect on lung function, SABA use and asthma control over placebo. A meta-analysis of six studies of montelukast add-on therapy in mild–moderate asthma showed improved effectiveness compared with ICS alone, with regard to symptoms and chances of an asthma attack. However, there are no studies in the BTS/SIGN guidance that specifically assess the addition of LTRA as an add-on maintenance therapy at step 4 compared with placebo or usual care, and guidelines extrapolate from studies in milder patients.

More recent evidence includes a 6-week double-blind parallel group trial that assessed 80 mg zafirlukast two times a day in 368 symptomatic asthma patients on high-dose ICS (≥ 1200 µg) plus any usual therapy. The results showed improved morning/evening PEF, daytime symptom score, SABA use and exacerbation risk with LTRA over placebo. A second study randomised 37 patients with symptomatic asthma already taking 800–1200 µg ICS plus a bronchodilator to 225 mg pranlukast two times a day or normal care over 4 weeks, which resulted in improved lung function, asthma symptoms, SABA use and eosinophil levels in the pranlukast arm. A similar study assessed 10 mg once daily montelukast as an add-on therapy to symptomatic asthma patients taking 400–1600 µg ICS over 16 weeks and showed increased asthma control and SABA usage compared with placebo. In contrast, two short-term clinical studies of patients on high-dose ICS (≥ 1000 µg) showed no improvement in symptoms, lung function or SABA use with 10 mg montelukast once dailyFurthermore, a Cochrane review in adults and children with symptomatic asthma concluded that the addition of LTRA had a modest effect on lung function, but no effect on exacerbations requiring steroids. Although there is evidence to suggest that LTRA may be beneficial as an add-on therapy in step 4 patients, in difficult asthma, LTRA may only be beneficial in specific patients.

### Safety and tolerability of montelukast in placebo-controlled pediatric studies and their open-label extensions [^5e21109a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Montelukast is a potent leukotriene-receptor antagonist administered once daily that provides clinical benefit in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults. Because of its wide use as a pediatric controller, there is a need for a further review of the safety and tolerability of montelukast in children.

Objective

To summarize safety and tolerability data for montelukast from previously reported as well as from unpublished placebo-controlled, double-blind, pediatric studies and their active-controlled open-label extension/extended studies.

Methods

These studies evaluated 2,751 pediatric patients 6 months to 14 years of age with persistent asthma, intermittent asthma associated with upper respiratory infection, or allergic rhinitis. These patients were enrolled in seven randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind registration and post-registration studies and three active-controlled open-label extension/extended studies conducted by Merck Research Laboratories between 1995 and 2004.

Results

Montelukast was well tolerated in all studies. Clinical and laboratory adverse experiences for patients treated with montelukast were generally mild and transient. The most frequent clinical adverse events for all treatments (placebo, montelukast, active control/usual care) in virtually all studies were upper respiratory infection, worsening asthma, pharyngitis, and fever.

Conclusion

The clinical and laboratory safety profile for montelukast was similar to that observed for placebo or active control/usual care therapies. The safety profile of montelukast did not change with long-term use.

Option 2: add-on therapy with LTRA

Leukotrienes are lipid mediators produced by inflammatory cells of the airways and are activated during allergic airway inflammation. Pathophysiological effects include bronchoconstriction, increased microvasculature permeability, mucus secretion and recruitment of eosinophils into the airway mucosa. Cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) inhibitors (montelukast, zafirlukast and pranlukast) can improve lung function, symptoms, SABA use, eosinophil level and exacerbation rate over a range of asthma severities in adults and children. One advantage of adding another anti-inflammatory medication to high-dose ICS is a potential steroid-sparing effect. LTRA may also inhibit early and late phase allergen responses, although the magnitude of effect on airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) may be reduced in comparison with ICS.

### Montelukast sodium [^0e2b2eb7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196).

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^8e5e49de]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

To address some of the shortcomings of the current evidence base on potential adverse outcomes associated with montelukast, we conducted a propensity score–matched 1-year follow-up study of incident neuropsychiatric diagnoses among patients with a new treatment episode with montelukast. We used a patient repository of more than 51 million patients. Of LTMAs currently available, we focused on montelukast because 99% of patients with prescriptions for LTMAs in our data were prescribed montelukast. Furthermore, because of the FDA's recent recommendation on reducing use of montelukast in treating allergic rhinitis, we examined incident neuropsychiatric outcomes separately for patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

### Clopidogrel but not prasugrel significantly inhibits the CYP2C8-mediated metabolism of montelukast in humans [^6ebd64b6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet pharmacotherapy is typically used in patient populations that often receive multiple medications. Therefore, the different potentials of prasugrel and clopidogrel to interact with substrates of CYP2C8 can be clinically very important. CYP2C8 is crucial or at least significant for the metabolism of several drugs, e.g. for amodiaquine, paclitaxel, imatinib, daprodustat, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, repaglinide, loperamide, dasabuvir, enzalutamide, and selexipag. As clopidogrel and prasugrel can both be used in the same indications, the current findings imply that prasugrel is a safer alternative than clopidogrel concerning its CYP2C8‐mediated drug–drug interaction potential.

The metabolism of montelukast is complex and a quantitative evaluation of its metabolic routes is challenging in vitro, due to its own inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 (K i 9 nM at microsomal protein concentration 0.25 mg/mL), and its high affinity to both plasma and microsomal proteins. In humans, montelukast is not a significant inhibitor of CYP2C8, 23 because its unbound concentrations in plasma (and tissues) are in the low nanomolar range, at the highest. Along with its major primary metabolite M6, several less important metabolites have been identified, including M5a, M5b, sulfoxide (M2), phenol (M3), and α ‐hydroxy (M7) metabolites, and the acyl‐ β ‐D‐glucuronide metabolite M1. 9, 12, 24 Clinical studies and in vitro studies with typical therapeutic montelukast concentrations (< 0.1 μM) indicate that CYP2C8‐mediated biotransformation from montelukast to M6 and subsequently to its secondary metabolite M4 is a dominant pathway in montelukast elimination. 5, 7, 8, 9 An in vitro study suggested that the glucuronidation of montelukast to M1 by UGT1A3 could significantly contribute to the total elimination of montelukast. 12 In addition, Varma et al. recently reported, based on in vitro results, PBPK modeling, and in vivo experiments in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, that hepatic uptake transporters, e.g. OATP1B1/1B3, have an important role in the pharmacokinetics and drug–drug interactions of montelukast. 13 Moreover, clarithromycin, a CYP3A4 and possible OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor, has been observed to cause a 2.4‐fold increase in montelukast AUC, 25 albeit the same study reported a 30–40% decrease in montelukast exposure by fluconazole, which lacks a convincing mechanistic explanation. 25 The recent pharmacogenomic study by Hirvensalo et al. demonstrated that UGT1A3 can account for up to 35–60% of montelukast metabolism, depending on the UGT1A3 genotype, and suggested that OATP1B1 is not of major importance in the pharmacokinetics of parent montelukast. 14 It should be noted, however, that the role of hepatic influx transporters in montelukast disposition cannot be completely ruled out based on pharmacogenomic data alone.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^e8b5482b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — new and newly emphasized guidance includes that food allergy testing not be performed in the routine evaluation of possible allergic rhinitis (AR), and that the oral leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast should only be used for AR in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies, with noted serious neuropsychiatric events. Either intranasal antihistamine (INAH) or intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) may be offered as first-line monotherapy for nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), and additional studies support the use of combination INCS and INAH in AR and NAR. Oral decongestants should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy, and first-generation antihistamines should not be used in AR, especially on a chronic basis, due to sedation, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, anticholinergic-mediated symptoms, and increased risk of dementia. The use of intranasal decongestants is suggested to be limited to short-term use, with combination therapy including an intranasal decongestant for up to 4 wk in limited circumstances. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets are both effective for AR and may help prevent and/or treat allergic asthma, whereas neither acupuncture nor herbal medications have adequate studies to support a recommendation for AR. New information highlights local allergic rhinitis (LAR), possibly present in up to 25% of patients with rhinitis, and cough is emphasized as a common symptom in both AR and NAR; four new algorithms combining evidence and expert opinion can guide treatment of intermittent and persistent AR and NAR.

Table 6: Effect of Montelukast Sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model)

✱ p < 0.001, compared with placebo Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). Onset of Action and Maintenance of Effects In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, "as-needed" β-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achievedafterthe first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuousonce-dailyevening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium inasthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n = 226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p ≤ 0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n = 642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and "as-needed" β-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n = 80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Experimental data suggest a role for cysteinyl leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of atopy giving a rationale for its use in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic urticaria management. A few clinical observations and small trials suggest that montelukast may be used in an adjunctive manner as an effective therapeutic option for all age categories affected by moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Our own observations proved that montelukast as a prospective corticosteroid-sparing option in the complex therapeutic strategy of corticosteroid-dependent atopic dermatitis patients, even in the severe erythrodermic cases.

### Adverse drug reactions of leukotriene receptor antagonists in children with asthma: a systematic review [^a23a3e71]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a disease of airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. It is the most common chronic disease of childhood globally, affecting more than 338 million children globally. The UK has the highest prevalence of childhood asthma symptoms in the world, with the National Health Service spending around 1 billion pounds each year on asthma care. Globally, the prevalence of asthma has been steadily increasing, and as a result, so has the prescribing of anti-asthma medication, with management guided by national and international guidelines.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are a class of drugs used as a preventative treatment for asthma and are usually prescribed as an additional therapy for patients whose acute symptoms and attacks remain uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids. Montelukast, the originator drug in this class, has also been separately licenced for allergic rhinitis in some nations. Initially licenced in 1998, montelukast was the 16th most prescribed medication in 2020 globally.

Medications come with potential harms such as adverse drug reactions (ADRs), defined as 'an unwanted or harmful reaction which occurs after administration of drugs' and 'is suspected or known to be due to the drug(s)'. In March 2020 montelukast was marked with a boxed warning by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other agencies, warning of the potential severity of adverse events attributed to the labelled drug. There was particular concern regarding significant neuropsychiatric events associated with this drug. These included suicidal thoughts and actions, depression and sleeping problems.

This systematic review aims to identify types of ADRs reported in the medical literature for children and young people (CYP) who use LTRAs and provide estimates of the frequency of these suspected ADRs.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^8048e31f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted.

Objectives

To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short-term measurements (defined as less than three months follow-up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study). Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate-to-severe eczema after short-term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low-quality evidence). When short-term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate-to-severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (mean improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain. All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low-quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long-term control. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low-quality evidence). There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate-to-severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all. Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

For the chewable tablets, advise the patient and/or caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Advise patients about the potential risk for serious neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral changes with montelukast sodium use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium with patients when prescribing or continuing treatment with montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Advise patients to monitor for changes in behavior or neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients taking montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Instruct patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately if changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient occur, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Advise patients to take montelukast sodium daily as prescribed, even when they are asymptomatic, as well as during periods of worsening asthma, and to contact their physicians if their asthma is not well controlled.
Advise patients that oral montelukast sodium is not for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. They should have appropriate short-acting inhaled β-agonist medication available to treat asthma exacerbations. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Advise patients to seek medical attention if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed.
Instruct patients to continue other anti-asthma medications as prescribed unless instructed by a physician.
Instruct patients with known aspirin sensitivity to continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Inform phenylketonuric patients that the 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Safety of antileukotriene agents in asthma management [^e2e8df1e]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This article presents information on the safety of zafirlukast, montelukast, and zileuton, three antileukotrienes (anti-LTs) approved in the United States for the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma. After reading this article, readers should have an understanding both of the general safety of anti-LTs and their specific adverse effects.

Data Sources

Relevant and appropriate controlled clinical studies on the safety of anti-LTs in asthma were used. Only literature in the English language was reviewed.

Study Selection

Material was taken from academic/scholarly journals and appropriate reviews.

Results

Antiasthma agents, including corticosteroids, beta2-agonists, and methylxanthines, may be categorized into two classes: those used for the long-term control and prevention of persistent asthma and those used for the prompt relief of acute symptoms and exacerbations of the disease. Although most agents are safe and well tolerated when used properly, adverse effects may occur with use at higher dose levels. The anti-LTs, including zafirlukast, montelukast, and zileuton, are the first new pharmacologic class in the therapeutic armamentarium for asthma management to be approved in the United States in the past 20 years. Both zafirlukast and montelukast carry pregnancy category B classification whereas zileuton carries pregnancy category C classification. The most common adverse effects observed in clinical trials were headache, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and cough.

Conclusions

The results of clinical trials and real-world experience indicate that these agents are generally safe and well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse effects comparable with placebo.

### A randomized controlled trial of intravenous montelukast in acute asthma [^2de240f8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many patients with acute asthma do not respond adequately to currently accepted therapy, including oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids. Leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast have demonstrated efficacy in chronic asthma, but their efficacy in acute asthma is unknown. In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group pilot study, adults with moderate to severe acute asthma received standard therapy plus either intravenous montelukast (7 or 14 mg) or matching placebo. A total of 201 patients were randomized, and 194 had complete data available for analysis. There was no difference in FEV1 response between the 7- and 14-mg montelukast groups. Montelukast improved FEV1 over the first 20 minutes after intravenous administration (mean percentage change from prerandomization baseline, 14.8% versus 3.6% for the pooled montelukast and placebo treatment groups, respectively; p = 0.007). This benefit was observed at 10 minutes and over 2 hours after intravenous therapy. Patients treated with montelukast tended to receive less beta-agonists and have fewer treatment failures than patients receiving placebo. The tolerability profile for montelukast was similar to that observed for placebo, and no unexpected adverse experiences were observed. We conclude that intravenous montelukast in addition to standard therapy causes rapid benefit and is well tolerated in adults with acute asthma.

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^ad0091a8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of 77 473 adult patients exposed to montelukast, we investigated the association between a new treatment episode with montelukast and incident neuropsychiatric diagnoses over the subsequent year, separately in individuals with diagnosed asthma and those diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. After propensity score matching, patients exposed to montelukast had a statistically significant excess of incident generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, and prescriptions for antidepressants compared with patients not exposed to montelukast. Associations were seen in patients diagnosed with asthma and patients with allergic rhinitis who did not have diagnosed asthma. Overall, there were higher odds of experiencing any incident neuropsychiatric outcome within a year from the initial montelukast prescription compared with patients not exposed to montelukast. After controlling for various potential baseline confounders by propensity score matching, no statistically significant associations were observed for other major neuropsychiatric outcomes, such as psychotic disorders, mood disorders, OCD, or nonfatal self-harm. These findings suggest that future research should aim to identify potential predisposing factors or triggers associated with neuropsychiatric outcomes during montelukast treatment.

Although a meta-analysisof 46 randomized controlled trials did not find an association between montelukast exposure and neuropsychiatric outcomes (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.94–1.39), its subgroup analyses found that patients with asthma who were exposed to montelukast had an excess of neuropsychiatric outcomes, as did patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis exposed to montelukast, but this was not statistically significant. No OR for sleep disturbances was reported, but as calculated using data provided by the authors, this may have been statistically significant (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02–1.90). Our findings are in line with these results concerning the relative contribution of various neuropsychiatric outcomes, but in contrast, our ORs were statistically significant in patients with asthma and those with allergic rhinitis. While randomized controlled trials are less prone to various sources of bias compared with observational studies, including confounding by indication, our propensity score–matched observational study benefitted from a large number of patients, with associated precision of estimates for these rare outcomes. We also found an association between montelukast exposure and incident prescriptions for antidepressants among patients with asthma and those with allergic rhinitis. Because we did not have information on diagnoses for which antidepressants were prescribed, we were not able to establish if antidepressants were prescribed for primary insomnia, anxiety, or depression. Associations between montelukast and antidepressant prescriptions have been reported in other observational studies.

Other Step 3 treatment options for adults and adolescents — For adult patients sensitized to house dust mite with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) provided FEV1 is > 70% predicted. Increasing ICS to medium dose is less effective at a population level than adding a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), and other less efficacious options are low-dose ICS-containing therapy plus either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or low-dose, sustained-release theophylline; note the concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast.

### The role of antileukotrienes in the treatment of asthma [^535e1b7b]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This article reviews the literature on the role of antileukotrienes (anti-LTs), specifically montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton, in the treatment of asthma.

Data Sources

Relevant and appropriate controlled clinical studies were used. Only literature in the English language was reviewed.

Study Selection

Material was taken from academic/scholarly journals, appropriate reviews, and published abstracts.

Results

In guidelines established by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a stepwise approach to asthma management is recommended, with recommendations varying depending on degree of disease severity. The anti-LTs, the newest class of drugs for the treatment of asthma, play a circumscribed role in the guidelines as they were only recently available when the latest guidelines were published. Subsequently, however, extensive clinical experience with the anti-LTs has been amassed. Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated that the anti-LTs improve pulmonary function and quality of life, and reduce asthma symptoms, asthma exacerbations, and use of beta2-agonists and oral steroids. The anti-LTs may be particularly useful in asthma patients with aspirin sensitivity or concomitant allergic rhinitis, as well as in pediatric patients. These agents have additive effects with inhaled corticosteroids and may permit a reduction in inhaled corticosteroid dosages.

Conclusions

The anti-LTs have several features that are likey to promote adherence to treatment and are generally well tolerated. The available clinical data suggest that anti-LTs should be considered as a therapeutic option or as additive therapy in patients with mild to severe asthma.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of montelukast sodium PO (also known as Singulair, Singulair):
- **Eosinophilia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as montelukast has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Exacerbation of asthma**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period. Do not abruptly substitute for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.
- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as chewable tablets contain phenylalanine.

Conclusions on the comparisons between LABA, LTRA and theophylline as add-on options

LABA (salmeterol) seem to have superior efficacy as add-on therapy in persistent asthma not controlled by low to moderate doses of ICS as compared with LTRA (montelukast; four studies or zafirlukast; one study). More studies comparing the different add-on options are needed as well as studies with longer duration as the current evidence is mostly limited to follow-up period of 3 months.

12.2 	Pharmacodynamics

Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD4in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n = 12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.

The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Long-acting beta2-agonists versus anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids for chronic asthma [^bf979162]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms despite taking regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent a management challenge. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) agents may both be considered as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Objectives

We compare the efficacy and safety profile of adding either daily LABA or LTRA in asthmatic patients with asthma who remained symptomatic on ICS.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL databases were searched for randomised controlled trials up to and including January 2004. Reference lists of all included studies and reviews were screened to identify potentially relevant citations. Inquiries regarding other published or unpublished studies supported by the authors of the included studies or pharmaceutical companies who manufacture these agents were made. Conference proceedings of major respiratory meetings were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials conducted in adults or children with recurrent asthma where a LABA (for example, salmeterol or formoterol) or LTRA (for example, montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast) was added to ICS for a minimum of 28 days were considered for inclusion. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and short courses of oral steroids were permitted as rescue medications. Other daily asthma treatments were permitted, providing the dose remained constant during the intervention period. Two reviewers independently reviewed the literature searches.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and trial quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Whenever possible, primary study authors were requested to confirm methodology and data extraction and to provide additional information and clarification when needed. Where necessary, expansion of graphic reproductions and estimation from other data presented in the paper was performed.

Main Results

Twelve randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria; only eight trials including 5,895 patients, provided data in sufficient details to allow aggregation. All eight trials pertained to adults with moderate airway obstruction (% predicted FEV1 66–76%) at baseline. Montelukast (n = 6) or Zafirlukast (n = 2) was compared to Salmeterol (n = 7) or Formoterol (n = 1) as add-on therapy to 400–565 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was significantly lower with LABA+ICS when compared to LTRA+ICS (RR = 0.83, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 0.71, 0.97): the number needed to treat with LABA compared to LTRA, to prevent one exacerbation over 48 weeks, was 38 (95% CI: 23 to 247). The following outcomes also improved significantly with the addition of LABA compared to LTRA to inhaled steroids (Weighted Mean Difference; 95%CI): morning PEFR (16 L/min; 13 to 18), evening PEFR (12 L/min; 9 to 15), FEV(1) (80 mL; 60 to 100), rescue-free days (9%; 4 to 14), symptom-free days (6%; 2 to 11), rescue beta2-agonists (-0.4 puffs/day; -0.2 to -0.5), quality of life (0.1; 0.05 to 0.2), symptom score (Standard Mean Difference -0.2; -0.1 to -0.3), night awakenings (-0.1/week; -0.06 to -0.2) and patient satisfaction (RR 1.12; 1.07 to 1.16). Risk of withdrawals due to any reason was significantly lower with LABA+ICS compared to LTRA+ICS (Relative Risk 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96). Withdrawals due to adverse events or due to poor asthma control, hospitalisation, osteopenia, serious adverse events, overall adverse events, headache or cardiovascular events were not significantly different between the two study groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In asthmatic adults inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids, the addition of LABA is superior to LTRA for preventing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, and for improving lung function, symptoms, and use of rescue beta2-agonists.

Background

Patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms despite taking regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent a management challenge. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) agents may both be considered as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Objectives

We compared the efficacy and safety profile of adding either daily LABA or LTRA in asthmatic patients who remained symptomatic on ICS.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was searched for randomised controlled trials up to and including March 2006. Reference lists of all included studies and reviews were screened to identify potentially relevant citations. Inquiries regarding other published or unpublished studies supported by the authors of the included studies or pharmaceutical companies who manufacture these agents were made. Conference proceedings of major respiratory meetings were also searched.

Main Results

Fifteen randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria; eleven trials including 6,030 participants provided data in sufficient detail to permit aggregation. All eleven trials pertained to adults with moderate airway obstruction (% predicted FEV(1) 66–76%) at baseline. Montelukast (n = 9) or Zafirlukast (n = 2) was compared to Salmeterol (n = 9) or Formoterol (n = 2) as add-on therapy to 400–565 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was significantly lower with LABA+ICS when compared to LTRA+ICS (RR = 0.83, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 0.71, 0.97): the number needed to treat with LABA compared to LTRA, to prevent one exacerbation over 48 weeks, was 38 (95% CI: 23 to 247).

Risk of withdrawals due to any reason was significantly lower with LABA+ICS compared to LTRA+ICS (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95). Withdrawals due to adverse events or due to poor asthma control, hospitalisation, osteopenia, serious adverse events, overall adverse events, headache or cardiovascular events were not significantly different between the two study groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In asthmatic adults inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids, the addition of LABA is superior to LTRA for preventing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, and for improving lung function, symptoms, and the use of rescue beta(2)-agonists.
