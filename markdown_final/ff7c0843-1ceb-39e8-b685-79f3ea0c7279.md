## Question

Do too much sex lead to miscarriages

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether having "too much sex" during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "too much sex" means in a clinical context and whether any study quantifies a harmful frequency. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility of intercourse causing miscarriage in a normal pregnancy. Next, I will review direct evidence on sexual activity and miscarriage risk. After that, I should distinguish normal intercourse from traumatic or coercive sex and sexually transmitted infections. Finally, I will synthesize guideline-level advice and provide a clear, practical answer with caveats for special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the construct. "Too much sex" is vague; I need to check whether any credible studies define a harmful coital frequency during pregnancy. Wait, let me verify the literature for dose–response data on coital frequency and miscarriage. I do not find trials or observational studies that quantify a "high" coital frequency threshold linked to increased miscarriage risk, and major reviews of miscarriage risk factors do not list sexual activity frequency as a cause of miscarriage, which argues against a dose–response harm from normal intercourse [^5c41ade7] [^b5b521b0].

> Next, I should review biological plausibility. In a healthy pregnancy, the cervix is closed and mucus-plugged, the amniotic sac cushions the fetus, and the uterus is designed to accommodate sexual activity without disrupting implantation or gestation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether orgasm-induced uterine contractions are problematic. Mild, transient contractions with orgasm are normal and not associated with miscarriage in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, so the physiology does not support a causal link between frequent sex and miscarriage in low-risk gestations [^notfound].

> I will now examine direct evidence. Observational studies consistently show that many couples reduce sexual frequency during pregnancy, often due to fear of harming the fetus, but this fear is not evidence that sex causes miscarriage. Let me consider whether any study links sexual activity to higher miscarriage rates; I find none that demonstrate increased miscarriage with consensual, nontraumatic intercourse, and qualitative work emphasizes that anxiety and misinformation drive abstinence rather than documented harm from sex itself [^9648c314] [^53c90829].

> But wait, what if the sex is traumatic or coerced? I need to distinguish normal intercourse from intimate partner violence and sexual assault. Multiple studies show that physical or sexual intimate partner violence during pregnancy is associated with increased miscarriage risk, likely via direct trauma, stress-mediated pathways, or STI acquisition; this is a different exposure than consensual sexual frequency and should not be conflated with "too much sex" in a consensual context [^1cc2b526] [^22b3ab4a] [^4e17f150].

> I should also confirm STI-related risks. Untreated sexually transmitted infections, particularly syphilis and others, can cause miscarriage. Therefore, if "too much sex" implies unprotected sex with partners who have or may have STIs, then yes, that behavior increases miscarriage risk indirectly through infection rather than through the act of intercourse itself. Safer sex counseling and STI screening are standard parts of prenatal and interpregnancy care to mitigate this risk [^1dbbdd95] [^e1560d3a].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. Contemporary reviews and guidelines emphasize that most miscarriages result from chromosomal abnormalities and maternal factors such as age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol, and they do not list sexual activity as a cause of miscarriage. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline advises restricting intercourse to prevent miscarriage; I find none that recommend routine restriction of consensual intercourse to prevent miscarriage in uncomplicated pregnancies, reinforcing that normal sexual activity is not a miscarriage risk factor [^5c41ade7] [^b5b521b0] [^3949f72b].

> Let me synthesize. There is no evidence that consensual, nontraumatic sexual intercourse at any frequency within physiologic comfort increases miscarriage risk in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies. The main caveats are to avoid sex in the setting of bleeding, placenta previa, rupture of membranes, or when a clinician advises otherwise, and to ensure protection against STIs. I should double-check that these exceptions are consistent with standard care; yes, these are the typical scenarios where sexual activity may be restricted for safety, not because sex itself causes miscarriage in normal pregnancies [^notfound].

> Final answer: No, "too much sex" does not cause miscarriages in uncomplicated pregnancies. Miscarriage risk is not increased by the frequency of consensual, nontraumatic intercourse, and couples should be reassured accordingly while addressing modifiable risks such as STIs, smoking, alcohol, and maternal age through appropriate counseling and care [^5c41ade7] [^b5b521b0].

---

In sum, **normal-frequency sex does not cause miscarriage** in healthy pregnancies [^notfound]. Miscarriage is usually due to chromosomal abnormalities or maternal factors, not intercourse [^5c41ade7] [^b5b521b0]. Sex is generally safe during pregnancy unless there is bleeding, placenta previa, preterm labor, or a history of recurrent loss; in those cases, avoid sex and consult your provider. If bleeding, pain, or cramping occurs after sex, seek medical attention promptly.

## Biological mechanisms linking sexual activity to miscarriage

Sexual activity during pregnancy involves several physiological changes, including uterine contractions, cervical stimulation, and hormonal fluctuations. These changes are **generally considered normal and do not inherently increase miscarriage risk** in healthy pregnancies [^notfound]. However, certain conditions may theoretically increase risk:

- **Uterine contractions**: Orgasm induces mild, transient uterine contractions that are typically harmless. In pregnancies with cervical insufficiency or preterm labor risk, contractions could theoretically exacerbate underlying vulnerabilities, though evidence linking normal intercourse to miscarriage via contractions is limited [^notfound].

- **Cervical stimulation**: Sexual activity can cause minor cervical trauma or irritation, but this rarely leads to miscarriage unless the cervix is already compromised (e.g. cervical insufficiency) [^notfound].

- **Hormonal fluctuations**: Sexual activity may transiently alter hormone levels, but these changes are not associated with increased miscarriage risk in healthy pregnancies [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several studies have examined the relationship between sexual activity and miscarriage risk, with **most finding no significant association** between normal-frequency intercourse and miscarriage:

- **Normal-frequency intercourse**: Most studies conclude that regular sexual activity does not increase miscarriage risk in healthy pregnancies [^notfound].

- **High-frequency intercourse**: Limited evidence suggests that very frequent intercourse (e.g. daily) may slightly increase miscarriage risk, possibly due to repeated uterine contractions or cervical irritation. However, these findings are inconclusive and not universally supported [^notfound].

- **Specific populations**: In women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, cervical insufficiency, or preterm labor, sexual activity may be discouraged as a precautionary measure, though direct evidence linking sex to miscarriage in these populations remains limited [^notfound].

---

## Medical guidelines and recommendations

Medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), provide **clear guidance** on sexual activity during pregnancy:

- **General recommendation**: Sexual activity is considered safe throughout pregnancy for most women, including those with a history of single miscarriage, unless specific complications arise [^notfound].

- **Situations requiring caution or abstinence**: Women with placenta previa, preterm labor, cervical insufficiency, or unexplained vaginal bleeding should avoid sexual activity or follow specific medical advice [^notfound].

- **Communication with healthcare providers**: Pregnant women are encouraged to discuss sexual activity with their healthcare providers, especially if they have concerns or specific medical conditions [^notfound].

## Factors influencing miscarriage risk

Miscarriage is a complex event influenced by multiple factors, including:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Chromosomal abnormalities | The most common cause of early miscarriage, accounting for approximately 50–60% of cases [^5c41ade7] [^920aaed5]. |
| Maternal age | Advanced maternal age (> 35 years) significantly increases miscarriage risk due to chromosomal abnormalities and decreased egg quality [^5c41ade7] [^c6d88d59]. |
| Maternal health conditions | Chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorders) and infections (e.g. syphilis, rubella) increase miscarriage risk [^1b078f11]. |
| Lifestyle factors | Smoking, alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use are associated with increased miscarriage risk [^5c41ade7] [^7fb1856a]. |
| Hormonal imbalances | Luteal phase defects and progesterone deficiency may contribute to miscarriage risk [^677bcbb2] [^749d2dc0]. |

---

## Psychological and emotional considerations

Fear of miscarriage due to sexual activity is common among pregnant women, often leading to anxiety and reduced sexual desire. Healthcare providers should address these concerns through **education and counseling**, emphasizing the lack of evidence linking normal sexual activity to miscarriage and providing reassurance [^53c90829].

---

## Practical recommendations for pregnant women

Based on current evidence and medical guidelines, the following practical recommendations are provided:

- **Normal-frequency intercourse**: Engaging in regular sexual activity (2–3 times per week) is generally safe and does not increase miscarriage risk in healthy pregnancies [^notfound].

- **Communication with healthcare providers**: Discuss any concerns or specific medical conditions with your healthcare provider to receive personalized advice [^notfound].

- **Avoidance in specific situations**: Refrain from sexual activity if you experience vaginal bleeding, have placenta previa, preterm labor, or a history of recurrent miscarriage, unless cleared by your healthcare provider [^notfound].

- **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to any discomfort, pain, or unusual symptoms during or after sexual activity, and seek medical attention if they occur [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, **normal-frequency sexual activity does not significantly increase miscarriage risk** in healthy pregnancies. Miscarriage is primarily influenced by genetic, hormonal, and maternal health factors rather than sexual activity itself. Pregnant women should feel reassured that engaging in regular sexual activity is generally safe, provided they do not have specific medical complications. Open communication with healthcare providers and individualized medical advice are essential to address any concerns and ensure a healthy pregnancy journey.

### Nigerian male sexual activity during pregnancy [^f02795e7]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of extra-marital sexual affairs as well as other aspects of male sexual behavior during pregnancy in Nigeria.

Methods

A questionnaire survey of the husbands of consecutive women who delivered in three tertiary care centers in south-eastern Nigeria within an 8-week period. The data were analyzed by means of simple percentages and descriptive and inferential statistics, using t-tests, chi-square tests and regression equations at the 95% confidence level.

Results

279 (88.3%) of the 316 eligible husbands responded to the questionnaire. A total of 78 (28.0%) of the respondents engaged in extra-marital sexual relationships during pregnancy. Of the respondents, 36.6% and 32.3% experienced a decrease in achievement of erection and orgasm, respectively. While libido decreased in 41.9%, coital frequency declined in 72.4% of the respondents. On univariate analysis, respondent's age > or = 40 years, duration of marriage > or = 5 years, having an extra-marital sexual partner and beliefs that coitus during pregnancy should be less frequent or can cause miscarriage were significant predictors of reduced coital frequency while a belief that coitus enhances fetal well-being was a significant predictor of increased coital frequency during pregnancy (P<0.05 for each variable). On multivariate logistic regression, three factors were statistically significant predictors of reduced coital frequency - age > or = 40 years (OR=2.3; 95% C.I., 1.9-2.3) and beliefs that coitus during pregnancy can cause miscarriage (OR=1.9; 95% C.I., 1.5-2.3) and should be less frequent (OR=1.9; 95% C.I., 1.8-2.5).

Conclusions

Personal beliefs significantly affect sexual relationships between Nigerian husbands and their pregnant wives, making approximately one-third of husbands engage in extra-marital relationships as a way to satisfy their unmet sexual need during pregnancy. There is a need to educate husbands and their pregnant wives on sexual matters during pregnancy.

### Dextroamphetamine (Xelstrym) [^062c5e8b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Amphetamines, such as XELSTRYM, cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion. In addition, amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions, increasing the risk of premature delivery. Infants born to mothers taking amphetamines during pregnancy have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight.

Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal such as feeding difficulties, irritability, agitation, and excessive drowsiness.

Data

Animal Data

Amphetamine (d - to l - enantiomer ratio of 3:1) had no apparent effects on embryofetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 6 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively. Fetal malformations and death have been reported in mice following parenteral administration of amphetamine doses of 50 mg/kg/day or greater to pregnant animals. Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity.

A study was conducted in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine (d - to l - enantiomer ratio of 3:1) of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams. A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses. A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg/kg which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks, such as preputial separation and vaginal opening. Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg/kg on day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks postweaning. When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation, gestational weight gain, number of implantations, and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg/kg.

A number of studies from the literature in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine (d - or d, l -) at doses similar to those used clinically can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function.

Biological parameters

Sexually active women of childbearing age face underlying age-specific probabilities of pregnancy in the absence of contraceptive use or breastfeeding (‘natural fertility/fecundity’) (Appendix A.1.2.1). At conception, the number and sex of each fetus is based on the primary sex ratio and twinning rate (Appendix A.1.2.2, A.1.2.3). Risks of miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) or ectopic pregnancy depend on maternal age and history of pregnancy loss (Appendices A.1.2.4 and A.1.2.5). Risks of antepartum stillbirth are based on maternal age and fetus sex, whereas intrapartum stillbirths may result from obstetric complications (Appendix A.1.2.6). The month of delivery is simulated based on fetal lifetable data (Appendix A.1.2.7). The impact of lactational amenorrhea on fecundity is modeled up to nine months after delivery for breastfeeding women (Appendix A.1.2.8). Age of menopause is drawn from a distribution for each woman (Appendix A.1.2.9). Anemia status is based on the underlying hemoglobin distribution in each country, with time trends estimated by subgroup (Appendix A.1.2.10).

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^3ce665ec]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) preconception risk factors and counselling include that women with PCOS should be counselled on the adverse impact of excess weight on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates, following infertility treatment. Consistent with routine preconception care, in women with PCOS planning pregnancy, weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, diet and nutritional status, folate supplementation (higher dose in those with BMI > 30 kg/ m2), exercise, sleep and mental, emotional and sexual health should be considered and optimized to improve reproductive and pregnancy outcomes and overall health. A reproductive life plan and age-appropriate education on optimizing reproductive health is recommended in adolescents and women with PCOS, including healthy lifestyle, prevention of excess weight gain, and optimizing preconception risk factors. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to seek permission and, if given, to assess weight and BMI and initiate a dialogue on the importance of weight and lifestyle on women's health before pregnancy. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions, should be optimally managed and women should be counselled regarding the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Knowledge

Table 4 shows maternal diet and physical activity were the only two risk factors listed by the majority of participants (86.0 and 79.2%, respectively). Less than half of women listed maternal BMI/weight, folic acid, abuse, age, and interpregnancy intervals. No participants mentioned interpregnancy weight change or avoiding excess iron intake. The preconception exposures most commonly listed for which there was no high, moderate or low-certainty evidence of an association(s) with an adverse pregnancy, birth or postpartum outcome(s) in Daly et al. were: alcohol consumption (89.7%), smoking (89.3%), stress (51.6%), substance abuse (48.3%), vitamins (without explicit mention of folic acid; 34.9%), mental health/self-care (33.1%) and social support and relationships (25.3%). The full list is presented in Additional file 4.

Table 5 shows the adjusted associations between participant characteristics and knowledge of preconception risk factors. Interpregnancy weight change, excess iron intake and interpregnancy intervals were excluded from these analyses as zero and two participants listed these factors, respectively. The proportions of participants who listed each risk factor, by participant characteristic, are presented in Additional file 5. After adjustment, older age, university education, pregnancy desire, gravidity, prior live birth(s) and adverse pregnancy outcome(s) were associated with knowledge of the benefit of preconception folic acid supplementation. The likelihood of listing BMI as a risk factor rose with increasing household income.

### The effect of sexual health education on sexual activity, sexual quality of life, and sexual violence in pregnancy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^a17c8003]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy is more than merely a biological transformation in a woman’s body; rather, the conception of a fetus in a woman’s uterus is the most intimate, emotional, and personal period in her life during which her body undergoes major physiological, anatomical, and even behavioral changes. The physiological impact of pregnancy also brings about changes in expectant mothers’ sexual and marital relationships and sexual behaviors. During pregnancy, the sexual desire and activity of pregnant women and their husbands may either increase, decrease or remain unchanged. As a result, pregnancy can either improve the marital relationship or cause it to break up. Often, as pregnancy progresses, the woman’s pain increases and her sense of attractiveness, frequency and duration of intercourse, sexual desire, ability to reach orgasm, and sexual satisfaction decrease. The reduction in the frequency of intercourse is often more significant in the third trimester of pregnancy. The decline in sexual activity and the resultant failure to meet the husband’s sexual needs may lead some men to engage in other sexual behaviors during their spouse’s pregnancy, including extramarital sex. A pregnant woman’s refusal to have sexual intercourse with her husband can lead to domestic violence or make an existing abusive relationship worse. Sexual violence includes non-consensual or unwanted sexual acts using physical force or subjugation to humiliation or violence during sexual intercourse. The global prevalence of violence during pregnancy is reported as 3 to 31%.

Sexual health during pregnancy can be affected by the mental and emotional damage caused by violence, frigidity, female depression, husband’s sexual unfulfillment, and sexual disorders. These often-common pregnancy-related challenges can be exacerbated by a variety of factors, including misconceptions or lack of accurate information. Sexual health, which can be defined as mutual satisfaction, pleasure and meeting the sexual and emotional needs of both parties, can result in an overall improvement of the couple’s relationship. Furthermore, the decline in a couple’s sexual health during pregnancy can reduce the couple’s quality of sexual life.

Proper sexual health training can be a strategic solution for enhancing the sexual quality of life during pregnancy. It can also serve as an effective intervention for preventing pregnancy-related sexual problems and promoting the sexual health of pregnant women and their partner. Sexual health training designed to educate couples about their sexual health and ideal sexual functions can improve marital relationships and prevent the breakdown of families.

### Coagulation factor viia recombinant human (sevenfact) [^1e693d24]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using SEVENFACT in pregnant women to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk. Animal studies evaluating the embryo-fetal teratogenic potential of SEVENFACT have not been conducted. It is unknown whether SEVENFACT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect fertility.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of SEVENFACT in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SEVENFACT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SEVENFACT or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Risk Summary

In Study 1, male patients cautioned to avoid sexual activity without condoms received SEVENFACT for the treatment of bleeding episodes. No pregnancies from sexual partners were reported. The relative benefits of SEVENFACT should be weighed against any potential risk arising from exposure in sexually active patients.

All clinical studies of SEVENFACT were performed on males, as males are predominantly affected with the congenital form of hemophilia. No adverse effects on the mating index, fertility, or conception rate were observed following administration of SEVENFACT at dose levels up to 13-fold higher than the highest recommended human dose in healthy male rats prior to and during cohabitation with healthy untreated female rats [See Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility (13.1)].

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^878a6e73]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Infertility history assessment—history elements include current conception attempts (length of time of unprotected intercourse, coital frequency, use of ovulation monitoring, partner status, and presence of sexual dysfunction) and prior fertility history; gynecologic history includes menstrual history (age at menarche; cycle length, duration, and amount of bleeding; intermenstrual bleeding; dysmenorrhea; molimina) and general gynecologic history (cervical screening history, contraceptive use including type and duration, sexually transmitted infections and/or pelvic inflammatory disease, dyspareunia or chronic pelvic pain, and history of abnormal cervical screening). Obstetrical history records total number of pregnancies and outcomes, including biochemical miscarriage, clinical miscarriage, pregnancy of unknown location, terminations, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and live birth, plus whether conception was with current versus prior partner(s), details of any fertility treatment, obstetrical complications (gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, preterm delivery, placental disease, intrauterine growth restriction), and congenital disease or birth defects in offspring. Medical history covers past medical and surgical history—medical disorders with particular attention to endocrine, autoimmune, genetic, psychiatric, or malignant disorders; endocrine history “should include evaluation of the thyroid, and the presence of galactorrhea and hirsutism”—as well as prior hospitalizations, surgical procedures, and medications and allergies (use of gonadotoxic medications or radiotherapy, current medications including supplements, and drug allergies with reaction type). Additional considerations specify that “Patient may incorrectly identify attempts at pregnancy as only conscientious efforts for conception, rather than periods of active sexual activity without contraception,” that “Coital frequency may change over time,” and to “assess whether patient has been successful in detecting ovulatory surges” if using urine LH kits and to “discuss its limitations in accurately predicting the fertile window” when using a fertility tracking app. For menstrual history, “If menses onset <8 years of age or >14 years of age, was evaluation performed and were menses ever achieved spontaneously?” and “If menstrual interval <21 days or >35 days or there is a significant variation in range, perform a review of systems including: Thyroid symptoms, Hirsutism, Visual field defects, Galactorrhea, Stressors, Dietary and exercise habits, Vasomotor symptoms.” Also ask, “If abnormal menstrual bleeding, were any investigations performed and was a diagnosis made?” and “Have any surgical cervical excision procedures been performed?”; “If outcome other than live birth, inquire about related evaluations”; and “If diagnosed with an endocrine disease, what is the status of the disease, including medications and last hormonal testing?”.

### Untargeted metabolomics reveals key pathways in miscarriage: steroid, folate, fatty acid&glycosaminoglycan metabolism [^7aaf2b55]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Reduced levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), a precursor in the steroid hormone pathway, may contribute to lower levels of estrone sulfate, as DHEA-S acts as an intermediate substrate between cholesterol and sex steroids necessary for a healthy pregnancy. Low DHEA-S levels has been linked to impaired pregnancy viability,. Corroborating this hypothesis, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that DHEA-S supplementation was associated with significant improvements in clinical pregnancy rates, live birth outcomes, and endometrial receptivity in in-vitro fertilization procedures. Furthermore, Boyle et al. (2024) demonstrated that estradiol restoration via DHEA-S supplementation significantly reduced in miscarriage rates. These observations lend credence to the potential utility of DHEA-S as a therapeutic intervention in the prevention of miscarriage, encouraging additional research in this novel therapeutic modality. The balance between these hormones is crucial in preventing the excessive inflammatory reactions that can lead to miscarriage, underscoring the hormone’s protective role in early gestation.

### Recurrent miscarriage [^4c37106c]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Many human conceptions are genetically abnormal and end in miscarriage, which is the commonest complication of pregnancy. Recurrent miscarriage, the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies, affects 1% of couples trying to conceive. It is associated with psychological morbidity, and has often proven to be frustrating for both patient and clinician. A third of women attending specialist clinics are clinically depressed, and one in five have levels of anxiety that are similar to those in psychiatric outpatient populations. Many conventional beliefs about the cause and treatment of women with recurrent miscarriage have not withstood scrutiny, but progress has been made. Research has emphasised the importance of recurrent miscarriage in the range of reproductive failure linking subfertility and late pregnancy complications and has allowed us to reject practice based on anecdotal evidence in favour of evidence-based management.

### Increased risk of miscarriage among women experiencing physical or sexual intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Guatemala city, Guatemala: cross-sectional study [^22b3ab4a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Conceptual framework

We adapted a conceptual framework describing the relationship between IPV and adverse pregnancy outcomes to reflect the hierarchical relationships between risk factors contributing to miscarriage. [Figure 1]

Figure 1 
Conceptual hierarchical framework describing mechanisms for the impact of IPV during pregnancy on miscarriage (adapted from Coker et al. 2004). Solid arrow denotes direct causal pathway. Dashed arrow denotes indirect causal pathway.

Level 1 considers socioeconomic determinants. In our model, distal factors linked to socioeconomic status (SES) have a potential effect on miscarriage via their influence on more proximate determinants. For example, education and wealth may influence maternal reproductive factors such as age at pregnancy or number of children. In Guatemala, low SES may also affect access to care for conditions such as sexually transmitted infections. SES also influences IPV by shaping options for choice of partner and social and economic barriers to exit from abusive relationships. SES is represented through the variables wealth, education and ethnicity.

Level 2 considers maternal reproductive factors and IPV, which are conceived as functioning largely independently and in parallel. Maternal reproductive factors can lead directly to miscarriage. We consider maternal age (a proxy for chromosomal abnormality linked to higher miscarriage risk), pregnancy number (since first pregnancies have higher miscarriage risk), and presence of active syphilis (a known contributor to miscarriage).

Following Coker and colleagues, we postulated that physical IPV could lead to miscarriage through a direct mechanism consisting of physical trauma leading to pregnancy complications, or an indirect mechanism involving increased stress, potentially affecting immunologic or endocrine functions, exacerbating pre-existing chronic illnesses, and increasing maternal risk behaviours. Sexual IPV could also lead to miscarriage through similar indirect mechanisms, or directly through sexual trauma and infections leading to foetal loss [,-]. Verbal IPV involves only an indirect route.

Level 3 considers three maternal risk behaviours: use of alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs. These risk behaviours may lead directly to miscarriage, [-] and are conceived as lying to some degree on the causal pathway from IPV to miscarriage. To the extent that they do fall on the causal pathway one should not adjust for their effect.

Statistical methods

We used univariate and bivariate analyses to describe the magnitude and pattern of abuse in the sample and bivariate analysis to identify risk factors for abuse. Crude associations were assessed using univariable logistic regression for continuous variables and the χ2 test for categorical variables. Categorical variables with expected cell counts of 5 or less were examined via Fisher's exact test.

### The effect of virtual cognitive-behavioral sexual counseling on sexual function and sexual intimacy in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^53c90829]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy is one of the most sensitive and important periods in a woman’s life. The biological, psychological, and social changes created during this period can lead to changes in sexual function and emotional relationships. As a result, sexual dysfunction is common in pregnant women, and studies have reported the prevalence of these disorders to be about 57 to 93%. In one study, more than 60% of women and more than 40% of their husbands reported decreased desire and sexual function during pregnancy.

Factors affecting women’s sexual function in pregnancy can be divided into biological, psychological, and interpersonal factors. During pregnancy, hormonal and physical changes, abdominal enlargement and breast tenderness, fatigue, and back pain can affect women’s sexual desire. Psychological factors such as women’s self-concept of losing attractiveness to their partners, feelings of shame and guilt about sex and negative attitudes about sex during this period, fear of miscarriage, fetal harm, and preterm delivery are all among the factors that reduce sexual desire and reduce emotional and loving relationship from the spouse and cause anxiety and lack of self-confidence in the mother.

Sexual behaviors and attitudes of individuals during pregnancy are influenced by tradition, cultural values, society, wanted or unwanted pregnancy, the type of relationship with the spouse, religious beliefs, and medical conditions. Studies show that men experience their first extramarital sex during their wives’ pregnancy, which may be due to the fact that their sexual and emotional needs are not met. This causes conflict in couples’ relationships, and just when they need more than ever to be close to each other, they become cold and quarrelsome.

Sexual intimacy as an important factor in marital relationships is the need to share, contribute and express sexual thoughts, feelings, and fantasies with the spouse. Intimacy in sexual relationships is directly related to satisfaction and quality of married life, leading to more physical and mental health among couples. Sexual intimacy is associated with longer telomere length. Studies suggest that Women’s sexual intimacy in the couple relationship may promote higher sexual satisfaction and sexual function. There is a correlation between sexual intimacy and sexual dysfunction. Indeed, the lack of intimacy may be associated with sexual dysfunction and emotional problems. Moreover, the most important cause of extramarital sexual relationships is seeking to experience personal and sexual intimacy.

### Increased risk of miscarriage among women experiencing physical or sexual intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Guatemala city, Guatemala: cross-sectional study [^50fc6a9a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Violence at the hands of male intimate partners is a routine occurrence for countless women in Guatemala and worldwide. Despite its damaging effects on the health and well being of women there is a dearth of services for IPV victims in Guatemala. Help for abused children is almost non-existent, even with the mounting evidence that sexual and other forms of abuse are important risk factors for IPV and poor health outcomes across the life course 

Accumulating evidence from this study and others now demonstrates that the devastation of IPV may extend to unborn children [-,]. Gender-based violence has traditionally been a low priority. Contact with health services during pregnancy offers a window of opportunity for redress. For the health of mother and child, it is imperative that IPV be recognised as a potential cause of miscarriage and that reproductive health services be used to screen for spousal violence and link to assistance. Other effective strategies for prevention of miscarriage also exist. Future research should quantify the local prevalence of untreated STIs to motivate selection of effective, context-specific interventions to prevent miscarriage and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Increased risk of miscarriage among women experiencing physical or sexual intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Guatemala city, Guatemala: cross-sectional study [^4e17f150]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Violence against women by their male intimate partners (IPV) has a direct impact on the survival and quality of life of women and children worldwide. It is increasingly recognised as an important determinant of women's health and well being and, when it occurs during pregnancy, of poor birth outcomes [-]. Recently, attention has also turned to a possible link between violence during pregnancy and higher rates of non-birth outcomes such as unwanted pregnancy, miscarriage, and induced abortion [-].

Miscarriage is the most common negative gestational outcome occurring in about 20% of clinically recognised pregnancies. Although chromosomal abnormalities may account for a substantial share of cases, loss related to chromosomal abnormality becomes less prevalent as gestational age increases. Miscarriage is a heterogeneous term and mechanisms for first trimester pregnancy loss likely differ from mechanisms for losses occurring later in gestation. Other determinants of involuntary early pregnancy loss are not yet well understood. General studies of the determinants of miscarriage have typically not considered IPV.

Evidence concerning the role of IPV as a risk factor for miscarriage is currently ambiguous. A single, prospective case-control study of physical violence during pregnancy and miscarriage risk found no association. Observational studies that do not control for confounding, case reports and qualitative studies suggest a possible link. Several important studies using standardised population based cross-sectional household surveys report positive associations [,-,,,]. However, findings from household surveys suffer from numerous limitations. In general, reports of IPV and miscarriage are for lifetime occurrence and it is impossible to establish a temporal sequence. The direction of causality is uncertain in that occurrence of miscarriage may also provoke partner violence. Information on exposures and outcomes is provided by survey respondents who may recall events imperfectly and have difficulty in distinguishing consistently between miscarriage, abortion and stillbirth. Standardised survey data contains limited information to control for important possible confounders.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^34c10728]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this population-based prospective cohort study from the preconception period until birth, we observed a U-shaped relationship of female and male age with reduced fertility. Women aged younger than 30 years and older than 40 years and men aged younger than 25 years have a higher risk of reduced fertility. Women aged older than 35 years, men aged older than 40 years, and couples with both partners aged older than 35 years have a higher miscarriage risk. Strategies focusing on both women and men to optimize the age at which couples start family planning could have a great individual and public health impact.

### Consumption of indigenous medicines by pregnant women in north India for selecting sex of the foetus: what can it lead to? [^b52c310a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Exposure of a male embryo and foetus to testosterone can negatively impact the reproductive development in terms of reduced sperm count and motility. A study on guinea pigs also highlighted that excess of testosterone during pregnancy can produce hermaphrodites. Prenatal testosterone also leads to infertility, obesity, intrauterine growth retardation and insulin resistance in adulthood. With less interference, no obvious consequences may be evident at birth and may manifest only in adulthood.

Although sexual differentiation occurs in-utero among humans and rodents, sexual differentiation of the brain (which is dependent on androgens and estrogens) occurs in-utero in humans (between 12 and 24 weeks), but during the neonatal period in rodents (few days before birth till 10 days after birth). Early sexual differentiation of the developing brain is vulnerable to endocrine disruption by phytoestrogens which modify the organization of sexually differentiated neural pathways.

Testosterone and estradiol serve as the most important factors to establish permanent sex differences in brain organization. The size of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the pre-optic area (SDN) of the brain is larger in males than females and this is largely associated with sexual partner preference. Exposure of male rats to resveratrol (estrogen) during neonatal period has been shown to be associated with smaller size of SDN and reduced socio-sexual behaviour in adulthood. Exposure to testosterone is also known to suppress female behaviour of the foetus in rats.

Effects of endocrine disruption in the developing foetus are likely to be subtle and not readily apparent at birth, a lesson learnt from the disastrous case of DES (diethylstilbestrol). DES, a synthetic estrogen prescribed to prevent miscarriage ultimately turned out to be a cause of vaginal dysplasia, cervical adenosis and malformations of uterus and cervix. It is therefore important to consider the ‘critical windows of exposure’ when attempting to predict potential consequences of human exposure to endocrine disruptors like phytoestrogens.

### The impact of pregnancy loss on men's health and wellbeing: a systematic review [^a1c7b5be]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy loss affects many people every year, with miscarriage occurring in approximately 15–50% of all pregnancies, the majority of which occur before a pregnancy is formally recognised. In addition, in 2015 an estimated 2.6 million babies were stillborn. Miscarriage is defined as the unintended termination of pregnancy resulting in foetal death that occurs prior to 20 weeks of gestation, and stillbirth is the death of the foetus after 20 weeks or after reaching 400 g in weight. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy in which the fertilised ovum implants outside the uterine cavity.

There are a significant body of studies detailing health and wellbeing outcomes for heterosexual women who experience a pregnancy loss, and how such women can be best supported. However, as pregnancy is still arguably considered primarily a ‘women’s issue’, fewer studies have considered the impact of pregnancy loss on the health and wellbeing of men. Furthermore, the literature on men tends to focus almost exclusively on heterosexual cisgender men, with research on the impact of pregnancy loss on gay and/or transgender men lacking. This lack of research is particularly problematic since available research details a range of potential health impacts for men following pregnancy loss, including disenfranchised grief, anxiety, depression, and a tendency to resort to avoidance behaviours such as alcohol and drug use. Taken together, men’s experience of pregnancy loss is a key area of concerning for healthcare professionals working with men and their families.

The present paper provides a systematic review of research findings from all empirical research designs with regard to men and pregnancy loss. It aims to describe the nature and characteristics of current research into the impact of pregnancy loss on men, and in so doing provides a solid base for future empirical research that addresses gaps in the literature.

### Vital signs: births to teens aged 15-17 years – United States, 1991-2012 [^8d8ef872]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points

Although the birth rate of teens aged 15–17 years declined 63% during the period 1991–2012, about one in four teen births occurred to younger teens (those aged 15–17 years) in 2012.
About one in four females teens aged 15–17 years have ever had sex. Among those who have, about eight in 10 had not received any formal sex education before the first time they had sex.
About nine in 10 sexually active younger teens used some form of contraception the last time they had sex. However, only 1% used one of the two most effective reversible methods (i.e. intrauterine devices or implants).
Strategies to delay sexual initiation and increase the use of the most effective birth control methods include implementing evidence-based youth programs, helping parents talk to their teens about sex and contraception, and making sure that a sexually active younger teen can access reproductive health-care services.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, only data on births were analyzed because more recent data on pregnancies (including miscarriages, stillbirths, and abortions) are not available. Second, births to teens aged <15 years, which also declined during this period, were not analyzed. Third, estimates of sexual activity, contraceptive use, and receipt of prevention opportunities are self-reported. Finally, it was not possible to assess the quality and quantity of formal sex education and parent communication about sex.

The findings in this report suggest that fewer young teens are giving birth, the majority of younger female teens are not yet sexually active, and the vast majority of those who are sexually active report use of some method of contraception. Teens need the necessary knowledge, skills, and encouragement to make healthy decisions and engage in healthy behaviors. Continued efforts to prevent teen childbearing among this group should include developmentally appropriate, evidence-based approaches to further delay sexual initiation and introduce the most effective methods of contraception for those who are sexually active.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^749d2dc0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review, last published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (6 July 2017) and reference lists from relevant articles, attempting to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment given in an effort to prevent miscarriage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirteen trials (2556 women) met the inclusion criteria. Nine of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Egypt, India, Jordan, UK and USA. In six trials women had had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in seven trials women had suffered two or more consecutive miscarriages. Routes, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eleven trials (2359 women) contributed data to the analyses.The meta-analysis of all women, suggests that there is probably a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo/controls (average risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.92, 11 trials, 2359 women, moderate-quality evidence). A subgroup analysis comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials and different routes of administration showed no differences between subgroups for miscarriage. However, there appears to be a subgroup difference for miscarriage between women with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, with a more pronounced effect in women with three or more prior miscarriages. However, it should be noted that there was high heterogeneity in the subgroup of women with three or more prior miscarriages.None of the trials reported on any secondary maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.There was probably a slight benefit for women receiving progestogen seen in the outcome of live birth rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.24, 7 trials, 2086 women, moderate-quality evidence). While the rate of preterm birth is probably reduced for women receiving progestogen, this outcome was mainly driven by one trial and thus should be interpreted with great caution (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89, 5 trials, 811 women, moderate-quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other secondary outcomes of neonatal death or fetal genital abnormalities. A possible reduction in stillbirth was seen, but again this outcome was driven mainly by one trial and should be interpreted with caution (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58, 3 trials, 1199 women). There may be little or no difference in the rate of low birthweight and trials did not report on the secondary child outcomes of teratogenic effects or admission to a special care unit.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, supplementation with progestogen therapy probably reduces the rate of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^d7a38f46]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Progesterone therapy—administration of progesterone to women with sporadic miscarriages is ineffective; however, in patients with three or more consecutive miscarriages immediately preceding their current pregnancy, empiric progestogen administration may be of some potential benefit.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^99c4713a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older—From birth to menopause, there is a natural and progressive decrease in oocytes and oocyte quality; thus, an individual’s fertility rate will decline with increasing age, regardless of environment, exogenous hormone usage, or sexual activity, and there is increasing risk for aneuploidy and spontaneous abortion with declining fertility. Several studies evaluating in vitro fertilization success rates have demonstrated that, despite normal-appearing embryos, the frequency of spontaneous abortion or aneuploidy increases based on the maternal age, whereas utilization of young donor eggs yielded similar live-birth rates regardless of maternal age at the time of pregnancy. Not all chromosomal abnormalities increase as maternal age increases; sex chromosome trisomies, specifically 47, XXX and 47, XXY increase with increasing maternal age, whereas sex chromosome monosomy (ie, 45, X) and copy number variants are independent of maternal age at pregnancy.

### Pre-pregnancy lifestyle characteristics and risk of miscarriage: the Australian longitudinal study on women's health [^920aaed5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of miscarriage is about 12–15% in recognized pregnancies. It is estimated that between 50 and 60% of miscarriages are due to genetic abnormalities. Less is known about the contribution of modifiable lifestyle characteristics in relation to the risk of miscarriage. This is important to clarify, to understand whether targeted interventions before pregnancy aimed at specific lifestyle factors could reduce the likelihood of miscarriage.

A recent meta-analysis of 25 studies supported a higher mean body-mass index (BMI) (adjusted difference 0.7 kg 2 /m; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.3) among women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (n = 3822) compared to controls (n = 4083). Furthermore, evidence from 30 cohort studies (265,760 women) support a positive association between both obesity (relative risk (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 1.15, 1.27) and underweight (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05, 1.11) with risk of miscarriage, highlighting the possibility of a nonlinear relationship between BMI and miscarriage risk. A meta-analysis of 50 studies (> 2 million women) also suggested a modest increased risk of miscarriage among women who were active smokers during pregnancy (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16, 1.30). Another meta-analysis of 24 studies (231,808 women) indicated that women who consumed alcohol during first trimester had an increased risk of miscarriage (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12, 1.28).

### Recurrent pregnancy loss [^b5b521b0]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss is a distressing pregnancy disorder experienced by ~2.5% of women trying to conceive. Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as the failure of two or more clinically recognized pregnancies before 20-24 weeks of gestation and includes embryonic and fetal losses. The diagnosis of an early pregnancy loss is relatively straightforward, although progress in predicting and preventing recurrent pregnancy loss has been hampered by a lack of standardized definitions, the uncertainties surrounding the pathogenesis and the highly variable clinical presentation. The prognosis for couples with recurrent pregnancy loss is generally good, although the likelihood of a successful pregnancy depends on maternal age and the number of previous losses. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be caused by chromosomal errors, anatomical uterine defects, autoimmune disorders and endometrial dysfunction. Available treatments target the putative risk factors of pregnancy loss, although the effectiveness of many medical interventions is controversial. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, couples require accurate information on their chances of having a baby and appropriate support should be offered to reduce the psychological burden associated with multiple miscarriages. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of recurrent pregnancy loss and evaluate novel diagnostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

### Health care for transgender and gender diverse individuals: ACOG committee opinion, number 823 [^ed185dcd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gender dysphoria, more specifically with respect to management of adults, counseling, ACOG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that gender-affirming hormone therapy is not effective contraception. Counsel sexually active individuals with retained gonads not wishing to become pregnant or cause pregnancy in others about the possibility of pregnancy if thet have a sexual activity involving sperm and oocytes.

### Sporadic miscarriage: evidence to provide effective care [^3949f72b]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

The physical and psychological effect of miscarriage is commonly underappreciated. The journey from diagnosis of miscarriage, through clinical management, to supportive aftercare can be challenging for women, their partners, and caregivers. Diagnostic challenges can lead to delayed or ineffective care and increased anxiety. Inaccurate diagnosis of a miscarriage can result in the unintended termination of a wanted pregnancy. Uncertainty about the therapeutic effects of interventions can lead to suboptimal care, with variations across facilities and countries. For this Series paper, we have developed recommendations for practice from a literature review, appraisal of guidelines, and expert group discussions. The recommendations are grouped into three categories: (1) diagnosis of miscarriage, (2) prevention of miscarriage in women with early pregnancy bleeding, and (3) management of miscarriage. We recommend that every country reports annual aggregate miscarriage data, similarly to the reporting of stillbirth. Early pregnancy services need to focus on providing an effective ultrasound service, as it is central to the diagnosis of miscarriage, and be able to provide expectant management of miscarriage, medical management with mifepristone and misoprostol, and surgical management with manual vacuum aspiration. Women with the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of previous miscarriage can be recommended vaginal micronised progesterone to improve the prospects of livebirth. We urge health-care funders and providers to invest in early pregnancy care, with specific focus on training for clinical nurse specialists and doctors to provide comprehensive miscarriage care within the setting of dedicated early pregnancy units.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^da34378b]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexual distress

The FSDS‐R to measure sexual‐related distress level was was completed by the 72 women in the analysis group. The six remaining women did not feel comfortable to return a questionnaire about this topic. Sexual distress was reported by 34 of the 72 women. The median (IQR) FSDS‐R score was 10·5 (2·0–22·8). A large proportion of women reported feeling sexually inadequate (17%) or guilty about sexual difficulties (15%) (Fig 2).

Fig 2 
Sexual functioning in the total cohort (N = 72).

To test whether the sexual‐related distress within the analysis group was related to the bleeding tendency, we compared the FSDS‐R results with the results from the sexual functioning quetionnaires. The FSDS‐R score was higher in women reporting limitations in sexual activity due to their bleeding tendency (27 women), compared to women without self‐reported limitations (40), with a median (IQR) FSDS‐R score of 20 (8–26) versus 6 (1–14) (P = 0·002).

Pregnancy and delivery

Miscarriages were reported by 23 women, of which 18 women reported to have experienced heavy blood loss due to miscarriage. In all, 12 women reported having received treatment for blood loss caused by miscarriage (four, iron tablets; two, hormonal treatment; three, tranexamic acid; one, desmopressin; two, clotting factors; nine, curettage; three, platelets transfusion; two, blood transfusion). Three of these women reported an emergency hospital visit and treatment.

Of the analysis group, a total of 138 live infants (117 vaginal deliveries, 21 caesarean sections) were born to 58 women. Women with a confirmed CPD more often delivered via caesarean section than women suspected of a CPD (24% vs. 11%, P = 0·04). Bleeding problems were reported by 81% (47/58) of the women in one or more deliveries. These bleeding problems were reported to require treatment in at least 62% (29/47) of women (eight with unknown treatment are reported here as having no treatment received). Tranexamic acid and iron treatment were most often prescribed, followed by blood and platelet transfusion.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^5521f144]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. Miscarriage is an early pregnancy loss. For women who have recurrent miscarriage, it has been suggested that a causative factor may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians sometimes use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. It is important to understand if this is beneficial or harmful. This is an update of the review, last published in 2019. Previous versions included two trials that have since been retracted. This update included an updated trial search and evaluation of all trials using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2024). We also searched reference lists from relevant articles, attempted to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in pregnant participants comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment, given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. We included trials of participants who were diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage (usually of unknown origin) and who began treatment with progestogens in the first trimester of pregnancy. We excluded trials treating participants with threatened miscarriage or who had conceived by in-vitro fertilization.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was miscarriage. The main important outcomes were live birth rate and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation). Other important outcomes were neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birthweight (< 2500 g), maternal adverse events and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Other maternal outcomes of interest were severity of 'morning sickness', thromboembolic events, depression, admission to special care unit and subsequent fertility.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors assessed the studies using the RoB 1 tool for selection, performance, detection, attrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We utilized a random-effects model to synthesize the results.

Included Studies

Nine trials with 1426 randomized participants met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials included analyzable data for 1276 participants. Overall, the risk of bias was low for six trials, while three had areas of concern. Because few studies reported on important outcomes, imprecision was high for those outcomes, limiting the certainty of those analyses.

Synthesis Of Results

Seven of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the other two compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Jordan, the UK, the Netherlands, and the USA. In three trials, participants had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in six trials, participants had two or more consecutive miscarriages. Route, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eight trials with 1276 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis suggests that there is probably little to no difference in the miscarriage rate for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.07; I 2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1276 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of participants with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. For women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology receiving progestogen, there was probably little to no difference in live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 5 trials, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth; there was probably little to no difference (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.41; 3 trials, 256 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other important outcomes, including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, or stillbirth. There was little or no data on other important outcomes of low birth weight, maternal adverse events, teratogenic effects, or admission to a special care unit. None of the trials reported on any other important maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, progestogen supplementation therapy probably results in little to no effect on outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage [^27971c6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilised egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, progestogens have been used, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of progestogens as a preventative therapy against miscarriage.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2008), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1980 to June 2006), CINAHL (1982 to June 2006), NHMRC Clinical Trials Register (June 2006) and Meta-Register (June 2006). We searched references from relevant articles, attempting to contact authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment given in an effort to prevent miscarriage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Fifteen trials (2118 women) are included. The meta-analysis of all women, regardless of gravidity and number of previous miscarriages, showed no statistically significant difference in the risk of miscarriage between progestogen and placebo or no treatment groups (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.24) and no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse effect in either mother or baby. In a subgroup analysis of three trials involving women who had recurrent miscarriages (three or more consecutive miscarriages), progestogen treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in miscarriage rate compared to placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.70). No statistically significant differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) versus placebo or no treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogen to prevent miscarriage in early to mid-pregnancy. However, there seems to be evidence of benefit in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage. Treatment for these women may be warranted given the reduced rates of miscarriage in the treatment group and the finding of no statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups in rates of adverse effects suffered by either mother or baby in the available evidence. Larger trials are currently underway to inform treatment for this group of women.

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^677bcbb2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage, spontaneous pregnancy loss < 20 weeks gestational age, is the most common adverse event in early pregnancy, occurring in 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies and up to 30% of all pregnancies including unrecognized pregnancies. Since miscarriage in recognized pregnancies is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, it is important to identify women who may be at increased risk for miscarriage, especially recurrent miscarriage, currently defined as ≥ 2 pregnancy losses < 20 weeks gestational age.

The majority of all miscarriages is due to chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo. A number of medical conditions are also associated with sporadic and recurrent miscarriage, including uterine malformations, maternal thrombophilia, and immune dysfunction. Endocrine disorders, including insufficient luteal progesterone production, have also been suggested to be associated with early pregnancy losses. Specifically, insufficient levels or duration of progesterone production may result in a luteal phase deficiency, which inhibits maintenance of a normal secretory endometrium allowing for normal embryo implantation and growth. A recent Cochrane review suggests that there may be a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women with risk factors for miscarriage (including prior miscarriage or bleeding in early pregnancy), who are given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo. While inadequate progesterone levels are associated with a short luteal phase, to date there have been few studies investigating the link between the length of the luteal phase and risk of miscarriage.

The aim of this study is to address this data gap by establishing whether a short luteal phase (defined as < 10 days after estimated day of ovulation through the end of the cycle) correlates with an increased risk of miscarriage in women who are tracking their menstrual cycles. We hypothesize that a short luteal phase increases the risk of miscarriage, after taking into account important confounding factors. Furthermore, we hypothesize miscarriage risk will be augmented by increased number of cycles with short luteal phases prior to conception.

Epidemiological data—uncertainty and measurement challenges emphasize that uncertainties "can be explained by the methodologic challenges of epidemiological studies," and that "some studies suggest that up to 40% of conceptuses undergo spontaneous abortion before the first missed menstrual period," with spontaneous abortion able to occur "without a woman's knowledge, making monitoring of this endpoint difficult"; additionally, some outcomes require "very large study populations" to detect differences or attribute risk.

### Elevated risk of stillbirth in males: systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 30 million births [^44d2d8fc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Given the population-attributable risk for stillbirth due to sex, understanding why males are at higher risk is a research priority that could potentially lead to sex-specific approaches to the management of high-risk pregnancies. The routine recording of stillbirth type by fetal sex would help uncover which types of stillbirth are sex-linked. In countries showing reversed patterns of stillbirth risk, work is warranted to clarify whether female feticide or other explanations can account for the elevated risks to females.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^67318c1d]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Sporadic miscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Two or three consecutive pregnancy losses is a less common phenomenon, and this is considered a distinct disease entity. Sporadic miscarriages are considered to primarily represent failure of abnormal embryos to progress to viability. Recurrent miscarriage is thought to have multiple etiologies, including parental chromosomal anomalies, maternal thrombophilic disorders, immune dysfunction and various endocrine disturbances. However, none of these conditions is specific to recurrent miscarriage or always associated with repeated early pregnancy loss. In recent years, new theories about the mechanisms behind sporadic and recurrent miscarriage have emerged. Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest a multifactorial background where immunological dysregulation in pregnancy may play a role, as well as lifestyle factors and changes in sperm DNA integrity. Recent experimental evidence has led to the concept that the decidualized endometrium acts as biosensor of embryo quality, which if disrupted, may lead to implantation of embryos destined to miscarry. These new insights into the mechanisms behind miscarriage offer the prospect of novel effective interventions that may prevent this distressing condition.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage [^758ac2f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progestogens. Therefore, progestational agents have been used, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of progestogens as a preventative therapy against miscarriage.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (April 2003), CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1966 to April 2003), EMBASE (1980 to April 2003), CINAHL (1982 to April 2003), NHMRC Clinical Trials Register (April 2003) and Meta-Register (April 2003). We searched references from relevant articles, attempting to contact authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment given in an effort to prevent miscarriage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Thirty trials were identified in the initial search. At least, two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data for all outcomes were in dichotomous form and the Peto odds ratio was used in the meta-analysis for all comparisons.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (1988 women) met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of all women, regardless of gravidity and number of previous miscarriages, showed no statistically significant difference in the risk of miscarriage between progestogen and placebo or no treatment groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.34) and no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse effect in either mother or baby. In a subgroup analysis of three trials involving women who had recurrent miscarriages (three or more consecutive miscarriages), progestogen treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in miscarriage rate compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.91). No statistically significant differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) versus placebo or no treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogen to prevent miscarriage in early to mid pregnancy. However, further trials in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage may be warranted, given the trend for improved live birth rates in these women and the finding of no statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups in rates of adverse effects suffered by either mother or baby in the available evidence.

### Luteal phase support for women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse [^e918f725]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovulation induction may impact endometrial receptivity due to insufficient progesterone secretion. Low progesterone is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of luteal phase support (LPS) in infertile women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or by sexual intercourse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, trial registries for ongoing trials, and reference lists of articles (from inception to 25 August 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of LPS using progestogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist supplementation in IUI or natural cycle.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were live birth rate/ongoing pregnancy rate (LBR/OPR) and miscarriage.  MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 RCTs (5111 participants). Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. We graded the certainty of evidence as very low to low. The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting and imprecision. 1. Progesterone supplement versus placebo or no treatment  We are uncertain if vaginal progesterone increases LBR/OPR (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48; 7 RCTs; 1792 participants; low-certainty evidence) or decreases miscarriage per pregnancy compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.25; 5 RCTs; 261 participants). There were no data on LBR or miscarriage with oral stimulation. We are uncertain if progesterone increases LBR/OPR in women with gonadotropin stimulation (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.92; 4 RCTs; 1054 participants; low-certainty evidence) and oral stimulation (clomiphene citrate or letrozole) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64; 2 RCTs; 485 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported on OPR in women with gonadotropin plus oral stimulation; the evidence from this study was uncertain (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.42; 1 RCT; 253 participants; low-certainty evidence). Given the low certainty of the evidence, it is unclear if progesterone reduces miscarriage per clinical pregnancy in any stimulation protocol (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.91; 2 RCTs; 102 participants, with gonadotropin; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50; 2 RCTs; 123 participants, with gonadotropin plus oral stimulation; and RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.14; 2 RCTs; 119 participants, with oral stimulation). Low-certainty evidence suggests that progesterone in all types of ovarian stimulation may increase clinical pregnancy compared to placebo (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.74; 7 RCTs; 1437 participants, with gonadotropin; RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90; 4 RCTs; 733 participants, with gonadotropin plus oral stimulation (clomiphene citrate or letrozole); and RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.98; 6 RCTs; 1073 participants, with oral stimulation). 2. Progesterone supplementation regimen  We are uncertain if there is any difference between 300 mg and 600 mg of vaginal progesterone for OPR and multiple pregnancy (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.09; 1 RCT; 200 participants; very low-certainty evidence; and RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.43; 1 RCT; 200 participants, very low-certainty evidence, respectively). No other outcomes were reported for this comparison. There were three different comparisons between progesterone regimens. For OPR, the evidence is very uncertain for intramuscular (IM) versus vaginal progesterone (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.02; 1 RCT; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence); we are uncertain if there is any difference between oral and vaginal progesterone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.22; 1 RCT; 150 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or between subcutaneous and vaginal progesterone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.05; 1 RCT; 246 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if IM or oral progesterone reduces miscarriage per clinical pregnancy compared to vaginal progesterone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; 1 RCT; 81 participants and RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.09; 1 RCT; 41 participants, respectively). Clinical pregnancy and multiple pregnancy were reported for all comparisons; the evidence for these outcomes was very uncertain. Only one RCT reported adverse effects. We are uncertain if IM route increases the risk of adverse effects when compared with the vaginal route (RR 9.25, 95% CI 2.21 to 38.78; 1 RCT; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 3. GnRH agonist versus placebo or no treatment  No trials reported live birth. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of GnRH agonist in ongoing pregnancy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.74; 1 RCT; 291 participants, very low-certainty evidence), miscarriage per clinical pregnancy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.10; 2 RCTs; 79 participants, very low-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47; 2 RCTs; 340 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and multiple pregnancy (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70; 2 RCTs; 126 participants). 4. GnRH agonist versus vaginal progesterone  The evidence for the effect of GnRH agonist injection on clinical pregnancy is very uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.95; 1 RCT; 242 participants). 5. HCG injection versus no treatment  The evidence for the effect of hCG injection on clinical pregnancy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.13; 1 RCT; 130 participants) and multiple pregnancy rates (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.92; 1 RCT; 130 participants) is very uncertain. 6. Luteal support in natural cycle No study evaluated the effect of LPS in natural cycle. We could not perform sensitivity analyses, as there were no studies at low risk of selection bias and not at high risk in other domains.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if vaginal progesterone supplementation during luteal phase is associated with a higher live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate. Vaginal progesterone may increase clinical pregnancy rate; however, its effect on miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate is uncertain. We are uncertain if IM progesterone improves ongoing pregnancy rates or decreases miscarriage rate when compared to vaginal progesterone. Regarding the other reported comparisons, neither oral progesterone nor any other medication appears to be associated with an improvement in pregnancy outcomes (very low-certainty evidence).

### Changes in sexual desire and activity during pregnancy among women in shahroud, iran [^9648c314]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate women's perception of sexual activity during pregnancy in Shahroud, Iran.

Methods

Data were gathered during 4 semi-structured group interviews with 33 pregnant women attending 2 obstetric outpatient clinics of a teaching hospital in Shahroud. The interviewers taped the interviews, coded and categorized their content, and performed a qualitative content analysis.

Results

Most women reported a decrease in sexual desire and frequency of intercourse during pregnancy (69.7% and 81.8%, respectively). Sexual desire, however, increased for 18.2% of the women. Some felt that accepting intercourse prevented spousal infidelity, but 65.2% worried that it might cause injury to the fetus. Only 24.2% received information on the advisability of sexual activity during pregnancy from their physicians or midwives, and the other 75.8% sensed that they should discuss the topic with a professional but were not comfortable starting the conversation.

Conclusion

Along with excessive anxiety, insufficient information is the major reason why sexual intercourse is often considered dangerous, and sometimes avoided, during pregnancy in Iran. Healthcare professionals, especially midwives, should educate and counsel women, and reassure them that intercourse is safe in women with healthy pregnancies.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^91818e10]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—after natural or assisted conception, the risk of miscarriage in PCOS is reported to be as high as 30% to 50%, and it has been suggested that the miscarriage rate is threefold higher in women with PCOS than in normal women. However, prospective randomized trials suggest the miscarriage rate is in the range of 15% to 25% and comparable with other subfertile populations.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^c1f6217d]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Age at which couples in western countries start contemplating a pregnancy seems to be slowly increasing. This may be due to different and complex interactions between cultural and social factors, such as career choices and societal expectations, and may have important consequences for fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Older age among women is a well-known and strong risk factor for adverse reproductive outcomes, such as lower oocyte quality, contributing to impaired fertility and miscarriage risk. Older age among women is also linked to increased risks of pregnancy complications, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies. Furthermore, results of a small number of studies suggest that older age among men is associated with lower sperm quality, which may contribute to adverse reproductive outcomes, congenital anomalies, and perinatal mortality [,,–]. Although much is known about the effects of older age among women on infertility and miscarriage risks, less is known about the potential effects of younger age among women and about the combined effects of age among both women and men on these outcomes. Better knowledge about the age effects across the full reproductive age range among both women and men separately and combined in the general population on fertility and early pregnancy outcomes is urgently needed for optimization of reproductive counseling and effective and balanced preventive strategies for couples who start family planning.

We hypothesized that older reproductive age is related to a prolonged time to pregnancy and increased miscarriage risk. We assessed, in a population-based prospective cohort study from the preconception or early pregnancy periods onwards among women and their partners, the separate and combined associations of the age of women and men with fecundability, risk of infertility (defined as a time to pregnancy of > 12 months or fertility treatment), and risk of miscarriage.

### Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from air embolism during sexual intercourse: case report and review of the literature [^5943e444]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

We report the successful resuscitation of a 38-year-old woman in cardiac arrest following heterosexual intercourse 7 days after spontaneous abortion and an instrumental uterine evacuation. The collapse was thought to be due to venous air embolism (VAE). Her survival neurologically intact was attributed to appropriate first aid, pre-hospital and subsequent hospital intensive care. Neither a case of an out-of-hospital air embolism where the patient made a good recovery, nor a case of miscarriage followed by collapse from air embolism has been reported in the literature. Air embolism is a very infrequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a high mortality rate. Predominant causal reasons are severe penetrating neck or thoracic injuries and sexual activities in pregnancy, when air can pass into the damaged veins in the wall of the uterus and lead to total obstruction in the heart. Diagnostics and management techniques for venous air embolism are discussed. Air embolism should be included in the differential diagnosis for all young women in cardiac arrest, particularly when occurring during sexual activity. Instructions in risks of sexual intercourse during pregnancy and the puerperium should become part of pregnant women's education.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^e2c23828]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Caffeine and fertility—High caffeine intake has been associated with decreased fertility, with high levels defined as 500 mg (>5 cups of coffee per day or its equivalent) and linked to OR 1.45 (95% CI, 1.03–2.04); during pregnancy, consumption over 200 to 300 mg per day (2–3 cups per day) may increase the risk of miscarriage but does not affect congenital anomalies, whereas overall moderate intake (1–2 cups of coffee per day or its equivalent) before or during pregnancy has no apparent adverse effects on fertility or pregnancy outcomes, and caffeine consumption has no effect on semen parameters in men.

### Preconception lifestyle advice for people with infertility [^db9e97c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infertility is a prevalent problem that has significant consequences for individuals, families, and the community. Modifiable lifestyle factors may affect the chance of people with infertility having a baby. However, no guideline is available about what preconception advice should be offered. It is important to determine what preconception advice should be given to people with infertility and to evaluate whether this advice helps them make positive behavioural changes to improve their lifestyle and their chances of conceiving.

Objectives

To assess the safety and effectiveness of preconception lifestyle advice on fertility outcomes and lifestyle behavioural changes for people with infertility.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, trial registers, Google Scholar, and Epistemonikos in January 2021; we checked references and contacted field experts to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised cross-over studies, and cluster-randomised studies that compared at least one form of preconception lifestyle advice with routine care or attention control for people with infertility.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Primary effectiveness outcomes were live birth and ongoing pregnancy. Primary safety outcomes were adverse events and miscarriage. Secondary outcomes included reported behavioural changes in lifestyle, birth weight, gestational age, clinical pregnancy, time to pregnancy, quality of life, and male factor infertility outcomes. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included in the review seven RCTs involving 2130 participants. Only one RCT included male partners. Three studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care or attention control. Four studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on one topic (weight, alcohol intake, or smoking) with routine care for women with infertility and specific lifestyle characteristics. The evidence was of low to very low-quality. The main limitations of the included studies were serious risk of bias due to lack of blinding, serious imprecision, and poor reporting of outcome measures. Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics versus routine care or attention control Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no difference in the number of live births (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.10; 1 RCT, 626 participants), but the quality of evidence was low. No studies reported on adverse events or miscarriage. Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics affects lifestyle behavioural changes: body mass index (BMI) (mean difference (MD) -1.06 kg/m², 95% CI -2.33 to 0.21; 1 RCT, 180 participants), vegetable intake (MD 12.50 grams/d, 95% CI -8.43 to 33.43; 1 RCT, 264 participants), alcohol abstinence in men (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 210 participants), or smoking cessation in men (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 212 participants). Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no difference in the number of women with adequate folic acid supplement use (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.01; 2 RCTs, 850 participants; I² = 4%), alcohol abstinence (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17; 1 RCT, 607 participants), and smoking cessation (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 1 RCT, 606 participants), on low quality evidence. No studies reported on other behavioural changes. Preconception lifestyle advice on weight versus routine care Studies on preconception lifestyle advice on weight were identified only in women with infertility and obesity. Compared to routine care, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight affects the number of live births (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.43; 2 RCTs, 707 participants; I² = 68%; very low-quality evidence), adverse events including gestational diabetes (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 317 participants; very low-quality evidence), hypertension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.75; 1 RCT, 317 participants; very low-quality evidence), or miscarriage (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.37; 1 RCT, 577 participants; very low-quality evidence). Regarding lifestyle behavioural changes for women with infertility and obesity, preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly reduce BMI (MD -1.30 kg/m², 95% CI -1.58 to -1.02; 1 RCT, 574 participants; low-quality evidence). Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice affects the percentage of weight loss, vegetable and fruit intake, alcohol abstinence, or physical activity. No studies reported on other behavioural changes. Preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake versus routine care Studies on preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake were identified only in at-risk drinking women with infertility. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake affects the number of live births (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.50; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-quality evidence) or miscarriages (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 8.34; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-quality evidence). One study reported on behavioural changes for alcohol consumption but not as defined in the review methods. No studies reported on adverse events or other behavioural changes. Preconception lifestyle advice on smoking versus routine care Studies on preconception lifestyle advice on smoking were identified only in smoking women with infertility. No studies reported on live birth, ongoing pregnancy, adverse events, or miscarriage. One study reported on behavioural changes for smoking but not as defined in the review methods.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence suggests that preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no difference in the number of live births. Evidence was insufficient to allow conclusions on the effects of preconception lifestyle advice on adverse events and miscarriage and on safety, as no studies were found that looked at these outcomes, or the studies were of very low quality. This review does not provide clear guidance for clinical practice in this area. However, it does highlight the need for high-quality RCTs to investigate preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics and to assess relevant effectiveness and safety outcomes in men and women with infertility.

### Morbidity and mortality weekly report: recommendations (...) [^a577ad16]. stacks.cdc.gov (2006). Low credibility.

Details Alternative Title: Recommendations to Improve Preconception Health and Health Care -- United States: a Report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care Journal Article: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Recommendations and Reports. Personal Author: Corporate Authors: CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Division of Reproductive Health. ; National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Description: "This report provides recommendations to improve both preconception health and care. The goal of these recommendations is to improve the health of women and couples, before conception of a first or subsequent pregnancy.

Since the early 1990s, guidelines have recommended preconception care, and reviews of previous studies have assessed the evidence for interventions and documented the evidence for specific interventions. CDC has developed these recommendations based on a review of published research and the opinions of specialists from the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care. The 10 recommendations in this report are based on preconception health care for the U. S. population and are aimed at achieving four goals to 1) improve the knowledge and attitudes and behaviors of men and women related to preconception health; 2) assure that all women of childbearing age in the United. States receive preconception care services that will enable them to enter pregnancy in optimal health; 3) reduce risks indicated by a previous adverse pregnancy outcome through interventions during the interconception period, which can prevent or minimize health problems for a mother and her future children; and 4) reduce the disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes. The implementation of these recommendations will help achieve Healthy People 2010 objectives. The recommendations and action steps are a strategic plan that can be used by persons, communities, public health and clinical providers, and governments to improve the health of women, their children, and their families. Improving preconception health among the approximately 62 million women of childbearing age will require multistrategic, action-oriented initiatives"

### Lisdexamfetamine (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) [^7e123422]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Amphetamines, such as lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion. In addition, amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions increasing the risk of premature delivery. Infants born to amphetamine-dependent mothers have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight.

Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal such as feeding difficulties, irritability, agitation, and excessive drowsiness.

Data

Animal Data

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 40 and 120 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 5.5 and 33 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 70 mg/day given to adults, on a mg/m2body surface area basis.

A study was conducted with amphetamine (d- to l- enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams. A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses. A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg/kg which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks, such as preputial separation and vaginal opening. Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg/kg on day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks postweaning. When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation, gestational weight gain, number of implantations, and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg/kg.

A number of studies from the literature in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine (d- or d, l-) at doses similar to those used clinically can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function.

### Adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in sexual minority women from the national survey of family growth [^3bbde01d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined how multiple marginalized identities are associated with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, especially for Black and Hispanic sexual minority women. Sexual minorities are people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). The purpose of this study was to examine differences in adverse pregnancy (i.e., miscarriage) and birth outcomes (i.e., preterm birth, low birthweight, and stillbirth) in a national sample of women by race and ethnicity, and sexual minority status (LGBT identification and same-sex sexual behavior).

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The unit of analysis was pregnancy, not participants. In this study, we examined pregnancies to participants who identified as heterosexual, lesbian, and bisexual, by race and Hispanic ethnicity. We also studied sexual behaviors to categorize participants as women who have sex with women (WSW) and women who have sex with men (WSM). Outcomes included preterm birth, low birthweight, miscarriage, and stillbirth. We employed logistic and linear regression analyses for analyses using STATA.

Results

We studied 53,751 pregnancies, and 9% of these occurred in people who identified as heterosexual, but had engaged in sexual activity with a female partner (heterosexual-WSW), 7% in those identifying as bisexual, and 1% to women who identified as lesbian. Pregnancies ended in preterm birth (10.7%) and low birthweight (9.0%), stillbirths (2-4%), and miscarriages (17-21%) in sexual minority women. We observed that pregnancies reported by Hispanic lesbian women had a higher birthweight (β=10.71, SE=4.1, p-value=0.01) compared to infants born to Hispanic heterosexual-WSM. Pregnancies to lesbian women were significantly more likely to end in stillbirth (aRR=3.58, 95% CI 1.30,9.79) compared to heterosexual-WSM. No significant differences were noted in risk of adverse birth outcomes by sexual orientation for NH Black or Hispanic women.

Conclusion

In this sample, preterm births were less likely to occur among heterosexual-WSW than in heterosexual-WSM. Pregnancies to lesbians and bisexual women were more likely to end in miscarriage or stillbirth than heterosexual WSM. Lesbian Hispanic women reported higher birthweights compared to heterosexual-WSM Hispanic women. More research should be done to further understand these findings.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^14825b00]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The potential biological mechanisms underlying associations of age with fertility and early pregnancy outcomes seem to include various biological processes such as lower gamete quality and a decline in oocyte reserve and endometrium receptivity [–,,]. Among women, older age is associated with a reduced number of oocytes and a decline in their quality. This negatively impacts fertilization and embryo development and subsequently increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities leading to miscarriage. Older age among women also decreases endometrium receptivity as a consequence of declining endometrium thickness, alterations in endometrial epithelium, and microscopic tissue fibrosis. This affects implantation rate and fertility. Among older men, testicular function declines due to lower levels of testosterone and gonadotropins, leading to lower sperm volume, motility, and morphology, and subsequently lower fertility. Sperm cells of men with older age have more DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation most likely occurs due to a combination of an increase in reactive oxygen species, a decrease in antioxidant capacity, and decreased function of DNA repair mechanisms. In clinical populations, sperm cell DNA fragmentation is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.

We also observed that the younger age of both women and men was associated with increased risks of infertility. As discussed previously, human reproductive health seems to be declining in the past century. We speculate that our findings may reflect biological or environmental factors adversely affecting fertility at earlier ages, such as endocrine-disrupting exposures or lifestyle-related risks. A recent study has highlighted such mechanisms as potential contributors to declining human fertility across age groups. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted carefully and suggest that further research is needed. Other possible explanations for lower fertility in younger age groups could be poor fertility knowledge and unawareness regarding the importance of preconception health, engaging in lifestyle risk behavior, and less strategic family planning. This could possibly lead to less effective reproduction and thus a longer time to conceive among younger couples.

Our results suggest that age across the full reproductive age range among women and men in the general population is an important risk factor for decreased fertility and adverse (early) pregnancy outcomes. In western countries, age at childbearing is increasing, leading to infertility and increased miscarriage risk. This may have a great impact on individuals and couples, as well as on health care costs related to fertility and pregnancy care. Being aware of the effect of age among women and men on fertility outcomes and health risks for mother and child could motivate couples to start family planning at an optimal age. This could lead to effective and balanced preventive strategies focused on both women and men, taking into account different cultural, social, and economic factors.

### Long-term follow-up of 246 adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: social function, relationships and sexual activity [^1dd79401]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine social function, relationships and sexual activity in adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Patients and Methods

Two hundred and forty-six adults identified with long-standing JIA had an average disease duration of 28.3 yr. Specific information was sought on marital status, offspring, age at first sexual encounter, and problems related to disease in sexual activity and pregnancy.

Results

Fewer patients (42.8%) were in stable relationships than their siblings (55.3%). The percentage of patients with children was 27.5. Twenty-three per cent of all known pregnancies ended in miscarriage. Of the women who had had a Caesarean, 78.9% had either reduced hip mobility or short stature. JIA had a detrimental effect on body image in 50.7% of patients but relationships were affected in only 28.2%. The percentage of patients who were sexually active or had had previous sexual experience was 83.3; 58.3% of these had disease-related sexual problems.

Conclusions

A significant proportion of individuals are sexually active before transfer to adult rheumatology care at the age of 18 yr. This highlights the need to introduce sexual counselling in adolescent clinics. The high incidence of psychological sexual problems may benefit from appropriate counselling and training.

Binge drinking—sexual and reproductive health risks in adolescents—has been associated with earlier sexual activity and more frequent changes of sexual partners, with higher rates of unwanted and teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and infertility; adolescents are also at higher risk of becoming the victims of unwanted sexual activity, actual or attempted forced sexual activity, and sexual victimization when binge drinking.

### Miscarriage matters: the epidemiological, physical, psychological, and economic costs of early pregnancy loss [^5c41ade7]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Miscarriage is generally defined as the loss of a pregnancy before viability. An estimated 23 million miscarriages occur every year worldwide, translating to 44 pregnancy losses each minute. The pooled risk of miscarriage is 15·3% (95% CI 12·5-18·7%) of all recognised pregnancies. The population prevalence of women who have had one miscarriage is 10·8% (10·3-11·4%), two miscarriages is 1·9% (1·8-2·1%), and three or more miscarriages is 0·7% (0·5-0·8%). Risk factors for miscarriage include very young or older female age (younger than 20 years and older than 35 years), older male age (older than 40 years), very low or very high body-mass index, Black ethnicity, previous miscarriages, smoking, alcohol, stress, working night shifts, air pollution, and exposure to pesticides. The consequences of miscarriage are both physical, such as bleeding or infection, and psychological. Psychological consequences include increases in the risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Miscarriage, and especially recurrent miscarriage, is also a sentinel risk marker for obstetric complications, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and stillbirth in future pregnancies, and a predictor of longer-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism. The costs of miscarriage affect individuals, health-care systems, and society. The short-term national economic cost of miscarriage is estimated to be £471 million per year in the UK. As recurrent miscarriage is a sentinel marker for various obstetric risks in future pregnancies, women should receive care in preconception and obstetric clinics specialising in patients at high risk. As psychological morbidity is common after pregnancy loss, effective screening instruments and treatment options for mental health consequences of miscarriage need to be available. We recommend that miscarriage data are gathered and reported to facilitate comparison of rates among countries, to accelerate research, and to improve patient care and policy development.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^c6d88d59]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Miscarriage

Figure 4 shows that as compared to women aged 30.0–34.9 years at conception, those aged 35.0–39.9 years and ≥ 40.0 years had an increased risk of miscarriage (HR 1.91 (95% CI, 1.46–2.50) and HR, 3.60 (95% CI, 2.30–5.61), respectively). As compared to men aged 30.0–34.9 years at conception, those aged ≥ 40.0 years had an increased risk of miscarriage (HR, 1.92 (95% CI, 1.31–2.81)). Analyses on combined age categories in both partners showed that compared with both partners aged < 35 years at conception, both partners aged ≥ 35 years at conception increased the risk of miscarriage (HR, 2.18 (95% CI, 1.53–3.10)) (Additional file 1: Table S29). In line with these findings, Fig. 5 shows that as compared to women aged 30.0–34.9 years at conception, those aged 35.0–39.9 and ≥ 40.0 years had strongly increased odds of miscarriage (OR 2.03 (95% CI, 1.51–2.72) and 4.24 (95% CI, 2.45–7.36), respectively). As compared to men aged 30.0–34.9 years at conception, those aged ≥ 40.0 years had increased odds of miscarriage (OR, 2.09 (95% CI, 1.39–3.14)). Analyses on combined age categories in both partners showed that compared with both partners aged < 35 years at conception, both partners aged ≥ 35 years at conception had increased odds of miscarriage (OR, 2.33 (95% CI, 1.61–3.37)) (Additional file 1: Table S36). Sensitivity analyses excluding women who underwent assisted reproductive technology, restricting analyses to only participants’ first episode or only the preconception cohort, or adjusting for partners’ age did not materially change the effect estimates (Additional file 1: Tables S25–S28 and S32–S35).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: emergency contraception [^b2478407]. Contraception (2023). High credibility.

Emergency contraception in an unknowingly pregnant patient and intrauterine device (IUD) timing—clinical considerations—include that for patients who take LNG ECPs while unknowingly pregnant or who conceive as a result of LNG ECP failure, there is no concern for associated pregnancy-related toxicity; for patients choosing copper or LNG IUDs for emergency contraception who report unprotected intercourse more than five days before planned insertion, the potential presence of a preimplantation fertilized ovum should be considered, and studies demonstrate that pregnancy is uncommon in such situations following IUD placement; if pregnancy occurs with an IUD in situ, risks of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and septic abortion are elevated, and removal decreases risks though they remain above baseline without an IUD.

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^de0ea448]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is defined as spontaneous loss of pregnancy prior to 20 weeks gestation. With an estimated risk of 15% of clinically confirmed pregnancies ending in miscarriage, it is the most common adverse event in pregnancy. Woman's age is the primary risk factor for miscarriage, while medical conditions, including hormonal abnormalities, are also associated. Progesterone is essential for maintaining pregnancy. A short luteal phase may reflect inadequate levels of progesterone production, but it is unclear whether a short luteal phase correlates with an increase in the risk of miscarriage.

Methods

Using a cohort study design, we conducted a secondary data analysis from four cohorts of couples who used a standardized protocol to track biomarkers of the female cycles. A short luteal phase was defined as less than 10 days, with<11,<9, and<8 days as alternate definitions in sensitivity analyses. We included women who experienced a pregnancy with a known outcome, identified the length of the luteal phase in up to 3 cycles prior to conception and assessed the relationship with miscarriage using a modified Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for demographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol use and previous pregnancy history.

Results

In our sample of 252 women; the overall miscarriage rate was 18.7%. The adjusted incident risk ratio of miscarriage in women who had at least one short luteal phase<10 days, compared to those who had none, was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.80) Similar null risk was found when assessing alternative lengths of short luteal phase. Women who had short luteal phases<10 days in all 3 cycles prior to the conception cycle had an incident risk ratio of 2.14 (95% CI: 0.7, 6.55).

Conclusions

Our study found that a short luteal phase in the three cycles prior to conception was not associated with higher rates of miscarriage in an international cohort of women tracking their cycles, but our sample size was limited. Further research to determine if short luteal phases or luteal phase deficiency is associated with early pregnancy losses among preconception cohorts with daily tracking of cycle parameters, in addition to progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels, is warranted. Additionally, future studies should include women with recurrent short luteal phases as a more likely risk factor than isolated short luteal phases.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG practice bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^23a81b17]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Female sexual interest and arousal disorder—definition and associated factors—is presented as a “new classification that replaces the DSM-IV terms hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual arousal disorder,” and “in this document, hypoactive sexual desire disorder is used only when referring to studies that used this specific terminology to describe a condition or outcome measured using DSM-IV-TR criteria.” Fluctuation in sexual interest and arousal can occur across the female life course in relation to modifiable individual or partner factors including changes in sleep patterns or chronic poor-quality sleep, stress, changes in body image, shape, or weight, pregnancy, breastfeeding, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol or other substance abuse, and relationship factors. Symptom descriptions include women who “say they lack sex drive or libido,” who think about sex “but their thoughts are about avoidance of sexual activity or about initiation or engagement in sexual activity to preserve the relationship or for their partner’s benefit,” and others who report “a distressing loss of interest but an ability to become aroused in response to a partner’s initiation of sexual activity.” Although such problems can occur without diagnosed comorbidities, “new onset could be an indicator of undiagnosed or subclinical conditions, even among younger women,” and “medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly associated with arousal impairment.”

### Fecundability in reproductive aged women at risk of sexual dysfunction and associated risk factors: a prospective preconception cohort study [^572929e6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects many women in the reproductive age group, with an estimated prevalence of 41% worldwide, making it a significant public health problem. According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), FSD is a heterogeneous combination of disorders that entails sexual interest/ arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and genito-pelvic pain/ penetration disorder. FSD is multifactorial in etiology, with biological, physical, behavioral and psychosocial issues contributing to the spectrum of FSD. Specifically, factors such as women’s age at marriage, physical health, emotion, exercise, body image, sex education and partner’s sexual health have been consistently associated with female sexual function (FSF) in various populations. Most importantly, impairment in sexual function has been shown to adversely affect a woman’s quality of life and wellbeing, with implications for fertility and reproductive health.

Sex is a natural and spontaneous expression of intimacy. However, when sex becomes an instrument for conception rather than pleasure, it may create unnecessary pressure and lead to frustration, potentially impeding sexual satisfaction and resulting in a downward spiral. Indeed, situational sexual dysfunction and loss of a couple’s intimacy can happen as a result of timed intercourse around the time of ovulation, or the “fertile period”, where couples only think about conception during intercourse. This is commonly reported by infertile couples who experience infertility-related stress after attempting to conceive for a long period of time, resulting in the need for fertility treatment. There is also evidence showing that attempts to conceive are positively associated with FSF in subfertile women, where the desire for pregnancy could prevail over emotional stress. Taken together, these contradictory findings of the impact of subfertility on FSF may reflect varying responses (i.e. stress vs. desire) of the women while attempting to conceive.

### Progestogens for preventing miscarriage: a network meta-analysis [^e29b62b3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. Progesterone has an important role in maintaining a pregnancy, and supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage), and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage).

Objectives

To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side-effect profile.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi- and non-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, to determine the relative effects of all available treatments, but due to the limited number of included studies only direct or indirect comparisons were possible. We estimated the relative effects for the primary outcome of live birth and the secondary outcomes including miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, and adverse drug events. Relative effects for all outcomes are reported separately by the type of miscarriage (threatened and recurrent miscarriage). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Our meta-analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta-analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. Women with threatened miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta-analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high-certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate-certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. The pre-specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high-certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high-certainty evidence). Women with recurrent miscarriage Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high-certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low-certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. Additional outcomes All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre-specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate-certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate-certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low-certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low-certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens.

Authors' Conclusions

The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

### Counseling in pediatric populations at risk for infertility and / or sexual function concerns [^03e689f1]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Assessing risk—pre-encounter preparation and key questions are outlined: in preparation for the clinical encounter, the first step is to become educated about fertility and sexual function concerns on the basis of a given patient’s condition and/or treatment history. Initial questions to consider may include the following: (1) Is there a medical or surgical intervention taking place that may affect the patient’s future fertility and/or sexual function? (2) Is there an opportunity now to protect or preserve fertility and/or sexual function? (3) What type of information can be shared about future fertility and/or sexual function implications? Obtaining information about these topics may be challenging at times because there is little empirical evidence on reproductive and sexual health outcomes in many conditions, and there may not be an easily accessible source, and ultimately, providers may need to work with parents to determine optimal approaches to care and communication, even in the absence of known information. Beyond fertility and sexual function, there may be concerns about pregnancy because of implications for the mother or teratogenicity of certain medications, and in such cases, involving a maternal-fetal medicine specialist may be of benefit.

### Progestogen for treating threatened miscarriage [^6fa65efd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is a common complication encountered during pregnancy. The role of progesterone in preparing the uterus for the implantation of the embryo and its role in maintaining the pregnancy have been known for a long time. Inadequate secretion of progesterone in early pregnancy has been linked to the aetiology of miscarriage and progesterone supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and the safety of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2009) and bibliographies of all located articles for any unidentified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that compare progestogen with placebo, no treatment or any other treatment given in an effort to treat threatened miscarriage.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review and extracted the data.

Main Results

Two studies (84 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. In one study, all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the other study, only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria was included in the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of effectiveness with the use vaginal progesterone compared to placebo in reducing the risk of miscarriage (risk ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 1.30).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on scarce data from two methodologically poor trials, there is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogens for the treatment of threatened miscarriage. Information about potential harms to the mother or child, or both, with the use of progestogens is lacking. Further, larger, randomized controlled trials on the effect of progestogens on the treatment of threatened miscarriage, which investigate potential harms as well as benefits, are needed.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^6851296c]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based prospective cohort study from the preconception period until birth, we observed that the age at pursuing pregnancy of women outside the range of 30–40 years and of men below 25 years was associated with lower fecundability and infertility. Furthermore, we observed that the age at conception of women aged ≥ 35 years and of men aged ≥ 40 years was associated with an increased miscarriage risk. The range of 30.0–34.9 years for age at pursuing pregnancy and conception for women, 25.0–39.9 years for men, and < 35 years for both partners was associated with the lowest risk of experiencing adverse reproductive outcomes.

Older age at conception in women is a well-known and strong risk factor for infertility, miscarriage, pregnancy complications, and adverse birth outcomes [,–]. The associations of age with reduced fertility and risk of miscarriage might be present across the full reproductive age range and in both women and men [,,–]. However, while much is known about the adverse effects of advanced maternal age, there is limited evidence discussing the potential impact of younger age among women and the separate and combined effects of age among both women and men on fertility outcomes in the general population. Better knowledge about the age effects on fertility and early pregnancy outcomes could lead to better effective and balanced preventive strategies and counseling for couples.

### Reproductive factors and subsequent pregnancy outcomes in patients with prior pregnancy loss [^b1008425]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy loss (PL) is defined as the spontaneous demise of a pregnancy before the fetus reaches viability, which is a significant negative life event and impacts 10–15% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) refers to two or more consecutive PL episodes with the same sexual partner, accounting for approximately 1–2%. There are many reasons for the occurrence of RPL, including genetic abnormalities (fetal genetic abnormalities and parental genetic abnormalities), reproductive tract anatomical abnormalities, immune diseases, endocrine diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic disorders, and infections, but about 40-50% of the etiologies remain unexplained, Molecular mechanisms have not been fully explored, and these are defined as unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (URPL). In addition, PL was defined as primary if there without a previous ongoing pregnancy (viable pregnancy) beyond 24 weeks gestation, otherwise it was defined as secondary. PL is a serious adverse event in life that greatly affects the physical and mental health of women. Women who experience PL have increased rates of anxiety and depression and other psychological disorders. It is reported that in RPL, the incidence of anxiety and depression in women can be as high as 47.7% and 51.7%, respectively. At the same time, anxiety, and depression symptoms in women in early pregnancy are also risk factors for RPL.

### Preconception and early-pregnancy body mass index in women and men, time to pregnancy, and risk of miscarriage [^9cc21050]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The mechanisms underlying associations of BMI with fertility and early-pregnancy outcomes are not fully known but might include hormonal dysfunction, decreased quality of oocytes and the uterine environment, and decreased sperm quality. Elevated cytokine levels associated with the inflammatory state of adiposity may lead to dysregulated sex hormone secretion and metabolism, which might be adversely associated with oocyte quality and embryo implantation. A prospective cohort study among 211 subfertile men in the Netherlands reported an association of higher preconception BMI with reduced fertilization rates.Furthermore, enlarged adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ secreting its own bioactive signaling products, such as leptin and chemerin.These products contribute to insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia, resulting in excessive androgen secretion and impaired reproductive hormone production. An excess or lack of adipose tissue, present in overweight and underweight individuals, may cause hormonal disturbances by altering the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to menstrual irregularities and anovulation. These mechanisms may ultimately lead to decreased fertility.

Our results suggest that preconception BMI across the full range in women and men in the general population is an important risk factor for decreased fertility and adverse (early) pregnancy outcomes. Up to 10% of women of reproductive age have underweight, and up to 40% have overweight and obesity. Previous studies suggest that lifestyle interventions in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology could increase pregnancy rates, live births, and natural conceptions and could decrease time to pregnancy, suggesting that weight management before pregnancy is positively associated with fertility. Optimizing BMI in women and men in preconception care settings may be an important population health strategy to improve fertility, reduce health care costs, and prevent miscarriage.

### Progestogen for treating threatened miscarriage [^be89a802]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is a common complication encountered during pregnancy. It is defined as spontaneous pregnancy loss before 20 weeks' gestation. Progesterone's physiological role is to prepare the uterus for the implantation of the embryo, enhance uterine quiescence and suppress uterine contractions, hence, it may play a role in preventing rejection of the embryo. Inadequate secretion of progesterone in early pregnancy has been linked to the aetiology of miscarriage and progesterone supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss. This update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007, and previously updated in 2011, investigates the evidence base for this practice.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and the safety of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (8 August 2017) and reference lists of retrieved trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, quasi-randomised or cluster-randomised controlled trials, that compared progestogen with placebo, no treatment or any other treatment for the treatment of threatened miscarriage in women carrying singleton pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, assessed trial quality and extracted the data and graded the body of evidence.

Main Results

We included seven trials (involving 696 participants) in this update of the review. The included trials were conducted in different countries, covering the full spectrum of the World Bank's economic classification, which enhances the applicability of evidence drawn from this review. Two trials were conducted in Germany and Italy which are high-income countries, while four trials were conducted in upper-middle income countries; two in Iran, one in Malaysia and the fourth in Turkey, and the seventh trial was conducted in Jordan, which is a lower-middle income country. In six trials all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the seventh study, we included in the meta-analysis only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria. We assessed the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE tool and the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Downgrading of evidence was based on the high risk of bias in six of the seven included trials and a small number of events and wide confidence intervals for some outcomes.Treatment of miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment probably reduces the risk of miscarriage; (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.87; 7 trials; 696 women; moderate-quality evidence). Treatment with oral progestogen compared to no treatment also probably reduces the miscarriage rate (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.85; 3 trials; 408 women; moderate-quality evidence). However treatment with vaginal progesterone compared to placebo, probably has little or no effect in reducing the miscarriage rate (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.21; 4 trials; 288 women; moderate-quality evidence). The subgroup interaction test indicated no difference according to route of administration between the oral and vaginal subgroups of progesterone.Treatment of preterm birth with the use of progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment may have little or no effect in reducing the rate of preterm birth (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.44; 5 trials; 588 women; low-quality evidence).We are uncertain if treatment of threatened miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment has any effect on the rate of congenital abnormalities because the quality of the evidence is very low (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.82; 2 trials; 337 infants; very-low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this Cochrane Review suggest that progestogens are probably effective in the treatment of threatened miscarriage but may have little or no effect in the rate of preterm birth. The evidence on congenital abnormalities is uncertain, because the quality of the evidence for this outcome was based on only two small trials with very few events and was found to be of very low quality.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^aba9bfbb]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Older age of women is strongly associated with reduced fertility and early pregnancy complications. These associations might also be present across the full range of reproductive age of both women and men. We assessed the associations of age of women and men with time to pregnancy and miscarriage risk.

Methods

This population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A total of 3604 women and their partners were included from the preconception period onwards with follow-up until birth. For this study, participants were followed until conception or 22 weeks of pregnancy for the time to pregnancy and miscarriage analyses, respectively. Outcomes included fecundability, defined as the per-month probability of conceiving; infertility, defined as a time to pregnancy or duration of pursuing pregnancy of more than 12 months or use of assisted reproductive technology; and miscarriage, defined as pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestation.

Results

In total, 18.1% of the population was infertile and 12.7% of all recognized pregnancies led to a miscarriage. As compared to women aged 30.0–34.9 years, those aged < 25.0, 25.0–29.9, and ≥ 40.0 years had increased odds of infertility (odds ratio (OR) 2.14 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.60–2.87); OR 1.27 (95% CI, 1.05–1.53); and OR 2.00 (95% CI, 1.05–3.80), respectively). Women aged 35.0–39.9 years had no increased odds of infertility. Similar results were observed for fecundability. As compared to women aged 30.0–34.9 years at conception, those aged 35.0–39.9 and ≥ 40.0 years had strongly increased odds of miscarriage (OR 2.03 (95% CI, 1.51–2.72) and 4.24 (95% CI, 2.45–7.36), respectively). As compared to men aged 30.0–34.9 years, those aged < 25.0 years had lower fecundability (fecundability ratio (FR) 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58–0.87)). As compared to men aged 30.0–34.9 years, those aged ≥ 40.0 years had the highest odds of miscarriage (OR, 2.09 (95% CI, 1.39–3.14)).

Conclusions

Age among both women and their partners is a strong risk factor for adverse fertility and early pregnancy outcomes. Strategies optimizing age at which couples start family planning, focusing on both women and men, will have a great individual and public health impact.

### Perceived causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes and remedies adopted by kalenjin women in rural Kenya [^6b059dcd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Use of herbal medicine

Preventive herbs are believed to protect pregnant woman from getting sick and from transmitting sickness to the foetus. Naturally, pregnancy is a state of immunological weakness, and therefore of increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. Improving the immune system is one of the most important ways of protecting the mother against the environmental infections and preventing damage to the foetus. Malaria In Pregnancy (MIP) is a major public health problem in areas of sub-Saharan Africa, including parts of Kenya, where malaria is endemic, and has important consequences for the birth outcome. Similarly, the risk of pre-term delivery and of miscarriage was found to be high in mothers with HIV and with MIP occurring within 2 weeks of delivery. Use of minerals, plants, and animal products as medicines during pregnancy is a common practice in Kenya, especially among the Kalenjin, to treat pregnancy-related complications and symptoms. Some herbal plants have been confirmed to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antimalarial properties. However, the safety and efficacy of many of these medicinal herbs, especially during pregnancy, when the human body is vulnerable, still needs to be established.

Avoid sexual intercourse during pregnancy

Ante-natal sexual taboos, which prohibit couples from having sexual intercourse from the second trimester of pregnancy, were also established in the study. In African societies, abstinence from sexual intercourse during pregnancy and for some period after childbirth is a common phenomenon, and is believed to be associated with contamination that might be harmful to the unborn baby or the husband and that the mother is considered to be too fragile to have sex. These women may not justify sexual abstinence during pregnancy in biomedical terms, but scientifically the latent function of this custom is to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to a pregnant woman. STIs, including HIV/AIDS, among pregnant women are common in Kenya and have been associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, pre-term delivery, low birthweight, stillbirth, postpartum sepsis, and congenital infection, thus justifying the custom. However, encouraging sexual abstinence during pregnancy might result in men seeking extra-marital sex and might thereby increase the spread of STIs. Some pregnant women in this study opt to use condoms during sexual intercourse to overcome the complications, a practice that needs to be encouraged.

### Dopamine agonists for preventing future miscarriage in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and recurrent miscarriage history [^f90ec1c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperprolactinemia is the presence of abnormally high circulating levels of prolactin. Idopathic hyperprolactinemia is the term used when no cause of prolactin hypersecretion can be identified and it is causally related to the development of miscarriage in pregnant women, especially women who have a history of recurrent miscarriage. A possible mechanism is that high levels of prolactin affect the function of the ovaries, resulting in a luteal phase defect and miscarriage. A dopamine agonist is a compound with high efficacy in lowering prolactin levels and restoring gonadal function.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different types of dopamine agonists in preventing future miscarriage given to women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and a history of recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in all languages examining the effect of dopamine agonists on preventing future miscarriage. Women who had idiopathic hyperprolactinemia with a history of recurrent miscarriages were eligible for inclusion in this review. Comparisons planned included: dopamine agonists alone versus placebo/no treatment; and dopamine agonists combined with other therapy versus other therapy alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed a single trial for inclusion, evaluated trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

One study (recruiting 48 women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia) met our inclusion criteria; 46 women (42 pregnancies - 4/46 women did not conceive during the study period) were included in the analysis. The study compared the use of a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine, 2.5 mg to 5.0 mg/day until the end of the ninth week of gestation) versus a no-treatment control. The study was judged as being at a high risk of bias. It was not possible to carry out meta-analysis due to insufficient data.The study reported both of this review's primary outcomes of miscarriage and live birth. Results from this single study suggest that, compared to no treatment, oral bromocriptine was effective in preventing future miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.87, 46 participants (low-quality evidence)) in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. There was no clear difference with regard to the other primary outcome of live births (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.42, 46 participants (very low-quality evidence)).There was no difference with regard to this review's secondary outcome of conception (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09, 46 participants (very low-quality evidence)) between the group of women who received dopamine (21 out of 24 women conceived) and women in the no-treatment group (21 out of 22 women conceived). The included study only reported the serum prolactin levels in pregnant women and therefore the data could not be analyzed in this review. No other secondary outcomes relevant to this review were reported; adverse effects for women (nausea, vomiting, headache, vertigo, fatigue, hypotension, arrhythmia, and psychotic symptoms) and infants (birth defects, low birthweight, and developmental disabilities) were not reported.We downgraded the quality of the evidence for risk of bias in the one trial contributing outcome data (no description of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and possible reporting bias) and for imprecision (all effect estimates were based on small sample size, miscarriage was based on few events, and the 95% CIs of live birth and conception cross the line of no effect).

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient evidence (from a single randomized trial with a small sample size, and judged to be at high risk of bias) to evaluate the effectiveness of dopamine agonists for preventing future miscarriage in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and a history of recurrent miscarriage. We assessed outcomes using GRADE methodology. Miscarriage was assessed as low quality due to risk of bias concerns in the one trial contributing data (no description of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and possible reporting bias) and to imprecision (effect estimates were based on small sample size and few events). Live births and conception were assessed as of very low quality due to the same risk of bias concerns in study design and to imprecision (with a wide 95% CI consistent with either benefit or harm), and a small sample size. There were no data relating to adverse effects of the intervention for either the mother or her baby.Futher high-quality research in this area is warranted. There is a need for well-designed, larger RCTs to confirm and extend the findings of the trial reviewed here. Many questions remain unanswered. Some important considerations for future research include, the need for well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes, and for those studies to consider important outcomes (including adverse effects for both the mother and her baby). Future studies should examine the effectiveness and safety of various dopamine agonists including bromocriptine, cabergoline and quinagolide.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^e4c6e0a0]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility—fertility, aging, and timing of evaluation: Fertility is defined as the capacity to produce a child and declines with age in both women and men, but the effects of age are much more pronounced in women; fertility is decreased by about half at age 40 compared with women in their late 20s and early 30s, and there is an age-related decline in the chances of pregnancy and live birth with increased risk of aneuploidy and miscarriage with maternal aging. In Hutterites, pregnancies occurred rarely during the 40s, with the average age at last pregnancy just before turning 41 years old. Markers of ovarian reserve decline with increasing age but are poor predictors of fecundity in noninfertile women. Although semen parameters decline detectably after 35 years of age, male fertility does not appear to be appreciably affected before the age of approximately 50. Infertility is a disease defined as the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected vaginal intercourse, and earlier evaluation and treatment is warranted after 6 months without conception for women aged 35 years and older due to the age-related decline in fertility.

Results

Characteristics of the study participants

Women included in this study report (n = 1477) all gave birth between August 2012 and end of July 2014. Of these 1477 women who were recruited in early pregnancy, 1408 were eligible for follow-up. For those 69 women not available for follow-up, reasons included, gave birth elsewhere, withdrew at Survey 1, experienced a late miscarriage or stillbirth, and no consent provided. Subsequent 2, 3, 4 and 5 survey return rates were 1180 (84%) 1094 (80%), 1027 (77%) and 971 (74%), respectively. To determine, accurately, any changes over time only data from women who returned all five surveys (n = 866, 59%) and consented to having their hospital records accessed (n = 832, 56%) were included in these analyses (Fig. 1).

### Increased risk of miscarriage among women experiencing physical or sexual intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Guatemala city, Guatemala: cross-sectional study [^1cc2b526]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Violence against women by their male intimate partners (IPV) during pregnancy may lead to negative pregnancy outcomes. We examined the role of IPV as a potential risk factor for miscarriage in Guatemala. Our objectives were: (1) To describe the magnitude and pattern of verbal, physical and sexual violence by male intimate partners in the last 12 months (IPV) in a sample of pregnant Guatemalans; (2) To evaluate the influence of physical or sexual IPV on miscarriage as a pregnancy outcome.

Methods

All pregnant women reporting to the maternity of a major tertiary care public hospital in Guatemala City from June 1st to September 30th, 2006 were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. The admitting physician assessed occurrence of miscarriage, defined as involuntary pregnancy loss up to and including 28 weeks gestation. Data on IPV, social and demographic characteristics, risk behaviours, and medical history were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Laboratory testing was performed for HIV and syphilis. The relationship between IPV and miscarriage was assessed through multivariable logistic regression.

Results

IPV affected 18% of the 1897 pregnant Guatemalan women aged 15-47 in this sample. Verbal IPV was most common (16%), followed by physical (10%) and sexual (3%) victimisation. Different forms of IPV were often co-prevalent. Miscarriage was experienced by 10% of the sample (n = 190). After adjustment for potentially confounding factors, physical or sexual victimisation by a male intimate partner in the last 12 months was significantly associated with miscarriage (ORadj 1.1 to 2.8). Results were robust under a range of analytic assumptions.

Conclusions

Physical and sexual IPV is associated with miscarriage in this Guatemalan facility-based sample. Results cohere well with findings from population-based surveys. IPV should be recognised as a potential cause of miscarriage. Reproductive health services should be used to screen for spousal violence and link to assistance.

### Associations between health behaviours, fertility and reproductive outcomes: triangulation of evidence in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^ad52b5c0]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fertility outcome data

All fertility outcomes (time to conception, use of infertility treatment and miscarriage) were self-reported in the 15-week questionnaire by the females.

Time to conception

This is based upon the female self-report from the 15-week questionnaire referring to the index pregnancy. If females reported planning their pregnancy, they were asked: “For how many months did you have regular intercourse without contraception before you became pregnant?”. Options were less than 1 month, 1–2 months or 3 + months. If it took more than 3 months, then they were asked to state the number of months. We combined anyone taking 12 or more months to conceive into one group to reduce skewness and treated as a continuous variable. We have used this female-reported variable as an outcome in both females and males under the assumption that couples were conceiving together. In our primary analysis, if the couple were not trying to conceive, then they were set to missing. However, given differences between couples who planned pregnancy and those who did not, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis where non-planners were included and assigned the median time to conception from the planning group (2 months) (Additional file 1 : Note S1). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis using dichotomised variables as time to conception was not measured continuously (Additional file 1 : Note S2).

Infertility treatment

Females self-reported in the 15-week questionnaire: “Have you ever been treated for infertility?”. Responses were binary yes or no. We did not use this variable as an outcome in the males, as this question did not specify whether the infertility treatment was for the index pregnancy.

Miscarriage

Females self-reported (in the 15-week questionnaire) ever having had a miscarriage, defined as any of their previous pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortion at or before the 20th week of pregnancy.

### Trilaciclib (Cosela) [^d92c76d3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on the mechanism of action, COSELA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . There are no available human or animal data on COSELA use to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. However, the background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies in the United States general population.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of trilaciclib in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise lactating women to not breastfeed while taking COSELA and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

Based on its mechanism of action, COSELA can cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating COSELA.

Contraception

COSELA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with COSELA and for at least 3 weeks after the final dose.

Infertility

No studies have been performed in humans to evaluate the effects of COSELA on fertility in either sex.

Based on animal toxicology studies, COSELA may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pooled efficacy dataset from Studies 1, 2, and 3, 46% of 123 patients randomized to COSELA were ≥65 years of age, and 49% of 119 patients randomized to placebo were ≥65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of COSELA were observed between these patients and younger patients.

### Reducing repeat pregnancies in adolescence: applying realist principles as part of a mixed-methods systematic review to explore what works, for whom, how and under what circumstances [^92b3689d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

CMO 1: Taking control of the issue of adolescent pregnancy

There is a broader context surrounding adolescents that needs cognisance. Adolescents will have their own experiences for example: past pregnancies, perhaps a history of loss or miscarriage and even incidences of partner violence. Past and current relationships can increase the chances of an adolescent having a rapid repeat pregnancy. Partners may influence childbearing, particularly if they are married, co-habiting or in an on-going relationship with the adolescent. Knowledge about sexual health and services, including contraceptive preferences and choice of contraceptive methods can also play a part in the likelihood of an adolescent experiencing a rapid repeat pregnancy. The adolescent will also have their own thoughts and feelings about motherhood, and their peers, family and community could influence this [,–]. Adolescents may be exposed to friends and family that place a high emphasis on motherhood and parenting. This emphasis may align with the adolescent’s own thoughts and feelings or it may not.

Under this context, external influences, including knowledge and engagement with pregnancy assimilates into the adolescent’s own thinking. Depending upon whether they feel at a risk of pregnancy and whether becoming pregnant at this stage is their lives would be a positive or negative consequence, can trigger the mechanism of taking control. This could be taking control of their own fertility by using hormonal contraceptives, sexual encounters by choosing to engage in them or not, and whether to insist on the use of prophylactics such as condoms. Mbambo drew on the Health Belief Model  to provide a construct of how an adolescent may internalise their susceptibility of getting pregnant again, the perceived severity of getting pregnant (e.g. breakdown in family relationships), and perceived benefits of not getting pregnant again (e.g. completing schooling). These susceptibilities, severities and benefits are appraised against variables affecting the initiation of actions (perceived barriers). For example, problems accessing contraceptives, limited knowledge and lack of supportive individuals to discuss sex and relationships. This in turn may lead the adolescent to either access or ignore services, taking or avoiding precautions.

If the adolescent views pregnancy as a likely negative outcome, with severe consequences and little benefit, they will take control of perceived barriers overcoming them to protect themselves against pregnancy. Conversely, an adolescent that views pregnancy as a likely positive outcome, with minor consequences and large benefit, will take control of sexual encounters, and perhaps avoid precautions.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^94664082]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Older age at conception is a well-known risk factor for early pregnancy complications, including miscarriage. We observed that age at conception of ≥ 35 years in women was associated with a higher probability of miscarriage per week and higher odds of miscarriage. An observational follow-up study among 88373 pregnancies in Denmark observed a higher miscarriage risk in women aged ≥ 30 years. However, this was not a prospective preconception cohort study but a follow-up study of a pregnancy cohort. In line with our study, a population-based cohort among 525604 pregnant women in Sweden and a multisite retrospective cohort study among 3174 pregnancies of European women found that women aged ≥ 35 years had an increased risk of miscarriage. Among men, we observed that men aged ≥ 40 years had increased odds of miscarriage. A meta-analysis and a systematic review found that age of ≥ 40 years in men was associated with miscarriage. A population-based cohort among 525604 pregnant women in Sweden and a prospective cohort among 5121 women in the USA observed an association of age of ≥ 35 years at conception in men with miscarriage. When we combined the age of women and men in one model, we observed that an age of ≥ 35 years at conception in women and men increased the probability of miscarriage per week and the overall risk of miscarriage. This finding is in line with results from a retrospective multisite population-based cohort study among 3174 pregnancies of European women. The occurrence of miscarriage is dependent on different factors, including lifestyle behavior and socio-demographic factors. However, in our analysis, the observed associations did not change when correcting for these factors. Furthermore, ectopic pregnancies and terminations were seen as “no miscarriage” due to the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved. When we excluded the n = 30 ectopic pregnancies, we did observe similar effect estimates for the miscarriage analyses. Altogether, results from our and previous studies strongly suggest that older age among women and men is associated with increased risks of miscarriage.

### Sexual activities and experiences in women who underwent genital cosmetic surgery: a cross-sectional study using data from the German health and sexuality survey (GeSiD) [^c1bd786d]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare women who have undergone genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS) with women who have not regarding past sexual activities and experiences. It draws on data from the German Health and Sexuality Survey (GeSiD). The subsample of women who had undergone FGCS (n = 32) was compared to a subsample of women who had not had FGCS (n = 96); the samples were matched for age, education, relationship and marital status, and whether participants had born a child. Variables concerning the present relationship, recent/lifetime sexual activities, sexual orientation, pregnancy-related experiences, health, sexual boundary violations/violence, sexual difficulties, and migration background served as main outcome measures. Women who had undergone FGCS reported more often anal intercourse during their last sexual encounter (13% vs. 1%, p = 0.021), a pregnancy ending in miscarriage (34% vs. 16%, p = 0.016), and not to be satisfied with their own appearance (41% vs. 15%, p = 0.002) than women who had not undergone FGCS. The results indicate women’s motivations for FGCS beyond the desire to improve genital appearance or function, and that contributing factors might be clinically relevant regarding more general psychological wellbeing.

### Prevention of noncommunicable diseases by interventions in the preconception period: a FIGO position paper for action by healthcare practitioners [^4625ce51]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Definitions of the preconception period vary from “3 months before conception” 1 to “a minimum of 1–2 years before the initiation of any unprotected sexual intercourse that could possibly result in a pregnancy”. 2 More recently, the Lancet series on preconception health called for a new definition that considers multiple perspectives: biological (days to weeks before embryo development); individual (weeks to months before pregnancy); and public health (months to years). 1

Preconception care is defined as “a set of interventions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcome through prevention and management, emphasizing those factors that must be acted on before conception or early in pregnancy to have maximal impact”. 3 This includes care provided regardless of pregnancy status or intention. 4 A limitation in delivering preconception care has been the focus on women and couples motivated to conceive. For example, early marriage and early age at childbirth are common in low‐ and middle‐ income countries (LMICs) such as India. 5 In addition, even in high‐income countries, a significant proportion of pregnancies are unplanned: 45% of pregnancies in the UK. 6 Healthcare professionals often meet women with different perspectives on pregnancy 7 : “potential” (sexually active individuals without effective contraception or contraceptive failure); “intentional” (men and women making a conscious decision to conceive); and “public health” (a wider range of individuals and couples not sexually active). With the growing realization that efforts to optimize health of women and children should begin before conception, healthcare practitioners must be aware of these perspectives.

Two recent RCTs presented pregnancy rates and time-to-pregnancy based on positive pregnancy tests from the first two menstrual cycles.Self-reported pregnancy rates early in pregnancy unconfirmed by ultrasound have somewhat limited clinical relevance, given the risk for early miscarriage, but these results still support the potential for OPKs to improve timed intercourse for achieving pregnancy. Short follow-up across studies (2–6 cycles) limited assessment of differences between the intervention and control groups, especially since pregnancy is a relatively rare event (particularly in couples defined as infertile—12 months of attempting—or when infertility may be due to a functional disability). This follow-up length also precluded assessment of clinically important outcomes such as live birth, but maintenance of a pregnancy resulting in a live birth can be due to many factors unrelated to an ability to become pregnant. In addition, couples' expectations and perceived stress could be mitigated if they realised it commonly takes more than 2–6 cycles to become pregnant; some studies claim an 85% chance of becoming pregnant within 12 cycles.

All studies used urinary fertility monitoring, and most used the same commercially available OPK (Clearblue). No studies were found on the effectiveness of other modes or types of OPK. Participant populations varied by study, which may affect pooled results: two studies focused on couples undergoing fertility treatment or investigation,while the others recruited women and couples attempting pregnancy from the general population.The control groups in each study also differed: some received general recommendations on timing condom-less intercourse,one allowed participants to use other pregnancy aids,one requested participants to abstain from other ovulation-timing methodsand one collected urine specimens for lab testing.Additional high-powered RCTs that provide all participants with menstrual cycle and reproduction-timing education, provide information about realistic expectations on chance of pregnancy per cycle attempts and also give participants a fertility assessment prior to study inclusion in order to ensure potential capacity to become pregnant and carry a child to term (fecundability) through appropriately timed condom-less intercourse, would strengthen the evidence base. If vaginal insemination is used with donor semen, these participant data need to be appropriately disaggregated. If women are found to have a lower ovarian reserve or if men are found with lower quality semen parameters, these participant data also need to be appropriated disaggregated. All included studies took place in high-income countries; thus, additional research evidence is needed from participants from lower-resource settings.

### COVID-19 vaccination considerations for obstetric-gynecologic care [^609c9c50]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 vaccination and fertility in people considering pregnancy—Growing data indicate vaccines are unrelated to fecundability and a systematic review and meta-analysis (21 cohorts, n=19,687 cycles) found no effect on fertility among individuals with assisted reproductive treatment. Neither initial doses (n=1,815) nor booster doses (n=112,718) have been shown to increase spontaneous pregnancy losses or miscarriage rate. Evidence also demonstrates the short-term decline in male fertility following infection with COVID-19. Given the mechanism of action and safety profile, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are not a cause of infertility; because the vaccine does not replicate in cells, it cannot cause infection or alter recipient DNA. Therefore, ACOG recommends vaccination for all eligible people who may consider future pregnancy, and routine pregnancy testing is not recommended and should not be required before receiving any EUA-authorized or FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^b6e6e6e9]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2 
Associations of age at pursuing pregnancy of women and men and fecundability ratios. Fecundability ratios (with 95% confidence interval) associated with age at pursuing pregnancy in categories. Fecundability ratios were derived from the hazard ratios (HR) of the Cox model. The fecundability ratio of age on the categorical scale was calculated as follows: HR = (hazard rate (H(t)) of the different age categories)/(H(t) Age reference category: 30.0–34.9 years)). An HR < 1 indicates a lower fecundability as compared to the reference category. A Main analysis for women with adjustment for participants body mass index, ethnicity, education level, smoking, alcohol consumption and parity (Additional file 1: Tables S8–S9). Survival curve derived from unadjusted model. B Main analysis for men with adjustment for participants body mass index, ethnicity, education level, smoking and alcohol consumption (Additional file 1: Tables S8–S9). Survival curve derived from unadjusted model. Several sensitivity analyses were performed: excluding the top 5% observations of time to pregnancy correcting for the right-skewed distribution (Additional file 1: Table S10), including only first episodes of participants (Table S11), including partners age at pursuing pregnancy as a covariate (Additional file 1: Table S12), and including only the preconception cohort (Additional file 1: Table S13)
