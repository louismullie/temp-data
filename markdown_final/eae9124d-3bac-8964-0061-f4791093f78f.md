## Question

Sleep apnea diagnosis scoring system

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the sleep apnea diagnosis scoring system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic metric and its thresholds. Then, I should verify the event definitions for apneas and hypopneas, including the AASM-recommended versus acceptable criteria. Next, I will examine the role of arousal-based scoring and RERAs. After that, I need to check how severity is classified and how this differs from ICSD-3 diagnostic criteria. I will then review pediatric-specific thresholds and the impact of device type and scoring rules on AHI. Finally, I should consider limitations of AHI, emerging metrics, and practical clinical implications for testing and follow-up, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental metric. The apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) is the primary measure of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity, defined as the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep, with diagnostic thresholds and severity bands anchored to AHI values, although I should double-check that severity bands are consistent across sources before concluding [^115UKFTo] [^114dpC5N].

> Wait, let me verify the event definitions so I don't misstate them. Apnea is a drop in peak signal excursion by at least 90% from baseline for at least 10 seconds, and hypopnea is a drop of at least 30% from baseline for at least 10 seconds accompanied by either at least a 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal; this is the AASM-recommended definition, and I should confirm that this is the current standard in the 2012 update and subsequent position statements [^112geA2K] [^1151si3N].

> Hold on, I should verify the alternative hypopnea definition because it materially changes AHI. The acceptable alternative requires a 30% reduction in airflow for at least 10 seconds with at least a 4% oxygen desaturation and does not allow arousal alone to qualify; importantly, this CMS-aligned definition underestimates disease burden compared with the AASM-recommended rule, and I need to ensure I note that dual scoring is often advised when the acceptable rule is mandated by payers [^112geA2K] [^113xyRfy] [^114HnqHn].

> I will now examine the role of arousal-based scoring and RERAs, since missing arousal-linked events can underdiagnose OSA. The AASM position is that polysomnography should include arousal-based scoring because arousals better predict hypersomnia than hypoxemia alone, and RERAs should be captured; RERAs are sequences of increased effort or flow limitation lasting at least 10 seconds that lead to arousal but do not meet criteria for apnea or hypopnea, and they contribute to the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) used diagnostically in ICSD-3 [^111BY4rn] [^114HnqHn] [^113tQqgh] [^117QQ5DM].

> Let me think about severity classification next, and I should confirm the bands. Mild OSA is typically defined as AHI 5 to less than 15 events per hour, moderate as 15 to less than 30, and severe as 30 or more events per hour; this schema is widely used in clinical practice and aligns with major guidelines, though I should note that diagnostic criteria in ICSD-3 are framed around obstructive respiratory events per hour with symptoms or ≥ 15/hr without symptoms, which is not identical to severity bands [^115UKFTo] [^114dpC5N] [^117QQ5DM].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child; I need to check pediatric thresholds. In children, an obstructive AHI greater than 1.5 events per hour of sleep is considered abnormal, and many pediatric guidelines caution against relying on AHI alone for decision-making; additionally, pediatric scoring requires arousal for hypopneas and attention to hypoventilation, which most HSAT devices cannot assess, reinforcing that in-lab PSG remains the reference standard in children [^111qZN5W] [^114Ttktc] [^112E8vYg].

> Next, I should review how device type and scoring rules affect AHI, because this is a common source of confusion. Home sleep apnea tests (HSAT) often use recording time rather than true sleep time as the denominator, cannot score arousals, and may miss hypopneas that require only arousal, leading to underestimation of AHI; therefore, a negative or inconclusive HSAT in a high-pretest-probability patient should prompt in-lab PSG, and raw HSAT data should be manually reviewed rather than relying on automated scoring alone [^112VwzyA] [^112J4Mu5] [^112Mk8uh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about AHI being the only meaningful metric; I should double-check limitations and emerging alternatives. AHI does not capture hypoxic burden, event duration, sleep fragmentation, or comorbidity, and newer approaches such as ventilatory burden, hypoxic burden, and EEG-based markers of arousal burden better predict outcomes like sleepiness, cardiovascular events, and mortality; nonetheless, AHI remains the current clinical standard pending widespread adoption of these advanced metrics [^117Dvage] [^1155mUUT].

> I need to ensure the practical clinical implications are clear. For uncomplicated adults with moderate-to-high pretest probability, HSAT is reasonable, but negative or inconclusive results warrant PSG; for patients with significant cardiopulmonary disease, suspected hypoventilation, neuromuscular weakness, opioid use, or complex sleep disorders, PSG is preferred; and when payer policy forces use of the 4% desaturation-only hypopnea rule, dual scoring with reporting of both AHI and RDI is advisable to avoid underdiagnosis [^112J4Mu5] [^112Y3Hkf] [^114HnqHn].

> Let me reconsider any potential inconsistencies before concluding. Some summaries equate severity bands with diagnostic criteria, but I should confirm that ICSD-3 diagnostic thresholds are framed around event frequency with or without symptoms, whereas severity bands are descriptive ranges; also, while AHI is the current clinical standard, emerging data support complementary metrics, so I should emphasize that AHI remains necessary but insufficient for full phenotypic characterization and outcome prediction [^117QQ5DM] [^117Dvage].

The sleep apnea diagnosis scoring system relies on the **apnea–hypopnea index (AHI)** [^115UKFTo], calculated as the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. Apneas are **≥ 90% drops in airflow for ≥ 10 seconds** [^112geA2K], and hypopneas are **≥ 30% drops in airflow for ≥ 10 seconds** with either ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal [^1151si3N]. Severity is classified as mild (5–14/h), moderate (15–29/h), or severe (≥ 30/h) [^115UKFTo] [^114dpC5N]. The AHI is the primary metric for diagnosis and severity grading, but arousal-based scoring [^111BY4rn] and RERAs are important to capture sleep fragmentation, especially in patients with symptoms but minimal desaturation [^115KPLPh] [^113V82eK]. Home sleep apnea testing can estimate AHI but may miss arousal-based events, so in-lab polysomnography remains the reference standard when HSAT is negative or inconclusive [^112VwzyA] [^112J4Mu5].

## Key components of the scoring system

### Apnea and hypopnea definitions

- **Apnea**: A ≥ 90% reduction in airflow from baseline for ≥ 10 seconds [^112geA2K].
- **Hypopnea**: A ≥ 30% reduction in airflow from baseline for ≥ 10 seconds, accompanied by either ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation from baseline or an arousal [^1151si3N].
- **Respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA)**: A sequence of breaths lasting ≥ 10 seconds characterized by increasing respiratory effort or flattening of the nasal pressure waveform, leading to an arousal from sleep, but not meeting criteria for apnea or hypopnea [^113tQqgh].

---

### Calculation of the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI)

The AHI is the **total number of apneas and hypopneas divided by the total sleep time** (hours) [^115N84rv]. It is the primary metric for diagnosing and classifying OSA severity [^115UKFTo].

---

### Severity classification

OSA severity is classified based on AHI as follows:

| **Severity** | **Ahi (events/hour)** |
|-|-|
| Normal | < 5 |
| Mild | 5–14 |
| Moderate | 15–29 |
| Severe | ≥ 30 |

---

This classification guides clinical decision-making and treatment planning [^114dpC5N].

---

## Clinical significance of the scoring system

The AHI is a **critical measure** for diagnosing OSA, assessing severity, and guiding treatment decisions [^115UKFTo]. Higher AHI values correlate with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and neurocognitive impairment [^116MVSdB]. Treatment decisions, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, are often based on AHI severity and symptomatology [^115N84rv].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the AHI is widely used, it has limitations:

- **Variability in scoring**: Different hypopnea definitions (e.g. ≥ 3% vs. ≥ 4% desaturation) can significantly affect AHI values and diagnostic outcomes [^1124bAZv] [^113xyRfy].
- **Night-to-night variability**: AHI can vary between nights, potentially leading to misclassification if only a single night study is conducted [^115KLsEd].
- **Limited correlation with symptoms**: AHI does not always correlate with daytime sleepiness or quality of life, necessitating consideration of other clinical factors [^116uQJvQ].

---

## Recent developments and modifications

Recent updates emphasize the **importance of arousal-based scoring** [^111BY4rn], particularly for patients with symptoms but minimal oxygen desaturation [^115KPLPh]. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends including arousal-based hypopneas in the AHI calculation to improve diagnostic accuracy and ensure appropriate treatment [^114HnqHn].

---

## Alternative and complementary metrics

In addition to AHI, other metrics are increasingly recognized for their clinical relevance:

- **Oxygen desaturation index (ODI)**: Measures the frequency of oxygen desaturation events, providing insight into hypoxemic burden [^116f28rC].
- **Hypoxic burden**: Quantifies the cumulative severity of oxygen desaturation events, correlating with cardiovascular outcomes [^117Dvage].
- **Arousal burden**: Assesses the frequency and impact of cortical arousals, reflecting sleep fragmentation [^117Dvage].

---

## Pediatric considerations

Pediatric OSA scoring differs from adult criteria, with **age-specific norms and thresholds**. Polysomnography remains the gold standard for pediatric diagnosis, and home sleep apnea testing is generally not recommended due to limitations in detecting arousal-based events and hypoventilation [^112E8vYg].

---

The sleep apnea diagnosis scoring system centers on the **AHI**, with event definitions and severity thresholds standardized by the AASM. Recent updates emphasize arousal-based scoring to improve diagnostic accuracy, and complementary metrics like ODI and hypoxic burden are increasingly used to better characterize disease severity and guide treatment.

### Arousal-based scoring of obstructive hypopneas [^115KPLPh]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obstructive sleep apnea in adults is diagnosed by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) above five (at least five apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep). Though the definition of apneas has remained stable, the scoring criteria for hypopneas has varied throughout the years. There is even more evidence now that scoring respiratory events associated with arousals should be included in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, as these patients may benefit from treatment.

Recent Findings

Recent studies, trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that respiratory events associated with arousal are associated with symptoms, such as poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. These arousal-based hypopneas have also been noted to carry a risk of hypertension and other adverse health consequences.

Summary

Requiring a 4% oxygen desaturation for hypopneas may miss patients that may benefit from treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. These patients are typically younger, nonobese, and women as they have been found to have respiratory events causing sleep fragmentation versus significant oxygen desaturation as compared with other populations.

### Rules for scoring respiratory events in sleep: update of the 2007 AASM manual for the scoring of sleep and associated events. deliberations of the sleep apnea definitions task force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^112geA2K]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Sleep Apnea Definitions Task Force reviewed the current rules for scoring respiratory events in the 2007 AASM Manual for the Scoring and Sleep and Associated Events to determine if revision was indicated. The goals of the task force were (1) to clarify and simplify the current scoring rules, (2) to review evidence for new monitoring technologies relevant to the scoring rules, and (3) to strive for greater concordance between adult and pediatric rules. The task force reviewed the evidence cited by the AASM systematic review of the reliability and validity of scoring respiratory events published in 2007 and relevant studies that have appeared in the literature since that publication. Given the limitations of the published evidence, a consensus process was used to formulate the majority of the task force recommendations concerning revisions. The task force made recommendations concerning recommended and alternative sensors for the detection of apnea and hypopnea to be used during diagnostic and positive airway pressure (PAP) titration polysomnography. An alternative sensor is used if the recommended sensor fails or the signal is inaccurate. The PAP device flow signal is the recommended sensor for the detection of apnea, hypopnea, and respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) during PAP titration studies. Appropriate filter settings for recording (display) of the nasal pressure signal to facilitate visualization of inspiratory flattening are also specified. The respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals to be used as alternative sensors for apnea and hypopnea detection are specified. The task force reached consensus on use of the same sensors for adult and pediatric patients except for the following: (1) the end-tidal PCO(2) signal can be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection in children only, and (2) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) belts can be used to monitor respiratory effort (thoracoabdominal belts) and as an alternative sensor for detection of apnea and hypopnea (PVDFsum) only in adults. The task force recommends the following changes to the 2007 respiratory scoring rules. Apnea in adults is scored when there is a drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative apnea sensor, for ≥ 10 seconds. Hypopnea in adults is scored when the peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for ≥ 10 seconds in association with either ≥ 3% arterial oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Scoring a hypopnea as either obstructive or central is now listed as optional, and the recommended scoring rules are presented. In children an apnea is scored when peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor; and the event meets duration and respiratory effort criteria for an obstructive, mixed, or central apnea. A central apnea is scored in children when the event meets criteria for an apnea, there is an absence of inspiratory effort throughout the event, and at least one of the following is met: (1) the event is ≥ 20 seconds in duration, (2) the event is associated with an arousal or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation, (3) (infants under 1 year of age only) the event is associated with a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute for at least 5 seconds or less than 60 beats per minute for 15 seconds. A hypopnea is scored in children when the peak signal excursions drop is ≥ 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for ≥ the duration of 2 breaths in association with either ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal. In children and adults, surrogates of the arterial PCO(2) are the end-tidal PCO(2) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (diagnostic study) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (titration study). For adults, sleep hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 55 mm Hg for ≥ 10 minutes or there is an increase in the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) ≥ 10 mm Hg (in comparison to an awake supine value) to a value exceeding 50 mm Hg for ≥ 10 minutes. For pediatric patients hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 50 mm Hg for > 25% of total sleep time. In adults Cheyne-Stokes breathing is scored when both of the following are met: (1) there are episodes of ≥ 3 consecutive central apneas and/or central hypopneas separated by a crescendo and decrescendo change in breathing amplitude with a cycle length of at least 40 seconds (typically 45 to 90 seconds), and (2) there are five or more central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour associated with the crescendo/decrescendo breathing pattern recorded over a minimum of 2 hours of monitoring.

### Polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea should include arousal-based scoring: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^111BY4rn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position statement on polysomnography (PSG) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) states that PSG "Should Include Arousal-Based Scoring" and that "Current evidence emphasizes the importance of using arousal-based scoring of respiratory events when evaluating patients suspected of having OSA". Evidence cited notes that "arousals, and not hypoxemia, better predict hypersomnia in patients with OSA" and that "Eliminating sleep fragmentation, even with persistent hypoxemia, improves sleepiness compared with baseline". It further indicates that "Existing data also support inclusion of RERAs in order to fully define sleep-disordered breathing" and concludes that "there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hypoxemia as a singular, disease-defining trait for OSA", because "cardinal features of OSA, such as daytime sleepiness, cannot be explained by hypoxemia alone". The document clarifies authorship and purpose, stating "This position statement was developed by the board of directors of the AASM to improve the diagnosis of OSA" and "It is published by the AASM as an advisory that is to be used for educational and informational purposes only".

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116qGjpJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) guideline background — classification and evidence limitations highlights that current CSA classification relies on clinical presentation rather than underlying pathophysiology, with polysomnographic criteria, particularly hypopnea scoring, inconsistently applied and seldom utilized in reviewed studies. Treatment options targeting specific mechanistic pathways are limited, and these challenges have impeded progress for decades, narrowing treatment options. The guideline notes limitations in the quantity, quality, and variability of available studies because CSA is less common and less well understood than obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and recent clinical trials in both CSA and OSA failed to demonstrate survival benefits, although intermediate outcomes such as quality of life and sleepiness improved with treatment. To address limited evidence and shared mechanisms, the task force aimed to group studies evaluating similar treatments across CSA subtypes and reviewed both individual and grouped data to strengthen assessment of treatment effectiveness. The guideline and its accompanying systematic review provide a comprehensive update intended to optimize patient-centric care.

### Polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea should include arousal-based scoring: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^112Y3Hkf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea — Impact of not using arousal-based scoring includes substantial underdiagnosis and clinical harms; studies have shown that not utilizing arousal-based scoring may lead to a missed diagnosis in up to 30% to 40% of patients with OSA, and not including arousal-based respiratory events when scoring a PSG may lead to lack of proper diagnosis, misclassification of OSA severity, or misidentification of another sleep or medical disorder, with patients remaining improperly treated and experiencing persistent sleep symptoms, worsened work performance, decreased neurocognitive function, and poor clinical outcomes.

### Polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea should include arousal-based scoring: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1145p4LD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Polysomnography for suspected obstructive sleep apnea — AASM position statements specify that the RECOMMENDED AASM Scoring Manual criteria for hypopneas should be utilized in clinical evaluation; if the ACCEPTABLE AASM criteria must be used, events including arousals should be captured either by scoring hypopneas using the RECOMMENDED criteria or by reporting an RDI; if the PSG AHI (using the RECOMMENDED definition) is 5 or more events/h or if the RDI is greater than or equal to 5 events/h, treatment of symptomatic patients is recommended; and because identification of arousal-based respiratory events requires EEG data, the RECOMMENDED AASM Scoring Manual criteria requiring arousal cannot be applied.

### Impact of different criteria for defining hypopneas in the apnea-hypopnea index [^1124bAZv]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore the effect of using different scoring criteria for hypopneas in the scoring of polysomnographic studies: (1) by estimating the level of agreement between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) scores derived from different scoring methods, and (2) by examining the effect on the point prevalence of disease using different threshold values of the AHI.

Design

Retrospective analysis of 48 diagnostic polysomnographic records.

Setting

Tertiary-hospital sleep-disorders clinic.

Measurements

AHIs were derived from three different methods for scoring hypopneas. The hypopnea definitions used incorporated different combinations and threshold values of respiratory signal changes in addition to differences in the requirement for associated oxygen desaturation or arousal. The level of agreement between different scoring methods was assessed by constructing Bland-Altman plots and calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). kappa statistics were used to assess agreement between the different methods using varying thresholds of AHI to categorize sleep apnea (AHI > 5, AHI > 15, and AHI > 20).

Results

The random-effects ICC for the three methods was 0.89, suggesting that the different scoring methods tended to rank patients fairly consistently. However, the point prevalence of disease estimated by using different thresholds of AHI was found to vary depending on the method used to score sleep studies (kappa, 0.30 to 0.95).

Conclusions

These findings have implications for case finding, population-prevalence estimates, and grading of disease severity for access to government-funded continuous positive airway pressure services. Guidelines for standardizing the measurement and reporting of sleep studies in clinical practice should be implemented.

### Polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea should include arousal-based scoring: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^113V82eK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

The diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults, as defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition, requires an increased frequency of obstructive respiratory events demonstrated by in-laboratory, attended polysomnography (PSG) or a home sleep apnea test (HSAT). However, there are currently two hypopnea scoring criteria in The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications (AASM Scoring Manual). This dichotomy results in differences among laboratory reports, patient treatments and payer policies. Confusion occurs regarding recognizing and scoring "arousal-based respiratory events" during OSA testing. "Arousal-based scoring" recognizes hypopneas associated with electroencephalography-based arousals, with or without significant oxygen desaturation, when calculating an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), or it includes respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs), in addition to hypopneas and apneas, when calculating a respiratory disturbance index (RDI). Respiratory events associated with arousals, even without oxygen desaturation, cause significant, and potentially dangerous, sleep apnea symptoms. During PSG, arousal-based respiratory scoring should be performed in the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected OSA, especially in those patients with symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, or other neurocognitive symptoms. Therefore, it is the position of the AASM that the RECOMMENDED AASM Scoring Manual scoring criteria for hypopneas, which includes diminished airflow accompanied by either an arousal or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation, should be used to calculate the AHI. If the ACCEPTABLE AASM Scoring Manual criteria for scoring hypopneas, which includes only diminished airflow plus ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation (and does not allow for arousal-based scoring alone), must be utilized due to payer policy requirements, then hypopneas as defined by the RECOMMENDED AASM Scoring Manual criteria should also be scored. Alternatively, the AASM Scoring Manual includes an option to report an RDI which also provides an assessment of the sleep-disordered breathing that results in arousal from sleep. Furthermore, given the inability of most HSAT devices to capture arousals, a PSG should be performed in any patient with an increased risk for OSA whose HSAT is negative. If the PSG yields an AHI of 5 or more events/h, or if the RDI is greater than or equal to 5 events/h, then treatment of symptomatic patients is recommended to improve quality of life, limit neurocognitive symptoms, and reduce accident risk.

### The AASM scoring manual: a critical appraisal [^116VMvcx]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Summarize recently published studies and critiques evaluating the effects of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Sleep Scoring Manual.

Recent Findings

Only a few retrospective studies have been published evaluating the new AASM Scoring Manual. These have shown that when scoring polysomnograms (PSGs) using the AASM rules compared to previous standards and guidelines: increased amount and percentage of sleep time in Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREM) 1 (N1) and N3 sleep, and decreased NREM 2 (N2) sleep; improved interscorer reliability when scoring sleep stages in adults; large differences in apnea-hypopnea indexes (AHIs) using different hypopnea scoring definitions; and PSGs scored using the 'recommended' hypopnea definition in the new manual identified no significant sleep disordered breathing in 40% of lean individuals with symptomatic OSA (AHI ≥ 5/h by 1999 'Chicago' criteria) and a favorable response to treatment.

Summary

Two years have passed since the AASM Scoring Manual was published, garnering less criticism than was feared by those who developed it. The improvement in interscorer reliability using the Manual is heartening since this goal shaped many of the choices made. The alternative hypopnea rule should be endorsed as a recommended option. The AASM Scoring Manual provides a foundation upon which we all can build rules and methods that quantify the complexity of sleep and its disorders. Multicenter validation and refinement of the Manual is encouraged.

### Polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea should include arousal-based scoring: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^114HnqHn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement — during in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) for suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), arousal-based respiratory scoring should be performed, and the RECOMMENDED AASM Scoring Manual hypopnea criterion — which includes diminished airflow accompanied by either an arousal or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation — should be used to calculate the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). If payer policy requires use of the ACCEPTABLE criterion, which includes diminished airflow plus ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation and does not allow for arousal-based scoring, then hypopneas as defined by the RECOMMENDED criterion should also be scored, and the AASM Scoring Manual offers an option to report a respiratory disturbance index (RDI). Given the inability of most home sleep apnea test (HSAT) devices to capture arousals, a PSG should be performed in any patient with an increased risk for OSA whose HSAT is negative. If the PSG yields an AHI of 5 or more events/h, or if the RDI is greater than or equal to 5 events/h, then treatment of symptomatic patients is recommended to improve quality of life, limit neurocognitive symptoms, and reduce accident risk.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115uMyx3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) background and diagnostic definitions — Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes OSA, central sleep apnea (CSA), and sleep-related hypoventilation, and the diagnosis of OSA involves measuring breathing during sleep. In population-based data using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff, the prevalence of OSA has been estimated to be 14% in men and 5% of women with AHI ≥ 5 events/h and hypopneas associated with ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation, while rates are higher in selected groups such as patients evaluated for bariatric surgery (estimated 70% to 80%) and those with transient ischemic attack or stroke (estimated 60% to 70%). Patients with untreated OSA may be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and treatment has been shown to improve quality of life, lower the rates of motor vehicle accidents, and reduce chronic health risks. Per ICSD-3, OSA is defined as a PSG-determined obstructive respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 5 events/h with typical symptoms, or an obstructive RDI ≥ 15 events/h even without symptoms; the RDI includes respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs), and event scoring is defined in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.

### Alternative algorithms and devices in sleep apnoea diagnosis: what we know and what we expect [^117RCY2u]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

REFERENCE STANDARD: POLYSOMNOGRAPHY

The reference standard for diagnosing sleep disordered breathing, as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and as defined by event definitions outlined in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual for scoring sleep and associated events, is PSG. The signals to be recorded, the technical requirements, the scoring criteria and the reporting of results are all perfectly specified in the AASM manual. PSG requires specially equipped rooms with one bed per room and video recording added, and a continuous supervision by trained persons (sleep technicians) for the night-time recording. After the recording, the data are scored visually by trained sleep scorers (sleep technicians) for sleep stages, apnoea, hypopnoea events, arousal, movement, and further events. A report is generated. The report includes the number of apnoea and hypopnoea events and relates them to the total sleep time (TST). Once related to TST, this is called AHI with events per hour of sleep. This index serves as a severity measure for sleep apnoea. An AHI below 5/h is rated as normal, AHI between 5 and 15 is rated as low apnoea severity, AHI between 15 and 30 as moderate apnoea severity and AHI above 30 as severe sleep apnoea. Moderate and severe sleep apnoea require treatment to reduce the risk for subsequent cardiovascular mortality. The resulting report is interpreted by experts, which altogether is a costly and time consuming investigation. This high standard for diagnosis will remain to be a clinical research tool and a reference when testing new algorithms and devices against the gold standard.

### Alternative algorithms and devices in sleep apnoea diagnosis: what we know and what we expect [^112vFC2K]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The traditional diagnostic tool for sleep apnoea is PSG. However, this is no longer the tool for clinical practice. The high prevalence and the global burden of sleep apnoea require easy accessible devices and alternative tools with high accuracy and reliability, adequated certifications and well known and documented limitations for their application. Polygraphy is the currently used tool. Simpler tools, such as smartphone supported tools are about to come, but have not been validated enough.

A clinician might want to know which of the new tools and methods could be used for which patient. To answer this question, studies are needed which check the precision in distinguishing between normal, mild, moderate sleep apnoea in unselected patient groups. However, this kind of studies are not available for the new tools. Tools, if validated were usually tested in extreme patients. Therefore, a clinicians guide to check devices is still the grading of methods according to the SCOPER criteria.

In addition to the challenge of high prevalence, sleep medicine faces the challenge of identifying the right patients which have an increased mortality risk and profit most from treatment. The traditional severity parameter AHI has limitations for this assessment. New devices and algorithms provide the potential to give better severity metrics. But his requires long-term mortality and treatment outcome studies and cannot be concluded with short-term studies.

### Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a clinical practice guideline from theAmerican College of Physicians [^115N84rv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) definition and diagnostic thresholds are specified: polysomnography and portable monitors measure or estimate AHI as "the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour during sleep". The American Academy of Sleep Medicine uses "15 events per hour without symptoms or 5 events per hour with symptoms" for OSA diagnosis, and it recommends continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) "for patients with an AHI score of at least 15 events per hour or those with at least 5 events per hour and symptoms". Included studies in the evidence review used minimum diagnostic cutoffs "ranging from 5 to 20 events per hour".

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111GjB3c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion and future directions — polysomnography (PSG) and split-night testing note that while PSG remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA, it involves cumbersome sensors and devices that, if minimized and less obstructive, could make PSG more tolerable, and new technology that is less intrusive and more comfortable may influence patient preferences. Split-night PSG testing, which may improve the efficiency of PSG, has not been adequately studied; the quality of evidence regarding split-night sleep studies is low, past research often used outdated testing methodology or scoring criteria, and there is a lack of data on its utility in patients with significant underlying cardiopulmonary disease, so cost-effectiveness warrants further exploration.

### Polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea should include arousal-based scoring: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1151si3N]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea — RECOMMENDED AASM hypopnea scoring criteria require that a hypopnea be scored only when all conditions are present: the peak signal excursions drop by ≥ 30% from pre-event baseline using nasal pressure, the duration of the ≥ 30% drop is ≥ 10 seconds, and there is a ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline or the event is associated with an arousal.

International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3) adult OSA diagnostic thresholds — diagnosis includes either five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (obstructive and mixed apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort-related arousals [RERAs]) per hour of sleep during polysomnography (PSG) or per hour of monitoring time during a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) with symptoms or comorbidities, or fifteen or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep during PSG or per hour of monitoring time during an HSAT. Patients with exclusively RERAs previously designated as having upper airway resistance syndrome are now subsumed under OSA in the ICSD-3.

### A transition to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine-recommended hypopnea definition in adults: initiatives of the hypopnea scoring rule task force [^113xyRfy]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that hypopneas be identified using a definition that is based on a ≥ 30% decrease in airflow associated with a ≥ 3% reduction in the oxygen saturation or an arousal (H3A) for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. This conflicts with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services definition, which requires a ≥ 4% decrease in the oxygen saturation to identify a hypopnea (H4) and does not acknowledge arousals. In 2018, the AASM Board of Directors constituted a Hypopnea Scoring Rule Task Force with a mandate to "create a strategy for adoption and implementation of the AASM recommended adult hypopnea scoring criteria among members, payers and device manufacturers". The task force initiated several activities including a survey of AASM-accredited sleep facilities and discussions with polysomnography software vendors. Survey results indicated that most sleep facilities scored polysomnograms using only the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services definition. Vendors indicated that they could easily support dual scoring. Informal testing among task force members' sleep facilities confirmed there would be little additional work if dual scoring was performed. The task force convened several meetings of a working group of OSA content experts and interested parties, with the purpose of creating research recommendations to study the impact on relevant clinical outcomes using the different definitions of hypopnea. Several possible prospective and retrospective approaches were discussed with emphasis on the group of patients diagnosed with OSA based on an apnea-hypopnea index using H3A but not H4. Based on the deliberations of the working group, the Hypopnea Scoring Rule Task Force submitted recommendations to the AASM Foundation concerning research project strategies for potential grant funding. Further discussions within the Hypopnea Scoring Rule Task Force focused on developing advocacy initiatives among patient stakeholder groups to change payer policy.

### Diagnostic issues in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea [^111Q5edC]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children includes a spectrum of respiratory disorders with significant morbidities. Diagnosis of OSAS is based on clinical suspicion, history, and physical findings, and confirmation is made by polysomnography. There has been significant progress in recent years in technologies available for diagnosis of OSAS since the consensus statement of the American Thoracic Society in 1996. The current review describes methodologies that are available today for assessment and diagnosis of OSAS in children and summarizes the most recent recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force regarding scoring sleep-related respiratory events in children.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112VwzyA]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea — home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) versus polysomnography (PSG) definitions, device classifications, and measurement limitations are outlined. Hypopnea criteria vary, with an alternative definition that requires association with a 4% oxygen desaturation without consideration of cortical arousals, and depending on which definition is used, the AHI may be considerably different in a given individual. HSAT, which has limitations, is an alternative method to diagnose OSA in adults, and may be less costly and more efficient in some populations. Device categorization includes Type I, Type II, Type III or Type IV, where unattended studies fall into Type II through Type IV; Type II uses the same signals as full PSGs but is unattended, Type III uses selective respiratory variables with oxygen saturation and a cardiac variable, and Type IV devices measure only 1 or 2 parameters, typically oxygen saturation and heart rate or just air flow. An alternative SCOPER classification incorporates Sleep, Cardiovascular, Oximetry, Position, Effort and Respiratory parameters and allows inclusion of technologies such as peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), but due to complexity the TF elected to refer to HSAT devices by the traditional Type II through Type IV classification. Compared with attended studies, HSAT raises risk for technical failures due to a lack of real-time monitoring, has limitations from the inability of most devices to define sleep versus wake, and positive airway pressure cannot be initiated during HSAT but can during PSG if needed. Measurement issues include using recording time rather than sleep time to define the denominator of the respiratory event index (REI), inability of conventional sensors to detect hypopneas only associated with cortical arousals that are included in the recommended AHI scoring rule, and sensor dislodgement and poor signal quality, which can underestimate the "true" AHI and lead to repeated studies due to inadequate data for diagnosis.

### STOP-bang questionnaire: a practical approach to screen for obstructive sleep apnea [^11154T8x]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "STOP-BANG score for obstructive sleep apnea" for obstructive sleep apnea.

The STOP-BANG score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in patients. The acronym stands for Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index (BMI), Age, Neck circumference, and Gender, which are the eight factors considered in the score.

This calculator is applicable to the general adult population, particularly those who present with symptoms of sleep apnea such as excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, observed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep, and abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking.

The clinical utility of the STOP-BANG score is to identify individuals at high risk for OSA who may benefit from further diagnostic evaluation, such as polysomnography. It is a simple and effective tool that can be used in both primary care and preoperative settings to screen for OSA.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the STOP-BANG score. However, it may not be as effective in populations with a low prevalence of OSA or in patients with other sleep disorders.

The STOP-BANG score for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is calculated using responses to eight questions addressing symptoms and risk factors associated with OSA. Each response is given a score of either 0 or 1, based on a predefined scoring system. The sum of these scores determines the individual's risk level for OSA.

The questions relate to:

1. **Loud snoring**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
2. **Daytime tiredness**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
3. **Observed apneas**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
4. **High blood pressure**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
5. **Body mass index (BMI)**: " > 35 kg/m²" = 1, " ≤ 35 kg/m²" = 0
6. **Age**: " > 50 years" = 1, " ≤ 50 years" = 0
7. **Neck circumference**: " > 40 cm" = 1, " ≤ 40 cm" = 0
8. **Gender**: "Male" = 1, "Female" = 0

The STOP-BANG score is computed by summing the individual scores for each question. The interpretation of the total score is as follows: a score of less than 3 indicates a low risk of OSA, while a score of 3 or higher indicates a high risk of OSA. The scoring system provides a straightforward method for initial screening of individuals at risk for obstructive sleep apnea.

### Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115UKFTo]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Definitions and severity classification — Apnea is total airflow obstruction for more than 10 seconds and hypopnea is a partial airway obstruction with at least a 3% reduction in blood oxygen saturation or sleep arousals; obstructive sleep apnea is defined as more than 5 apnea, hypoxic, or sleep arousal events per hour, and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used to define severity as mild 5 to 15 events per hour, moderate 16 to 30 events per hour, and severe more than 30 events per hour.

### The AASM scoring manual four years later [^114LSEPh]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Review published studies and critiques which evaluate the impact and effects of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Sleep Scoring Manual in the four years since its publication.

Findings

USING THE AASM MANUAL RULES TO SCORE SLEEP AND EVENTS IN A POLYSOMNOGRAM (PSG) RESULTS IN: (1) very large differences in apnea-hypopnea indexes (AHI) when using the recommended and alternative rule for scoring hypopneas in adults; (2) increases in NREM 1 and sleep stage shifts with compensatory decreases in NREM 2 in children and adults when following rule 5.C.b. for ending NREM 2 sleep; (3) increases in NREM 3 in adults scoring slow wave activity in the frontal EEG derivations; (4) improved interscorer reliability; and (5) successfully identified fragmented sleep in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from primary snorers or normal controls because they had more NREM 1 and stage shifts using rule 5.C.b. Criticism of the Manual most often cited: (1) two rules for scoring hypopneas; (2) alternative EEG montage cancellation effects; (3) scoring stages 3 and 4 as NREM 3; and (4) too few rules for scoring arousals and REM sleep without atonia.

Summary

Four years have passed since the AASM Scoring Manual was published with far less criticism than those who developed it feared. The AASM Manual provides a foundation upon which we all can build rules and methods which identify the complexity of sleep and its disorders.

### A single-arm, open-label, multicenter, and comparative study of the ANNE sleep system vs polysomnography to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea [^114sr7hf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Evaluate per-patient diagnostic performance of a wireless dual-sensor system (ANNE sleep) compared with reference standard polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with a minimum prespecified threshold of 80% for both sensitivity and specificity.

Methods

A multicenter clinical trial was conducted to evaluate ANNE sleep vs PSG to diagnose moderate and severe OSA in individuals 22 years or older. For each testing approach, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was manually scored and averaged by 3 registered sleep technologists blinded to the other system. Average variations > 15% were adjudicated by a sleep medicine physician.

Results

In a total of n = 225 participants (mean age 53 years, range 22–88 years), PSG diagnosed 30% (n = 68) of participants with moderate or severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/h) compared to 29% (n = 65) diagnosed by ANNE sleep (P = 0.55). The sensitivity and specificity for ANNE sleep were 90% (95% confidence interval: 80–96%) and 98% (95% confidence interval: 94–99%), respectively. Strong correlation was shown in terms of final AHI (r = .93), with an average AHI bias of 0.5 (95% limits of agreement: -12.8 to 11.8). The majority of users noted comfort with using the ANNE sleep in the home setting. No adverse events were noted.

Conclusions

Using PSG as the gold standard, ANNE sleep demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of moderate or severe OSA.

Table 2. OSA scoring system — an example for estimating perioperative risk from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) uses point scores from severity, surgery/anesthesia invasiveness, and opioid requirement. For severity based on sleep study, "None 0", "Mild 1", "Moderate 2", and "Severe 3". For invasiveness, examples include "Superficial surgery under local or peripheral nerve block anesthesia without sedation 0", "Peripheral surgery with general anesthesia 2", and "Airway surgery, general anesthesia 3". For postoperative opioids, "None 0", "Low-dose oral opioids 1", and "High-dose oral opioids, parenteral or neuraxial opioids 3". The overall risk score is defined as "the score for A plus the greater of the score for either B or C", with modifiers stating "One point may be subtracted if a patient has been on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)… " and "One point should be added if a patient with mild or moderate OSA also has a resting arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco2) greater than 50 mmHg". The table notes that "Patients with score of 4 may be at increased perioperative risk from OSA; patients with a score of 5 or 6 may be at significantly increased perioperative risk from OSA", and clarifies that it "has not been clinically validated" and is "meant only as a guide".

### Clinical use of a home sleep apnea test: an updated American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^113RCAQa]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis and effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults is an urgent health priority. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) that only a medical provider can diagnose medical conditions such as OSA and primary snoring. Throughout this statement, the term "medical provider" refers to a licensed physician and any other health care professional who is licensed to practice medicine in accordance with state licensing laws and regulations. A home sleep apnea test (HSAT) is an alternative to polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adults presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. It is also the position of the AASM that: the need for, and appropriateness of, an HSAT must be based on the patient's medical history and a face-to-face examination by a medical provider, either in person or via telemedicine; an HSAT is a medical assessment that must be ordered by a medical provider to diagnose OSA or evaluate treatment efficacy; an HSAT should not be used for general screening of asymptomatic populations; diagnosis, assessment of treatment efficacy, and treatment decisions must not be based solely on automatically scored HSAT data, which could lead to sub-optimal care that jeopardizes patient health and safety; and the raw data from the HSAT device must be reviewed and interpreted by a physician who is either board-certified in sleep medicine or overseen by a board-certified sleep medicine physician.

### Description and validation of the apnea risk evaluation system: a novel method to diagnose sleep apnea-hypopnea in the home [^111VtyfB]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate the accuracy and practicality of the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES; Advanced Brain Monitoring; Carlsbad, CA), a limited-channel system for diagnosing sleep apnea/hypopnea in the home.

Design

Prospective randomized study with blinded analysis.

Settings

Two independent, community-based, sleep-disorders centers and the participants' homes.

Participants

Two hundred ninety-nine subjects were recruited, including 210 consecutive willing patients referred by community physicians to the centers because of suspected sleep apnea; 36 "general medical" patients recruited from community physicians' offices; and 53 "presumably healthy" subjects recruited from community centers.

Measurements and Results

Manual scoring of attended in-laboratory full-night or split-night polysomnography by trained technologists supervised by physicians board certified in sleep medicine, and automated scoring of the limited-channel system used attended in the laboratory and unattended at home. The definition of the polysomnography apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the ARES respiratory disturbance index was the total number of events divided by the study duration in hours. Two hundred eighty-four valid comparisons of in-laboratory simultaneous polysomnography and ARES and 187 valid comparisons of in-laboratory polysomnography with a separate 2 nights of unattended self-applied ARES Unicorder (Advanced Brain Monitoring) were obtained. A diagnostic AHI cutoff of > 10 was used to establish the accuracy and validity of the ARES. The concurrent in-laboratory comparison yielded a sensitivity of 97.4, a specificity of 85.6, a positive predictive value of 93.6, and a negative predictive value of 93.9; in-home comparison sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 91.5, 85.7, 91.5, and 85.7, respectively.

Conclusions

The ARES demonstrated consistently high sensitivity and specificity for both in-laboratory and in-home recordings. In patients at risk for sleep apnea who do not a priori need an attended study, the ARES could provide a low-cost alternative to traditional polysomnography.

### Alternative algorithms and devices in sleep apnoea diagnosis: what we know and what we expect [^1155mUUT]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover outcome studies have shown, that counting apnoea and hypopnoea events, and summarizing them to an apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) is not enough to predict mortality. In addition, a few treatment studies have shown, that a simple reduction of the AHI may not improve mortality. Consequently the development of alternative devices and algorithms tries to derive new metrics which might better predict severity of sleep apnoea and may help to phenotype patients to choose a personalized treatment. Hypoxia and the hypoxic burden are important parameters related to sleep apnoea severity. Derived metrics are the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and time metrics like time with oxygen saturation below 90% and more similar parameters. Definitely, ODI alone is not an appropriate replacement for AHI. Currently we are thinking to combine different information, such as AHI, ODI, respiratory event duration, sleep fragmentation, symptoms, and cardiovascular/metabolic comorbidity. But this combination is still under discussion and outcome studies are needed for achieving conclusive results. This approach requires further discussion and leads to the idea of 'reinventing polysomnography' and more specifically, the polysomnography (PSG) reporting. However, this is a long-term goal because mortality and morbidity data need to be collected.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112J4Mu5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

HSAT data handling and scoring — The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events includes scoring criteria for HSAT data and confirms that HSAT devices have the ability to display raw tracings in detail for review, manual scoring or editing of events; however, the limitations of current automatic scoring algorithms restrict their diagnostic accuracy, and these algorithms are not set up to detect other abnormal findings (eg, hypoventilation) that may be indicative of underlying pulmonary disease, therefore, it is essential for the raw HSAT data to be reviewed and interpreted by a physician who is either board-certified in sleep medicine or overseen by a board-certified sleep medicine physician.

### Defining common outcome metrics used in obstructive sleep apnea [^116uQJvQ]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing a spectrum that ranges from snoring through disorder of increased airway resistance, to overt sleep apnea affects many clinical disease outcomes. Traditionally, disease outcomes have been measured by polysomnography, with the most common metric being the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Multiple other clinical metrics are commonly used to assess the severity and impact of disease on important outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). These allow assessment of sleepiness, quality of life, performance, and medical, especially cardiovascular outcomes. Currently the available metrics only partially explain the associated disease outcomes in different patients. This review highlights the available clinical, physiological and biomarker metrics in measuring OSA and associated co-morbidities and defines treatment goals.

Objectives

Intermittent hypoxemia is a risk factor for developing complications in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. The objective of this systematic review was to identify articles evaluating the accuracy of the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) as compared with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and then provide possible values to use as a cutoff for diagnosing adult OSA.

Study Design

Systematic Review of Literature.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS databases were searched through November 2019.

Results

Eight studies (1,924 patients) met criteria (age range: 28–70.9years, body mass index range: 21.9–37 kg/m², and AHI range: 0.5–62 events/hour). Five studies compared ODI and AHI simultaneously, and three had a week to months between assessments. Sensitivities ranged from 32% to 98.5%, whereas specificities ranged from 47.7% to 98%. Significant heterogeneity was present; however, for studies reporting data for a 4% ODI ≥ 15 events/hour, the specificity for diagnosing OSA ranged from 75% to 98%, and only one study reported the positive predictive value, which was 97%. Direct ODI and AHI comparisons were not made because of different hypopnea scoring, different oxygen desaturation categories, and different criteria for grading OSA severity.

Conclusion

Significant heterogeneity exists in studies comparing ODI and AHI. Based on currently published studies, consideration should be given for diagnosing adult OSA with a 4% ODI of ≥ 15 events/hour and for recommending further evaluation for diagnosing OSA with a 4% ODI ≥ 10 events/hour. Screening with oximetry may be indicated for the detection of OSA in select patients. Further study is needed before a definitive recommendation can be made. Laryngoscope, 131:440–447, 2021.

### Clinical use of a home sleep apnea test: an updated American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^112TNpAw]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position — It is the position of the AASM that only a medical provider can diagnose medical conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and primary snoring, the need for, and appropriateness of, a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) must be based on the patient's medical history and a face-to-face examination by a medical provider, either in person or via telemedicine, an HSAT is a medical assessment that must be ordered by a physician for the diagnosis of OSA in select adult patients, an HSAT should not be used for general screening of asymptomatic clinical populations, diagnosis, assessment of treatment efficacy, and treatment decisions must not be based solely on automatically scored HSAT data, which could lead to sub-optimal care that jeopardizes patient health and safety, and the raw data from the HSAT device must be reviewed and interpreted by a physician who is either board-certified in sleep medicine or overseen by a board-certified sleep medicine physician.

### Statistical uncertainty quantification to augment clinical decision support: a first implementation in sleep medicine [^115hkhir]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, one of the problems we encountered in our approach was the realization that assessment of sleep via PSG is far from a true "gold standard". Despite the application of a uniform scoring standard, human scorers fail to achieve identical scoring, with classification between certain stages of sleep such as wake vs. N1 particularly troublesome. Our automated scoring system also struggled with these distinctions and uncertainty was often high for these epochs. However, manual review did not uniformly improve scoring agreement with the gold standard since human review is equally fraught with uncertainty. Even big(er)-data approaches fall short of perfect agreement with gold standard criteria. For example, Sun et al.published work detailing the use of ~1000 features and a feed-forward neural network model for automated sleep staging. As a study employing a plethora of biosignals, the study still only achieved Cohen's kappa = 0.68 agreement with gold standard manual scoring. Thus, even brute-force approaches to machine learning may not accelerate the accuracy — and therefore complete reliance on — medical classifiers to perfection so quickly. As such, in the interim, use of uncertainty is one method towards augmented clinical scoring and classification. One approach has been by Younes and colleagues who have developed an automated sleep scoring system which can be used to indicate if certain sleep studies require manual editing –. However, the review rules were not fully automated in that manual review is often based on expectations for a "good" night of sleep, and raw thresholding. Such analysis may miss rare abnormalities of sleep architecture, such as narcolepsy. Future work is needed to investigate the appropriate tolerance level of uncertainty (optimal threshold for flagging/prompting manual review), and applications beyond clinical labeling such as quick screening/diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.

### More than the sum of the respiratory events: personalized medicine approaches for obstructive sleep apnea [^113hgErL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Continuous positive airway pressure is generally first-line therapy despite low adherence, because it reliably reduces the AHI when used, and the response to other therapies is variable. However, there is growing appreciation that the underlying etiology (i.e., endotype) and clinical manifestation (i.e., phenotype) of OSA in an individual are not well described by the AHI. We define and review the important progress made in understanding and measuring physiological mechanisms (or endotypes) that help define subtypes of OSA and identify the potential use of genetics to further refine disease classification. This more detailed understanding of OSA pathogenesis should influence clinical treatment decisions as well as help inform research priorities and clinical study design. In short, treatments could be individualized on the basis of the underlying cause of OSA; patients could better understand which symptoms and outcomes will respond to OSA treatment and by how much; and researchers could select populations most likely to benefit from specific treatment approaches for OSA.

### USPSTF recommendation: screening for obstructive sleep apnea in adults… [^112kE3fV]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Persons with suspected OSA are usually diagnosed using polysomnography, which combines several measurements, including an electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, chin electromyelogram, airflow monitor, oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, and electrocardiogram or heart rate. 15, 16 Additional recommended measurements include body position and leg movements. 17 The resultant AHI measured during polysomnography is representative of the frequency of events and used to describe the severity of disease or condition. This recommendation replaces the 2017 USPSTF recommendation on screening for OSA. In 2017, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults. This recommendation statement is consistent with the I statement from 2017.
21.

Seven studies assessed 1 or more clinical prediction tools or screening questionnaires compared with facility-based polysomnography: 2 studies assessed the Berlin Questionnaire, 4 studies the STOP-BANG questionnaire, and 2 studies the Multivariable Apnea Prediction tool. Study sizes ranged from 43 to 1033 participants, and studies were generally conducted in participants with underlying conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or Alzheimer disease or in persons with symptoms. 15, 16 The Berlin Questionnaire had sensitivity ranging from 37% to 80% and specificity ranging from 0% to 84% for detecting mild OSA. In the 2 studies evaluating the original STOP-BANG questionnaire, both found good sensitivity but low specificity for detecting OSA at different AHI cut points.

15, 16 Two studies assessed a modified version of the STOP-BANG questionnaire in different populations; sensitivity ranged from 61% to 100% and specificity ranged from 21% to 76% for detecting OSA at different AHI cut points. 15, 16. In the 2 studies that assessed the Multivariable Apnea Prediction tool alone and when followed by an unattended home sleep test, sensitivity ranged between 88% and 92% and specificity ranged between 44% and 76% to predict severe OSA syndrome. 15, 16 However, these studies were conducted in populations that had a high prevalence of OSA and a high risk of spectrum bias.

### Polysomnography for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing in children under 2 years of age [^111qZN5W]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Polysomnography (PSG) is the accepted standard for measuring sleep disordered breathing (SDB) including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in both adults and children. 1, 2 In children > 1 year of age undergoing in‐laboratory attended PSG, an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) > 1.5 events/hr of sleep is statistically abnormal. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, the cut‐off values that define clinically significant abnormalities, or level at which treatment is likely to alter outcome are yet to be determined. Therefore, PSG results, including but not limited to AHI, are part of the information used by clinicians to diagnose SDB and OSA. 7 PSG criteria used in research studies to define SDB and OSA vary and are based on cut‐offs applied to AHI, 8 respiratory disturbance index (RDI), 9 obstructive AHI (OAHI), 10, 11, 12, 13 or a combination of respiratory parameters on PSG. 14 Criteria used to determine SDB in infancy are less well‐reported with no accepted criteria to define an abnormal AHI in children less than 1 year of age. In fact, infants < 1 year of age are recognized to have unique issues with respect to SDB such that this group is excluded from practice guidelines. 2, 15

There are several reasons why applying the same criteria for an abnormal AHI in children to infants may not be appropriate. Prior to birth, the fetus does not rely on breathing for gas exchange and, therefore, there is considerable variability of both the amplitude and frequency of fetal breathing movements. 16 After birth, variability continues to decrease such that a more stable pattern of both breathing and heart rate develops. Apnea, 17 periodic breathing, 18, 19 and oxygen desaturation 20, 21, 22, 23 during sleep are normal events in healthy infants in the first few weeks after birth. Decrease in respiratory events with increasing age reflects greater stability in the respiratory control system. 20, 23 Infants have more compliant upper airways and chest wall which increase the collapsibility of the upper airway and predisposes to paradoxical respirations. 24, 25, 26 Finally, infant arousal responses are immature with greater variability in the arousal response to stimuli such as hypoxemia and changes in upper airway resistance. 27, 28 This variability in arousal response, along with greater variability of oxygen desaturation events, is likely to impact scoring of central apneas and hypopneas and, thus, alter the normal range of AHI in younger infants.

### Clinical guidelines for the use of unattended portable monitors in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adult patients. portable monitoring task force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^116zKfaF]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Based on a review of literature and consensus, the Portable Monitoring Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) makes the following recommendations: unattended portable monitoring (PM) for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be performed only in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Clinical sleep evaluations using PM must be supervised by a practitioner with board certification in sleep medicine or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination. PM may be used as an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA. PM is not appropriate for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant comorbid medical conditions that may degrade the accuracy of PM. PM is not appropriate for the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having comorbid sleep disorders. PM is not appropriate for general screening of asymptomatic populations. PM may be indicated for the diagnosis of OSA in patients for whom in-laboratory PSG is not possible by virtue of immobility, safety, or critical illness. PM may also be indicated to monitor the response to non-CPAP treatments for sleep apnea. At a minimum, PM must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation. The airflow, effort, and oximetric biosensors conventionally used for in-laboratory PSG should be used in PM. The Task Force recommends that PM testing be performed under the auspices of an AASM-accredited comprehensive sleep medicine program with written policies and procedures. An experienced sleep technologist/technician must apply the sensors or directly educate patients in sensor application. The PM device must allow for display of raw data with the capability of manual scoring or editing of automated scoring by a qualified sleep technician/technologist. A board certified sleep specialist, or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination, must review the raw data from PM using scoring criteria consistent with current published AASM standards. Under the conditions specified above, PM may be used for unattended studies in the patient's home. Afollow-up visit to review test results should be performed for all patients undergoing PM. Negative or technically inadequate PM tests in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA should prompt in-laboratory polysomnography.

### A new scoring system for upper airway pediatric sleep endoscopy [^114PFyyP]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Sleep-associated upper-airway obstruction in children is a significant cause of morbidity. Development of a simple, standardized, quantitative technique to assess anatomic causes of sleep-related breathing disorder is important for surgical planning, clinical communication, and research.

Objective

To design, implement, and evaluate a scoring system to quantify airway obstruction in pediatric drug-induced sleep endoscopy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was a retrospective case series conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital. The patients were children with sleep-related breathing disorder who underwent polysomnography and drug-induced sleep endoscopy.

Interventions

Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy was performed. Endoscopic examinations were recorded on video and assessed by 4 independent raters based on a scoring template.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Five locations in the upper aerodigestive tract (adenoid, velum, lateral pharyngeal wall, tongue base, and supraglottis) were evaluated on a 4-point scale for minimum and maximum obstruction. Internal reliability was assessed by calculating interrater and intrarater intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). For external validation, aggregate and site-specific scores were correlated with preoperative polysomnographic indices.

Results

Videos recorded of sleep endoscopies from 23 children (mean age, 2.2 years) were reviewed and rated. Children had an average apnea-hypopnea index of 24.8. Seventy percent of interrater and intrarater ICC values (7 of 10 for each set) were above 0.6, demonstrating substantial agreement. Higher total obstructive scores were associated with lower oxygen saturation nadir (P = 0.04). The scoring system was also used to quantitatively identify children with multilevel airway obstruction, who were found to have significantly worse polysomnographic indices compared with children with single-level obstruction (P = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

The proposed scoring system, which is designed to be easy to use and allow for subjectivity in evaluating obstruction at multiple levels, nonetheless achieves good internal reliability and external validity. Implementing this system will allow for standardization of reporting for sleep endoscopy outcomes, as well as aid the practicing clinician in the interpretation of sleep endoscopy findings to inform site-directed surgical intervention in cases of complicated obstructive sleep apnea.

### Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^112ZLwZG]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with adverse health outcomes.

Objective

To review the evidence on screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults or those with unrecognized OSA symptoms to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and trial registries through August 23, 2021; surveillance through September 23, 2022.

Study Selection

English-language studies of screening test accuracy, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening or treatment of OSA reporting health outcomes or harms, and systematic reviews of treatment reporting changes in blood pressure and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) scores.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality. Meta-analysis of intervention trials.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Test accuracy, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-related and general health-related quality of life (QOL), and harms.

Results

Eighty-six studies were included (N = 11 051). No study directly compared screening with no screening. Screening accuracy of the Multivariable Apnea Prediction score followed by unattended home sleep testing for detecting severe OSA syndrome (AHI ≥ 30 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score > 10) measured as the area under the curve in 2 studies (n = 702) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90). Five studies assessing the accuracy of other screening tools were heterogeneous and results were inconsistent. Compared with inactive control, positive airway pressure was associated with a significant improvement in ESS score from baseline (pooled mean difference, -2.33 [95% CI, -2.75 to -1.90]; 47 trials; n = 7024), sleep-related QOL (standardized mean difference, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.42]; 17 trials; n = 3083), and general health-related QOL measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) mental health component summary score change (pooled mean difference, 2.20 [95% CI, 0.95 to 3.44]; 15 trials; n = 2345) and SF-36 physical health component summary score change (pooled mean difference, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.29 to 2.77]; 13 trials; n = 2031). Use of mandibular advancement devices was also associated with a significantly larger ESS score change compared with controls (pooled mean difference, -1.67 [95% CI, 2.09 to -1.25]; 10 trials; n = 1540). Reporting of other health outcomes was sparse; no included trial found significant benefit associated with treatment on mortality, cardiovascular events, or motor vehicle crashes. In 3 systematic reviews, positive airway pressure was significantly associated with reduced blood pressure; however, the difference was relatively small (2–3 mm Hg).

Conclusions and Relevance

The accuracy and clinical utility of OSA screening tools that could be used in primary care settings were uncertain. Positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices reduced ESS score. Trials of positive airway pressure found modest improvement in sleep-related and general health-related QOL but have not established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other health outcomes.

### Can screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea predict postoperative complications? A systematic review of the literature [^113sYxuy]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common, underdiagnosed condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the perioperative setting. Increasing evidence suggests that the utility of preoperative screening tools may go beyond identification of OSA, to the prediction of perioperative complications. The primary objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on all studies assessing whether high risk scores on the STOP-Bang questionnaire, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) checklist, and the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) are associated with higher rates of postoperative complications.

Methods

A systematic review of English language records was performed using Medline, EMBASE, and PsychInfo with additional studies identified by manual search through reference lists. Only studies that evaluated the ability of the STOP-Bang, the BQ, and ASA checklist to predict postoperative complications in adults were included.

Results

Twelve studies were included in the final review. Eight studies looked at STOP-Bang, 3 at the Berlin Questionnaire, and 2 at the ASA Checklist. Significant differences across study characteristics prevented a meta-analysis and the studies were evaluated qualitatively.

Conclusions

The ASA checklist, Berlin Questionnaire, and STOP-Bang questionnaire may be able to risk stratify patients for perioperative and postoperative complications. Further research is required, with a particular focus on specific surgery types and adjustment of potentially confounding factors in the analysis.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI) diagnostic criteria and severity thresholds are specified as follows: an OSA diagnosis is defined by ≥ 15 events/h (with or without OSA symptoms) or ≥ 5 events/h with OSA symptoms; severity of OSA classified according to AHI is defined as mild if 5–14 events/h, moderate if 15–30 events/h, and severe if ≥ 30 events/h. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire in which patients rate their chances of dozing in various situations, and the arousal index is the frequency of arousals per hour of sleep measured by electroencephalography.

### An official ATS / AASM / ACCP / ERS workshop report: research priorities in ambulatory management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea [^111vgrgE]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ambulatory diagnosis — patient selection and role of portable monitors are outlined with emphasis on Type 3 devices and follow-up testing. In most current clinical applications, Type 3 portable monitors are used for unattended home recordings to diagnose OSA, and It is recommended that those patients with a negative Type 3 recording have an in-laboratory PSG to exclude the possibility of a false negative study. Limiting portable monitor testing to patients with a high-likelihood of OSA would minimize the number of negative studies and the need for in-laboratory PSG, and clinical prediction rules such as the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index, Sleep Apnea Clinical Score, and Berlin Questionnaire have been used for this purpose but have not been adequately tested in clinical management pathways. Very few published studies have assessed specific populations including diverse ethnic groups, the elderly, and individuals with cardio-respiratory and neurological diseases, and persons with COPD, asthma, heart failure, and neuromuscular disorders have a higher risk of developing sleep-related hypoventilation and central sleep apnea, highlighting the need for targeted research in these groups.

Respiratory event scoring

Variable definitions of "hypopnea" are of particular concern for endotype estimates. Metrics validated in cohort studies in which any period of significant airflow reduction was considered a hypopnea (i.e. regardless of desaturation or arousal), might produce different results when used under a more stringent definition. For example, Landry and colleagues demonstrated that a hypopnea definition requiring at least 4% desaturation weakened the potential value of PUP-estimated LG in predicting treatment response to upper airway surgery. This issue is not limited to computationally advanced sleep study–based endotypes. For example, F hypopneas is also clearly dependent on hypopnea scoring. Derivation and external validation studies of any candidate endotype should therefore report the specific hypopnea definition used as well as the potential effects of variable hypopnea definitions.

An approach used in several large cohort studies (e.g. the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, the Sleep Heart Health Study, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men) would be helpful to test an endotype under different hypopnea definitions: all discrete periods of sufficient airflow reduction are marked as candidate hypopneas. These candidate hypopneas can then be tagged as "true" hypopneas depending on the degree of accompanying desaturation and/or arousal, allowing efficient investigation under different definitions. The extent to which central versus obstructive hypopneas influence key metrics, which are not well differentiated with current clinical diagnostic tools, also requires investigation.

Arousal scoring

Computationally advanced endotypes that rely on arousal scoring depend not only on the presence of a scored arousal but also on accurate identification of start and end times of each arousal, a degree of accuracy beyond current routine clinical practice. Even point-of-care endotype surrogates that do not require such a degree of precision may still be affected by variable arousal scoring. The fraction of respiratory events terminating in arousal is a point-of-care surrogate used to infer a low ArTH. This is likely to be largely robust to event type and precise timing but may suffer from marked interindividual heterogeneity or arousal scoring differences.

Body position

Physiologic mechanisms are affected by changes in body position, including the head and neck. Small studies have examined the effects of body position on some endotypes, but assessing these effects at scale is complicated by the lack of a consistent coding scheme (i.e. for supine, left, right, prone, and upright) and a paucity of head and neck position data due to a lack of clinically feasible monitoring technology.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ambulatory surgery — background, prior guideline elements, and purpose are summarized as follows: Prior ASA guidelines "recommended preoperative assessment for presence of OSA and proposed a checklist consisting of 12 items as a routine screening tool", and "the guidelines proposed a scoring system based upon the severity of OSA, the invasiveness of the surgery, the type of anesthetic technique, and the need for postoperative opioids", although "This scoring system has not yet been validated", and "the guidelines recommended that upper abdominal procedures and airway procedures are not suitable for ambulatory setting". Since then, "several studies have been published that provide validated screening tools for OSA surgical patients that identify patients who are likely to develop postoperative complications", leading to "a systematic review of published literature evaluating the perioperative complications in OSA patients undergoing ambulatory surgery", after which "it was determined that the ASA guidelines were outdated and required updating". The consensus statement's aim is explicit: "to provide guidance for the appropriate selection of OSA patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery, with the aim of reducing perioperative complications", and its scope notes that "other sleep disorders were not evaluated" and "intraoperative and postoperative care in OSA patients was not evaluated".

Portable monitors (types II, III, and IV) and central sleep apnea considerations — Portable monitors types II, III, and IV can be used to diagnose OSA, but the measured AHI can differ substantially from PSG; low-quality evidence showed that type II monitors may identify AHI scores suggestive of OSA, and current evidence supports greater diagnostic accuracy with type III monitors than type IV monitors, with type II, III, and IV monitors showing a wide range of difference in AHI estimates compared with PSG. A significant limitation of type IV monitors is that they cannot differentiate obstructive from central apneas; patients with cardiac, respiratory, or neurologic disease may be at the greatest risk for central sleep apnea, and the text states that it "does not recommend the use of portable monitors for diagnosis in these patients".

### Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in adults: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^113QmLAM]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Many adverse health outcomes are associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Objective

To review primary care-relevant evidence on screening adults for OSA, test accuracy, and treatment of OSA, to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Results

A total of 110 studies were included (N = 46 188). No RCTs compared screening with no screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of the multivariable apnea prediction score followed by home portable monitor testing for detecting severe OSA syndrome (AHI ≥ 30 and ESS score > 10) was AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but the studies oversampled high-risk participants and those with OSA and OSA syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated screening tools to report calibration or clinical utility for improving health outcomes. Meta-analysis found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with sham was significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), excessive sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 trials, 2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% CI, -3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 participants). CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life (Cohen d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 participants). Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs were also associated with reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse effects of CPAP and MADs included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, among others. In cohort studies, there was a consistent association between AHI and all-cause mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce AHI, ESS scores, and blood pressure. Trials of CPAP and other treatments have not established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other health outcomes, except for modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life.

Screening and diagnostic tests — There are several screening questionnaires and clinical prediction tools that attempt to identify persons at higher risk of OSA, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the STOP questionnaire, but none have been adequately validated in general populations enrolled from primary care settings; persons with suspected OSA are usually diagnosed using polysomnography, the resultant apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used to describe severity, and additional recommended measurements include body position and leg movements.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^114Sfyde]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Testing with portable monitors (PM) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be performed only with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and supervision by a practitioner with board certification in sleep medicine or an individual meeting eligibility criteria (Consensus). At a minimum, a PM should record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation, using biosensors recommended for in-laboratory PSG (oronasal thermal sensor for apneas, nasal pressure transducer for hypopneas, oximetry, and ideally calibrated or uncalibrated inductance plethysmography) (Consensus), with trained personnel available for sensor application or patient instruction (Consensus). PMs may be used unattended as an alternative to PSG in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA and without comorbid sleep or major medical disorders when these parameters are met (Consensus). Diagnosis and severity should use the same criteria as PSG with scoring consistent with AASM standards (Consensus). RDI for PMs is defined differently — RDI PM is the number of apneas + hypopneas / total recording time rather than total sleep time — and PMs are likely to underestimate severity compared to AHI by PSG; due to false negatives, in-laboratory PSG should be performed when PM is technically inadequate or fails to establish the diagnosis in high pretest probability cases (Consensus).

### Alternative scoring models of STOP-bang questionnaire improve specificity to detect undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea [^114ytNRj]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among surgical patients. The STOP-Bang questionnaire is a validated screening tool with a high sensitivity. However, its moderate specificity may yield fairly high false positive rate. We hypothesized that the specific combinations of predicting factors in the STOP-Bang questionnaire would improve its specificity.

Methods

After research ethics approval, consented patients were asked to complete the STOP-Bang questionnaire and then underwent sleep studies. The predictive performance of the STOP-Bang alternative scoring models was evaluated. Five hundred sixteen patients with complete data on the STOP-Bang questionnaire and polysomnography were reported.

Results

When the STOP-Bang score was ≥ 3 (any 3 positive items), the sensitivity and specificity for identifying moderate-severe OSA was 87% and 31%, respectively. The specificity for any 2 positive items from the 4 STOP questions plus BMI > 35 kg/m², male gender, or neck circumference > 40 cm for identifying moderate-severe OSA was 85%, 77%, and 79%, respectively. Compared with STOP-Bang score ≥ 3, the predicted probability for severe OSA of the specific combinations of STOP score ≥ 2 + male and STOP score ≥ 2 + BMI increased by 36% and 42%, respectively. For severe OSA, the specific combination of STOP score ≥ 2 + BMI + male demonstrated a specificity of 97% and 86% increase in predicted probability versus any 4 positive items of STOP-Bang questionnaire.

Conclusions

The specific constellations of predictive factors improved the specificity of STOP-Bang questionnaire. For patients with STOP score ≥ 2, male gender, and BMI > 35 kg/m² were more predictive than age ≥ 50 and neck circumference > 40 cm.

1. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS OF OSA

1.1. Question: Does a Diagnosis of OSA Change Postoperative Outcomes?

Recommendation 1.1.1: Patients With a Diagnosis of OSA Should Be Considered to Be at Increased Risk for Perioperative Complications (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)

The notion that OSA negatively affects postoperative outcomes is held widely among perioperative physicians; however, prospective, controlled studies with sufficient power to support this assumption are rare, and randomization may not be feasible. In recent years, 2 independent meta-analyses have evaluated studies comparing outcomes in patients with and without a diagnosis of OSA and concluded that such a diagnosis is associated with increased risk for postoperative complications. Cardiopulmonary adverse events were increased by 2- to 3-fold. Nevertheless, these analyses used fairly strict inclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 13 and 17 studies only, respectively. Additional literature available on the topic was not considered in these meta-analyses, including recent analyses generated from data collected in large national databases on millions of patients. –, Although the accuracy of studies that use International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding to identify patients with OSA in Canada has been recently criticized, the point of the critique might not be applicable to other databases, and separate validation would be necessary to verify sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, potential deficiencies of coding systems in OSA identification would label a mixture of OSA and non-OSA patients with the diagnosis of OSA, and potential misclassification would bias results to the null. Considering the fact that patients with an ICD-9 code of OSA are likely to have the disease, and many who remain undiagnosed are included in the control group as is likely the case in database studies, the associations found in these analyses could actually underestimate the true effects.

Question 2: What Screening Method Is Indicated to Timely Detect OSAS?

General Diagnostics of OSAS History

Informing after symptoms related to OSAS is of essential value:Troubled sleep, snoring, apneas, skin discoloration, bedwetting, perspiration; and in the daytime: as an expression of hypoxemia, respectively, and a restless sleep pattern, with both periods of arousal and also periods of deep sleep: dry mouth when waking up in the morning, fatigue, impaired cognitive functioning, poor school performance and behavioral disorders.

Brouillettedeveloped a scoring system based on the following nightly symptoms:

The OSAS score is calculated with the following formula: 1.42 a + 1.41 b + 0.71 c – 3.83

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is considered to be present at a score > 3.5. At the time of this writing this is the only scoring system applied in children suspected of OSAS.

Parental observation of video images of the child's breathing pattern during sleep could help making the diagnosis.

Bannink, in a study in a large group of children with syndromic craniosynostosis, showed that a negative answer to the question 'breathing problems during sleep?' may be sufficient to exclude moderate or severe OSAS.

Polysomnography — diagnostic criteria, split-night use, and severity thresholds for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) state that the frequency of obstructive events is reported as an apnea + hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI). Full-night PSG is recommended for diagnosis, with a split-night study as an alternative; a split-night study may be performed if an AHI ≥ 40/hr is documented during 2 hours of a diagnostic study and may be considered for an AHI of 20–40/hr based on clinical judgment. In patients with a strong suspicion of OSA after excluding other causes, a second diagnostic overnight PSG may be necessary. The diagnosis of OSA is confirmed on PSG if obstructive events are greater than 15 events/hr or greater than 5/hr with symptom reports as listed, and OSA severity is defined as mild for RDI ≥ 5 and < 15, moderate for RDI ≥ 15 and ≤ 30, and severe for RDI > 30/hr (Consensus).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^113juego]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — definitions, diagnostic approach with home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) versus polysomnogram (PSG), and severity thresholds are detailed as follows: Apneas do not require desaturation or arousal to be scored. Hypopnea is a 30% or greater decrease in airflow that is at least 10 seconds in duration and is associated with either a ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation or arousal. Traditionally, the diagnosis of OSA was made by an attended overnight in-lab polysomnogram (PSG); however, home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) that focuses solely on diagnosing SDB is increasingly used. Current guidelines are that HSAT is appropriate to diagnose uncomplicated patients that have an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA, and a non-diagnostic and/or negative HSAT for OSA is unable to rule out OSA and further testing is recommended, preferably a PSG, though HSAT can be repeated if clinically appropriate. According to the ICSD-3 TR, OSA can be diagnosed when a patient has at least a minimum number of respiratory events per hour during sleep (or, in the case of HSAT, per hour of recording), and event indices categorize severity as: Mild OSA defined as ≥ 5 to < 15 events per hour with the presence of symptoms; moderate OSA defined as ≥ 15 to < 30 events per hour; and severe OSA defined as ≥ 30 events per hour. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory event index (REI) are not the sole indicators of OSA severity because this parameter does not account for oxygen desaturation frequency or oxygen saturation nadir, the duration of the respiratory event, sleep fragmentation, or comorbid illnesses.

Respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) during PAP titration — adult definition and pediatric scoring features are described. In adults, "a respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA) in adults is defined as a sequence of breaths lasting at least 10 sec characterized by increasing respiratory effort or flattening of the nasal pressure waveform leading to an arousal from sleep when the sequence of breaths does not meet criteria for an apnea or hypopnea". For pediatrics, scoring "requires a discernible fall in the amplitude of the signal from the sensor; a duration of at least 2 breath cycles; accompanying snoring, noisy breathing, elevation in the end-tidal CO2, transcutaneous CO2, or visual evidence of increased work of breathing; and termination by an arousal". The document adds, "The contour of inspiratory flow tracing from a PAP system can be used to infer the presence of elevated upper airway resistance and flow limitation", and this contour "appears to be the simplest variable that best correlates with the lowest esophageal pressure during PAP titration".

### Ventilatory burden: development of a new approach to better quantify obstructive sleep apnea severity and its impacts [^117Dvage]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutral and inconsistent findings for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment trials across a range of outcomes have motivated recent efforts to better define OSA severity. Strategies have included novel in-home technology to quantify the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) over multiple nights to reduce the high rates of disease misclassification associated with current single-night diagnostic approaches. Techniques to identify different OSA endophenotypes to help increase success rates with existing therapies and develop new therapies that target specific pathophysiological causes have also been developed. In addition, new markers of OSA severity based on specific pathophysiological consequences of OSA have been established. Examples include hypoxic burden to capture both the frequency and severity of OSA-related hypoxia and electroencephalogram-based markers to better quantify OSA-related sleep disruption such as arousal burden, odds ratio product, and quantitative measures of sleep depth and pattern. These physiology-based markers of sleep and breathing disruption better predict important health outcomes such as sleepiness, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality than traditional polysomnography metrics such as the AHI.

### Weighted epworth sleepiness scale predicted the apnea-hypopnea index better [^113G24oi]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is uncertain and even poor. The major problem associated with the ESS might be a lack of consideration of weight in prediction in clinical practice. Would awarding different item-scores to the four scales of ESS items to develop a weighted ESS scoring system improve the accuracy of the AHI prediction? It is warranted to explore the intriguing hypotheses.

Methods

Seven hundred fifty-six adult patients with suspicion of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) were prospectively recruited to a derivation cohort. This was tested against a prospective validation cohort of 810 adult patients with suspected OSAS. Each ESS item's increased odds ratio for the corresponding AHI was calculated using univariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic curves were created and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated to illustrate and compare the accuracy of the indices.

Results

The higher the ESS item-score, the closer the relationship with the corresponding AHI. The odds ratios decreased as a result of the increased AHI. The ESS items were of unequal weight in predicting the corresponding AHI and a weighted ESS was developed. The coincidence rates with the corresponding AHI, body mass indices, and neck circumferences rose as the scores increased, whereas nocturnal nadir oxygen saturations decreased, and the weighted ESS was more strongly associated with these indices, compared with the ESS. The capability in predicting the patients without OSAS or with severe OSAS was strong, especially the latter, and the weighted ESS orchestrated manifest improvement in screening the patients with simple snoring. The patterns of sensitivities, specificities, and Youden's indices of the four ranks of weighted ESS for predicting the corresponding AHI were better than those of the ESS, and the AUCs of weighted ESS were greater than the corresponding areas of ESS in the two cohorts.

Conclusions

The weighted ESS orchestrated significant improvement in predicting the AHI, indicating that the capability in predicting the patients without OSAS or with severe OSAS was strong, which might have implications for clinical triage decisions to prioritize patients for polysomnography.

Overall, these validation studies reported a relatively wide range of sensitivities and specificities that varied to some extent with severity of OSA. In addition, using oximetry alone is not adequate for the identification of OSA in otherwise healthy children, and combining oximetry with a clinical score only identified approximately half of the children with OSA.

Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), demographic, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) characteristics across the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and Centers for Medicare and Medicare (CMS) scoring rules in moderate to severe TBI undergoing inpatient neurorehabilitation.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis from a prospective clinical trial of sleep apnea at 6 TBI Model System study sites (n = 248). Scoring was completed by a centralized center using both the AASM and CMS criteria for OSA. Hospitalization and injury characteristics were abstracted from the medical record, and demographics were obtained by interview by trained research assistants using TBI Model System standard procedures.

Results

OSA was prevalent using the AASM (66%) and CMS (41.5%) criteria with moderate to strong agreement (weighted κ = 0.64; 95% confidence interval = 0.58–0.70). Significant differences were observed for participants meeting AASM and CMS criteria (concordant group) compared with those meeting criteria for AASM but not CMS (discordant group). At an apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 events/h, the discordant group (n = 61) had lower Emergency Department Glasgow Coma Scale Scores consistent with greater injury severity (median, 5 vs 13; P = 0.0050), younger age (median, 38 vs 58; P < .0001), and lower body mass index (median, 22.1 vs 24.8; P = 0.0007) compared with the concordant group (n = 103). At an apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15 events/h, female sex but no other differences were noted, possibly because of the smaller sample size.

Conclusions

The underestimation of sleep apnea using CMS criteria is consistent with prior literature; however, this is the first study to report the impact of the criteria in persons with moderate to severe TBI during a critical stage of neural recovery. Management of comorbidities in TBI has become an increasing focus for optimizing TBI outcomes. Given the chronic morbidity after moderate to severe TBI, the impact of CMS policy for OSA diagnosis for persons with chronic disability and young age are considerable.

### Development and validation of a morphologic obstructive sleep apnea prediction score: the DES-OSA score [^113fzuHu]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underdiagnosed entity that favors perioperative morbidity. Several anatomical characteristics predispose to OSA. We developed a new clinical score that would detect OSA based on the patient's morphologic characteristics only.

Methods

Patients (n = 149) scheduled for an overnight polysomnography were included. Their morphologic metrics were compared, and combinations of them were tested for their ability to predict at least mild, moderate-to-severe, or severe OSA, as defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5, > 15, or > 30 events/h. This ability was calculated using Cohen κ coefficient and prediction probability.

Results

The score with best prediction abilities (DES-OSA score) considered 5 variables: Mallampati score, distance between the thyroid and the chin, body mass index, neck circumference, and sex. Those variables were weighted by 1, 2, or 3 points. DES-OSA score > 5, 6, and 7 were associated with increased probability of an AHI > 5, > 15, or > 30 events/h, respectively, and those thresholds had the best Cohen κ coefficient, sensitivities, and specificities. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve was 0.832 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.762–0.902), 0.805 (95% CI, 0.734–0.876), and 0.834 (95% CI, 0.757–0.911) for DES-OSA at predicting an AHI > 5, > 15, and > 30 events/h, respectively. With the aforementioned thresholds, corresponding sensitivities (95% CI) were 82.7% (74.5–88.7), 77.1% (66.9–84.9), and 75% (61.0–85.1), and specificities (95% CI) were 72.4% (54.0–85.4), 73.2% (60.3–83.1), and 76.9% (67.2–84.4). Validation of DES-OSA performance in an independent sample yielded highly similar results.

Conclusions

DES-OSA is a simple score for detecting OSA patients. Its originality relies on its morphologic nature. Derived from a European population, it may prove useful in a preoperative setting, but it has still to be compared with other screening tools in a general surgical population and in other ethnic groups.

Monitoring arousals and hypoventilation in pediatric HSATs — Another requirement for the scoring of pediatric hypopneas is having an arousal, rather than just a 3% oxygen desaturation, which requires EEG monitoring; the pediatric respiratory rules also recommend monitoring hypoventilation in children during a diagnostic study, which requires CO2 monitoring. An ideal HSAT would capture all of these parameters, but only 2 of the studies described included EEG monitoring and none included CO2 monitoring for scoring hypoventilation. In general, the devices used to perform an HSAT do not include EEG or end-tidal or transcutaneous CO2 monitoring and are therefore unable to score arousals or monitor hypoventilation, and the lack of EEG and CO2 monitoring may result in significantly underestimating the presence and severity of disease in children and in differing diagnoses and clinical management strategies compared with PSG.

### Obstructive sleep apnea devices for out-of-center (OOC) testing: technology evaluation [^111jrGzX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Guidance is needed to help clinicians decide which out-of-center (OOC) testing devices are appropriate for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A new classification system that details the type of signals measured by these devices is presented. This proposed system categorizes OOC devices based on measurements of Sleep, Cardiovascular, Oximetry, Position, Effort, and Respiratory (SCOPER) parameters. Criteria for evaluating the devices are also presented, which were generated from chosen pre-test and post-test probabilities. These criteria state that in patients with a high pretest probability of having OSA, the OOC testing device has a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 5 or greater coinciding with an in-lab-polysomnography (PSG)-generated apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, and an adequate sensitivity (at least 0.825). Since oximetry is a mandatory signal for scoring AHI using PSG, devices that do not incorporate oximetry were excluded. English peer-reviewed literature on FDA-approved devices utilizing more than 1 signal was reviewed according to the above criteria for 6 questions. These questions specifically addressed the adequacy of different respiratory and effort sensors and combinations thereof to diagnose OSA. In summary, the literature is currently inadequate to state with confidence that a thermistor alone without any effort sensor is adequate to diagnose OSA; if a thermal sensing device is used as the only measure of respiration, 2 effort belts are required as part of the montage and piezoelectric belts are acceptable in this context; nasal pressure can be an adequate measurement of respiration with no effort measure with the caveat that this may be device specific; nasal pressure may be used in combination with either 2 piezoelectric or respiratory inductance plethysmographic (RIP) belts (but not 1 piezoelectric belt); and there is insufficient evidence to state that both nasal pressure and thermistor are required to adequately diagnose OSA. With respect to alternative devices for diagnosing OSA, the data indicate that peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) devices are adequate for the proposed use; the device based on cardiac signals shows promise, but more study is required as it has not been tested in the home setting; for the device based on end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), it appears to be adequate for a hospital population; and for devices utilizing acoustic signals, the data are insufficient to determine whether the use of acoustic signals with other signals as a substitute for airflow is adequate to diagnose OSA. Standardized research is needed on OOC devices that report LR+ at the appropriate AHI (≥ 5) and scored according to the recommended definitions, while using appropriate research reporting and methodology to minimize bias.

### Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^112jo8js]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) requires the combined assessment of relevant clinical features and the objective demonstration of abnormal breathing during sleep, and current evidence indicates that attempts to base the diagnosis of the clinical syndrome on either aspect alone are unreliable. The present review discusses the clinical assessment of patients with suspected OSAS and also the potential added value of structured questionnaires and clinical prediction models that seek to improve the diagnostic value of clinical assessment from the formalized evaluation of selected clinical features. While the traditional "gold standard" for objective assessment is laboratory-based polysomnography, there is growing evidence that limited sleep studies focused on respiratory and cardiac variables are adequate in most cases, and are particularly suited to home-based assessment. The choice between home versus sleep laboratory studies should be decided by taking into account resource limitations and the clinical index of suspicion for OSAS. At present, patients with either a low or high clinical index of suspicion for OSAS appear most suited to home-based investigation, whereas those with intermediate levels of clinical suspicion, or who present with atypical clinical features, may best be assessed by full polysomnographic studies in the first instance.

### Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a clinical practice guideline from theAmerican College of Physicians [^113Pso2S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — diagnostic testing indications and questionnaire limitations states ACP recommends a sleep study for individuals with unexplained daytime sleepiness (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence) and ACP recommends polysomnography for diagnostic testing in patients suspected of obstructive sleep apnea, with portable sleep monitors for patients without serious comorbidities as an alternative when polysomnography is not available (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Sleepiness questionnaires, such as the ESS, help assess symptom severity but cannot assess the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to replace a sleep study in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea, and common clinical symptoms include unintentional sleep episodes during wakefulness, daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, insomnia, and snoring.

Mild obstructive sleep apnea in adults — definition and severity criteria used for this statement followed the 1999 Chicago apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) scheme, with a working definition for mild OSA including AHI, oxygen desaturation index (ODI), or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ranging from 5/h to less than 15/h, irrespective of hypopnea definition parameters.

Key Points for Practice
- The shorter STOP tool for evaluating OSA is easier to administer than the STOP-BANG criteria but equally sensitive.
- PAP is the most effective OSA treatment, although mandibular advancement devices are easier for patients to use.
- The Insomnia Severity Index and Athens Insomnia Scale are useful to grade insomnia before and after treatment. Diagnosis of OSA Testing for sleep apnea should be considered based on clinical risk. The STOP and STOP-BANG criteria had the highest sensitivities for OSA screening, but using the shorter STOP tool is recommended because it is easier to administer. People with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, congestive heart failure, or long-term opioid use are considered high risk regardless of STOP score, although the evidence behind this recommendation is weak. In-laboratory polysomnography is the standard for diagnosing OSA.

The diagnosis can also be made using home sleep apnea testing, with an unattended portable monitor. The home sleep apnea test can report the respiratory disturbance index, respiratory event index, or apnea-hypopnea index; 15 or more events per hour on any one index indicates OSA. Patients with a high risk of OSA and negative home sleep apnea test results should receive repeat testing, with home sleep apnea testing or polysomnography. Less than the recommended four hours per night of PAP use is still beneficial. Mandibular advancement devices are appropriate for mild to moderate OSA and improve adherence. Although PAP is better at reducing apneic and hypopneic episodes, use of a mandibular advancement device results in similar improvement in daytime sleepiness, cognitive function, vigilance, hypertension, and quality of life. Assessment of Chronic Insomnia Disorder Consider medical, substance-related, and psychiatric causes before diagnosing chronic insomnia disorder.

Because of the variable symptoms of insomnia, using the Insomnia Severity Index or Athens Insomnia Scale may help grade symptom severity and monitor treatment effects. It is not necessary to repeat diagnostic testing when standard treatment is ineffective. Guideline source: U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Evidence rating system used.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to initial sleep study, AASM 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain either polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing as the first-line investigation for patients with suspected OSA, in the absence of conditions that warrant using polysomnography as a first-line test.

2.3. Question: What Is the Clinical Value of Performing Additional Preoperative Tests?

Recommendation 2.3.1: There Is Insufficient Evidence to Support Canceling or Delaying Surgery to Perform More Advanced Screening Techniques or Sleep Testing to Diagnose OSA in Those Patients Identified as Being at High Risk of OSA Preoperatively, Unless There Is Evidence of an Associated Significant or Uncontrolled Systemic Disease or Additional Problems With Ventilation or Gas Exchange (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)

Because screening instruments perform better in patients with greater OSA severity, screen-positive patients with greater threshold values should be assumed to have moderate-to-severe OSA in the absence of diagnostic polysomnography. The inclusion of preoperative serum bicarbonate level may improve the predictive accuracy of the screening instrument. Although AHI is the most commonly used metric of OSA severity, other parameters such as oxygen desaturation index, or cumulated duration of oxygen desaturation < 90% may improve prediction of postoperative complications. Further research in this area will help to better define which patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA are at most risk of postoperative complications.

Table 7.
Summary of Recommendations for Screening to Identify Patients With Suspected OSA

The aforementioned recommendation does not relate to procedures in which polysomnography is performed as part of the accepted preoperative management, usually because of a high prevalence of OSA (eg, bariatric surgery, tonsillectomy, or upper airway surgery for OSA). Summaries of the different recommendations for screening of surgical patients for OSA are listed in Table 7.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115KLsEd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnostic testing — repeat polysomnography (PSG) after a negative PSG: We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and there is still clinical suspicion for OSA, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). Evidence on apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) night-to-night variability shows a meta-analysis of four studies found a mean difference of 0.14 (95% CI: −0.86 to 2.15), which was not statistically or clinically significant, yet subsets crossed diagnostic/treatment thresholds: using an AHI cutoff of ≥ 5, 9.9% to 25% had an AHI ≤ 5 on the first PSG but an AHI ≥ 5 only on the second; with an AHI cutoff of ≥ 15 or 20, 7.6% and 25% crossed this threshold only on the second, and severity classification changed in 26% to 35% across the two nights. The quality of evidence for night-to-night variability was high; however, the TF downgraded the overall quality of evidence supporting this recommendation to very low. Based on clinical judgment, the TF determined that the benefits of a second PSG outweigh the harms, though the certainty that the benefits outweigh the harms is low, and that the majority of well-informed symptomatic patients would choose a second PSG when the initial PSG is negative.
