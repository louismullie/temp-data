## Question

What is the safe daily correction rate for hyponatremia to prevent complications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the safe daily correction rate for hyponatremia is to prevent complications, especially osmotic demyelination syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary complication we are trying to avoid (ODS) and why rapid correction causes it. Then, I should distinguish acute versus chronic hyponatremia because targets differ. Next, I will risk‑stratify patients for ODS and lay out correction limits by risk category, including European versus US/Irish guidance. After that, I should verify recommendations for initial rapid correction in severe symptomatic cases and the minimum daily targets. Then, I will review practical safeguards: lab imprecision, monitoring cadence, aquaresis, and how to rescue overcorrection with desmopressin and relowering. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, consensus recommendation and briefly consider special populations where I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize, especially pediatrics and peri‑transplant settings.

> Let me first confirm the complication we must prevent. The key danger of overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia is osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), a consequence of osmotic stress after the brain has adapted to hypotonicity; clinical sequelae can be catastrophic and often irreversible, so our correction limits are designed around minimizing this risk [^113E6Kdx] [^116JUkNn].

> I need to check the acute versus chronic distinction. In acute hyponatremia (< 48 hours), the brain has not fully adapted, so a modestly faster initial rise can be lifesaving for cerebral edema; in chronic or unknown‑duration hyponatremia, adaptation has occurred and ODS risk is highest, mandating conservative daily limits and close monitoring [^114zXmxm] [^113E6Kdx].

> Next, I should review ODS risk stratification to guide how strict we must be. High‑risk features include initial sodium ≤ 105 mEq/L, alcohol use disorder, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, and advanced liver disease; patients without these have "normal" or standard risk, but if chronic and ≤ 120 mEq/L we still cap daily change to avoid ODS; these buckets come from US/Irish expert consensus and align with European guidance in spirit, though the numerical caps vary slightly [^116JUkNn] [^113E6Kdx].

> Now, I will lay out safe correction limits by risk category. Hold on, I should verify the exact numbers. For high‑risk patients, do not exceed 8 mEq/L in any 24 hours, with a minimum daily goal of 4–6 mEq/L to avoid undertreatment; for standard‑risk chronic hyponatremia, stay within 10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours and ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours, with a 4–8 mEq/L minimum; European guidelines are slightly more conservative: ≤ 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours, then ≤ 8 mmol/L for each subsequent 24 hours [^116JUkNn] [^116VvNY1] [^114mqwBU].

> But wait, what if the patient has seizures or impending herniation? For severe symptomatic hyponatremia, initial rapid correction with 3% saline boluses to raise sodium by about 4–6 mEq/L over a few hours is appropriate to control life‑threatening cerebral edema; critically, that initial rise does not change the 24‑hour limits, which still apply once symptoms improve and you transition to slow correction [^113SHKnQ] [^114zXmxm].

> I should confirm minimum daily targets to avoid prolonged untreated hypotonicity. Many expert sources recommend aiming for at least 4–6 (up to 8) mEq/L per 24 hours depending on risk, which balances symptom improvement and safety; setting a conservative goal well below the absolute cap reduces the chance of overshooting [^116JUkNn] [^113pumUb].

> Next, I should review practical safeguards because overcorrection often results from physiology rather than the intended dose. Hold on, I should verify the major driver — yes, sudden aquaresis (water diuresis) after vasopressin effect wanes is the usual culprit and can increase Na by > 2 mEq/L per hour; therefore, during active correction of severe hyponatremia (Na ≤ 120), check serum sodium frequently (every few hours) and closely monitor urine output. Also, because of analytical imprecision, a reported +8 mEq/L could truly be +10; plan targets a couple of mEq/L below the hard limits [^113SHKnQ] [^115yzmgu].

> I will now examine what to do if we are correcting too fast. European guidance recommends relowering or halting the rise if Na increases by > 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours or > 8 mmol/L in any subsequent 24‑hour period; desmopressin (DDAVP) can proactively or reactively stop aquaresis, and hypotonic fluid (e.g. D5W) can be used to re‑lower sodium when appropriate. Let me double‑check: evidence is observational but consistent, and ICU series show DDAVP effectively brakes the rise and reduces variability; use is especially compelling in high‑risk ODS patients [^116VvNY1] [^117SmC1L] [^111NtJp7].

> Synthesis time — what is the consensus safe daily correction rate to prevent complications? For chronic or unknown‑duration hyponatremia without major ODS risk factors: ≤ 10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours and ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours, aiming for 4–8 mEq/L/day; for high‑risk patients: ≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, aiming for 4–6 mEq/L/day; for severe symptoms, an initial 4–6 mEq/L rise with 3% saline is appropriate, but total 24‑hour and 48‑hour limits still apply. I should emphasize again that conservative targets are prudent given lab imprecision and the severe consequences of ODS [^114mqwBU] [^116JUkNn] [^113SHKnQ].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. Children are often cited with a 0.5 mmol/L/h correction rule — but wait, let me verify: that rate pertains to hypernatremia reduction and cannot be directly imported to hyponatremia correction; for pediatric hyponatremia, we generally extrapolate adult ODS‑prevention limits and use the same caution with close monitoring. In uremia, theoretical partial protection exists due to urea kinetics, but this is not a license to exceed limits. Liver transplant candidates with severe pre‑LT hyponatremia are at particular ODS risk intra‑ and post‑operatively; multidisciplinary planning to cap intraoperative ΔNa is essential [^115Apu7H] [^111PHu5d] [^117725jU].

To correct hyponatremia safely and avoid complications, **limit sodium correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours** for high-risk patients (chronic hyponatremia, alcoholism, malnutrition, advanced liver disease, severe hypokalemia) [^114mqwBU] and **≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 hours** for low-risk patients [^116JUkNn]. For severe symptoms, administer **100 mL boluses of 3% saline** [^113SHKnQ] to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly [^116JUkNn], then slow correction to stay within daily limits. Monitor sodium every **2–4 hours initially** [^113SHKnQ], and use **desmopressin** to prevent or halt overcorrection [^111NtJp7] [^117SmC1L]; if limits are exceeded, relower sodium with D5W [^116VvNY1] [^1169HNqy]. These measures minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination while treating hyponatremia [^111hiyrd].

## Recommended correction rates

Recommended correction rates vary by **patient risk and clinical context**:

| **Patient risk category** | **Recommended correction rate** |
|-|-|
| High-risk patients (chronic hyponatremia, alcoholism, malnutrition, advanced liver disease, severe hypokalemia) | ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours [^114mqwBU] [^116JUkNn] |
| Low-risk patients (acute hyponatremia, no significant risk factors) | ≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 hours [^114mqwBU] [^116JUkNn] |
| Maximum correction limit (all patients) | ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours [^114mqwBU] [^116JUkNn] |

## Clinical approach to correction

### Initial assessment

Initial assessment **determines chronicity** (acute < 48 hours vs chronic > 48 hours) [^114mqwBU], evaluates symptom severity (e.g. seizures or coma), and identifies the underlying etiology (e.g. SIADH, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, or medication-induced) [^113E6Kdx].

---

### Acute symptomatic hyponatremia

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, **immediate correction** consists of 100 mL boluses of 3% hypertonic saline [^113SHKnQ] to raise serum sodium by 4–6 mmol/L, repeated as needed until symptoms improve [^116JUkNn]. Subsequent correction should be **slowed after initial stabilization** to remain within the recommended daily limits.

---

### Chronic hyponatremia

In chronic hyponatremia, **slow correction** means gradually correcting within recommended limits to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^113E6Kdx], and **monitoring** should include frequent serum sodium measurements (every 2–4 hours initially) [^114zXmxm].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Frequent monitoring**: Serum sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable [^113SHKnQ].
- **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**: Administer proactively or reactively to prevent or halt overcorrection [^111NtJp7].
- **Relowering sodium**: If overcorrection occurs, administer hypotonic fluids (e.g. D5W) and/or desmopressin to safely reduce serum sodium [^115yzmgu] [^116VvNY1].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- **Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)**: Rapid correction (> 8 mmol/L/day) significantly increases the risk of ODS [^116JUkNn], a potentially irreversible neurologic complication [^114mqwBU].
- **Mortality**: Rapid correction is associated with increased mortality, particularly in high-risk patients [^114mqwBU].
- **Neurologic sequelae**: Rapid correction can cause seizures, dysarthria, dysphagia, and permanent neurologic deficits [^113LDB46] [^114mqwBU].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **High-risk patients**: ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours.
- **Low-risk patients**: ≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 hours.
- **Maximum correction**: ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.
- **Immediate correction**: 100 mL 3% saline boluses for severe symptoms.
- **Monitoring**: Frequent serum sodium measurements.
- **Desmopressin**: Use to prevent or halt overcorrection.
- **Relowering**: Use hypotonic fluids if overcorrection occurs.

Correcting hyponatremia requires **careful adherence to recommended correction rates**, frequent monitoring, and judicious use of desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome [^114bTxzD].

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114mqwBU]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, specifically concerning severely symptomatic patients, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend limiting sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. For patients without risk factors, sodium correction should be limited to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1169HNqy]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of < 135 mEq/L, is a water balance disorder, characterized by a relative excess of body water in relation to sodium. Some reports have classified SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L as "profound" hyponatremia. Since profound hyponatremia is associated with fatal complications such as brain herniation, appropriate treatments for hyponatremia have been intensely discussed worldwide. For example, urgent therapy using hypertonic saline is justified in life-threatening conditions caused by hyponatremia complicated with seizures and coma.

In contrast, the problem of overcorrection makes the treatment of hyponatremia challenging because it can provoke osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), a dreaded neurologic complication associated with high mortality. Therefore, international guidelines recommend limiting the increase of SNa to within 10 mEq/L and 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively, from the initiation of treatment for hyponatremia. To achieve the ideal correction rate of hyponatremia, several strategies have been introduced, including the administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), 3% hypertonic saline in combination with DDAVP, and re-lowering the SNa with 5% dextrose in water (D5W).

However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk factors for overcorrection, especially in "chronic" profound hyponatremia, which carries a greater risk of neurologic complications from overcorrection, even though several risk factors for ODS have been identified, such as SNa ≤ 105 mEq/L at presentation and overcorrection itself.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel, which included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (referred to as the "US/Irish expert panel"), reached similar conclusions, but with some added nuance.

For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L, such as outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or those treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours, who are at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended:

- **Correction limits**: 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period, with a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L.

- **Heightened risk considerations**: For patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L who are at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination (such as those with sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease), the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L.

The panel noted that for patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was more than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm.

### Desmopressin to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia: A systematic review [^117SmC1L]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia; however, these recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of four databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed, and study quality was appraised.

- **Results**: The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found three strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia:
	1. Proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration.
	2. Reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output.
	3. Rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent.

A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with a lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series.

- **Conclusions**: Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions from being drawn.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^115vvueJ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Six days after the development of hypernatremia, several symptoms became evident, including dysarthria, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis. Due to these symptoms, we suspected osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) associated with acute hypernatremia. Consistent with our clinical suspicion, a brain MRI revealed a symmetric, high-intensity signal in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting central pontine myelinolysis (CPM).

Soon after this diagnostic confirmation of CPM, we initiated two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange sessions over two days. A total of 4394 mL of plasma was exchanged with albumin 5%, crystalloids, and fresh frozen plasma. The day following the plasma exchange, the patient regained speech and became oriented. Her neurological symptoms, which included dysarthria, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis, markedly improved, although mild diplopia was present.

### A rare presentation of central pontine myelinolysis secondary to hyperglycaemia [^1132bsrK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a demyelinating disorder caused by the loss of myelin in the center of the basis pontis; this disorder presents clinically with quadriparesis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, psychosis, seizures, and altered mental status. CPM was initially described in patients with malnutrition or alcoholism and typically occurred after rapid correction of severe and chronic hyponatremia. Other pathogenetic conditions, including prolonged diuretic use, burns, and liver transplantation, have also been recognized as risk factors for the development of CPM. While hyperglycaemia is a potential cause of the disturbance in serum osmolality, CPM rarely occurs secondary to the management of diabetes mellitus, especially in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Although there is no effective treatment for CPM, recent results suggest that early diagnosis and improved intensive care treatment are closely associated with improved outcomes. In the present case report, the patient developed CPM following uncontrolled hyperglycaemia in the absence of sodium abnormalities; he responded well to glucose control, recovering completely.

### Minocycline prevents osmotic demyelination associated with aquaresis [^113zy8Hs]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Minocycline protects against ODS associated with overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia with hypertonic saline infusion in rats. In clinical practice, inadvertent rapid correction frequently occurs due to water diuresis, when vasopressin action suddenly ceases.

In addition, vasopressin receptor antagonists have been applied to treat hyponatremia. The susceptibility to and pathology of ODS were evaluated using rat models developed to represent rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia in the clinical setting. The protective effect of minocycline against ODS was assessed. Chronic hyponatremia was rapidly corrected by administering either 1 mg/kg (T1) or 10 mg/kg (T10) of tolvaptan, removing desmopressin infusion pumps (RP), or administering hypertonic saline.

The severity of neurological impairment in the T1 group was significantly milder than in other groups, and brain hemorrhage was found only in the T10 and desmopressin infusion removal groups. Minocycline inhibited demyelination in the T1 group. Further, immunohistochemistry showed a loss of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes before demyelination developed. Interestingly, serum AQP4 levels were associated with neurological impairments.

Thus, minocycline can prevent ODS caused by overly rapid correction of hyponatremia due to water diuresis associated with vasopressin action suppression. Increased serum AQP4 levels may be a predictive marker for ODS.

### Disorders of sodium [^113Bapty]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain are whether the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on the severity of symptoms, with the most rapid treatment occurring only in severely symptomatic cases. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion to prevent these devastating outcomes.

### Does uremia protect against the demyelination associated with correction of hyponatremia during hemodialysis? A case report and literature review [^111PHu5d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia is known to cause demyelination syndromes, attributed to the rapid shift of water out of the brain. In uremic patients with hyponatremia, depending on the dialysate sodium concentration and delivered Kt/V, serum sodium levels may be rapidly corrected inadvertently during the hemodialysis (HD) session. It is not known whether uremic patients are as susceptible to the development of demyelination as patients with normal renal function. Since urea diffuses slowly across the blood-brain barrier, it can act as an effective osmole between plasma and the brain if levels are changed abruptly.

During HD, blood urea levels drop suddenly and significantly, and cerebral edema may develop (dialysis disequilibrium syndrome). This effect may counteract the fluid shift out of the brain during the correction of hyponatremia. Therefore, theoretically, uremic patients may be less prone to develop demyelination. We present a patient with renal failure whose hyponatremia was corrected rapidly during HD to illustrate the potential problem. The patient tolerated rapid correction of hyponatremia without sustaining any neurologic damage. We performed a literature search looking for similar case reports and reviewed the scientific evidence behind the above hypothesis.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^114EHymy]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to classification, SE 2018 guidelines recommend classifying hypernatremia according to the serum sodium level:

- **Mild**: 146–149 mmol/L
- **Moderate**: 150–159 mmol/L
- **Severe**: > 160 mmol/L

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. When hyponatremia is called acute severe, lasting 4 to 6 days, there is typically no brain edema, and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate of less than 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to determine whether severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed.

The modalities of treatment for severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline combined with fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency in inducing sustained water diuresis and in the correction of hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

- **Administration of desmopressin**: A synthetic antidiuretic hormone, desmopressin, either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis, has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction.

- **Case for relowering serum sodium**: The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours.

	- **Patients with rapid hyponatremia**: On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal. This is because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome…

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147wBVW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia, we conducted a search on MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Comparative studies were selected to assess rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs. slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Pairs of reviewers independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11,811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22).

### Complications and management of hyponatremia [^113LDB46]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia causes significant morbidity, mortality, and disability. This review considers the literature of the past 18 months to improve the understanding of these complications and to identify therapeutic strategies to prevent them.

- **Recent findings**: Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4–6 mEq/L increase in serum sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination, correction should not exceed 8 mEq/L per day. In high-risk patients, correction should not exceed 4–6 mEq/L per day. Inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures; however, it is not known if the correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

- **Summary**: Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111GVLSX]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) 2023 guidelines recommend considering the correction of hypernatremia in adult patients at a rate of no more than 12 mEq/L over 24 hours. It is advised to avoid increasing serum sodium further for therapeutic purposes if the recommended correction rate is exceeded.

### Benign type of central pontine myelinolysis in alcoholism — clinical, neuroradiological and electrophysiological findings [^117EhecA]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Nine alcoholic patients with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), who showed a favorable prognosis, are reported. The majority of these patients had engaged in binge drinking and subsequently experienced consciousness disturbances for a mean of 18.1 ± 10.9 days. Notably, none of the patients underwent acute correction of hyponatremia.

Truncal ataxia and gait instability were observed in most patients following recovery from their consciousness disturbances. Most of the patients eventually regained independence. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that their pontine lesions tended to shrink over time.

Electrophysiological studies showed prolonged latency between the I and III waves in auditory brainstem responses, as well as between the N11 and P13/14 onsets in somatosensory evoked potentials. These clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological findings are valuable for the diagnosis of CPM.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1163shSW]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Incidence of overcorrection and ODS**: The incidence of overcorrection varies depending on its definition and mode of correction. A retrospective study involving 412 patients with serum sodium (SNa) levels of 10 mEq/L during the first 24 hours reported that 114 (27.9%) patients were overcorrected. However, the study did not detail the treatment strategies for hyponatremia. Another retrospective study including 62 patients found that 7 (11.3%) patients exceeded an increase in SNa by > 12 mEq/L, and 6 (9.7%) patients by > 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Treatment involved the administration of 3% hypertonic saline, D5W, and DDAVP, used in patients where overcorrection was likely or had occurred. The incidence of overcorrection in our study was consistent with previous observations, where we identified that 9 (16.0%) patients had an increase in SNa by > 10 mEq/L and 6 (10.7%) by > 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively.

	- The international guidelines define overcorrection with a safety margin. We speculated that no osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) occurred mainly because the increase in SNa was relatively limited in the present study. Even among patients with overcorrection, SNa increased by 12 mEq/L (quartile, 11–15 mEq/L) and 19 mEq/L (quartile, 17–23 mEq/L) during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Similarly, in a previous retrospective study where four of 37 patients (11%) with overcorrection developed ODS, the increases in SNa were 21 ± 5 mEq/L and 28 ± 8 mEq/L.

### SPL drug information for tolvaptan [^112WcES9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Year not provided). High credibility.

Boxed warning regarding the use of tolvaptan PO (also known as Samsca, Jynarque) and osmotic demyelination syndrome: it is critical to maintain a high level of suspicion, as too rapid correction of hyponatremia (> 12 mEq/L in 24 hours) can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Initiate and re-initiate tolvaptan only in a setting where serum sodium can be monitored closely.

### Urea minimizes brain complications following rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia compared with vasopressin antagonist or hypertonic saline [^114Tiy9y]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder that carries significant morbidity and mortality. However, severe chronic hyponatremia should not be corrected rapidly to avoid brain demyelination. Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans) are now being widely used for the treatment of hyponatremia along with other alternatives like hypertonic saline. Previous reports have suggested that, in some cases, urea can also be used to correct hyponatremia. Correction of severe hyponatremia with urea has never been compared to treatment with a vaptan or hypertonic saline with regard to the risk of brain complications in the event of a too rapid rise in serum sodium. Here, we compared the neurological outcome of hyponatremic rats corrected rapidly with urea, lixivaptan, and hypertonic saline.

Despite a similar increase in serum sodium obtained by the three drugs, treatment with lixivaptan or hypertonic saline resulted in a higher mortality than treatment with urea. Histological analysis showed that treatment with urea resulted in less pathological change of experimental osmotic demyelination than was induced by hypertonic saline or lixivaptan. This included breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, microglial activation, astrocyte demise, and demyelination. Thus, overcorrection of hyponatremia with urea resulted in significantly lower mortality and neurological impairment than the overcorrection caused by lixivaptan or hypertonic saline.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline and is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one reason for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with anorexia nervosa [^111tbnfU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Myelinolysis may occur as a severe complication of eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa (AN). One significant reason for this could be the rapid correction of hyponatremia caused by tubulopathy, water intoxication (WI), or the abuse of diuretics in individuals with AN.

- **Method and results**: We report on a 24-year-old female patient with an 8-year history of AN. A rapid correction of severe hyponatremia and hypokalemia induced by WI led to central pontine myelinolysis, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Besides affective lability, incoherence, and an acute confusional state, surprisingly, no severe neurological symptoms emerged.

- **Conclusion**: Thus, physicians should be aware of the risk of pontine myelinolysis with new psychiatric symptoms emerging in the absence of obvious neurological deficits.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^116VvNY1]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, specifically management of overly rapid correction, the 2014 ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM guidelines recommend prompt intervention to re-lower the serum sodium concentration if it increases by more than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours or more than 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period thereafter.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines. These guidelines recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia.

- **Established practice**: Recently, this practice has been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. Based on the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction. The authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration.

We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how the guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^112ZhxLW]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to the patient's hypotension and altered mental status, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. She required mechanical ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen due to lethargy, somnolence, and respiratory failure (PCO 2 45.3 mmHg). She was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and an oral potassium chloride tablet via nasogastric tube.

In addition to ventilatory support, she also required treatment for her severe acidemia with sodium bicarbonate. Her desired bicarbonate level was 24 mEq, and her bicarbonate deficit was calculated to be 365 mEq using the formula: bicarbonate deficit = (0.5 × lean body weight) × (24 - serum bicarbonate). Her lean body weight was calculated to be 44.5 kg using the formula: lean body weight [kg] = 9270 × body weight [kg] / (6680 + (216 × BMI [kg/m²])).

We treated her with an overdose of 480 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose and water solution because her mental status and severe metabolic acidosis did not improve. The next day, her potassium was corrected to normal levels (4.2 mEq/L); however, we found acute hypernatremia with her sodium levels rising from 142.8 mEq/L to 172.8 mEq/L. We began treating her with half-normal saline and 5% dextrose in water, and her serum sodium level gradually decreased from 172.8 mEq/L to 148.0 mEq/L over the course of six days. As her hypernatremia was corrected, she became more alert and her weakness was greatly improved.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^111Dqcat]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) may be observed as a result of a rapid change in serum osmolarity, such as that induced by an overly rapid correction of serum sodium levels in hyponatraemic patients.

- **Case presentation**: We describe the case of a 21-year-old woman who was hospitalized at week 10 of gestation because of severe hyperemesis. At admission, the patient appeared restless and confused, and severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium 107 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (serum potassium 1.1 mmol/L) were detected. Active and simultaneous correction of these imbalances led to an overly rapid increase of serum sodium levels (17 mmol/L in the first 24 hours). Isotonic saline solution was stopped and replaced by 5% dextrose solution infusion. However, the neurological alterations worsened, and the radiological features were consistent with the diagnosis of extra-pontine ODS. Steroids were administered intravenously with progressive improvement of biochemical and clinical abnormalities. At the time of discharge, 20 days later, the patient was able to walk and eat autonomously with only minimal external support.

- **Conclusions**: This report illustrates an unusual case of ODS, which occurred after an excessive rate of correction of hyponatraemia obtained with isotonic saline infusion. Hypokalemia and its active correction very likely played a crucial role in facilitating the onset of ODS. This interesting aspect will be explained in detail in the article. A more cautious and thoughtful correction of electrolyte alterations would have probably prevented the onset of ODS in this patient.

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^114zXmxm]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients.

With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies. ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^112qTXNC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The study's conclusion that osmotic demyelination syndrome is unrelated to the correction of hyponatremia was based on the finding that most patients with myelinolysis had been corrected by 8 mmol/L per day (and 1.5% of 390 corrected by > 12 mmol/L per day) had developed osmotic demyelination syndrome. It was possible that some cases with osmotic demyelination syndrome had been missed. The authors of the other study speculated that a possible reason could be…

### Sodium homeostasis during liver transplantation and correlation with outcomes [^113des5C]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Reports of perioperative serum sodium increase in liver transplant (LT) recipients are mostly restricted to unintentional rapid serum sodium overcorrection, which can lead to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. We examined intraoperative serum sodium changes and their effects on short-term outcomes after LT.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed data from all LT recipients over a period of 3.5 years. Collected information included preoperative and postoperative serum sodium (Napre and Napost), delta sodium (ΔNa), intraoperative serum sodium peak and trough with corresponding maximum ΔNa, intraoperative peak blood glucose, history of hepatic encephalopathy, perioperative diuretics, and intraoperative administration of vasopressin, dopaminergic agents, alkalizing drugs (sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3], tromethamine), crystalloids, colloids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and packed red blood cells (PRBC). The delta of serum osmolality (ΔOsm) was calculated from Napre and Napost, blood urea nitrogen, and blood glucose values, and the correlation between ΔNa and ΔOsm was examined. Outcomes analyzed included intubation for ≥ 2 days, postanesthesia care unit/surgical intensive care unit (PACU/SICU) length of stay (LOS) for ≥ 2 days, need for SICU admission, hospital LOS, postoperative neurological complications, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test associations between ΔNa and outcomes. A P value < 0.005 was considered significant.

- **Results**: Data from 164 patients were analyzed. Their ΔNa was 5.3 ± 4.5 (mean ± SD) mEq/L. A lower Napre was associated with various outcomes.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: Major influences and treatment implications [^117MPgeG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Maintenance of the volume of all cells, particularly those of the central nervous system, is critical for their function and survival. Tonicity (i.e. effective osmolarity) of a solution refers to its property to cause osmotic fluid shifts into or out of cells suspended in it. Direct determination of serum tonicity is not readily available for clinical applications. Serum sodium concentration ([Na] S) is the main parameter used as a surrogate value for serum tonicity. The only direct information provided by [Na] S is whether serum tonicity is normal (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with normal [Na] S is not affected), low (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with low [Na] S increases by osmotic intracellular transfer of water), or high (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with high [Na] S decreases by osmotic transfer of water out of the cells).

In a pivotal study, Edelman and coinvestigators identified total body sodium, total body potassium, and total body water as the universal determinants of [Na] S in patients with various states potentially associated with extracellular volume disturbances. Abnormalities in [Na] S usually result from changes in the external balance of one of its three determinants or a combination thereof. The relations between [Na] S and total body sodium, total body potassium, and total body water have been expressed by various formulas. The original Edelman formula expresses sodium concentration in plasma water. The Nguyen and Kurtz formula expresses sodium concentration in plasma, which is…

### Extrapontine myelinolysis resulting in transient cortical blindness [^115dWAwD]. Pediatric neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis are characterized by symmetric demyelination subsequent to rapid shifts in serum osmolality. Described here is a novel case of transient cortical blindness associated with imaging features of extrapontine myelinolysis, which occurred in a child with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency after rapid correction of hyperammonemia. Serum sodium levels were within normal limits at presentation and throughout the period of ammonia correction. A potential pathogenic mechanism of osmotic demyelination in the setting of acute treatment for hyperammonemia in a patient with a urea cycle abnormality includes disruption of the blood-brain barrier and re-equilibration of organic osmolytes, particularly glutamine.

### Outcomes in severe hyponatremia treated with and without desmopressin [^115FKVaN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of plasma sodium in severe hyponatremia is associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can prevent overcorrection of plasma sodium in hyponatremia. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes in hyponatremia according to DDAVP usage.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective observational study including all admissions to internal medicine with hyponatremia (plasma sodium concentration < 123 mEq/L) from 2004 to 2014 at two academic hospitals in Toronto, Canada. The primary outcome was safe sodium correction (≤ 12 mEq/L in any 24-hour and ≤ 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period).

- **Results**: We identified 1450 admissions with severe hyponatremia; DDAVP was administered in 254 (17.5%). Although DDAVP reduced the rate of change of plasma sodium, fewer patients in the DDAVP group achieved safe correction (174 of 251 [69.3%] vs. 970 of 1164 [83.3%]); this result was driven largely by overcorrection occurring before DDAVP administration in the rescue group. Among patients receiving DDAVP, most received it according to a reactive strategy, whereby DDAVP was given following a change in plasma sodium within correction limits (174 of 254 [68.5%]). Suspected osmotic demyelination syndrome was identified in 4 of 1450 admissions (0.28%). There was lower mortality in the DDAVP group (3.9% vs. 9.4%), although this is likely affected by confounding. Length of stay in hospital was longer in those who received DDAVP according to a proactive strategy.

- **Conclusions**: Although observational, these data support a reactive strategy for using DDAVP in patients at risk of overcorrection.

### Early MRI findings of central pontine myelinolysis following "rapid" correction of hyponatraemia during diabetic ketoacidosis: A curious pontine lesion [^117Pigw7]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a diabetic patient with hyponatraemia and ketoacidosis who developed central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) following a very rapid correction of serum sodium. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the marked shifts in osmolarity make these patients more susceptible to the development of CPM. The dramatic early MRI findings (after three weeks) should raise awareness of the risk of permanent damage to the brain associated with hydration therapy in this susceptible group. Magnetic resonance imaging might be a useful investigation at presentation and follow-up of diabetic patients with extreme metabolic derangements.

### Society for endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^113nAJEA]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for arginine vasopressin deficiency, specifically concerning treatment goals, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend correcting serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour (or until symptoms improve). The correction should be limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in symptomatic patients with acute hypernatremia, which develops within 48 hours.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^112qoopD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a condition characterized by severe vomiting resulting in dehydration, fluid electrolyte imbalance, and weight loss. We report the case of a 21-year-old woman hospitalized at week 10 of gestation due to severe hyperemesis. The condition appeared at week 4 of pregnancy and caused her weight to drop from 51 kg to 46 kg. On the day of admission to the hospital, she became restless and confused. Clinical examination performed in the emergency room revealed the presence of mild dehydration (dry mouth and skin) with normal blood pressure, increased heart rate, and slightly reduced breath frequency.

- **Biochemical assessment**: Performed at admission, it revealed severe hyponatraemia (107 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (1.1 mmol/L) with secondary metabolic alkalosis and partially compensated respiratory acidosis. Urinary data suggested the presence of extra-renal loss of Na+ and K+ with appropriate increase of urinary water and electrolyte retention.

- **Treatment and monitoring**: The patient was promptly admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital, and intravenous isotonic NaCl solution along with K-lactate supplementation was started. The electrolyte disorder was intensively monitored with blood sample evaluation performed every two hours. During the first six hours after admission, an excessive rate of correction of serum Na+ concentration ([Na+]) occurred (Δ 10 mmol/L). Hence, the isotonic solution was replaced with a hypotonic solution (5% dextrose), while K-lactate supplementation was maintained.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^115ryoA7]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) included an initial serum sodium (SNa) level of less than 105 mEq/L and overcorrection. International guidelines recommend avoiding overcorrection in the management of patients with hyponatremia; however, risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. In contrast, avoiding overcorrection or ODS may lead to prolonged or inadequate management of patients with hyponatremia, resulting in undercorrection in clinical practice.

It is essential to develop an optimal treatment strategy to assure a safe correction rate of SNa to achieve an appropriate correction while avoiding overcorrection. With this aim, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the risk factors for overcorrection and believe that our results will guide physicians in managing these patients. Our study revealed that a low level of SNa at presentation was associated with overcorrection, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.19 for every 1 mEq/L decrease (0.84 for every 1 mEq/L increase). This finding indicates that a 4 mEq/L lower SNa level doubles the risk of overcorrection.

Although several previous retrospective studies have indicated that the SNa at presentation was lower in patients with overcorrection compared to those without, a direct association between the SNa levels and the risk of overcorrection has not been evaluated previously. Our results alert clinicians to be cautious of the incremental risk of overcorrection when patients present with low SNa levels.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^113E6Kdx]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A critically important consideration in hyponatremia of chronic or unknown duration is managing the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) by avoiding excessively rapid correction of serum sodium concentration, which can damage the protective neural myelin sheath as a consequence of osmotic stress — with severe, potentially fatal, consequences. ODS was first reported in 1959, in a series of individuals presenting with rapidly evolving flaccid quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy, then death within weeks, who were found to have distinctive pontine lesions at autopsy, on a background of alcohol abuse and malnutrition. It was only in the 1980s after preclinical studies in animals demonstrated demyelination following rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia that causation was established, supported by concordant patient observations.

When hyponatremia is chronic, brain cells adapt to the reduced serum tonicity by decreasing intracellular osmolytes (e.g. electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and non-electrolyte organic osmolytes). This lowers the tonicity gradient between brain tissue and serum, reducing water influx and lessening the risk of cerebral edema. This adaptation to hyponatremia occurs in two phases. The initial phase involves rapid exit of electrolytes through volume-sensing channels occurring over minutes to hours, to avert life-threatening sequelae of cerebral edema such as seizure or brain herniation (though a degree of edema may still occur and can have severe clinical consequences). The second phase of adaptation occurs over hours to days.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^116XpGZZ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Because there are no proven effective therapies for central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), its prevention is essential. Supportive therapy should be provided to all patients who were functional prior to the onset of CPM and should continue for at least six to eight weeks before drawing conclusions about the severity of the deficits and their irreversibility.

Some animal studies have investigated the benefits of re-inducing hyponatremia in cases of rapid overcorrection of hyponatremia to avoid osmotic demyelination. Gankam Kengne et al. demonstrated that re-induction of hyponatremia by intraperitoneal administration of water 12 hours after rapid overcorrection effectively prevented the opening of the blood-brain barrier, reduced neurological manifestations, decreased microglial activation, and significantly decreased mortality in rats. In the rat experiment by Soupart et al, it was shown that after exposure to excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia, even when rats had developed myelinolysis-related neurologic symptoms, administration of hypotonic fluids could improve survival and prevent the subsequent development of brain myelinolysis.

Although there are no well-studied therapies for CPM, plasma exchange might be beneficial when CPM is associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia. For example, according to Bibl et al, three young female patients with CPM were successfully treated with extensive therapeutic plasma exchange. These patients received plasma exchange for three to seven weeks, and their neurological symptoms were improved.

### Central pontine myelinolysis associated with hypokalaemia in anorexia nervosa [^116WRZqL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of anorexia, binge eating, and self-induced vomiting. On admission, he exhibited a pronounced low weight and disturbance of body image and was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. In addition, electrolyte abnormalities were noted, primarily hypokalaemia, along with increased serum renin and aldosterone concentrations. These findings suggested pseudo-Bartter syndrome as a complication. Through frequent monitoring of serum potassium and sodium concentrations, serum electrolytes were gradually corrected. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed reversible central pontine myelinolysis (CPM).

Although primary attention has been focused on the association of CPM with rapid correction of hyponatraemia and abnormal osmolality, this case report strongly suggested the involvement of hypokalaemia in the pathogenesis of CPM.

### Correcting hypernatremia in children [^115Apu7H]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

In children with hypernatremia, clinical guidelines recommend a reduction in serum sodium of 0.5 mmol/L per hour or less to avoid complications of cerebral edema. However, no large-scale studies have been conducted in the pediatric setting to inform this recommendation. This study aimed to report the association between the rate of correction of hypernatremia, neurological outcomes, and all-cause mortality in children.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2016 to 2019 at a quaternary pediatric center in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. All children with at least one serum sodium level ≥ 150 mmol/L were identified through interrogation of the hospital's electronic medical record. Medical notes, neuroimaging reports, and electroencephalogram results were reviewed for evidence of seizures and/or cerebral edema. The peak serum sodium level was identified, and correction rates over the first 24 hours and overall were calculated. Unadjusted and multivariable analyses were used to examine the association between the rate of sodium correction and neurological complications, the requirement for neurological investigation, and death.

- **Results**: There were 402 episodes of hypernatremia among 358 children over the 3-year study period. Of these, 179 were community-acquired, and 223 developed during admission. A total of 28 patients (7%) died during admission. Mortality was higher in children with hospital-acquired hypernatremia, as was the frequency of intensive care unit admission and hospital length of stay. Rapid correction (> 0.5 mmol/L…

### Unusual case of hyponatraemia [^114aXYTq]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality, encountered in up to 30% of inpatients. Inappropriate management can have serious implications for patients, including demyelinating disease, coma, and death. We have used a case report to identify common problems and provide useful strategies for management, which can help avoid these complications. The aim was to provide a framework that clinicians can adopt to improve clinical practice and provide optimum outcomes for patients.

### Hyperglycemia-related central pontine demyelinization following a binge-eating attack in a patient with type-2 diabetes: a case report [^113q8sG4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Central pontine demyelinization, also referred to as osmotic demyelination syndrome or central pontine myelinolysis, has been reported after increases in serum osmolality due to overcorrection of hyponatremia. As a pathomechanism, an increase in serum osmolality due to a rapid correction of hyponatremia is well recognized.

In single cases, hyperglycemia leading to an increased plasma osmolality has been attributed to cause central pontine demyelinization in type-2 diabetes patients and in a type-1 diabetes patient. This complication also has been reported in a patient with latent autoimmunity diabetes displaying significant glucose fluctuations.

Here, we report a case of central pontine demyelinization in a type-2 diabetes patient with severe hyperglycemia on admission in the absence of clinically relevant hyponatremia.

Two patients in end-stage hepatic failure presented for orthotopic liver transplantation with longstanding severe hyponatremia (121 and 122 mmol/L). Both patients underwent liver transplantation with the concomitant use of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Replacement and dialysate solutions were prepared individually to contain a sodium level that was individually considered safe with regard to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. The sodium increase in both patients was within the expected and planned limits despite a situation of mass transfusion. Both patients did well postoperatively, and neither patient suffered neurological deficits.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

- **Key learning points**:

	- **What was known**: In patients with chronic hyponatremia, plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination. Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

	- **This study adds**: Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium, and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea. Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

	- **Potential impact**: In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction. Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea is generally a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago.

After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

We describe a 6-year-old girl with nephrotic syndrome who presented with symptomatic hyponatremia and developed acute quadriparesis with pseudobulbar palsy during rapid correction of the hyponatremia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral, symmetric basal ganglia lesions (extrapontine myelinolysis). The extrapontine myelinolysis was caused by the rapid correction of severe and prolonged hyponatremia with intravenous 3% sodium chloride. The child demonstrated complete neurologic recovery. Prevention of this rare condition involves recognizing patients at risk for the disorder and avoiding rapid correction of severe and prolonged hyponatremia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of extrapontine myelinolysis in a child with nephrotic syndrome.

- **Warning: Hyponatremia**: DDAVP can cause hyponatremia, which may be life-threatening if severe, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. DDAVP is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and in those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Monitoring**: Ensure that serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming DDAVP. Measure serum sodium within 7 days and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy, and periodically during treatment. More frequent monitoring of serum sodium is recommended in patients 65 years of age and older and in those at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If hyponatremia occurs, DDAVP may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning**: DDAVP can cause hyponatremia, which may be life-threatening if severe [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Ensure serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming DDAVP. Measure serum sodium within 1 week and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^116DrkQu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Our patient had also been started on steroids as treatment for possible MS flare. Steroids, especially dexamethasone, have been reported to improve the outcome of hypernatremic demyelination in rats by offering protection against osmotic-induced demyelination through preventing disruption of the blood–brain barrier. It is yet unclear whether this played a role in the reversibility of symptoms and better prognosis in our patient. A follow-up MRI is needed to evaluate the resolution of the CPM lesion.

- **Learning points**: The clinical manifestations of acute hypernatremia, including altered mental status and paresis, are similar to those of hyponatremia that are rapidly corrected. It is important to avoid overzealous fluid resuscitation; for example, in this case, it would have been prudent to change to 5% dextrose when serum sodium was 148 mEq/L. The osmotic stress, rather than the absolute value of sodium — whether high or low — seems to correlate more with the severity of symptoms. The presence of other electrolyte derangements such as hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia certainly increases the risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) lesions seem to be more common in hyponatremia, while extrapontine lesions are more common in hypernatremia, as reported by Ismail et al. They also mentioned that hypernatremic brain osmotic injury is far more common in children than in adults. Our case presents a rare occurrence of CPM in a woman who developed CPM due to acute hypernatremia and who fortunately had a good outcome.

### Samsca [^112hSp2T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Too rapid correction of serum sodium can cause serious neurologic sequelae. Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with the overly rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g. > 12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination can lead to dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma, or even death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism, or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable.

In controlled clinical trials where tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses, starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L experienced an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours, and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours, and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with Samsca therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients treated with Samsca should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for overly rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving Samsca who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment, and consider the administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours is advised.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^114Ny94U]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In terms of her hypokalemia work-up, clinical history and absence of diarrhea excluded gastrointestinal losses of potassium. Refractoriness to potassium supplementation suggested renal loss. Renal potassium wasting was confirmed by measuring 24-hour potassium excretion (125 mmol/24 hours), calculating urine anion gap of +29, potassium-to-creatine ratio of 100 mmol/g, and transtubular potassium gradient of 16, all in the setting of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and preserved renal function, leading to a diagnosis of proximal RTA. Collection of 24-hour urine potassium is often impractical; our first result was borderline elevated at 125 mmol/24 hours. In the presence of profound hypokalemia, a normal renal response would be to conserve potassium and decrease excretion to less than 25 mEq per day. Excretion of over 30 mEq per day is consistent with renal potassium wasting.

A spot urine potassium-to-creatine ratio is an acceptable estimate, and a result greater than 13 mEq/g creatine (1.5 mEq/mmol) points to inappropriate renal potassium loss. The spot urine potassium by itself has limitations in polyuria and can sometimes be misleading. For an accurate estimate, the urine sodium has to be greater than 30 mEq/L and urine osmolality greater than plasma osmolality, suggesting that the patient is not polyuric. This results in the use of potassium-to-creatine ratio to eliminate the effect of urine volume. A study by Lin et al. in 2004 showed that the urine potassium-to-creatine ratio was a reliable tool to distinguish between hypokalemic periodic paralysis and other causes.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^113pumUb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of untreated electrolyte disturbance, including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication, and the complications of excessive therapy, such as the osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Recent findings indicate that correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/L within 6 hours, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of harmful correction rates. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection. If overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial.

Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls due to impaired gait and an increased likelihood of fracture due to hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Evaluation of serum and whole blood sodium critical values [^1141AeWJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Laboratories are required to have a critical values policy as a patient safety measure. Serum sodium is commonly included in critical results lists, but a wide range of values are used. We studied all critical serum and whole blood sodium results called to clinicians during a 6-month period. Patients' electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical responses and patient outcomes. Of the 111,545 sodium results occurring during the study, 615 (0.6%) were critical. By using criteria of 120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L) or less and 155 mEq/L (155 mmol/L) or more, we found 166 critically low results and 447 critically high results. In hypernatremic and hyponatremic patients, the lengths of stay were increased above our average, and clinicians responded to more than 50% of results within 4 hours. The mortality rates of hyponatremic and hypernatremic inpatients were 19% and 48%, respectively. Disease severity, as measured by length of stay and mortality, indicated these critical limits should not be broadened.

### Brain volume regulation in response to hypo-osmolality and its correction [^111Qd3q5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia exerts most of its clinical effects on the brain. An acute onset, usually within 48 hours, makes the brain vulnerable to injury (osmotic demyelination) if the electrolyte disturbance is corrected too rapidly. The reuptake of organic osmolytes after correction of hyponatremia is slower than their loss during adaptation to hyponatremia. Areas of the brain that remain most depleted of organic osmolytes are the most severely injured by rapid correction. The brain's reuptake of myoinositol, one of the most abundant osmolytes, occurs much more rapidly in a uremic environment, and patients with uremia are less susceptible to osmotic demyelination. In an experimental model of chronic hyponatremia, exogenous administration of myoinositol speeds the brain's reuptake of the osmolyte and reduces osmotic demyelination and mortality caused by rapid correction.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^116baiLd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Inaccuracies of estimates entered in the formulas

Among these estimates, sodium concentration in serum and infusate and volume of infusate can be accurately measured, but clinical estimates of body water with adjustments for volume abnormalities are essentially inaccurate. Figure 4 shows that the predicted effect of widely varying estimates of body water on the changes in [Na] after infusion of various volumes of 0.154 mol/L saline is relatively small. After the first infusion of saline in the illustrative patient, predicted by formula 7, [Na] values differed by only 0.7 mEq/L, whereas initial body water estimates differed by 10 L; both substantially lower than the observed [Na] value (Table 3). Although variation in the estimates of body water has a small effect on the discrepancies between observed and predicted [Na], it is appropriate to use in the calculations realistic values for body water, especially in hyponatremia with pronounced hypovolemia when lower values of body water produce higher estimates of the postinfusion [Na].

Inaccuracies of predictive formulas

Formulas 2 to 7 do not take into account several factors potentially affecting [Na], including changes in body content of solutes other than sodium or potassium, in exchangeable potassium and sodium from body pools not readily available for rapid changes.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1121b7dy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

As ODS can be a devastating outcome, overcorrection should be scrupulously avoided to reduce risk. For this reason, recommended sodium correction targets often err on the conservative side for safety, particularly in those with risk factors for ODS, for whom a daily correction limit of 6 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours is endorsed by US expert opinion guidelines. It is the net 24-hour change in pNa rather than the precise hourly rate of correction that is most important.

- **Recommended plasma sodium concentration daily correction targets and limits in hyponatremia guidelines**: The management of patients who develop ODS is outside the scope of this review, but in brief, there are no established therapies. To maintain correction within the goal range, relowering of serum sodium with hypotonic fluid and/or desmopressin may be required if pNa targets are surpassed, and can still be beneficial even for those who have developed early symptoms of ODS. Case reports describe good outcomes after treatment of ODS with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, and zolpidem; however, it is unclear if improvements occurred as the result of these interventions. Glucocorticoids have been assessed in animal models of ODS and have shown reduced histological damage, but there are conflicting data with respect to mortality benefit. Nevertheless, glucocorticoid therapy after overcorrection is recommended in US expert guidelines for those with baseline pNa less than 120 mmol/L.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^116425hH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. Based on the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago.

After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: Expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. Optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including the identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^116L6Pcv]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) or extra-pontine myelinolysis, primarily occurs after the rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. The clinical manifestations of ODS are typically delayed for two to six days after swift elevations in the serum sodium level. The symptoms, which are often irreversible or only partially reversible, include dysarthria, dysphagia, tetraparesis, behavioral disturbances, lethargy, confusion, disorientation, and coma. ODS can also occur during other osmotic challenges such as the rapid correction of hypernatremia and the development of acute hypernatremia from normal sodium concentrations.

When CPM is associated with the rapid correction of hyponatremia, plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) can be a beneficial therapy. In fact, Bibl et al. reported that three young female patients with CPM, associated with the correction of hyponatremia, were successfully treated with extensive therapeutic plasma exchange. However, ours is the first case report of CPM after the rapid development of hypernatremia from sodium bicarbonate therapy to be successfully treated by plasma exchange.

### Use of desmopressin acetate in severe hyponatremia in the intensive care unit [^111NtJp7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Excessive correction of chronic and profound hyponatremia may result in central pontine myelinolysis and cause permanent brain damage. In cases of foreseeable or established hyponatremia overcorrection, slowing down the correction rate of sodium plasma levels (PNa) or reinducing mild hyponatremia may prevent this neurologic complication.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: This retrospective and observational study was performed with 20 consecutive patients admitted to two intensive care units for severe hyponatremia, defined by PNa < 120 mmol/L and/or neurologic complications ascribable to hyponatremia. These patients were subsequently treated with desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) during correction of hyponatremia when the rate of correction was overtly or predictably excessive. The primary endpoint was the effectiveness of DDAVP on PNa control.

- **Results**: DDAVP dramatically decreased the rate of PNa correction (median 0.81 mmol/L per hour [interquartile range, 0.46, 1.48] versus -0.02 mmol/L per hour [-0.16, 0.22] before and after DDAVP, respectively; P < 0.001) along with a concurrent decrease in urine output (650 ml/h [214, 1200] versus 93.5 ml/h [43, 143]; P = 0.003), and a rise in urine osmolarity (86 mmol/L [66, 180] versus 209 mmol/L [149, 318]; P = 0.002). The maximal magnitude of PNa variations was also markedly reduced after DDAVP administration (11.5 mmol/L [8.25, 14.5] versus 5 mmol/L [4, 6.75]; P < 0.001). No patient developed seizures after DDAVP or after the subsequent relowering of PNa that occurred in 11 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Desmopressin acetate is an effective treatment for controlling the rate of PNa correction in severe hyponatremia, reducing the risk of neurologic complications such as central pontine myelinolysis.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^116cMhje]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a rare neuropathology typically associated with the rapid correction of hyponatremia. The pons is especially sensitive to osmotic changes, and neurological symptoms can occur within 2–3 days. Symptoms can progress within days to include paralysis, "locked-in syndrome", and even coma and death. Thus, it is of utmost importance to prevent significant morbidity and mortality in patients predisposed to this condition, especially when disability can be permanent.

Interestingly, there has been some controversy regarding other causes and risk factors for CPM, which are not widely considered in the medical community. CPM in the setting of hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, malnutrition, hypophosphatemia, and alcoholism has been increasingly recognized, but it is seldom reported in the absence of hyponatremia. Theoretically, rapid alteration of serum osmolality, as in acute hypernatremia, can overwhelm brain adaptive mechanisms and induce osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), regardless of the specific measurement of sodium. In 2015, a case of ODS presenting with hypernatremia was published by Han et al. Overall, 50 cases have been reported in the literature, including 20 case reports and 1 case series of 30 patients. It is possible that the true incidence of CPM in the setting of all the above-mentioned predisposing factors is actually higher than previously believed.

### Extrapontine myelinolysis after correction of hyponatremia presenting as generalized tonic seizures [^113G6AwG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis are rare complications of the rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. Central pontine myelinolysis is more common and more predictable in presentation. Extrapontine myelinolysis presents with symptoms that vary and may be as general as lethargy or altered mood. We report our experience with a patient who developed only extrapontine myelinolysis after the rapid correction of severe hyponatremia associated with gastroenteritis. His presenting sign, generalized seizures, has not been previously reported. We summarize the risk factors for myelinolysis, which may be more common than previously thought, as well as steps to minimize risk while managing vulnerable patients.

### Prevention of the osmotic demyelination syndrome after liver transplantation: A multidisciplinary perspective [^117725jU]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a serious neurologic condition that occurs in the setting of rapid correction of hyponatremia. It presents with protean manifestations, from encephalopathy to the "locked-in" syndrome. ODS can complicate liver transplantation (LT), and its incidence may increase with the inclusion of serum sodium as a factor in the Mayo End-Stage Liver Disease score. A comprehensive understanding of risk factors for the development of ODS in the setting of LT, along with recommendations to mitigate the risk of ODS, are necessary.

The literature at the time of writing on ODS in the setting of LT was reviewed. Major risk factors for the development of ODS include severe pretransplant hyponatremia (serum sodium [SNa] < 125 mEq/L), the magnitude of change in SNa pre- versus posttransplant, higher positive intraoperative fluid balance, and the presence of postoperative hemorrhagic complications. Strategies to reduce the risk of ODS include correcting hyponatremia pretransplant via fluid restriction and/or ensuring an appropriate rate of increase from the preoperative SNa via close attention to fluid and electrolyte management both during and after surgery. Multidisciplinary management involving transplant hepatology, nephrology, neurology, surgery, and anesthesiology/critical care is key to performing LT safely in patients with hyponatremia.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^117936YZ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and weight loss of 8 kg over the previous two months. The patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 57 kg. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse was 110 beats/min. She was on no diuretics or other medications and did not have a medical history or diarrhea upon presentation. On admission, she exhibited weakness in both limbs (Medical Research Council Grade 2), but her deep-tendon reflexes were intact. Babinski's sign and ankle clonus were absent.

Upon initial laboratory analysis, her sodium was 142.8 mEq/L; potassium, 2.3 mEq/L; chloride, 125.5 mEq/L; calcium, 7.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 1.1 mg/dL; magnesium, 2.6 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 17.7 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; and albumin, 4.2 g/dL. Her spot urine potassium was 16.9 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 7%, suggesting renal loss. Blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.194, PCO2 of 19.5 mmHg, PO2 of 67.8 mmHg, HCO3 of 7.6 mEq/L, SpO2 of 90.2%, and a serum anion gap of 9.7, indicating normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.5 and a urine anion gap of 6.1.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^115YQeus]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

When addressing hypernatremia, especially in patients with central diabetes insipidus, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend correcting serum sodium levels at a rate of 5 mmol/L within the first hour, or until symptoms improve. For symptomatic patients with hypernatremia developed within 48 hours (acute hypernatremia), the correction should be limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours.
