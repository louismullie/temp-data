## Question

What is the plan of care for a well differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma measuring 0.6 MM on the sternum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a plan of care for a well-differentiated invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) on the sternum with a 0.6 mm depth, including risk stratification, surgical approach, pathology and margin handling, adjuvant therapy decisions, imaging/staging, and follow-up recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk classification using accepted systems and high-risk features. Then, I should determine the primary surgical approach and appropriate clinical margins. Next, I will verify histopathology reporting requirements and how to interpret margins. After that, I need to assess indications for adjuvant therapy. Then, I will consider whether any imaging or staging is warranted and verify AJCC-8 staging. Finally, I will set a pragmatic follow-up schedule and reinforce patient education, ensuring each step is anchored to guideline-grade sources.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile before jumping to management. Depth of invasion at 0.6 mm is well below thresholds commonly associated with "deep invasion" or high-risk categorization, and the histologic description as well-differentiated also lowers risk; the sternum (anterior chest) is not a high-risk anatomic site like ear, lip, or periocular areas, and there is no mention of perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, or immunosuppression, which further supports a low-risk classification; I should double-check this aligns with AAD, NCCN, and BAD framings of high-risk features, and it does, keeping this tumor in the low-risk category based on depth, differentiation, and site, with the caveat that final risk depends on complete pathology review for occult adverse features [^117TCvAJ] [^114SwfJu] [^113MybLc].

> Now, for the primary treatment, I initially wondered if Mohs might be needed, but wait, let me verify appropriateness for this site and risk profile; for low-risk invasive cSCC on the trunk, standard surgical excision with 4–6 mm clinical margins down to mid-subcutaneous fat with postoperative histologic margin assessment is recommended, so choosing a 5 mm margin is reasonable and concordant with EADO/EORTC guidance for low-risk tumors, whereas Mohs micrographic surgery is generally reserved for high-risk tumors, ill-defined margins, tissue-sparing critical sites, or recurrent disease rather than the sternum in a low-risk setting [^1129bZuB] [^113MybLc] [^111VfjuE].

> I need to ensure the pathology workflow captures all required elements and that margin interpretation is explicit. Hold on, I should verify that permanent vertical paraffin sections are preferred for accurate staging and margin assessment in this context, and yes, NCCN advises submitting the specimen for permanent vertical sections and reporting differentiation, depth in mm or tissue plane, perineural and lymphovascular invasion, and margin status; if margins are clear with adequate clearance, no further therapy is needed, but if margins are positive or truly close (for example, less than 1 mm), I should confirm next steps, which include re-excision or consideration of Mohs, with most low-risk lesions favoring re-excision rather than adjuvant radiation when additional surgery is feasible [^114sMmAU] [^1118Uexs] [^11171XJU].

> Before recommending radiotherapy, I should confirm whether any indications exist here. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; adjuvant radiation is generally reserved for adverse features such as extensive perineural invasion, large named nerve involvement, lymphovascular invasion, close or positive margins not amenable to further surgery, very thick or large tumors, desmoplastic histology, or other poor prognostic factors, none of which are described for this 0.6 mm, well-differentiated lesion; outcomes with clear surgical margins alone are excellent in low-risk disease, so no adjuvant therapy is indicated if complete excision is achieved [^11681mJY] [^112hRtSc] [^116isyMM].

> Next, I should review whether any imaging or additional staging is warranted. Wait, let me verify the guidance for low-risk, clinically node-negative cSCC; routine imaging of the draining nodal basin is not recommended without clinical suspicion, and cross-sectional imaging is generally reserved for cases with suspected deep structure invasion or high-risk scenarios, so careful clinical examination of the primary site and regional nodes suffices here; regarding pathologic staging, assuming no additional adverse features, this lesion would be staged as pT1 by AJCC-8, but I should confirm there are no size or risk factors that would upstage before finalizing that determination [^111ZEgog] [^116fzSdn] [^111H9Sn7].

> I will now examine follow-up and surveillance needs, and I should confirm frequency appropriate for low-risk tumors. The NCCN follow-up framework supports a complete skin and nodal examination every 6–12 months for the first 1–2 years and then annually thereafter, with patient education on self-skin and nodal checks and strict photoprotection; given the low recurrence risk with adequately excised low-risk cSCC, this cadence avoids over-surveillance while maintaining vigilance, though I will adjust frequency if new risk factors emerge or if the patient develops multiple primaries [^114Cm5qn] [^114TMH8S].

> Putting this together, the final plan is straightforward but I should double-check each link in the chain for consistency with guidelines: proceed with standard elliptical excision using 5 mm clinical margins to mid-subcutaneous fat with primary linear closure when feasible, submit for permanent sections with complete reporting of depth, differentiation, PNI/LVI, and margin distances, avoid adjuvant radiation in the absence of adverse features once clear margins are confirmed, forgo routine imaging in the clinically node-negative, low-risk setting, document the pathologic stage likely as pT1 if no additional high-risk findings are identified, and institute surveillance with skin and nodal exams every 6–12 months for 1–2 years then annually, coupled with patient education on sun protection and prompt reporting of new lesions [^1129bZuB] [^1118Uexs] [^11681mJY] [^111ZEgog] [^114Cm5qn].

---

For a 0.6 mm, well-differentiated invasive SCC of the sternum, the recommended plan is **standard excision with 4–6 mm margins** [^1129bZuB], with **no routine imaging or adjuvant therapy** unless high-risk features are present [^113MybLc] [^111ZEgog]. If margins are positive, **re-excision or Mohs is indicated** [^11171XJU] [^113nM7pT]; for close margins (< 1 mm), consider adjuvant radiotherapy after MDT review [^115cJCY6]. Follow-up should include skin and regional lymph node exams every 6–12 months for 2 years, then annually, along with patient education on sun protection and self-examination [^114TMH8S].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

During the **history and physical examination** [^116fzSdn], document lesion size, location, duration, growth, symptoms, and risk factors (immunosuppression, prior radiation, chronic wounds). During the **physical examination**, assess lesion characteristics, regional lymph nodes, and overall skin health [^114TMH8S].

---

### Histopathological evaluation

On **biopsy** [^1118Uexs], confirm diagnosis, differentiation, depth, perineural/lymphovascular invasion, and margin status. The **pathology report** [^117TCvAJ] should document these features and the TNM stage [^1118Uexs].

---

### Imaging studies

Routine imaging is **not indicated** [^111ZEgog] for low-risk lesions without clinical suspicion of deeper involvement or metastasis. Consider CT or MRI when there is clinical suspicion of bone involvement or deeper invasion [^116fzSdn].

---

## Surgical management

### Primary surgical excision

For **standard excision**, use 4–6 mm margins [^113MybLc] and excise to the mid-subcutaneous adipose tissue for low-risk lesions [^1129bZuB]. Mohs micrographic surgery should be considered when **margins are difficult to delineate** or **tissue conservation is important** [^111VfjuE].

---

### Margin assessment

- **Clear margins**: No further surgical intervention required [^1126qdiQ].

- **Positive margins**: Re-excision or Mohs indicated [^11171XJU] [^113nM7pT].

- **Close margins (< 1 mm)**: Consider adjuvant radiotherapy after MDT review [^115cJCY6].

---

## Adjuvant therapy

### Indications for adjuvant radiotherapy

High-risk features include **perineural invasion**, **lymphovascular invasion**, positive or close margins, or **immunosuppression** [^114TMH8S] [^114SwfJu]. Adjuvant radiotherapy is generally not indicated for **low-risk lesions** [^115oqcpM].

---

### Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is **not indicated** for low-risk, well-differentiated lesions in the absence of metastasis [^116ZZKdD].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

### Clinical follow-up schedule

- **First 2 years**: Every 6–12 months [^114TMH8S].

- **After 2 years**: Annually.

- **Examination**: Complete skin and regional lymph node exam at each visit [^114Cm5qn].

---

### Patient education

Emphasize **sun protection** [^114Cm5qn] and regular self-examination of the skin and lymph nodes. Educate patients about **signs of recurrence** and new lesions [^114TMH8S].

---

## Multidisciplinary team involvement

MDT involvement should include **dermatology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, and radiology** for comprehensive care [^117LUKFT]. MDT discussion is **essential** for cases with high-risk features or added complexity [^116z1Rjz].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** for well-differentiated SCC at 0.6 mm depth with clear margins, with low risks of recurrence and metastasis. However, the presence of **high-risk features** increases these risks, warranting closer follow-up and possible adjuvant therapy [^114TMH8S].

---

### Invasive squamous cell carcinoma: A comparison of tumors with or without horn presentation based on age, sex, anatomic site, tumor diameter, depth of invasion, and grade of differentiation in 1,666 cases [^1153PE8o]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may present clinically with or without a horn.

- **Objective**: To compare invasive SCC with or without horn presentation by anatomic site, tumor diameter, depth, and grade of differentiation.

- **Materials and methods**: The above characteristics of invasive SCC with or without horns were compared using a logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders.

- **Results**: There were 7.0% horns (n = 116) and 93.0% nonhorns (n = 1,550) in 1,666 cases. The median tumor diameter was 6 mm for horns and 8 mm for nonhorn cases, p < .001. The median depth of invasion was 0.8 mm for horn cases and 1.3 mm for nonhorns, p < .001. Most cases were well-differentiated SCC for both horns (n = 102, 87.9%) and nonhorns (n = 1,265, 81.6%) p = .07. Horn cases had a borderline significant shift to well differentiation with moderate differentiation in 11.2% of cases (n = 13) and poor differentiation in 0.9% (n = 1).

- **Conclusion**: Horns presented on invasive SCC with reduced tumor diameters and reduced invasion depths compared to nonhorns. Horns presenting on invasive SCC were usually well differentiated. However, moderate and even poor differentiation can occur within a horn base.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN 2021 guidelines specifically focus on the management of very-high-risk cutaneous SCC. These guidelines recommend offering the following treatment planning options for patients with very-high-risk cutaneous SCC, who are at significant risk of extensive local recurrence, nodal, or in-transit metastasis:

- **Radiologic staging**: MRI with and without contrast, or CT with contrast, and/or ultrasound. Evaluate abnormal lymph nodes identified by imaging studies.

- **Consider performing sentinel lymph node biopsy** in cases that are recurrent or have multiple high-risk features.

- **Consider offering neoadjuvant therapy with cemiplimab-rwlc** after multidisciplinary discussion if: the tumor has very rapid growth; there is in-transit metastasis; there is lymphovascular invasion; the tumor is borderline resectable; surgery alone may not be curative or may result in significant functional limitation.

### Surgical monotherapy versus surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy in high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: A systematic review of outcomes [^116isyMM]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) has been recommended for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with a high risk of recurrence, particularly perineurally invasive disease. The utility of ART is unknown. This study compares reported outcomes of high-risk SCC treated with surgical monotherapy (SM) with those of surgery plus ART (S + ART).

- **Methods**: The Medline database was searched for reports of high-risk SCC treated with SM or S + ART that reported outcomes of interest: local recurrence, regional or distant metastasis, or disease-specific death.

- **Results**: There were no controlled trials. Of the 2,449 cases of high-risk SCC included, 91 were treated with S + ART. Tumor stage and surgical margin status before ART were generally unreported. In 74 cases of perineural invasion (PNI), outcomes were statistically similar between SM and S + ART. In 943 high-risk SCC cases in which clear surgical margins were explicitly documented, risks of local recurrence, regional metastasis, distant metastasis, and disease-specific death were 5%, 5%, 1%, and 1%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: High cure rates are achieved in high-risk cutaneous SCC when clear surgical margins are obtained. Data are insufficient to identify high-risk features in which ART may be beneficial. In cases of PNI, the extent of nerve involvement appears to affect outcomes, with involvement of larger nerves imparting a worse prognosis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, more specifically with respect to follow-up, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining the following for regional or satellite-in-transit metastasis disease:

- **History and physical examination**: Conduct a complete skin and regional lymph node exam every 2–3 months for the first year, then every 2–4 months for the second year, every 4–6 months for the next three years, and every 6–12 months for life.

- **Consider obtaining imaging**: This is recommended if the clinical examination is insufficient for monitoring the disease or if there is an appreciable risk of subclinical local or nodal recurrence. Surveillance imaging of the regional nodal basin and evaluation for distant metastatic disease should ideally be based on multidisciplinary board recommendations or as clinically indicated.

- **Provide patient education**: Emphasize the importance of sun protection and instruct on self-examination of skin and lymph nodes.

### A new evidence-based risk stratification system for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma into low, intermediate, and high risk groups with implications for management [^112YVUis]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Most primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are cured with surgery. However, a subset may develop local and nodal metastasis that can lead to disease-specific death. This subset has been variably termed high risk. Herein, we review an emerging body of data on the risks of these outcomes and propose an evidence-based risk stratification for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk tumors that considers both tumor and patient characteristics. Finally, we discuss a framework for managing these tumors based on available data and provide our recommendations when data are sparse.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^112Q9oWn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the 2021 NCCN guidelines recommend considering a surgical procedure as PDEMA only if all of the following criteria are met:

- **The entire marginal surface of the surgical specimen**: This surface must be microscopically visualized and histopathologically analyzed for the presence of cancer. The marginal surface includes both the complete deep and peripheral margins.

- **Orientation of the surgical specimen**: The specimen should be oriented in relation to the surgical site and marked so that any positive margin identified in histopathologic analysis can be accurately located and re-excised.

- **Re-excision and visualization**: The surgical margin of any re-excised tissue must also be entirely visualized and oriented as previously described. This process should be repeated until no further cancer is identified at the surgical margin or until further excision is not anatomically possible or not in the best interest of the patient.

- **Timing between procedural steps**: The interval between the steps of this process must be rapid enough to prevent significant size or shape changes in the wound bed (such as granulation or contraction) that could decrease the accuracy of orientation.

### Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: Management of advanced and high-stage tumors [^1165vDbi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

While the majority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) can be treated surgically, treatments for high-risk cSCC remain undefined. Recent improvements in tumor staging systems have enabled more accurate stratification of tumors into high- and low-risk categories. This advancement, together with the publication of cSCC guidelines, moves us closer to developing a consensus approach.

The second article in this continuing medical education series addresses, in a question and answer format, the most common queries related to advanced and high-stage cSCCs, accompanied by a simplified flowchart.

- **High-risk cSCC identification**: Does my patient have high-risk cSCC?

- **Treatment steps with palpable lymphadenopathy**: What is the next step for patients with cSCC and palpable lymphadenopathy?

- **Lymph node staging candidacy**: In patients with no clinically evident lymphadenopathy, who are candidates for lymph node staging?

- **Radiologic imaging for subclinical metastases**: What forms of radiologic imaging can help detect subclinical lymph node metastases?

- **Sentinel lymph node biopsy role**: What is the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in cSCC?

- **Adjuvant radiation therapy need**: Which patients with cSCC need adjuvant radiation therapy?

- **Adjuvant chemotherapy option**: Is adjuvant chemotherapy an option for patients with high-stage cSCC after surgery?

- **Targeted and immunologic therapies option**: Are targeted and immunologic therapies an option for advanced cSCC?

- **Follow-up frequency**: How often should I follow up with my patient after they have been diagnosed with a high-risk cSCC?

- **Chemoprophylaxis options**: What are the options for chemoprophylaxis in a patient with an increased risk of cSCC?

- **Chemopreventive measures coordination**: What chemopreventive measures can be started in coordination with medical oncology or transplant physicians?

### Anterior transclavicular approach for lung cancer invading the superior sulcus [^116dkJmt]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

The patient was positioned supine, and an incision was made along the left sternocleidomastoid muscle extending to the upper border of the left third rib. A myocutaneous flap was elevated, and thoracotomy was performed through the second intercostal space. Palpation confirmed tumor invasion of the costosternal junction of the first rib. Sternal resection was performed in an "L-shaped" manner from the sternal notch to the second intercostal space. The third rib was also partially resected. The clavicle was cut at the point where the subclavian vein crossed it. The left internal jugular, left subclavian, and left innominate veins were transected. Subclavian artery invasion was not observed. The phrenic nerve was encased and resected. It was subsequently reconstructed using an intercostal nerve graft, although its long-term functionality is unclear as this was not monitored postoperatively. Left upper lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection were performed through the chest wall defect (Figure 1, C). The chest wall was reconstructed with a Gore-Tex patch (thickness 1 mm; W.L.

Postoperative chylothorax was treated using a conservative approach.

The patient was discharged on the 18th postoperative day. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed squamous cell carcinoma, pT4N0M0 stage 3A, with negative margins. The patient underwent adjuvant chemoradiation (4 cycles of platinum-doublet) to complete multimodality therapy.

### Systematic review of postoperative therapy for resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Executive summary of the American Radium Society appropriate use criteria [^115NCQe1]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

A "close" or microscopically positive margin is a traditional indication for PORT or chemoPORT, having been used as an eligibility criterion for multiple prospective clinical trials. There is controversy regarding the margin sufficient to omit PORT or to warrant intensification with chemoPORT. One reason for this is that margin status was defined differently in clinical trials. For example, in RTOG 9501, a "high-risk" feature was a microscopically positive margin; yet, in the EORTC study, patients were considered "high-risk" for a close margin defined as < 5 mm. A large retrospective study of SCC of the oral tongue (n = 381), of whom 25% received postoperative therapy, proposed redefining the cut-off for a close margin to ≤ 2.2 mm.

While a microscopically positive margin is a clear indication for postoperative therapy, the optimal cut-off to consider a margin "negative" (not close) is still subject to debate and may well differ for different primary sites and p16-positive (HPV-mediated) oropharynx cancers (as opposed to p16-negative).

Further uncertainty has arisen in the context of transoral surgical management of oropharynx cancer, where the superior constrictor margin is typically no more than 2 mm, representing the average thickness of the constrictor muscle. Trials such as ECOG 3311 defined a negative margin at the deep constrictor as "no tumor on ink", highlighting the importance of careful intraoperative labeling to enable pathologists to interpret the location of the margins accurately.

### Comparing the eighth and the seventh editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system and the Brigham and Women's Hospital alternative staging system for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: Implications for clinical practice [^111H9Sn7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

The new eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system (AJCC-8) incorporates changes regarding cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).

- **Objectives**: We aimed to compare the AJCC-8 staging system with the previous seventh edition of the AJCC staging system (AJCC-7) and the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) alternative staging system to identify their usefulness and the utility of their risk factors in defining prognostic groups in CSCC.

- **Methods**: A series of 186 CSCCs of the head and neck were retrospectively collected. All three staging systems were compared from the standpoint of their ability to predict poor prognosis. Binary logistic regression models were built to determine which risk factors were most relevant.

- **Results**: Poor prognosis was mainly associated with stage T2 of the AJCC-7, with stages T2b/T3 of the BWH system, and with stage T3 of the AJCC-8. The AJCC-8 and the BWH staging systems displayed overlap with each other in predicting poor prognosis, and both were superior to the AJCC-7. The new risk factors incorporated into the AJCC-8 and the poor degree of differentiation were independently associated with poor outcome.

- **Limitations**: Retrospective study and few cases with bone invasion.

- **Conclusions**: The AJCC-8 is more distinctive, monotonous, and homogeneous than the AJCC-7 and shows some overlap with the BWH system in stratification of tumors.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^1155QKsU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as outlined by the NCCN, the 2021 guidelines provide recommendations for managing patients at high risk for multiple primary cutaneous SCCs. For patients in high-risk groups with clinically low-risk tumors, the guidelines suggest considering destructive therapy options, such as curettage and electrodessication or cryotherapy. These methods allow for the treatment of multiple lesions in a single patient visit, which is particularly beneficial for those who may develop multiple lesions in short periods. It is crucial to review the pathology from the biopsy taken during curettage and electrodessication to ensure there are no high-risk pathologic features indicating the need for further therapy beyond these procedures.

### Review of high-risk features of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and discrepancies between the American Joint Committee on Cancer and NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology [^114SwfJu]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignancy that arises from epidermal keratinocytes. Although the majority of cutaneous SCC cases are easily treated without further complication, some behave more aggressively and carry a poor prognosis. These "high-risk" cutaneous SCCs commonly originate in the head and neck and have an increased tendency toward recurrence, local invasion, and distant metastasis.

Factors for high-risk cutaneous SCC include large size (> 2 cm), a deeply invasive lesion (> 2 mm), incomplete excision, high-grade/desmoplastic lesions, perineural invasion (PNI), lymphovascular invasion, immunosuppression, and high-risk anatomic locations. Both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) identify several of these high-risk features of cutaneous SCC.

The purpose of this article was to review the high-risk features included in these guidelines, as well as their notable discrepancies and omissions. We also provide a brief overview of prophylactic measures, surgical options, and adjuvant therapies for high-risk cutaneous SCC.

### Invasive squamous cell carcinoma: Comparison of differentiation grade and tumour depth by anatomical site in 1666 tumours [^1118r4kD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) present with different grades of differentiation and depths of invasion.

- **Aim**: To compare the grade of differentiation, tumour diameter, and tumour depth by anatomical site in invasive SCC.

- **Methods**: Retrospective clinical and histopathological data on consecutive cases of SCC from a clinic in Sydney, Australia, were assessed. A multinomial logistic regression model was applied to compare grades of differentiation by age, sex, anatomical sites, and histological tumour maximum diameter and depth.

- **Results**: In total, 1666 SCCs were identified, including 82.1% (n = 1367) well-differentiated, 13.3% (n = 222) moderately differentiated, and 4.6% (n = 77) poorly differentiated SCCs. Patients with poorly differentiated tumours were more likely to be older and male (both P < 0.001). The most common site for poor differentiation was the scalp in men (n = 12; 15.6%) and the cheek or chin in women (n = 7; 9.1%). In the multivariate model, compared with well-differentiated SCC, older age was significantly associated with poorly and moderately differentiated SCC (P < 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Larger tumour diameters were related to poor differentiation (P = 0.03). Ear, forehead, and chest sites had increased tumour depth and poor differentiation.

- **Conclusions**: This study found increased rates of poorly differentiated SCC on the forehead and cheek for both sexes, while men displayed increased rates of poorly differentiated SCC on the bald scalp and the ears. Tumour diameter and depth increased as tumours varied from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated forms.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining the following preliminary workup for a lesion suspicious for skin cancer:

- **History and physical examination**: Conduct a thorough review and assessment of the patient's medical history and perform a physical examination.

- **Biopsy**: If the lesion is more than superficial, a biopsy that includes the deep reticular dermis is preferred.

- **Imaging studies**: Consider imaging studies of the area of interest if there is suspicion of locally extensive or metastatic disease. Extensive disease includes deep involvement such as bone, named nerves, and deep soft tissue.
	- **MRI with and without contrast**: Obtain if disease of named nerve(s) is suspected.
	- **CT with contrast**: Obtain if bone disease is suspected, unless contraindicated. The imaging modality and targeted area should be decided at the discretion of the treating team based on the suspected extent of disease (local, regional, metastatic).

- **Histologic confirmation**: Obtain to diagnose local recurrence, but consider obtaining MRI with and without contrast to assess the extent of local disease.

- **Additional imaging modalities**: Obtain for histologic analysis and/or to confirm nodal or distant metastases and assess the extent of disease.
	- Consider obtaining MRI with and without contrast of the brain to rule out subclinical cortical involvement in cases with bone invasion.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^114Mh29u]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN, specifically concerning the management of very-high-risk cases, recommends considering offering radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy for resected high-risk regional disease of the head and neck. Adjuvant radiation therapy is advised for cutaneous SCC with gross clinical radiologic perineural invasion, multifocal histologic nerve invasion, tumors with ≥ 6 cm diameter, high risk for regional or distant metastasis, close surgical margins where further surgery cannot be performed, and desmoplastic or infiltrative tumors in patients who are chronically immunosuppressed.

### Adjuvant therapy for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: 10-year review [^116weKjX]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

The gold standard treatment for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains complete surgical excision of the primary lesion with clear margins when possible. Adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) is typically considered when certain high-risk features are seen, such as perineural invasion (PNI), lymph node (LN) metastasis, and/or extracapsular extension (ECE), the patient is otherwise at high risk for metastasis and/or recurrence, or further surgery is not an option. The addition of systemic therapy to ART is not currently recommended for most patients. Depending on the extent of the disease, ART with or without systemic therapy may be considered for treating locally advanced disease or regional LN metastasis. However, multidisciplinary consultation is recommended, and clinical trial enrollment is strongly encouraged. Given the activity of checkpoint inhibition in this disease, enthusiasm for the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in the adjuvant setting may be on the decline.

More prospective, randomized, large cohort clinical trials are needed to collect high‐quality data from which consensus guidelines can be developed to determine which patients might benefit most from a specific type of adjuvant therapy or combination of therapies. Importantly, this includes prospective studies of prognostic testing, such as gene expression profiling (GEP) testing or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), in patients with high‐risk cSCC. This additional testing would help determine which patients truly need adjuvant therapy and which patients may be managed more appropriately without it. Multidisciplinary approaches will most likely continue to be recommended in complicated cases.

### Evaluation of American Joint Committee on Cancer, International Union Against Cancer, and Brigham and Women's Hospital tumor staging for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^114Jzg31]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) tumor (T) staging systems for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and to validate BWH staging against prior data.

Primary tumors diagnosed from 2000 to 2009 at BWH (n = 1,818) were analyzed. Poor outcomes, including local recurrence (LR), nodal metastasis (NM), and disease-specific death (DSD), were analyzed by T stage concerning each staging system's distinctiveness (outcome differences between stages), homogeneity (outcome similarity within stages), and monotonicity (outcome worsening with increasing stage).

The results indicated that AJCC and UICC T3 and T4 stages were indistinct, with overlapping 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 10-year cumulative incidences of poor outcomes. However, all four BWH stages were distinct. In the AJCC and UICC systems, high-stage tumors (T3/T4) were rare, constituting 0.3% and 3% of the cohort, respectively. Most poor outcomes occurred in low-stage tumors (T1/T2), with AJCC reporting 86% (95% CI, 77% to 91%) and UICC 70% (61% to 79%), resulting in heterogeneous outcomes in these early stages.

Conversely, in BWH staging, only 5% of tumors were classified as high stage (T2b/T3), yet they accounted for 60% (95% CI, 50% to 69%) of poor outcomes, including 70% of NMs and 83% of DSDs, indicating superior homogeneity and monotonicity. Cumulative incidences of poor outcomes were low for BWH low-stage (T1/T2a) tumors, with LR at 1.4% (95% CI, 1% to 2%), NM at 0.6% (95% CI, 0% to 1%), and DSD at 0.2% (95% CI, 0% to 0.5%). In contrast, higher incidences were observed for BWH high-stage (T2b/T3) tumors, with LR and NM both at 24% (95% CI, 16% to 34%).

### Squamous cell carcinoma in situ upstaged to invasive squamous cell carcinoma: A 5-year, single institution retrospective review [^113ynSgC]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Shave biopsy may not be able to accurately distinguish squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) from invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Information on the incidence of biopsy-proven SCCIS upstaged to SCC following a more complete histologic examination is limited.

- **Objective**: To determine the incidence and clinical risk factors associated with upstaging the biopsy diagnosis of SCCIS into invasive SCC based on findings during Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).

- **Methods**: All MMS cases of SCCIS performed between March 2007 and February 2012 were identified, MMS operative notes were examined, and invasive dermal components were confirmed by the MMS slide review. Upstaged SCCIS was defined as biopsy-diagnosed SCCIS subsequently found to be an invasive SCC during MMS.

- **Results**: From 566 cases with the preoperative diagnosis of SCCIS, 92 (16.3%) cases were SCCIS upstaged to SCC. Location of ears, nose, lips, and eyelids, preoperative diameter > 10 mm, and biopsy report mentioning a transected base were significant predictors of upstaged SCCIS.

- **Conclusion**: Considering the possibility that over 16% of SCCIS may be truly invasive SCC, biopsy-proven SCCIS should be treated adequately with margin-assessed treatment modalities such as surgical excision or Mohs surgery when indicated.

### Guidelines for the excision of cutaneous squamous cell cancers in the United Kingdom: The best cut is the deepest [^117VEzgV]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical excision remains the gold standard for the management of cutaneous squamous cell cancers (SCC), and national guidelines for operative radial margins predict 95% oncological clearance with a margin of 4 mm for low-risk and 6 mm for high-risk tumors. We retrospectively analyzed all cutaneous SCC excisions performed across four regional plastic surgical units in England over a consecutive 24-month period and collected data on tumor characteristics, operative and histological margins, and completeness of excision. We identified 633 eligible SCC excisions, of which 265 (42%) were over 2 cm in diameter with 37 recurrences (5.8%). The mean radial operative margin was 6.5 mm across all tumors and 8.4 mm for tumors greater than 2 cm. The mean histological tumor diameter was 21 mm. The overall incomplete excision rate was 7.6% (7.9% for tumors > 2 cm).

Ninety-four percent (45/48) of incomplete excisions involved the deep margin, and only 3 out of 633 excisions (0.47%) were incomplete at a radial margin only. No differences were observed in tumor size or excision margin between incompletely and completely excised tumors. Incomplete excisions were most common on the ear, nose, and cheek. In summary, our analysis demonstrates that despite adherence to recommended surgical margins for cutaneous SCCs, the incomplete excision rate remains higher than expected. We believe that this is because most incomplete excisions are incomplete at the deep margin and question the utility of performing increasingly wide excisions and the generalizability of the evidence upon which recommendations are based.

### Diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck: ASCO guideline [^116xUxVw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and other healthcare providers on the diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck (SCCUP).

- **Methods**: The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert panel of medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, radiology, pathology, and advocacy experts. The panel conducted a literature search that included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 2008 through 2019. Outcomes of interest included survival, local and regional disease control, and quality of life. Expert panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

- **Results**: The literature search identified 100 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline. Four main clinical questions were addressed, which included sub-questions on preoperative evaluations, surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, appropriate pathology techniques, and adjuvant therapy.

- **Recommendations**: Evidence-based recommendations were developed to address preoperative evaluation for patients with a neck mass, surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and appropriate treatment options in unilateral versus bilateral SCCUP.

### Primary papillary carcinoma of the thymus with invasion into subcutaneous tissue through the sternum [^113w8dD8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old Japanese man presented with a bulging of the anterior chest wall of 3 months duration. On examination, a round mass was palpable with tenderness and redness, and it was fixed in the upper mid-sternum. The patient had previously undergone wedge resection of the right upper lobe due to a spontaneous pneumothorax in his youth. A computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a 7.5 × 5.5 × 7.2 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum, invading subcutaneous fat tissue through the sternum, accompanied by bone destruction [figure 1, (a) and (b)].

On fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), abnormal FDG uptake was observed only in the mediastinal mass with a maximum standardized uptake ratio of 15.0. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was remarkably elevated at 2047.2 ng/ml, but other tumor markers (AFP, beta-HCG, SCC), anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody, and alkaline phosphatase were negative. The tumor was diagnosed as carcinoma by fine-needle aspiration; however, definitive histology could not be determined.

- **Figure 1**:
	- The computed tomographic scan showed an anterior mediastinal tumor penetrating the sternum.
	- (a) Horizontal section; (b) sagittal section.

The patient underwent en bloc resection of the tumor through a midline incision over the sternum and a right collar incision. The tissue around the tumor was circumferentially mobilized, and the upper half of the sternum, including the terminal 3–5 cm of the clavicle, the upper three ribs on the right side, the medial end of the left clavicle, and adjacent subcutaneous tissue and skin, were removed.

### Is three-dimensional virtual planning in cranial reconstruction for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the skull a feasible option [^114bzPQN]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a common type of malignant skin disorder. An uncommon feature is local bony invasion, as can rarely be seen in lesions on the scalp. The optimal treatment strategy in these rare cases is still under debate.

The aim of this case report is to present a one-stage three-dimensional planned surgical resection and reconstruction of a cSCC with bony invasion into the scalp and to discuss alternative options and potential pitfalls.

A patient diagnosed with rT4N0M0 cSCC of the scalp underwent a cranial resection and reconstruction in one stage. Using computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing, a patient-specific implant (PSI) of poly (ether ether ketone) was manufactured. After the PSI was inserted, it was covered with a latissimus dorsi muscle and a split-thickness skin graft.

Intraoperatively, the resection template generated an accurate resection and ensured accurate and fast placement of the PSI. Although the reconstruction had a clinically satisfactory aesthetic result, it was hampered by the development of a small wound dehiscence observed over the postoperative course.

Three-dimensional planned resection and reconstruction for composite defects of the skull after resection of a cSCC of the scalp with bony invasion may lead to an accurate and predictable resection and placement of the PSI. However, patient-specific characteristics should be considered to assess potential risks and benefits before opting for this one-stage treatment strategy.

### Optimizing reconstruction of oncologic sternectomy defects based on surgical outcomes [^111AK6Ap]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal strategy for oncologic sternectomy reconstruction has not been well characterized. We hypothesized that the major factors driving the reconstructive strategy for oncologic sternectomy include the need for skin replacement, extent of the bony sternectomy defect, and status of the internal mammary vessels.

- **Study design**: We reviewed consecutive oncologic sternectomy reconstructions performed at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during a 10-year period. Regression models analyzed associations between patient, defect, and treatment factors and outcomes to identify patient and treatment selection criteria. We developed a generalized management algorithm based on these data.

- **Results**: Forty-nine consecutive patients underwent oncologic sternectomy reconstruction (mean follow-up 18 ± 23 months). More sternectomies were partial (74%) rather than total/subtotal (26%). Most defects (n = 40 [82%]) required skeletal reconstruction. Pectoralis muscle flaps were most commonly used for sternectomies with intact overlying skin (64%) and infrequently used when a presternal skin defect was present (36%; p = 0.06). Free flaps were more often used for total/subtotal vs. partial sternectomy defects (75% vs. 25%, respectively; p = 0.02). Complication rates for total/subtotal sternectomy and partial sternectomy were equivalent (46% vs. 44%, respectively; p = 0.92).

- **Conclusions**: Despite more extensive sternal resections, total/subtotal sternectomies resulted in equivalent postoperative complications when combined with the appropriate soft-tissue reconstruction.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^112yaYXW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN 2021 guidelines specifically address the management of high- and very-high-risk cutaneous SCC. The guidelines recommend obtaining a multidisciplinary consultation and considering the offer of adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with negative margins if there is extensive perineural involvement, large or named nerve involvement, or other poor prognostic features. Adjuvant radiation therapy should also be considered for cutaneous SCC with gross clinical radiologic perineural invasion, multifocal histologic nerve invasion, tumors with a diameter of ≥ 6 cm, high risk for regional or distant metastasis, close surgical margins where further surgery cannot be performed, and desmoplastic or infiltrative tumors in chronically immunosuppressed patients.

### A comparative analysis of the significance of depth of invasion and tumor thickness in the staging of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^111LfPju]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). High credibility.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition designates tumor depth of invasion as a crucial parameter for staging oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We conducted this study to examine our diagnostic challenges and share our institutional experiences in measuring the depth of invasion.

We selected 90 OSCC cases between 2017 and 2023. In each case, we remeasured the depth of invasion and tumor thickness and assigned the tumor stage according to the AJCC 8th edition criteria. The results showed that 84 out of 90 cases (93.3%) had the same tumor stage regardless of whether tumor thickness or depth of invasion was used. The difference between tumor thickness and depth of invasion ranged from 0 to 3 mm. In only 6 out of the 90 cases (6.7%) was the tumor stage changed based on tumor thickness. Of these 6 cases, 4 were upgraded from T1 to T2, while the remaining 2 were upgraded from T2 to T3.

Our conclusions indicate that in 93.3% of OSCC cases, the tumor stage remained the same whether based on depth of invasion or tumor thickness, while 6.7% were upstaged based on tumor thickness. We observed that tumor thickness appears to be more straightforward to measure than depth of invasion, which requires certain prerequisites and can present diagnostic challenges. Additional studies with larger cohorts are needed to compare tumor thickness with depth of invasion findings.

### Primary malignant chest wall tumors: Analysis of 40 patients [^1118sSyN]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Thirty-five out of forty tumors (87.5%) arose from both soft tissue and adjacent ribs, while the remaining five tumors (12.5%) originated from the sternum. An adequate margin of resection was 4 cm. Moreover, reconstruction was required for anterior tumors larger than 5 cm and posterior tumors larger than 10 cm.

Five patients underwent resection without reconstruction: two with low-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), one with costal chondrosarcoma, one with leiomyosarcoma, and one with fibrosarcoma. Resections were performed on four men and one woman. Furthermore, extensive resection and reconstruction were conducted in nineteen women and sixteen men.

Figures 1 and 2 demonstrated the resected specimen and the use of mesh and cement in combination with muscle flaps in reconstruction. The latissimus dorsi flap was the most commonly used muscle flap in our work (30 patients). In five patients with sternal resection, a bilateral pectoral muscle flap was used. Figure 3 illustrates this technique. Figure 4 shows the surgical resection technique.

Early postoperative complications were observed in eight patients: four patients with wound infection (10%), two with sarcoma (5%), and in two others, atelectasis occurred (5%). All eight patients were treated with medical therapy. Hospital mortality was 0%, defined as death within 30 days post-operation. The prevalence of local recurrence and distant metastasectomy are detailed in Figure 5.

### Interventions for non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: Systematic review and pooled analysis of observational studies [^113uQKgk]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this systematic review

Although we endeavored to be as thorough as possible in our literature search, it is inevitable that some relevant studies were not found. Observational studies, particularly case series, are challenging to identify in literature databases compared to randomized controlled trials. These studies are often not discernible from the title and are inconsistently indexed by study design in bibliographic databases. There is also likely an element of publication bias associated with observational studies.

We did not review treatments for recurrent squamous cell carcinomas (reSCCs) and tumors known to be metastatic at presentation. Many studies were excluded because they included previously treated relapsed tumors without separating data from non-recurrent tumors. Such recurrent tumors may exhibit different characteristics, making them more likely to recur or be resistant to treatment.

Similarly, we did not specifically search for studies focused solely on managing SCC in solid organ transplant recipients, although some included such patients. Cutaneous SCC is a significant cause of morbidity in this patient group and is associated with the likelihood of multiple tumors and a potentially more aggressive clinical course. Therefore, this topic might warrant separate consideration, as it is beyond the scope of this general review.

We observed that mean follow-up periods were generally poorly reported, with few studies reporting a mean follow-up of more than…

### Understanding and use of the American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition guidelines for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: a survey of dermatologic surgeons [^115z4FcX]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual was published in 2009, including an updated chapter on cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and other cutaneous carcinomas. Notable improvements from the previous sixth edition include the placement of Merkel cell carcinoma and cSCC of the eyelid in individual chapters, elimination of the 5-cm clinical breakpoint for T3, and the addition of high-risk features for upstaging T1 to T2, independent of clinical tumor size. Despite these advances, several publications critical of the AJCC guidelines have surfaced in the literature since their release.

- **Objective**: To further evaluate the use and applicability of the most recent AJCC guidelines for cSCC.

- **Materials and methods**: A web-based survey of members of the American College of Mohs Surgery to gauge knowledge and application of the guidelines.

- **Conclusion**: Although physician knowledge of the details of the guidelines was in line with expectations, some areas for improvement, such as coexistent immunosuppression incorrectly listed as a high-risk feature, remain. Also, the lack of change in practice among Mohs surgeons or dermatopathologists, as a result of the guidelines, is somewhat troubling and may be an area for further research.
