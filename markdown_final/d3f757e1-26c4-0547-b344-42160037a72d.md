## Question

Ok. stressed from sitting at my desk all day, lower back is killing me, is there some standard posture stuff that helps or reduces the pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a standard posture or ergonomic approach that helps reduce lower back pain from sitting at a desk all day, and what the evidence says about what actually works. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence linking posture to back pain. Then, I should verify what high-quality trials say about sit-stand desks and movement breaks. Next, I will examine specific ergonomic principles that are reasonable and low-risk. After that, I need to consider pain phenotypes and whether posture advice should be individualized. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized plan and state the bottom line clearly with caveats about evidence quality and what would change my mind.

> Let me first confirm the core premise: does "bad posture" cause lower back pain, and does "good posture" fix it. Wait, let me verify the evidence base before jumping to conclusions. Contemporary viewpoints and guidelines emphasize that there is no strong evidence that specific static sitting postures prevent or treat low back pain, and that rigid "sit up straight" prescriptions are largely unsupported; instead, variability and comfort-driven positions are preferred, and lumbar supports have insufficient evidence for routine recommendation in acute or chronic low back pain [^ec8a4b38] [^228f5efa] [^3e3d0f86].

> Next, I should review whether reducing sitting time itself helps pain. Hold on, I should verify the randomized trials. The SMArT Work cluster RCT showed sustained reductions in occupational sitting of roughly 60–80 minutes per workday and improvements in work engagement, fatigue, and some musculoskeletal outcomes, with benefits persisting at 12 months; similarly, the Stand Back RCT in desk workers with chronic low back pain reduced sitting by about 1.5 hours/day and improved disability by about 8 points on the Oswestry scale at 6 months, although pain ratings were mixed, suggesting clinically meaningful functional gains even when pain changes are modest [^2b53b32f] [^83fdc822] [^10239774].

> I will now examine the practical ergonomic principles that are reasonable and low-risk, even if the evidence is indirect. Let me think about neutral spine and load distribution. A neutral lumbar curve with the chair supporting the natural lordosis, feet flat on the floor or a footrest, hips at or slightly above knee level, and the backrest reclined about 95–110 degrees reduces static load; adding a small lumbar roll can help maintain lordosis and may indirectly improve cervical alignment, though I should confirm that these are biomechanically plausible rather than proven pain interventions, which they are [^7a8168cf] [^db9e9ba5] [^b7d97065].

> But wait, what if the pain is posture-dependent in a specific way. I need to check whether subclassifying low back pain changes posture advice. Evidence suggests that some patients with flexion-pattern pain benefit from extension-biased positions, whereas others with extension-pattern pain benefit from flexion-biased positions; this is the rationale behind McKenzie-style movement classification, and it implies that posture advice should be individualized to the pain-provocation pattern rather than a one-size-fits-all "lordotic sitting" rule [^56d7c196] [^3b714fdf].

> Next, I should review the role of movement breaks and sit-stand transitions. Hold on, I should verify frequency and timing. Expert statements and trials converge on breaking up prolonged sitting every 30–45 minutes with standing or light movement, aiming for about 2–4 hours of standing/light activity during the workday; experimental studies show reductions in fatigue and lower back discomfort with 30-minute alternation between sitting and standing, and long-term trials show sustained behavior change with height-adjustable desks plus behavioral support [^2ce6087d] [^06da1c54] [^2b53b32f].

> I should double-check the magnitude of sitting reduction that is realistic and meaningful. Cochrane reviews and large RCTs indicate that sit-stand desks typically reduce workplace sitting by about 30–100 minutes per day in the short term, with medium-term reductions around 60 minutes/day, and that multi-component interventions with education, prompts, and coaching achieve larger, more durable changes than desks alone; importantly, these changes are largely achieved by substituting standing for sitting rather than adding stepping, which still yields musculoskeletal and work-engagement benefits [^1aad81bb] [^2b53b32f] [^30fdb6e0].

> Let me consider the home workstation context, since many people work remotely. Poor desk and chair setups are associated with increased neck and low back pain; using a proper chair with armrests, external keyboard and mouse, monitor at eye level, and a footrest if needed reduces awkward postures, and if a dining chair is unavoidable, adding a cushion for lumbar support and using a box for foot support is better than nothing; I should confirm that these are CDC-endorsed basics, which they are [^37224e42] [^b7d97065].

> I need to ensure I am not overpromising on pain relief. The Cochrane review of workplace interventions to increase standing/walking found low- to very low-quality evidence and no consistent short-term reduction in low back pain intensity from sit-stand desks alone, although some studies show improved fatigue and discomfort; this means that while sitting reduction is reasonable and likely safe, pain outcomes are heterogeneous and may require time, larger samples, or combined strategies including exercise and education to emerge [^0220263c].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized plan. First, prioritize movement: set a timer to stand or move for 1–2 minutes every 30–45 minutes, and if available, use a height-adjustable desk to accumulate 2–4 hours of standing/light activity during the workday. Second, optimize the workstation: chair height so hips are at or slightly above knees, feet flat or on a footrest, backrest reclined 95–110 degrees with lumbar support, monitor top at or just below eye level, keyboard and mouse at elbow height. Third, individualize posture: if sitting aggravates pain, try a more upright, lordotic position; if standing aggravates pain, favor a slightly flexed, supported position; track what centralizes or peripheralizes symptoms. Fourth, add exercise: core strengthening and general physical activity are foundational for pain and function, and should be layered onto ergonomic changes rather than replacing them [^2ce6087d] [^7a8168cf] [^56d7c196].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the message clearly. There is no single "standard posture" that reliably cures sitting-related back pain, but consistently breaking up sitting time, using a well-adjusted workstation that supports a neutral spine, and tailoring positions to what feels best and centralizes symptoms are evidence-aligned strategies that reduce mechanical load, improve comfort, and can improve function over time; the strongest support is for reducing sitting and increasing movement, with moderate support for ergonomic optimization, and limited but supportive signals for functional outcomes in desk workers with chronic low back pain [^ec8a4b38] [^2b53b32f] [^10239774].

---

Desk-related back pain is best managed by **neutral spine alignment** [^7a8168cf] and **frequent movement** [^2ce6087d], not a single "perfect" posture. Sit with hips/knees at ~90°, feet flat, lumbar support, and screen at eye level; avoid slouching or perching forward. Stand or walk for 2–4 minutes every 30 minutes [^2ce6087d] [^1aad81bb], and use a sit-stand desk if available [^2b53b32f]. Add core strengthening and stretching 3–4 times/week, and adjust your chair/desk to fit your body. If pain persists, see a clinician for individualized care [^notfound].

---

## Optimal sitting posture

- **Neutral spine**: Maintain the natural lumbar curve; avoid slouching or arching [^7a8168cf].
- **Hip and knee alignment**: Hips and knees at ~90°, feet flat on the floor or a footrest [^7a8168cf].
- **Lumbar support**: Use a chair with adjustable lumbar support or a cushion to maintain lordosis [^8b8b8f01].
- **Screen position**: Top of monitor at or just below eye level, ~20–40 inches away, to avoid neck strain [^b4451230].
- **Arm and wrist position**: Elbows at 90–100°, wrists neutral, forearms parallel to the floor [^7a8168cf].

---

## Postures to avoid

Avoid **slouching** — rounding the shoulders and upper back increases spinal load and muscle strain — and **perching forward**, which places excess load on the lumbar discs and muscles. Also avoid **crossing legs**, which can misalign the pelvis and spine, and **cradling the phone**, which strains the neck and shoulders.

---

## Importance of movement and breaks

Prolonged sitting is harmful even with perfect posture; **regular movement is essential** [^2ce6087d]. Stand or walk for 2–4 minutes every 30 minutes [^notfound]; use a sit-stand desk if available [^2b53b32f]. Incorporate micro-breaks: shoulder rolls, neck stretches, and gentle trunk movements every hour [^b7d97065].

---

## Ergonomic adjustments

- **Chair**: Adjustable height, lumbar support, and armrests; seat pan supports the thighs without pressing the knees [^b7d97065].
- **Desk**: Height allows elbows at 90–100°; consider a sit-stand desk [^2b53b32f].
- **Monitor**: Adjustable height/angle; top at or just below eye level [^b4451230].
- **Keyboard/mouse**: External, wireless, or ergonomic to reduce strain [^09fd0fad].

---

## Exercises and stretches

Regular exercise and stretching **reduce pain and improve posture**:

| **Exercise/stretch** | **Frequency** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Core strengthening | 3–4 times/week | Planks, bird-dogs, dead bugs |
| Hip flexor stretch | Daily | Lunge stretch, 30 seconds each side |
| Hamstring stretch | Daily | Seated or standing, 30 seconds each side |
| Cat-camel stretch | Daily | 10–15 reps |
| Shoulder blade squeezes | Hourly | 10–15 reps |

---

## Individualized approach

Posture advice should be **tailored to body type, pain pattern, and work tasks** [^1f901456]. A clinician can provide personalized guidance and address underlying issues [^notfound].

---

## When to seek professional help

Consult a clinician if pain persists despite ergonomic changes, worsens, or is accompanied by red flags (leg weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes, fever, or unexplained weight loss).

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Neutral spine**: Maintain natural lumbar curve [^7a8168cf].
- **Frequent movement**: Stand/walk every 30 minutes [^2ce6087d].
- **Ergonomic setup**: Adjust chair, desk, and monitor to fit your body [^b7d97065].
- **Exercise**: Core strengthening and stretching 3–4 times/week.
- **Individualization**: Tailor posture and interventions to your needs [^1f901456].

---

There is no single "perfect" posture; **neutral alignment plus regular movement** is the key to reducing desk-related back pain [^ec8a4b38].

### "Sit up straight": time to Re-evaluate [^ec8a4b38]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Posture is a frequent topic of discussion for patients, clinicians, the media, and society. A common belief is that spinal pain is caused by sitting, standing, or bending "incorrectly". Despite the absence of strong evidence to support these common beliefs, a large posture industry has flourished, with many interventions and products claiming to "correct" posture and prevent pain. Unfortunately, many health care professionals provide advice in line with this non-evidence-based perspective. In this Viewpoint, the authors reflect on common beliefs regarding posture and spinal health and why they are so widely held, and consider how clinicians can positively influence these beliefs.

Activities and activity modification — management has shifted over the past 10 years from prescribing bed rest to recognizing that prescriptions of bed rest are ineffective, with emphasis that many workers can continue working or return to work while symptoms persist rather than waiting to be 100% symptom-free. In general, activities causing a significant increase in low back symptoms should be reviewed with the patient and modifications advised when appropriate, as heavy lifting, awkward postures, prolonged duration of a single posture, work station design, and other activities may require at least temporary modification. A modest increase in pain does not represent or document damage and may actually be beneficial for some short-term pain; while the patient is recovering, activities that do not aggravate symptoms should be maintained and exercises should begin.

### Reducing sedentary behaviour to decrease chronic low back pain: the stand back randomised trial [^10239774]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The Stand Back study evaluated the feasibility and effects of a multicomponent intervention targeting reduced prolonged sitting and pain self-management in desk workers with chronic low back pain (LBP).

Methods

This randomised controlled trial recruited 27 individuals with chronic LBP, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) > 10% and desk jobs (sitting ≥ 20 hours/week). Participants were randomised within strata of ODI (> 10%- < 20%, ≥ 20%) to receive bimonthly behavioural counselling (in-person and telephone), a sit-stand desk attachment, a wrist-worn activity-prompting device and cognitive behavioural therapy for LBP self-management or control. Self-reported work sitting time, visual analogue scales (VAS) for LBP and the ODI were assessed by monthly, online questionnaires and compared across intervention groups using linear mixed models.

Results

Baseline mean (SD) age was 52 (11) years, 78% were women, and ODI was 24.1 (10.5)%. Across the 6-month follow-up in models adjusted for baseline value, work sitting time was 1.5 hour/day (P < 0.001) lower comparing intervention to controls. Also across follow-up, ODI was on average 8 points lower in intervention versus control (P = 0.001). At 6 months, the relative decrease in ODI from baseline was 50% in intervention and 14% in control (P = 0.042). LBP from VAS was not significantly reduced in intervention versus control, though small-to-moderate effect sizes favouring the intervention were observed (Cohen's d ranged from 0.22 to 0.42).

Conclusion

An intervention coupling behavioural counselling targeting reduced sedentary behaviour and pain self-management is a translatable treatment strategy that shows promise for treating chronic LBP in desk-bound employees.

### Effectiveness of an intervention for reducing sitting time and improving health in office workers: three arm cluster randomised controlled trial [^15784b70]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMART Work and Life (SWAL) intervention, delivered with and without a height adjustable desk, and by workplace champions, compared with a control group. Both intervention groups (with and without a height adjustable desk) were shown to be effective, with the SWAL group sitting for 22 minutes less daily and the SWAL plus desk group for 64 minutes less daily than the control group at 12 months. The SWAL plus desk group sat for 42 minutes less daily than the SWAL group, showing it to be more effective. Time spent in prolonged sitting was lower in both intervention groups compared with the control group. Reductions in sitting time were largely replaced by increases in standing time, and these changes occurred on workdays and during work hours. Furthermore, the magnitude of behaviour change was similar across the three and 12 month follow-up, indicating that behaviour change was maintained during the course of the study. Finally, the SWAL plus desk intervention appeared more effective during work hours for those older than the median age (≥ 46 years).

Results were suggestive of small improvements in stress and wellbeing at three and 12 months and vigour at 12 months for both intervention groups, and in organisational social norms, all types of support, and pain in the lower extremity in the SWAL plus desk group at three and 12 month follow-up compared with the control group. For other health, work, and wellbeing outcomes, no noticeable between group differences were found.

Comparison with previous research

The results for change in sitting time at the 12 month follow-up for the SWAL plus desk group are consistent with two other large randomised controlled trials evaluating multicomponent interventions to promote reductions in sitting that included height adjustable desks. However, the SWAL intervention was solely facilitated by workplace champions, unlike the previous interventions, which were delivered by researchers. One other large, randomised trial without a control group recruited employees from academic, industry, healthcare, and government and compared two intervention groups. The trial found that the intervention (Stand and Move at Work) when provided with a height adjustable desk was more effective at reducing daily sitting time than the intervention provided on its own by 48 minutes per 16 hour waking day, a similar effect size to the present study (42 min/day). Collectively, however, all previous interventions and SWAL showed no or minimal changes in movement time for the intervention groups, with reductions in sitting being replaced by increased accumulated standing time.

Ergonomics and human factors engineering

Musculoskeletal disorder prevention

Radiologists are at considerable risk for developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to prolonged static postures, repetitive motions, and suboptimal workstation configurations. Studies report that up to 60% of radiologists experience symptoms of musculoskeletal discomfort, most commonly affecting the neck, lower back, and upper extremities. Effective prevention begins with ergonomically designed seating.

Workstation layout is another critical factor. Height-adjustable desks that accommodate both sitting and standing postures have been shown to reduce static spinal loading. Evidence supports alternating between sitting and standing every 30–45 min to maximize musculoskeletal benefit without impairing workflow efficiency or diagnostic accuracy. Monitor positioning has a direct impact on cervical strain. Optimal setup involves placing the top edge of the primary display at or just below eye level and maintaining a viewing distance of approximately 20–40 inches from the user. When using multiple displays, monitors should be arranged to minimize head rotation, typically through curved or angled configurations that preserve consistent viewing distances across all screens (Fig. 2).

Visual fatigue mitigation strategies

One widely supported intervention is the 20-20-20 rule: looking at an object 20 feet away for 20 s every 20 min. This technique has been shown to alleviate accommodation fatigue and can be effectively integrated into the workflow through scheduled break reminders.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^03dd490e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Health professionals and people with osteoporosis had substantial uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of exercise for those with osteoporosis. However, evidence synthesis confirmed that physical activity and exercise have multiple potential benefits for those with osteoporosis: it may modestly benefit bone strength; improve muscle strength and balance and hence reduce falls risk and reduce kyphosis, which may benefit pain, self-esteem and risk of falls and fractures. Physical activity has a range of other health benefits. We conducted an updated and more thorough analysis of adverse events (particularly fractures) reported during exercise: harms have not been consistently reported, and although a small number of fractures have been reported during exercise, the benefits outweigh the risks. The level of evidence for people who have existing fractures is lower unfortunately; there is inconsistent evidence that exercise could benefit pain, physical function and quality of life. Many of our recommendations for this group are thus based on consensus rather than evidence.

We recommend several overarching principles. Physical activity and exercise have an important role in promoting bone strength, reducing falls risk and managing vertebral fracture symptoms, so they should be part of a broad approach that includes other lifestyle changes, combined with pharmaceutical treatment where appropriate. People with osteoporosis should be encouraged to do more rather than less. This requires professionals to adopt a positive and encouraging approach, focusing on 'how to' messages rather than 'don't do'. Although specific types or exercise may be most effective, even a minimal level of activity should provide some benefit. The evidence indicates that physical activity and exercise is not associated with significant harm, including vertebral fracture; in general, the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks. Professionals should avoid restricting physical activity or exercise unnecessarily according to BMD or fracture thresholds as this may discourage exercise or activities that promote bone and other health benefits. Finally, people with painful vertebral fractures need clear and prompt guidance on how to adapt movements involved with day-to-day living, including how exercises can help with posture and pain. Anyone with osteoporosis may benefit from guidance on amending some postures and movements to care for their back. Supporting resources were produced.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^fe6f3d77]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain — work activities and initial restrictions are outlined for acute, severe LBP with or without radicular symptoms: No lifting over 10 pounds; No prolonged or frequent bending (flexion); Alternate sitting and standing as needed. Activity guidance is iterative, as activity guidelines are generally reassessed every week in the acute phase with gradual increases in activity recommended, and the patient's activity level should be kept at maximum levels and gradually advanced. Written work activity limitations are advised to communicate status and expectations at work and at home.

### Tilted seat position for non-ambulant individuals with neurological and neuromuscular impairment: a systematic review [^3577043e]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tilt-in-space wheelchairs and seats are increasingly used by people with neurological or neuromuscular impairments who cannot walk. Tilt-in-space systems may be considered for a variety of reasons, including low sitting tolerance or discomfort, a requirement to rest in the seat, and to assist with manual handling. Drawbacks to these systems compared with conventional wheelchairs and seats include purchase costs, size and complexity of equipment. Tilt-in-space wheelchairs are also heavier and less manoeuvrable than more standard wheelchairs due to a longer wheelbase, and this may restrict access to transport.

A backwards-tilted sitting position has been suggested to improve head and trunk posture, and to reduce the loading under the buttocksor through the spine. There are concerns that seating that is excessively tilted back limits communication, upper limb function and the ability to stand up from the chair.

A forward-tilted sitting position has also been proposed to maintain lumbar lordosis, decrease posterior pelvic tilt, reduce the effect of tight hamstrings on the position of the pelvis and to position a person within reach of the desk or table. Forward-tilted positions have been incorporated into some paediatric seating.

With no evidence-based criteria or guidelines for provision and use of these systems, practices around the provision of tilt-in-space seating systems vary widely. Tilt-in-space seating may be provided by statutory service in some areas. Systems are also available for purchase directly by the user.

In a qualitative studyof severely disabled wheelchair users with multiple sclerosis and significant spasticity themes such as wheelchair size and manoeuvrability, transport difficulties, comfort, pressure ulcers, sitting up during day for prolonged periods and fatigue emerged from in-depth interviews. Seven tilt-in-space and 16 conventional wheelchair users participated.

With this background it was thought that a systematic review on the effects of tilt-in-space seating might inform clinical practice on seating provision and use within these populations, and identify what further research studies on this topic are required in order to establish evidence-based guidelines for provision.

### Chair-based fidgeting and energy expenditure [^43efb7d3]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The importance of sedentariness in chronic disease and obesity is established. Sedentary behaviours occur during work and while at home. Many people spend the majority of their weekly waking hours at work and so solutions to reverse sedentariness and promote physical activity are necessary.

In adults, most sitting occurs while people are at work. This is attributed to the computer-based nature of modern work and to standard office design, both of which encourage employees to remain seated throughout the majority of work hours. Although standing and/or walking while working are attractive solutions for reversing excessive sitting, they are not practical for many employees. Another attractive example is to incorporate walking breaks throughout the workday; however, many companies cannot allow this because it interferes with workflow. Innovative approaches are needed to help sedentary office workers move more.

What can be performed to help employees who cannot get up from their desks? One approach could be to render sitting more active, which is called, 'dynamic sitting'. People who fidget while sitting can increase energy expenditure by 5–10% above resting values. In order to exploit this effect, several manufacturers have designed specific pieces of furniture that directly encourage an office worker to incorporate fidgeting movements while working at their usual business tasks. One popular example is replacing office chairs with large rubber balls (Swiss Balls). Using a Swiss Ball, an employee needs to continuously adjust their balance and deploy trunk and back muscles for support. Other 'dynamic sitting'solutions are being examined whereby furniture design is used to encourage chair-based fidgeting and/or leg movements. In this paper, we critically evaluated the thermogenic impact of these innovations.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^42061b1b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain — sleep posture should prioritize patient comfort due to lack of quality evidence. There are no quality studies reported on sleep posture to prevent or treat LBP, and as supportive quality evidence is lacking, and absence of sleep is detrimental, sleep posture(s) that are most comfortable for the patient are instead recommended (Recommended (I), Low Confidence).

### Energy expenditure of deskwork when sitting, standing or alternating positions [^e5ad2ead]. Occupational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines recommend accruing 2-4h of standing or light activity during the working day. Use of sit-stand desks could achieve this goal, but whether standing can meaningfully increase energy expenditure (EE) is unclear.

Aims

To study EE, heart rate, feelings and productivity during deskwork while sitting, standing or alternating positions.

Methods

We measured EE by indirect calorimetry in working adults over three randomly ordered 60-min conditions while performing deskwork: continuous sitting (SIT), 30min of each standing and sitting (STAND-SIT) and continuous standing (STAND). We also assessed heart rate, productivity and self-reported energy, fatigue and pain. Linear mixed models compared minute-by-minute EE and heart rate across conditions. Non-parametric tests compared remaining outcomes across conditions.

Results

The study group comprised 18 working adults. Compared with SIT, STAND-SIT engendered an additional 5.5 ± 12.4 kcal/h (7.8% increase) and STAND engendered an additional 8.2 ± 15.9 kcal/h (11.5% increase) (both P < 0.001). Alternating positions to achieve the recommended 4h/day of standing could result in an additional 56.9 kcal/day for an 88.9kg man and 48.3 kcal/day for a 75.5kg woman. STAND-SIT and STAND also increased heart rate over SIT by 7.5 ± 6.8 and 13.7 ± 8.8 bpm, respectively (both P < 0.001). We observed no meaningful differences in feelings or productivity.

Conclusions

Desk-based workers could increase EE without added discomfort by using a sit-stand desk. These findings inform future research on sit-stand desks as a part of workplace interventions to increase EE and potentially improve health.

### Global, regional and national burden of low back pain in adolescents aged 10–19 years, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^bb446459]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

From a health policy perspective, addressing the global burden of LBP in adolescents requires multi-sectoral collaboration and targeted interventions tailored to regional and socioeconomic contexts. First, preventive strategies should prioritize population-wide health education to raise awareness about LBP risk factors, such as prolonged sedentary behavior, poor posture, and unsafe lifting practices. School-based programs could integrate age-appropriate modules on spinal health, including daily warm-up exercises and ergonomic guidance, with a focus on gender-specific needs — for example, educating female adolescents about hormonal influences on pain sensitivity and stress management techniques. Second, school environment ergonomics must be systematically improved. Policies should mandate adjustable desks and chairs that accommodate adolescent growth, reduce backpack weights (eg, through digital textbook adoption), and enforce regular break times to encourage movement. In high-SDI regions with intense academic pressure, like Eastern Europe and East Asia, education systems should implement evidence-based limits on daily study hours and promote peer-led "posture champions" to reinforce healthy habits. For low-SDI regions where adolescents engage in heavy labor, occupational health protections are critical, including age-appropriate workload regulations, vocational training on safe lifting techniques, and access to protective equipment for those in agricultural or industrial roles. Third, promoting physical activity requires policy incentives to increase structured and unstructured movement. Governments should expand school-based sports programs, integrate active commuting (eg, walking or cycling to school), and collaborate with urban planners to create safe public spaces for play. In high-SDI areas with sedentary lifestyles, digital health interventions (eg, mobile apps tracking screen time and prompting movement) could complement in-person initiatives. Conversely, in regions with high physical labor burdens, policies should balance injury prevention with access to recreational activities that strengthen core muscles without exacerbating occupational strain. Lastly, health systems need enhanced capacity to diagnose and manage adolescent LBP, particularly in low-resource settings. Training primary care providers in non-pharmacological interventions (eg, physical therapy, yoga) and reducing barriers to low-cost treatments would improve outcomes. Cross-sectoral monitoring frameworks, linking education, labor, and health data, should be established to evaluate policy impacts on LBP prevalence, incidence, and YLDs over time. By embedding these strategies into national health agendas, policymakers can mitigate the lifelong social and economic toll of adolescent LBP while fostering healthier lifestyles for future generations.

### "It feels unhealthy to be sitting for 40 hours a week": a qualitative analysis of employee perceptions of standing desk use in the workplace [^2b8b4ebc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Reducing sedentary behavior (SB) is an important public health concern. The purpose of this study was to explore motivation to acquire a standing desk and strategies for using a standing desk through one-on-one interviews.

Methods

Thirty-seven university employees (89% staff; 51% women) participated in the study. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide and brief demographic questionnaire.

Results

Data analysis yielded five themes about motivation to acquire a standing desk: (1) pain management; (2) health risk; (3) movement opportunity; (4) workspace flexibility; and (5) productivity and three themes about typical use strategy: (1) task-dependent; (2) time-dependent; and (3) threshold.

Conclusions

Motivating factors for using a standing desk should be considered when encouraging standing desk use. Interventions should provide realistic strategies to establish a sit-stand routine that address employees' unique job demands and preferences.

### Reallocating desk workers' sitting time to standing or stepping: associations with work performance [^0cd46f02]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In the partition models that held time spent in the other behaviour constant, we also found that more time spent in occupational sitting and standing/stepping was associated with lower absolute absenteeism, indicating higher-than-expected work hours. Given that there was no maximum of total work hours in partition models, the finding that higher-than-expected work hours were associated with both occupational sitting and standing/stepping may simply reflect the longer work hours. It has also been argued that such an adding effect of the partition models may be confounded by the total time for behaviours. The associations with absolute absenteeism were not observed for occupational sitting or standing/stepping in the isotemporal substitution models, which control for total work hours, supporting this potential explanation. The findings across the two models highlight the importance of considering the time-use composition structure of workplace sitting, standing and stepping.

The partition models indicated that occupational sitting (negatively) and standing/stepping (positively) were associated with work engagement. This aligns with previous findings showing that less time spent in prolonged occupational sitting was associated with a higher level of work engagement. When reallocating occupational sitting to standing/stepping, positive associations were also found for work engagement, both overall and in each dimension. Our findings were consistent with evidence from a trial of sit–stand workstations, which showed an increase in the vigour dimension of work engagement when workers were able to increase their workplace standing time. Meta-analyses have reported that workers with more time in the workplace sitting had 23–47% higher risks of low back pain and a 73% higher risk of neck/shoulder pain. A lower risk of physical pains in desk workers who involved in less sedentary time may have higher levels of energy and work concentration. Furthermore, time spent standing and stepping may increase workplace social interaction, social capital and resources of work engagement, contributing to an enhancement of involvement in work. The combination of lower level of physical pain and higher level of social interaction may amplify the benefits of reallocating sitting time to standing/stepping among desk workers in countries/areas where a limited population working from home. These findings suggest that creating and offering opportunities to support workers to engage in more time standing and stepping at work by designing open-plan offices and providing behavioural cues, for example, e-newsletters and managerial support may be beneficial for work engagement without detrimentally affecting presenteeism or absenteeism.

### Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work [^6fef9515]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The number of people working whilst seated at a desk keeps increasing worldwide. As sitting increases, occupational physical strain declines at the same time. This has contributed to increases in cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. Therefore, reducing and breaking up the time that people spend sitting while at work is important for health.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, PsycINFO, Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) search trial portal up to 14 February, 2014. We also searched reference lists of articles and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), and quasi-randomised controlled trials of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) with a concurrent control group. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self-reported or objectively measured by means of an accelerometer coupled with an inclinometer. We considered energy expenditure, duration and number of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required.

Main Results

We included eight studies, four RCTs, three CBAs and one cRCT, with a total of 1125 participants. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (three studies), policy changes (one study) and information and counselling (four studies). No studies investigated the effect of treadmill desks, stepping devices, periodic breaks or standing or walking meetings. All the studies were at high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was very low to low. Half of the studies were from Australia and the other half from Europe, with none from low- or middle-income countries. Physical workplace changesWe found very low quality evidence that sit-stand desks with or without additional counselling reduced sitting time at work per workday at one week follow-up (MD -143 minutes (95% CI -184 to -102, one study, 31 participants) and at three months' follow-up (MD - 113 minutes, 95% CI -143 to -84, two studies, 61 participants) compared to no intervention. Total sitting time during the whole day decreased also with sit-stand desks compared to no intervention (MD -78 minutes, 95% CI -125 to -30, one study, 31 participants) as did the duration of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more (MD -52 minutes, 95% CI -79 to -26, two studies, 74 participants). Sit-stand desks did not have a considerable effect on work performance and had an inconsistent effect on musculoskeletal symptoms and sick leave. Policy changesWalking strategies had no considerable effect on sitting at work (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -54 to 23, one study, 179 participants, low quality evidence). Information and counsellingGuideline-based counselling by occupational physicians reduced sitting time at work (MD -28 minutes, 95% CI -54 to -2, one study, 396 participants, low quality evidence). There was no considerable effect on reduction in total sitting time during the whole day. Mindfulness training induced a non-significant reduction in workplace sitting time (MD -2 minutes, 95% CI -22 to 18) at six months' follow-up and at 12 months' follow-up (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -45 to 12, one study, 257 participants, low quality evidence). There was an inconsistent effect of computer prompting on sitting time at work. One study found no considerable effect on sitting at work (MD -18 minutes, 95% CI -53 to 17, 28 participants, low quality evidence) at 10 days' follow-up, while another study reported a significant reduction in sitting at work (MD -55 minutes, 95% CI -96 to -14, 34 participants, low quality evidence) at 13 weeks' follow-up. Computer prompting software also led to a non-significant increase in energy expenditure at work (MD 278 calories/workday, 95% CI 0 to 556, one study, 34 participants, low quality evidence) at 13 weeks' follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

At present there is very low quality evidence that sit-stand desks can reduce sitting time at work, but the effects of policy changes and information and counselling are inconsistent. There is a need for high quality cluster-randomised trials to assess the effects of different types of interventions on objectively measured sitting time. There are many ongoing trials that might change these conclusions in the near future.

### Effectiveness of an intervention for reducing sitting time and improving health in office workers: three arm cluster randomised controlled trial [^47dcd612]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Environmental strategies — The intervention promoted small scale restructuring of the office environment (eg, relocation of printers and wastepaper bins, standing meetings, standing areas in shared space) to encourage more frequent movement around the office. Participants were also encouraged to think about their home environment. Motivational posters were embedded in the office environment. The workplace champions demonstrated positive examples within the working environment (ie, behavioural modelling).

Clusters randomised to the SWAL plus desk group received a height adjustable desk to encourage them to transition between sitting and standing postures while working. Participants were able to select their preferred desk type and colour (black or white) from four models: Deskrite 100 (Posturite, Berwick, UK), Yo-Yo Desk Mini, Yo-Yo Desk 90, or Yo-Yo Desk Go (Sit-Stand Trading, Swindon, UK). All the desks were designed to sit on top of the participants' existing workstation. Participants were provided with an information booklet and guidance from the research team on how to use the desk appropriately when in the sitting and standing positions, as well as recommendations based on the sedentary office expert statementon how much standing to achieve throughout the day (ie, gradually work towards two hours of standing and light movement and eventually towards four hours). The importance of avoiding prolonged standing was also highlighted.

### Usage of sit-stand workstations and associations between work and nonwork sitting time: an observational study [^ee37f498]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

No studies have objectively measured habitual usage of sit-stand workstations.

Methods

Eighteen full-time office workers participated (47.9 ± 9.2 years, 61% female). Sitting time was objectively measured (activPAL, 24h/7 days), and time at desk, desk position, and perceptions of desk use were self-reported.

Results

Participants sat for 39% of their daily workstation time, and changed workstation position twice daily. The most common reasons for standing included back pain (44%) and tiredness (22%). The majority of participants received no workstation occupational health (72%) or educational (61%) information. Workstation standing time had a significant moderate correlation with total daily standing time (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Office workers with sit-stand workstations rarely change desk position, and there is no relationship between the time spent sitting at the workstation, and total daily sitting time. Education about the workstations was limited.

### Sitting with adjustable ischial and back supports: biomechanical changes [^8b8b8f01]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

The seat and back contact force, pressure distribution, lumbar lordosis, and low back muscle activities associated with a new seat design with adjustable ischial support and backrest were investigated using kinematic, kinetic, electromyographic, and radiographic measurements.

Objectives

To investigate the biomechanical effects of adjusting ischial and backrest supports during sitting.

Summary Of The Background Data

Sitting may induce posterior rotation of the pelvis, reduction of lumbar lordosis, and increases in muscle tension, disc pressure, and pressure on the ischium and coccyx, which may be associated with low back pain. A device that reduces the ischial load and maintains lumbar lordosis may help increase seating comfort and reduce low back pain.

Methods

Fifteen office workers with no known low back pain history were tested. Contact pressure distributions, reaction forces between the buttock-thighs and seat and between the back and backrest, load carried by the seat pan and backrest, sacral inclination, lumbar lordosis, intervertebral space of lumbar spine, and muscular activity in stabilizing the trunk were measured for sitting with and without ischial support and with adjustable back support.

Results

When the ischial support was relieved, the center of the force on the seat and on the legs of the chair, and the peak center of pressure on the seat, were significantly (P < 0.002) shifted forward toward the thighs. The total contact area on the seat pan and on the backrest was significantly decreased and increased, respectively (P < 0.001). The sacral inclination, total and segmental lumbar lordosis, and lumbar spine disc height were significantly increased for sitting upright with backrest, with the lumbar curve close to that during standing.

Conclusions

Sitting with reduced ischial support and fitted backrest to the lower spine altered the contact area, reduced peak pressure under the ischia, reduced muscular activity, maintained total and segmental lumbar lordosis, rotated the sacrum forward, and increased lumbar intervertebral disc heights, which could potentially reduce low back pain.

### What if you let them stand? A 2-year follow-up on sit-stand desk [^db399bf6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Excessive sitting time is linked to adverse health outcomes, with sit-stand desk (SSD) emerging as effective workplace interventions. However, evidence on long-term impact is scarce. This study evaluates the effects of SSD on physical behaviors after 18 and 24 months.

Methods

Ten office workers were analyzed: five after 18 months (G-18 m) and five after 24 months (G-24 m) of SSD usage. Physical behaviors, which are sitting, standing, stepping, and sit-to-stand transitions, were objectively measured using activPAL pre- and post-SSD implementation.

Results

Significant reductions in workplace sitting time were observed: G-18 m (-78.32 minutes, P = 0.019) and G-24 m (-84.36 minutes, P < 0.001). Both groups increased standing and stepping during work hours. No changes occurred during leisure time (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

SSD use was associated with sustained reductions in workplace sitting time over 24 months, suggesting a potential role in long-term health promotion. These findings support SSD adoption and emphasize the need for larger-scale studies.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^d6497456]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain — mattresses and other sleeping surfaces lack sufficient comparative evidence for specific product recommendations. There are eight high-quality and one moderate-quality studies incorporated into this analysis, and there are no quality studies on waterbeds or sleeping on the floor. One moderate-quality study of chronic LBP patients reported a medium firm mattress was superior to a firm mattress, but overall there are no quality data supporting specific commercial products. Thus, while the most comfortable sleeping surface and posture may be preferable, there is No Recommendation (I) (for or against specific mattresses, bedding, and water beds.

### Occupational sitting time, leisure physical activity, and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality [^a9b02974]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The serious risks associated with prolonged occupational sitting can be mitigated by incorporating regular breaks and engaging in additional physical activity. Systemic changes, such as more frequent breaks, standing desks, designated workplace areas for physical activity, and gym membership benefits, can help reduce risk.

### Breaking up workplace sitting time with intermittent standing bouts improves fatigue and musculoskeletal discomfort in overweight / obese office workers [^06da1c54]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the introduction of intermittent standing bouts during the workday using a height-adjustable workstation can improve subjective levels of fatigue, musculoskeletal discomfort and work productivity relative to seated work.

Methods

Overweight/obese office workers (n = 23; age 48.2 ± 7.9years, body mass index 29.6 ± 4kg/m(2)) undertook two, 5-day experimental conditions in an equal, randomised (1:1) order. In a simulated office environment, participants performed their usual occupational tasks for 8h/day in a: seated work posture (SIT condition); or interchanging between a standing and seated work posture every 30min using an electric, height-adjustable workstation (STAND-SIT condition). Self-administered questionnaires measuring fatigue, musculoskeletal discomfort and work productivity were performed on day 5 of each experimental condition.

Results

Participants' total fatigue score was significantly higher during the SIT condition (mean 67.8 (95% CI 58.8 to 76.7)) compared with the STAND-SIT condition (52.7 (43.8 to 61.5); p < 0.001). Lower back musculoskeletal discomfort was significantly reduced during the STAND-SIT condition compared with the SIT condition (31.8% reduction; p = 0.03). Despite concentration/focus being significantly higher during the SIT condition (p = 0.006), there was a trend towards improved overall work productivity in favour of the STAND-SIT condition (p = 0.053).

Conclusions

Transitioning from a seated to a standing work posture every 30min across the workday, relative to seated work, led to a significant reduction in fatigue levels and lower back discomfort in overweight/obese office workers, while maintaining work productivity. Future investigations should be directed at understanding whether sustained use of height-adjustable workstations promote concentration and productivity at work.

### Reducing occupational sitting time and improving worker… [^795a8edc]. stacks.cdc.gov (2012). Low credibility.

Reducing Occupational Sitting Time and Improving Worker Health: The Take-a-Stand Project, 2011 Supporting Files Public Domain 2012 By Pronk, Nicolaas P.; Katz, Abigail S.; Lowry, Marcia;. File Language: English. Details Journal Article: Preventing Chronic Disease Personal Author: Description: Background Prolonged sitting time is a health risk. We describe a practice-based study designed to reduce prolonged sitting time and improve selected health factors among workers with sedentary jobs. Community Context We conducted our study during March–May 2011 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, among employees with sedentary jobs. Methods Project implementation occurred over 7 weeks with a baseline period of 1 week, an intervention period of 4 weeks, and a postintervention period of 2 weeks. The intervention group received a sit-stand device during period 2 designed to fit their workstation, and the comparison group did not.

We used experience-sampling methods to monitor sitting behavior at work during the 7 weeks of the project. We estimated change scores in sitting time, health risk factors, mood states, and several office behaviors on the basis of survey responses. Outcome The Take-a-Stand Project reduced time spent sitting by 224%, reduced upper back and neck pain by 54%, and improved mood states. Furthermore, the removal of the device largely negated all observed improvements within 2 weeks. Interpretation Our findings suggest that using a sit-stand device at work can reduce sitting time and generate other health benefits for workers. Subjects: Source: Prev Chronic Dis.

### Workplace sitting and height-adjustable workstations: a randomized controlled trial [^8578aecb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Desk-based office employees sit for most of their working day. To address excessive sitting as a newly identified health risk, best practice frameworks suggest a multi-component approach. However, these approaches are resource intensive and knowledge about their impact is limited.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of a multi-component intervention to reduce workplace sitting time, to a height-adjustable workstations-only intervention, and to a comparison group (usual practice).

Design

Three-arm quasi-randomized controlled trial in three separate administrative units of the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Data were collected between January and June 2012 and analyzed the same year.

Setting/Participants

Desk-based office workers aged 20–65 (multi-component intervention, n = 16; workstations-only, n = 14; comparison, n = 14).

Intervention

The multi-component intervention comprised installation of height-adjustable workstations and organizational-level (management consultation, staff education, manager e-mails to staff) and individual-level (face-to-face coaching, telephone support) elements.

Main Outcome Measures

Workplace sitting time (minutes/8-hour workday) assessed objectively via activPAL3 devices worn for 7 days at baseline and 3 months (end-of-intervention).

Results

At baseline, the mean proportion of workplace sitting time was approximately 77% across all groups (multi-component group 366 minutes/8 hours [SD = 49]; workstations-only group 373 minutes/8 hours [SD = 36], comparison 365 minutes/8 hours [SD = 54]). Following intervention and relative to the comparison group, workplace sitting time in the multi-component group was reduced by 89 minutes/8-hour workday (95% CI = -130, -47 minutes; p < 0.001) and 33 minutes in the workstations-only group (95% CI = -74, 7 minutes, p = 0.285).

Conclusions

A multi-component intervention was successful in reducing workplace sitting. These findings may have important practical and financial implications for workplaces targeting sitting time reductions.

### Low back pain [^9b092bc8]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute low back pain with related (referred) lower extremity pain — the ICD diagnosis of flatback syndrome or lumbago due to displacement of intervertebral disc and the associated ICF diagnosis are made with a reasonable level of certainty when the patient presents with low back pain commonly associated with referred buttock, thigh, or leg pain that worsens with flexion activities and sitting; low back and lower extremity pain that can be centralized and diminished with positioning, manual procedures, and/or repeated movements; and frequently lateral trunk shift, reduced lumbar lordosis, and limited lumbar extension mobility with clinical findings commonly present that align with the subacute or chronic low back pain with movement coordination impairments category.

### Musculoskeletal symptoms amongst clinical radiologists and the implications of reporting environment ergonomics – a multicentre questionnaire study [^c86de59b]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

This multicentre study aimed to assess compliance of the reporting environment with best ergonomic practice and to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms related to working as a radiologist. All 148 radiology trainees and consultants in 10 hospitals across the region were invited to complete a musculoskeletal symptoms and reporting ergonomics questionnaire. Best ergonomic reporting practice was defined, following literature review, as being able to alter the following: monitor, desk, chair and armrest height, chair back support, ambient light, and temperature. The frequency that these facilities were available and how often they were used was determined. One hundred and twenty-three out of 148 (83%) radiologists responded, and 38% reported radiology-associated occupational injury. Lower back discomfort was the commonest radiology associated musculoskeletal symptom (41%). Only 13% of those with occupational injury sought the advice of occupational health. No reporting environments conformed completely to best ergonomic practice. Where certain facilities were available, less than a third of radiologists made personal ergonomic adjustments prior to starting a reporting session. Radiologists who had good self-assessed knowledge of best ergonomic practice had significantly less back discomfort than those with poor self-assessed knowledge (P < 0.005). We demonstrated high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms amongst radiologists. Poor compliance of the reporting environment with best ergonomic practice, in combination with our other findings of a low level of ergonomic awareness, low rates of making ergonomic adjustments and seeking appropriate help, may be implicated. We hope this study raises awareness of this issue and helps prevent long-term occupational injury amongst radiologists from poor ergonomic practice.

### Effectiveness of an intervention for reducing sitting time and improving health in office workers: three arm cluster randomised controlled trial [^30fdb6e0]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention, with and without a height adjustable desk, on daily sitting time, and to investigate the relative effectiveness of the two interventions, and the effectiveness of both interventions on physical behaviours and physical, biochemical, psychological, and work related health and performance outcomes.

Design

Cluster three arm randomised controlled trial with follow-up at three and 12 months.

Setting

Local government councils in Leicester, Liverpool, and Greater Manchester, UK.

Participants

78 clusters including 756 desk based employees in defined offices, departments, or teams from two councils in Leicester, three in Greater Manchester, and one in Liverpool.

Interventions

Clusters were randomised to one of three conditions: the SMART Work and Life (SWAL) intervention, the SWAL intervention with a height adjustable desk (SWAL plus desk), or control (usual practice).

Main Outcomes Measures

The primary outcome measure was daily sitting time, assessed by accelerometry, at 12 month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were accelerometer assessed sitting, prolonged sitting, standing and stepping time, and physical activity calculated over any valid day, work hours, workdays, and non-workdays, self-reported lifestyle behaviours, musculoskeletal problems, cardiometabolic health markers, work related health and performance, fatigue, and psychological measures.

Results

Mean age of participants was 44.7 years, 72.4% (n = 547) were women, and 74.9% (n = 566) were white. Daily sitting time at 12 months was significantly lower in the intervention groups (SWAL -22.2 min/day, 95% confidence interval -38.8 to -5.7 min/day, P = 0.003; SWAL plus desk -63.7 min/day, -80.1 to -47.4 min/day, P < 0.001) compared with the control group. The SWAL plus desk intervention was found to be more effective than SWAL at changing sitting time (-41.7 min/day, -56.3 to -27.0 min/day, P < 0.001). Favourable differences in sitting and prolonged sitting time at three and 12 month follow-ups for both intervention groups and for standing time for the SWAL plus desk group were observed during work hours and on workdays. Both intervention groups were associated with small improvements in stress, wellbeing, and vigour, and the SWAL plus desk group was associated with improvements in pain in the lower extremity, social norms for sitting and standing at work, and support.

Conclusions

Both SWAL and SWAL plus desk were associated with a reduction in sitting time, although the addition of a height adjustable desk was found to be threefold more effective.

### Computer and furniture affecting musculoskeletal problems and work performance in work from home during COVID-19 pandemic [^37224e42]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Use of "other tables" was found to be significantly associated with severe neck/shoulder and severe low back pain. This option mainly consisted of small desks with a disproportionate height, such as side tables, counter tables, kid's desks, camping tables, dressers, and so on. This finding supported the previous studies, which reported that lack of space on the desk is associated with higher odds of low back pain among homeworkers. The desk plays an important role when working in a sitting position because it provides support and carries the weight of the arms and upper torso. A sitting position without arm support was reported to increase the load on the lumbar spineand may increase the risk of low back pain. The height difference between the desk and the seat affects arm posture and the load on the shoulders. A desk height above the elbow results in arm abduction while working, and this increases the muscle active contraction of the deltoids. On the other hand, a desk height lower than the elbow results in static contraction of the shoulder muscles while supporting the weight of the upper arms. Prolonged stressful posture leads to muscle fatigue and poor work posture, which may ultimately result in musculoskeletal problems. In addition to this, the desk height also determines the location of the display, hence affecting the neck angle. A neck flexion angle greater than 25 degrees is a critical zone according to the ISO 11226 ergonomics evaluation of static working. Improper postures when using "other tables" with disproportionate size and height is a possible reason for severe neck/shoulder pain or low back pain.

### Reducing occupational sitting time and improving worker health… [^e74349da]. CDC (2012). Low credibility.

We used experience-sampling methods to monitor sitting behavior at work during the 7 weeks of the project. We estimated change scores in sitting time, health risk factors, mood states, and several office behaviors on the basis of survey responses. Outcome The Take-a-Stand Project reduced time spent sitting by 224%, reduced upper back and neck pain by 54%, and improved mood states. Furthermore, the removal of the device largely negated all observed improvements within 2 weeks. Interpretation Our findings suggest that using a sit-stand device at work can reduce sitting time and generate other health benefits for workers. Upper back and neck pain declined significantly from T1 to T2 for the intervention group. This improvement was negated during period 3.

No significant changes were observed for either the intervention or the comparison group for lower back pain, time spent in face-to-face interactions with coworkers, or time spent in physical activity breaks. Following a slight improvement during the intervention period, self-esteem decreased after removal of the devices to below baseline levels. No significant changes in any of the mood states were noted at any of the measurement points for the comparison group. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for all participants to test the association between changes during period 1 and 2 of the project in sitting time while at work and changes in back pain, office behaviors, and mood states. Reductions in sitting time were significantly associated with reductions in upper back and neck pain (. At the end of week 7, the intervention group was asked several questions about specific benefits of alternating between a seated and standing position.

Results indicated that 87% felt more comfortable, 87% felt energized, 75% felt healthier, 71% felt more focused, 66% felt more productive, 62% felt happier, and 33% felt less stressed as a result of having the sit-stand device installed at their work stations. Few studies report health benefits resulting from successful interventions to reduce sitting time. Our study succeeded in changing the physical environment of employees by introducing a sit-stand device and in recording a significant reduction in sitting time during work. Reductions in sitting time correlated significantly with improved outcomes for upper back and neck pain as well as various mood states. This level of intervention effect warrants further study using more rigorous experimental study design criteria.

### Clinical effects of a nine-month web-based intervention in subacute non-specific low back pain patients: a randomized controlled trial [^82aa38a4]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the clinical effect of a web-based lower back pain intervention on quality of life and selected lower back pain outcomes.

Design

A prospective single-blinded randomized intervention.

Setting

Occupational preventive service.

Subjects

One hundred office workers with non-specific subacute lower back pain.

Intervention

The 50 intervention group subjects were educated daily about sitting correctly and asked to perform exercises shown by video demonstrations on the university website. The exercise routines included strengthening, mobility and stretching exercises focused on the postural stability muscles. The 50 control group subjects only received standard occupational care.

Measures

Outcomes were measured by the EuroQol questionnaire five dimensions three levels, the Oswestry Disability Index, and the StarT Back Screening Tool questionnaires. At nine months, the intervention group outcomes were compared to the baseline data and the control group outcomes.

Results

For 97% (n = 45) of the experimental group quality of life (clinical utility) improved significantly; 3.58 times greater than the control group. Oswestry Disability Index showed an odds ratio (OR) of 5.42 with a 37% (n = 17) change for the intervention group with respect to the control group. With regard to the StarT Back Screening Tool, 76% (n = 35) of the intervention group improved their clinical state (odds ratio = 3.04 with respect to the control group improvement). Logistic regression analysis revealed positive changes in EuroQol questionnaire, increasing the likelihood of observing positive changes in StarT Back Screening Tool (OR = 15.5) and Oswestry Disability Index (OR = 4.5).

Conclusions

The intervention showed clinical improvements in quality of life and selected lower back pain outcomes in the experimental group compared to the control group.

### Reallocating desk workers' sitting time to standing or stepping: associations with work performance [^e481034a]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Individual work performance can directly affect the productivity of the workplace across all sectors. Indicators such as presenteeism (i.e. being at work without being productive) and absenteeism (i.e. not reporting for work as scheduled) can be associated with productivity loss, while work engagement (i.e. high morale with dedication and a strong focus on work) has been linked to higher work productivity. Underperforming workers who have any presence of high presenteeism, high absenteeism or low engagement may reduce a workplace's overall productivity in both quantity and quality. Flexible work hours and great self-control over working patterns for workers are suggested to increase work performance but are not put into widespread practice in the workplace. Strategies of behavioural changes that took place at work, with non-reduced work hours, associated with work performance may be more feasible and acceptable for the workplace to develop and carry out relevant initiatives for improving worker morale and productivity.

Reduction in time spent for sedentary behaviours — any waking behaviour with an energy expenditure of ≤ 1.5 metabolic equivalents while in a sitting or reclining posture — is a main target on improving desk workers' health, well-being and productivity. For example, a study from Northern Ireland found that less time in occupational sitting was associated with a higher level of vigour — an aspect of work engagement. Another study from Japan showed that less work-related sitting time was associated with higher levels of work efficiency and engagement. By contrast, some studies have shown that sitting time at work was neither associated with lower work productivity nor with presenteeism. However, these cross-sectional studies did not consider the time-use composition of these behaviours. As time spent in the workplace setting is limited, examining the associations between reduced occupational sitting time and work productivity indicators without considering the relative effects of the specific activities with which it is replaced may underestimate the benefits of reducing sitting at the workplace. Several experimental studies have shown that sit–stand workstations allowing office workers to switch between sitting and upright postures (i.e. standing or stepping) at work were followed by a decrease in the frequency of work errors, an increase in the vitality of work engagement and perceived work performance, and improved productivity outcomes.

### Effectiveness of the stand more AT (SMArT) work intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial [^1d5c14c4]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Consistent with previous research, sitting was replaced with standing rather than ambulation, despite emphasis on both behaviours. Participants may have chosen to reduce their sitting time by performing work tasks standing at their desk rather than reducing and breaking up their sitting through activities such as using a toilet, printer, or water cooler further away, walking meetings, or a combination of both strategies, suggestions that were promoted in the intervention. More qualitative research may be needed to elicit how best to encourage changes in movement while at work, in terms of the ability to perform work tasks more actively and to incorporate more movement during work breaks.

Participants in the intervention group on average reduced their sitting time by more than an hour daily (95% confidence interval of 40 to > 85 min/day reduction in sitting), and a recent meta-analysis examining the strength and shape of the dose-response relation between sedentary behaviour and health outcomes, suggests that this may have meaningful health benefits. For example, the increased risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality was strongest for those sitting for more than 8 h/day (relative risk of 1.04 for each additional hour after eight hours) and 6 h/day (relative risk of 1.04 for each additional hour after six hours), respectively. The average daily sitting time of the intervention group at baseline was 9.7 h/day. Furthermore, the association between sitting time and type 2 diabetes appeared to be linear, suggesting that any reduction may be beneficial. However, the acute experimental evidence is equivocal for replacing sitting time with standing time and the resulting metabolic health benefits, with one study showing that breaking up sitting with standing has acute beneficial effects on postprandial metabolic health in those with impaired glucose regulation, with other studies reporting a modestor no effectin healthy populations. Future studies are therefore needed to assess the benefit of displacing sitting with standing on health outcomes over the longer term. Nevertheless, an increase in standing seemed to have a positive impact on many work related outcomes such as job performance, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteesim, and some musculoskeletal problems. In previous similar shorter term (eg, three months) interventions, self reported or objectively measured work performance were not negatively or positively affected. Our findings suggest that this type of intervention may take time to positively affect work performance, as these differences were observed in the present study at six and 12 months.

### Ergonomics in the anaesthetic workplace: guideline from the association of anaesthetists [^7a8168cf]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Lithotomy position

Putting the patient safely into this position depends on the patient's weight. If the patient is not excessively overweight this can usually be done with one person per leg. It is important to move both legs simultaneously to prevent damage to the patient's pelvis.

Positions achievable using mechanical theatre tables

There are a number of other positions that can be achieved using modern mechanical theatre tables (e.g. the beach chair and Trendelenburg positions). This protects operating theatre staff from musculoskeletal injury, but puts patients at risk, therefore knowledge and training in how to operate the theatre table is essential.

Special circumstances

Certain patients, such as those with proven or suspected unstable vertebral fractures, require extra precautions in order to position them safely. This will often involve specialist pieces of equipment and staff members trained in their use.

Intra‐operative phase

The operating theatre should be 55 m 2 and have a recommended 20 air changes per hour.

Anaesthetists often remain seated during maintenance of anaesthesia and should follow the same advice that is advocated for staff that spend time at a desk working at a computer screen. The anaesthetist must monitor the patient, administer medications and perform other interventions that require frequent changes in posture. The anaesthetist should remain outside the immediate surgical area for purposes of infection prevention and control. There should be ergonomic seating and a desk for documentation (Box 2).

Arrangement of desk and seat

The ideal work posture is one where the back is straight or slightly reclined (95–110°)
The shoulders are abducted < 20°
The elbows are flexed at 90–100°
The forearm is pronated with the wrist, hand and forearm in a straight line with the work item
Wrist extension or deviation of more than 15° should be avoided
The lower leg should be perpendicular to the floor
The thighs should be parallel to the floor
The hip joint should be slightly higher than the knee joint
The feet should rest flat on the floor or on a footrest

### Effectiveness of an intervention for reducing sitting time and improving health in office workers: three arm cluster randomised controlled trial [^668af2f5]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention, with and without a height adjustable desk, on daily sitting time, and to investigate the relative effectiveness of the two interventions, and the effectiveness of both interventions on physical behaviours and physical, biochemical, psychological, and work related health and performance outcomes.

Design

Cluster three arm randomised controlled trial with follow-up at three and 12 months.

Setting

Local government councils in Leicester, Liverpool, and Greater Manchester, UK.

Participants

78 clusters including 756 desk based employees in defined offices, departments, or teams from two councils in Leicester, three in Greater Manchester, and one in Liverpool.

Interventions

Clusters were randomised to one of three conditions: the SMART Work and Life (SWAL) intervention, the SWAL intervention with a height adjustable desk (SWAL plus desk), or control (usual practice).

Main outcomes measures

The primary outcome measure was daily sitting time, assessed by accelerometry, at 12 month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were accelerometer assessed sitting, prolonged sitting, standing and stepping time, and physical activity calculated over any valid day, work hours, workdays, and non-workdays, self-reported lifestyle behaviours, musculoskeletal problems, cardiometabolic health markers, work related health and performance, fatigue, and psychological measures.

Results

Mean age of participants was 44.7 years, 72.4% (n = 547) were women, and 74.9% (n = 566) were white. Daily sitting time at 12 months was significantly lower in the intervention groups (SWAL −22.2 min/day, 95% confidence interval −38.8 to −5.7 min/day, P = 0.003; SWAL plus desk −63.7 min/day, −80.1 to −47.4 min/day, P < 0.001) compared with the control group. The SWAL plus desk intervention was found to be more effective than SWAL at changing sitting time (−41.7 min/day, −56.3 to −27.0 min/day, P < 0.001). Favourable differences in sitting and prolonged sitting time at three and 12 month follow-ups for both intervention groups and for standing time for the SWAL plus desk group were observed during work hours and on workdays. Both intervention groups were associated with small improvements in stress, wellbeing, and vigour, and the SWAL plus desk group was associated with improvements in pain in the lower extremity, social norms for sitting and standing at work, and support.

Conclusions

Both SWAL and SWAL plus desk were associated with a reduction in sitting time, although the addition of a height adjustable desk was found to be threefold more effective.

### Noninvasive spinal stimulation safely enables upright posture in children with spinal cord injury [^229be61a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The participant was instructed to sit relaxed (or as he/she would normally sit without support) and report any discomfort while stimulation intensity was increased in 5–10 mA increments until the threshold for induction of upright posture was reached. Stimulation optimization (from stimulation on to stimulation off) for each electrode location took anywhere from 3 to 5 min, depending on the maximum stimulation intensity needed for each of the participants to achieve the upright sitting posture and whether the adjustment of the parameters (e.g. stimulation frequency) was needed. For T11 and L1 stimulation sites, the upright posture-inducing threshold was determined as the intensity where there was a visible increase in thoracic and lumbar trunk extension and achievement of upright sitting posture (T11: 140 mA ± 23.1, L1: 134 mA ± 40). Due to increased sensitivity in the neck region, the intensity of stimulation at C5 was increased in smaller increments and only to the point of comfortable tolerance based on the participants' verbal feedback (38 mA ± 20). After upright-posture inducing thresholds were determined individually for each of the electrode locations, stimulation was turned on at all three locations. This was achieved by, first, turning on and ramping up the stimulation at T11, then L1, and then C5 if tolerated by the participant. Stimulation intensity at T11 and L1 was kept 10–20 mA lower than the maximum stimulation intensity tested during stimulation optimization for each location separately to avoid a possibility of lower extremity motor responses evocation. The duration of stimulation at all three or two channels was maintained for 2–3 min, while the BP and pain assessments were taken and then ramped down, one channel at a time. Altogether, each participant received 15–20 min of stimulation.

### Ergonomics in the operating room [^6f572a0e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Ergonomic interventions to be considered

Previous studies have shown that the most effective way to avoid ergonomic problems is a neutral body posture. Several adaptations have contributed to this, such as endoscopic instruments that have been redesigned, the adjustability of the table height, and the optimal placement of the monitor. Combining these features will avoid a non-neutral posture in surgeons. In addition, when operating with two surgeons, small adjustments can be made for the assisting surgeon to obtain a neutral position as well; by placing a second monitor and, if there is a mismatch in height, add a small bench for one of the two surgeons. Furthermore, various forms of exercise in order to strengthen the core muscles can improve the physical condition. In addition, the musculoskeletal system can be relieved by the use of orthopaedic foot gear, a brace, or even an exoskeleton. Depending on a surgeon's individual complaint(s), aforementioned adaptations can be considered to achieve an ergonomic body posture.

In the past, various studies have been conducted to evaluate musculoskeletal complaints among surgeons. Several recommendations have been made to reduce complaints. Nevertheless, occupational musculoskeletal complaints among surgeons still exist. Surgeons with a positive medical history seem to report a higher occurrence of previous or current musculoskeletal complaints. Respondents' most frequently reported complaints were pain in the neck, the (lower) back, and shoulders. Most of the musculoskeletal complaints were only present while performing surgical procedures. No significant difference was found when comparing respondents who performed more endoscopic and more open surgery. Surgeons used analgesics and/or therapy to reduce their complaints, and even sick leave was necessary to fully recover. About half of the respondents with complaints made ergonomic adjustments in the operating room to prevent future complaints. The latter would be interesting for future research to develop a programme that could reduce musculoskeletal complaints and associated sick leave during a surgeon's career.

### Automatic adaptation of neurostimulation therapy in response to changes in patient position: results of the posture responsive spinal cord stimulation (PRS) research study [^f3332534]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Variation in the intensity of neurostimulation with body position is a practical problem for many patients implanted with a spinal cord stimulation system because positional changes may result in overstimulation or understimulation. These posture-related changes in patients' perception of paresthesia can affect therapeutic outcomes of spinal cord stimulation therapy. An accelerometer-based algorithm that automatically adjusts spinal cord stimulation based on sensed body position or activity represents a potential solution to the problem of position-mediated variations in paresthesia perception.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare patient satisfaction ratings for manual versus automatic adjustment of spinal cord stimulation amplitude in response to positional changes.

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial

Setting

2 pain centers in the US.

Method

Twenty patients at 2 centers in the U.S. who had been implanted with a spinal cord stimulation system for low back and/or leg pain were enrolled in the study. During a 3-day run-in phase, patient position and activity changes were monitored with an ambulatory data recorder and with a research patient programmer which recorded all stimulation parameter changes. Patients who made ≥ 2 amplitude adjustments per 24-hour period were invited to participate in an in-clinic phase. During the in-clinic phase, patients' preferred stimulation amplitude and therapy impedance measured at the preferred stimulation amplitude were determined as they performed a series of 8 physical tasks. Satisfaction ratings were determined during position transitions between the physical tasks using both manual and automatic adjustments.

Results

Among the 15 patients who completed the in-clinic test protocol, overall satisfaction ratings were significantly higher for automatic adjustment of stimulation amplitudes versus manual adjustments. Patients reported statistically significant improvements with automatic versus manual adjustment for the standing to supine transition and for supine to standing transition. Approximately 74% of participants rated the paresthesia intensity of the automatic adjustment algorithm as "just right" for the physical tasks that were completed.

Limitations

Small study size.

Conclusion

Patients preferred automatic versus manual adjustment of stimulation amplitude in response to changes in paresthesia consequent to positional changes during in-clinic testing.

### Effectiveness of the stand more AT (SMArT) work intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial [^2b53b32f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention (Stand More AT (SMArT) Work) designed to reduce sitting time on short (three months), medium (six months), and longer term (12 months) changes in occupational, daily, and prolonged sitting, standing, and physical activity, and physical, psychological, and work related health.

Design

Cluster two arm randomised controlled trial.

Setting

National Health Service trust, England.

Participants

37 office clusters (146 participants) of desk based workers: 19 clusters (77 participants) were randomised to the intervention and 18 (69 participants) to control.

Interventions

The intervention group received a height adjustable workstation, a brief seminar with supporting leaflet, workstation instructions with sitting and standing targets, feedback on sitting and physical activity at three time points, posters, action planning and goal setting booklet, self monitoring and prompt tool, and coaching sessions (month 1 and every three months thereafter). The control group continued with usual practice.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was occupational sitting time (thigh worn accelerometer). Secondary outcomes were objectively measured daily sitting, prolonged sitting (≥ 30 minutes), and standing time, physical activity, musculoskeletal problems, self reported work related health (job performance, job satisfaction, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, and sickness absenteeism), cognitive function, and self reported psychological measures (mood and affective states, quality of life) assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equation models, accounting for clustering.

Results

A significant difference between groups (in favour of the intervention group) was found in occupational sitting time at 12 months (−83.28 min/workday, 95% confidence interval −116.57 to −49.98, P = 0.001). Differences between groups (in favour of the intervention group compared with control) were observed for occupational sitting time at three months (−50.62 min/workday, −78.71 to −22.54, P < 0.001) and six months (−64.40 min/workday, −97.31 to −31.50, P < 0.001) and daily sitting time at six months (−59.32 min/day, −88.40 to −30.25, P < 0.001) and 12 months (−82.39 min/day, −114.54 to −50.26, P = 0.001). Group differences (in favour of the intervention group compared with control) were found for prolonged sitting time, standing time, job performance, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, daily anxiety, and quality of life. No differences were seen for sickness absenteeism.

Conclusions

SMArT Work successfully reduced sitting time over the short, medium, and longer term, and positive changes were observed in work related and psychological health.

### Preliminary study: reliability of the spinal wheel. A novel device to measure spinal postures applied to sitting and standing [^47a3981a]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Postural re-education is an integral part of physiotherapy management in patients with back pain. Although the link between posture and back pain is largely unknown, postural re-education is performed on the premise of optimizing spinal alignment to minimize stresses on the passive structures of the spine, to facilitate optimal muscular support and thus to prevent possible damage and further pain. A reliable and clinically meaningful measurement of spinal postures to monitor such interventions remains challenging. This study evaluated within-day (intra-tester, inter-tester) and between-day (test-retest) reliability of a novel spinal wheel device measuring thoracic and lumbar postures during sitting and standing. 17 healthy volunteers (age 39.5 ± 5.4, BMI 25 ± 9.2; 9 males) were measured three times, by three testers, on two separate occasions (1 week apart). The angular change between C7 and T12 and between T12 and S1 provided thoracic and lumbar curvatures, respectively. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals and typical error were calculated. Excellent reliability was demonstrated with intra-tester ICCs between 0.947 and 0.980 and typical error between 1.7 degrees and 3.7 degrees and inter-tester ICCs between 0.949 and 0.986 and typical error between 2.0 degrees and 4.7 degrees. Test-retest reliability was high with ICCs 0.719–0.908 and typical error between 4.0 degrees and 7.4 degrees. In conclusion, the spinal wheel demonstrated excellent within-day and high between-day reliability. The device may be used in conjunction with 2D camcorder to provide clinically useful visual evaluation of postures for assessment, intervention monitoring, and feedback during postural re-education.

### The prevalence of redundant nerve roots in standing positional MRI decreases by half in supine and almost to zero in flexed seated position: a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study [^1c7510f8]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Experimental cadaver studies, myelographic and CT-myelographic investigations, and positional MRI studies have shown that posture influences lumbar lordosis (LL), length of the spinal canal (LSC), segmental anteroposterior diameter (APD), and dural cross-sectional area (DCSA) of the lumbar spine. Transitioning from the extended spinal canal (standing) to the inflected (bent forward sitting) decreases the lordotic angle, increases the length of the lumbar spine, and increases the capacitance of the spinal canal.

However, additional parameters are required to diagnose patients with degenerative central lumbar spinal stenosis (cLSS) presenting with redundant nerve roots (RNR) confirmed by MRI. First, we investigated the influence of four relevant postures on daily living. These are as follows: STA, which increases pain when lasts a long time; SUP, which during sleep is associated with 71% of patients affected by cLSS with nocturnal cramps; SIT, which relieves the pain partially; and FLEX, which relieves pain as much as possible. Furthermore, psoas relaxed SUP is the standard positioning for MRI investigations due to lumbar stenosis. Second, we analyzed the influence of postural changes on the prevalence of RNR (Fig. 1).

### Effectiveness of the stand more AT (SMArT) work intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial [^f1bb746e]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Environmental strategies — After attendance at a seminar (see individual and group strategies for more information), participants were provided with a height adjustable desk or desk platform to enable them to sit or stand to work. They were given a choice between a full sized electric desk (twin leg single step stand desk 1200×800, MACOI, Kimbolton, UK), which allows the desk top to move up and down, or a choice of two sizes of desk platform (Pro Plus 30 or Pro Plus 48, VARIDESK; TX), which sits on the existing desk allowing the computer screen and keyboard to be moved up and down. This choice allowed flexibility for office set-up and to avoid testing the effectiveness of a specific type of desk rather than the height adjustable desk concept. We provided a brief training session on how to use the desk or platform and on the ergonomic set-up. A leaflet was also provided to reinforce these messages.

### Ergonomics in the anaesthetic workplace: guideline from the association of anaesthetists [^5d181a03]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the purposes of this guideline, we define ergonomics as the scientific study of the interaction between anaesthetists and their workspace environment to promote safety, performance and well‐being. Musculoskeletal problems, such as back pain, account for 40% of sickness absence among NHS staff and cost approximately £400 million per year. Legally, employers are obliged to provide a safe working environment for their staff. Under the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 (as amended), employers are required to avoid the need for hazardous manual handling, so far as is reasonably practicable; assess the risk of injury from any hazardous manual handling that cannot be avoided; and reduce the risk of injury from hazardous manual handling, so far as is reasonably practicable. It requires employees to follow appropriate systems of work laid down for their safety; make proper use of equipment provided for their safety; co‐operate with their employer on health and safety matters; inform the employer if they identify hazardous handling activities; and take care to ensure their activities do not put others at risk.

The foundation for avoiding pain or discomfort at work is to adopt and maintain a good posture. What is considered a 'good' posture does not change significantly whether the anaesthetist is sitting or standing. The basic principles remain the same; everyone should aim to keep their posture as natural and neutral as possible. A neutral posture is one where the individual remains upright and forward facing with their arms close to their body. The arrangement of the patient, equipment and monitoring should not result in the anaesthetist reaching or looking behind their sitting or standing position. The anaesthetic team should wear comfortable clothing and temperature, humidity and light should be adequate at all times. They should comply with infection prevention and control guidelines and monitoring as recommended by the Association.

### Differences in sitting postures are associated with nonspecific chronic low back pain disorders when patients are subclassified [^1f901456]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

A comparative study.

Objectives

To investigate sitting postures of asymptomatic individuals and nonspecific chronic low back pain (NS-CLBP) patients (pooled and subclassified) and evaluate the importance of subclassification.

Summary Of Background

Currently, little evidence exists to support the hypothesis that CLBP patients sit differently from pain-free controls. Although classifying NS-CLBP patients into homogeneous subgroups has been previously emphasized, no attempts have been made to consider such groupings when examining seated posture.

Methods

Three angles (sacral tilt, lower lumbar, and upper lumbar) were measured during "usual" and "slumped" sitting in 33 NS-CLBP patients and 34 asymptomatic subjects using an electromagnetic measurement device. Before testing, NS-CLBP patients were subclassified by two blinded clinicians. Twenty patients were classified with a flexion motor control impairment and 13 with an active extension motor control impairment.

Results

No differences were found between control and NS-CLBP (pooled) patients during usual sitting. In contrast, analyses based on subclassification revealed that patients classified with an active extension pattern sat more lordotic at the symptomatic lower lumbar spine, whereas patients with a flexion pattern sat more kyphotic, when compared with healthy controls (F = 19.7; df1 = 2, df2 = 63, P < 0.001). Further, NS-CLBP patients had less ability to change their posture when asked to slump from usual sitting (t = 4.2, df = 65; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Differences in usual sitting posture were only revealed when NS-CLBP patients were subclassified. This highlights the importance of subclassifying NS-CLBP patients.

### Reallocating desk workers' sitting time to standing or stepping: associations with work performance [^04c63f53]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This study is the first to investigate the associations of reallocating occupational sitting time to stepping/standing with desk workers' performance using isotemporal substitution models. There are some limitations to this study. We were unable to infer a cause-and-effect relationship between sitting time, standing/stepping and work performance due to the cross-sectional design. The study participants were recruited from the internet, with a low response rate, which may lead to limited generalizability due to self-selection. Replications with a nationally representative sample can corroborate the findings. There were some residual confounding factors, for example, physical disorders need to be considered when investigating the relationships between behaviours and work performance. Self-reported measures of behaviours and work performance indicators may be subject to bias due to erroneous recall and/or social desirability. Research using objective measures for behaviours and work-related performance (e.g. monitors and work-related reports) is required. The design of question did not allow for separating occupational standing and stepping behaviours; it was also not able to identify the types of activities that workers were doing while sitting. Previous research suggested that standing and stepping may have different effects on health risks and work performance. A study that measured sitting time using accelerometers and logbooks also reported marked differences in the associations of work presenteeism with sitting time during work hours for doing work and having lunch. Future studies are encouraged to apply measures of sedentary and upright behaviours, with information on the time of day and type of work activity, to provide a better understanding of the relationships between sitting-to-standing or -stepping reallocation and work performance indicators.

In conclusion, there are putative benefits of reallocating occupational sitting to standing/stepping on work engagement, with limited impact on presenteeism or absenteeism. Work practices that support more time being spent standing and stepping during work hours, with decreased sitting behaviours, are likely to be helpful in improving desk workers' overall performance. Longitudinal studies using both self-reported and objective measures of these physical behaviours and indicators of work performance are required to corroborate the relationships identified, to inform the development of strategies that can benefit desk workers and their productivity.

### Workplace interventions for increasing standing or walking for decreasing musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers [^0220263c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers is high. Interventions that promote occupational standing or walking have been found to reduce occupational sedentary time, but it is unclear whether these interventions ameliorate musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers.

Objectives

To investigate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase standing or walking for decreasing musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, OSH UPDATE, PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to January 2019. We also screened reference lists of primary studies and contacted experts to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs), quasi RCTs, and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies of interventions to reduce or break up workplace sitting by encouraging standing or walking in the workplace among workers with musculoskeletal symptoms. The primary outcome was self-reported intensity or presence of musculoskeletal symptoms by body region and the impact of musculoskeletal symptoms such as pain-related disability. We considered work performance and productivity, sickness absenteeism, and adverse events such as venous disorders or perinatal complications as secondary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for study eligibility. These review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors to request additional data when required. We used GRADE considerations to assess the quality of evidence provided by studies that contributed to the meta-analyses.

Main Results

We found ten studies including three RCTs, five cluster RCTs, and two CBA studies with a total of 955 participants, all from high-income countries. Interventions targeted changes to the physical work environment such as provision of sit-stand or treadmill workstations (four studies), an activity tracker (two studies) for use in individual approaches, and multi-component interventions (five studies). We did not find any studies that specifically targeted only the organisational level components. Two studies assessed pain-related disability. Physical work environment There was no significant difference in the intensity of low back symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.80 to 0.10; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) nor in the intensity of upper back symptoms (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -.096 to 0.00; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) in the short term (less than six months) for interventions using sit-stand workstations compared to no intervention. No studies examined discomfort outcomes at medium (six to less than 12 months) or long term (12 months and more). No significant reduction in pain-related disability was noted when a sit-stand workstation was used compared to when no intervention was provided in the medium term (mean difference (MD) -0.4, 95% CI -2.70 to 1.90; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). Individual approach There was no significant difference in the intensity or presence of low back symptoms (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.77; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), upper back symptoms (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.84; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.78; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), shoulder symptoms (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), or elbow/wrist and hand symptoms (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions involving an activity tracker compared to an alternative intervention or no intervention in the short term. No studies provided outcomes at medium term, and only one study examined outcomes at long term. Organisational level No studies evaluated the effects of interventions solely targeted at the organisational level. Multi-component approach There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants reporting low back symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.27; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence), shoulder symptoms (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.80; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), and upper back symptoms (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions using a multi-component approach compared to no intervention in the short term. Only one RCT examined outcomes at medium term and found no significant difference in low back symptoms (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.95 to 1.15; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence), upper back symptoms (MD -0.70, 95% CI -2.12 to 0.72; low-quality evidence), and leg symptoms (MD -0.80, 95% CI -2.49 to 0.89; low-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants reporting low back symptoms (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.40; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence), neck symptoms (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; two RCTs; low-quality evidence), and upper back symptoms (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.29; 2 RCTs; low-quality evidence) for interventions using a multi-component approach compared to no intervention in the long term. There was a statistically significant reduction in pain-related disability following a multi-component intervention compared to no intervention in the medium term (MD -8.80, 95% CI -17.46 to -0.14; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available limited evidence does not show that interventions to increase standing or walking in the workplace reduced musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers at short-, medium-, or long-term follow up. The quality of evidence is low or very low, largely due to study design and small sample sizes. Although the results of this review are not statistically significant, some interventions targeting the physical work environment are suggestive of an intervention effect. Therefore, in the future, larger cluster-RCTs recruiting participants with baseline musculoskeletal symptoms and long-term outcomes are needed to determine whether interventions to increase standing or walking can reduce musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers and can be sustained over time.

### Treatment algorithms for continuous low-level heat wrap therapy for the management of musculoskeletal pain: an Italian position paper [^f52a7435]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Back Pain

Lumbosacral pain is characterized by discomfort felt in the region between the lower rib cage and buttock creases, with the potential to radiate into the legs. This type of pain is also referred to as lumbar pain. According to the World Health Organization, low back pain (LBP) is the most common type of musculoskeletal conditions, affecting nearly everyone at some point in their lives.LBP is currently the leading cause of disability. Globally, 619 million people were diagnosed with LBP in 2020; by 2050, this number is projected to rise to 843 million, primarily due to population growth and aging. There is a general upward trend in prevalence from birth to age 80, with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 50 and 55. LBP is more prevalent in women.LBP can manifest as specific or non-specific. In the former, the pain originates from a disease or structural issue in the spine or radiates from another region of the body. In the latter, the inability to identify a specific disease or structural cause for the pain characterizes the condition. In approximately 90% of cases, there is no clear cause for LBP.

Symptoms

Back pain is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors and is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that have been thoroughly researched and documented in an enormous amount of published research. Symptoms can range from intense, deep pain to long-lasting, throbbing discomfort. These symptoms are typically centered in the lower back or middle back. In some cases, patients report discomfort that spreads to the limbs, in addition to sensations of tingling, numbness, or paralysis, all of which are indicative of the possibility of nerve involvement. Musculoskeletal symptoms, which include rigidity, muscle spasms, and restricted movement, are regularly experienced by individuals. These symptoms frequently exacerbate functional restrictions and reduce overall well-being. Additionaly, discomfort typically becomes more severe with intense physical activity, extended periods of standing or sitting, and during the night, leading to disruptions in normal sleep rhythms. Anxiety and depression often occur concurrently, adding another layer of complication to the clinical presentation. Due to the complex interaction of various symptoms, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment is necessary. This highlights the relevance of individualized treatment strategies for managing the numerous forms of back pain. It is imperative that the treatment be multimodal and in accordance with the most recent standards established by both national and international organizations.

### Feasibility and behavioral effects of prolonged static and dynamic standing as compared to sitting in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^25410bcc]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in older adults and is expected to reach endemic proportions as it is predicted to increase by 54% from 2015 to 2030 in the United States of America. Over 30% of older adults probably have evidence of pre-diabetic insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in older adults is especially problematic as it impacts both physical and cognitive function. Hence, effective control of T2DM and its sequelae is of utmost importance in this geriatric population.

Sedentary behavior has been strongly associated with the development of diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, the modern home- and workplace environment promote sedentary behavior. This is further exacerbated by significant barriers to exercise and physical activity in T2DM patients, such as poor tolerance to physical effort, development of pain with physical activity, and lack of motivation. Older adult T2DM patients are more likely to be physically inactive and adherence to an exercise program to meet recommended minimum guidelines appears to be an elusive goal in these patients.

Simple intermittent non-exercise interruption of prolonged inactivity during daily life could potentially represent a more feasible target in older adult T2DM patients. For example, even a modest increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary time may significantly improve health, especially in the most inactive older adults. Upright standing represents the most rudimentary form of physical activity and may have specific metabolic benefits in T2DM. Several studies, mainly conducted in office workers, have shown beneficial effects of desktop standing on metabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance and glycemic excursion. Non-exercise physical activity interventions that can be performed at home while integrating this with routine activities of daily living may provide an attractive means to reduce sedentariness and improve diabetic control in older adult patients with diabetes.

The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of 4h standing sessions while performing routine desktop activities as a non-exercise physical activity intervention in older adults with T2DM to increase non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). The primary hypothesis was that 4h standing behind a height-adjustable desk is feasible in an older adult population with T2DM. We also hypothesized that standing while performing weight-shifting movements will lead to additional increase in oxygen uptake as compared to normal more 'static' stance. Finally, we explored secondary outcome parameters of net duration of standing time, total movement, rate of musculoskeletal discomfort development and leg swelling, and performance on a cognitive task during the different sessions.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^41aea36f]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — working definition: Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis describes a condition in which there is diminished space available for the neural and vascular elements in the lumbar spine secondary to degenerative changes in the spinal canal, producing when symptomatic a variable clinical syndrome of gluteal and/or lower extremity pain and/or fatigue which may occur with or without back pain. Symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis has characteristic provocative and palliative features, with provocative features including upright exercise such as walking or positionally-induced neurogenic claudication and palliative features commonly including symptomatic relief with forward flexion, sitting and/or recumbency.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^d5f406ad]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Fifth, the foregoing conditions should exist in the absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. The patient should exhibit a normal lower extremity neurologic exam without marked motor weakness or other deficits. Dermatomal radiation and other neurologic symptoms such as motor weakness and numbness are absent with discogenic pain.

Patients demonstrating the foregoing constellation of signs and symptoms for greater than six months can be classified diagnostically as exhibiting lumbar discogenic pain (Figure 1, Box 2). We provide the following acronym, DISCS, as a helpful cue in the initial assessment of the back pain patient:

D - Duration of symptoms: Chronic pain persisting for more than six months.

I - Increased pain with flexion: Pain is aggravated with forward flexion due to annular strain.

S - Sitting intolerance: The patient shows limited sitting tolerance, typically less than 30 minutes.

C - Central back pain: Axial midline pain without radicular symptoms.

S - Sustained hip flexion test: Pain is reproduced with sustained hip flexion in the supine position, distinguishing discogenic pain.

### How to optimize your work environment and stay healthy | Blogs… [^b7d97065]. blogs.cdc.gov (2020). Medium credibility.

Start with creating a work-ready environment. Find space in your home where noise, lighting and temperature can be well-controlled. Even if you are home alone, a dedicated workspace will help keep you focused. A properly designed workspace can help prevent workplace musculoskeletal disorders. Seating
- An office chair with armrests is ideal for seating, allowing your feet to rest flat on the floor with the hips and knees at, or slightly greater than, a 90. oangle. If your feet aren't flat on the floor, use a box or book as a footrest.
- In general, avoid working on a couch or soft chairs. If you have no other option, use pillows to provide some back support and work in an upright position.
- Varying your posture regularly is beneficial. If possible, periodically work standing up as a break to prolonged sitting.
- Working for prolonged periods of time at a kitchen table or while on the sofa can be uncomfortable for many.

Ideally, a primary seated posture should support the low back in a position of lordosis – the natural inward curvature of the lumbar spine above the pelvis. This is shown in photo A below. Photo B shows an ordinary flat back chair which does not support the inward curvature of the low back. There are creative ways to devise a lumbar support pad or roll that can be attached to the back of an ordinary chair.
- Try the 20/20/20 rule to help combat eye fatigue. Focus your gaze on an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Take a Break.
- Periodic rest breaks and changes in posture are beneficial.
- NIOSH research has found that overall levels of musculoskeletal discomfort and eyestrain are significantly reduced when twice-daily conventional rest breaks were supplemented with hourly 5-minute breaks.
- Take at least one prolonged break.
- Set a timer for your other 5-minute break from screens and from sitting.

Stretch, walk the dog or yourself, climb a set of stairs, get the mail, or rehydrate. Paying attention to your home office setup can help prevent physical discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders. When combined with monitoring your physical and mental health, some of the possible negative effects of this unprecedented work-at-home experience can be avoided. The good news is that raising awareness of these principles will also help improve your "regular" work environment when we one day return.

### Changes in head and neck posture using an office chair with and without lumbar roll support [^db9e9ba5]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

A repeated measures observational study.

Objective

To investigate change in sagittal alignment of head and neck posture in response to adjustments of an office chair with and without a lumbar roll in situ.

Summary Of Background Data

Forward head posture has been identified as a risk factor for neck pain, and there is evidence to show that ergonomic correction in sitting may reduce the incidence of pain. The effect placement of a lumbar roll has on cervical spine posture has not been previously investigated experimentally but rather, is assumed to have a positive influence on head and neck posture.

Methods

Thirty healthy male participants (18–30 years) were photographed while registered in the natural head resting position in each of 4 sitting positions with and without a lumbar roll in situ. Two positions incorporated adjustments to the back rest and 1 to the seat pan of the office chair. The craniovertebral (CV) angle, as a determinant of head and neck posture was measured from the set of digitized photographs obtained for each participant. Comparisons between the CV angle in all postural registrations were made using a mixed model analysis adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Results

Of the positions examined, significant differences in the mean CV angles were found with the backrest of the chair at 100 degrees and at 110 degrees (P < 0.001). With the lumbar roll in situ and the backrest position at 110 degrees, there was a significant increase in the mean CV compared with the angle without the lumbar roll in situ (2.32 degrees, 95% confidence interval: 1.31–3.33; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The degree of angulation of the backrest support of an office chair plus the addition of lumbar roll support are the 2 most important factors to be taken into account when considering seating factors likely to favorably change head and neck postural alignment, at least in asymptomatic subjects.

### Associations of device-measured sitting, standing, and stepping time with informal face-to-face interactions at work [^32c79fa3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This cross-sectional study examined the interrelationships between workplace movement (sitting, standing, and stepping), availability of discussion space, and face-to-face (FTF) interactions between workers.

Methods

Desk-based workers (n = 221) wore an activity monitor for 7 days and self-reported their weekly frequency of FTF interactions and discussion space availability. Negative binomial regression models examined behavioral and spatial factors associated with the frequency of FTF interactions.

Results

Adjusted for potential confounders, each one standard deviation increment in time spent sitting, standing, stepping, and discussion space availability was associated with 20% lower (P = 0.004), 19% higher (P = 0.003), 6% higher (P = 0.16), and 11% higher (P = 0.26) frequency of FTF interactions, respectively CONCLUSIONS:: Lower workplace sitting was often linked to reduced risk of chronic diseases. Our findings suggest that less sitting at work may have additional benefits of increasing informal interactions between office workers.

### Changes in musculoskeletal pain among computer workers when working from home [^1c85be60]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1 depicts the characteristics of the study population. Slightly more men than women participated (49.9% vs 49.1%), and more than 50% of study subjects were university graduates. The median age was 48 years. The proportion of participants with poor or fair general health and with more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety was statistically significantly higher at t1 compared with t0. During the pandemic, 14% of office workers experienced a reduction in physical activity and 29% experienced an increase and 7% a reduction in body weight.

TABLE 1
Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Study Population

At the time of the survey (t1), 922 subjects (87%) worked remotely at least some of the time, with a median of 18 hours per week (IQR 10–24). Before the pandemic (t0), considerably fewer subjects (39%) had engaged in remote work and spent fewer working hours at home (median 10 hours per week, P WSR < 0.0001). A total of 96 participants (9%) had not worked remotely at all. The ergonomic remote workstation equipment according to the WFH score could be considered as very good at t1. About three quarters of the 968 subjects who had ever worked remotely were well or even optimally equipped. Specifically, 69% of WFH respondents reported optimal seating, that is, using an optimally height-adjusted chair (seating score = 3), 76% used an additional monitor, and 78% used an external keyboard and/or computer mouse. A total of 271 participants (28%) stated that they were able to work standing up or at a desk with optimal height adjustment. During the pandemic, about half of the WFH employees improved their remote workstation equipment.

### STRESS… At work (99–101) | NIOSH… [^7bdc280c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Example: David is exposed to constant noise at work. Job Stress and Health Stress sets off an alarm in the brain, which responds by preparing the body for defensive action. The nervous system is aroused and hormones are released to sharpen the senses, quicken the pulse, deepen respiration, and tense the muscles. This response is important because it helps us defend against threatening situations. The response is preprogrammed biologically. Everyone responds in much the same way, regardless of whether the stressful situation is at work or home. Short-lived or infrequent episodes of stress pose little risk. But when stressful situations go unresolved, the body is kept in a constant state of activation, which increases the rate of wear and tear to biological systems. Ultimately, fatigue or damage results, and the ability of the body to repair and defend itself can become seriously compromised.

As a result, the risk of injury or disease escalates. Early Warning Signs of Job Stress Job Stress and Health: What the Research Tells Us Cardiovascular Disease Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Musculoskeletal Disorders On the basis of research by NIOSH and many other organizations, it is widely believed that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper- extremity musculoskeletal disorders. In one study, the frequency of medication errors declined by 50% after prevention activities were implemented in a 700-bed hospital. In a second study, there was a 70% reduction in malpractice claims in 22 hospitals that implemented stress prevention activities. In contrast, there was no reduction in claims in a matched group of 22 hospitals that did not implement stress prevention activities.

What Can Be Done About Job Stress. The examples of Theresa and David illustrate two different approaches for dealing with stress at work. Stress management training may rapidly reduce stress symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbances; it also has the advantage of being inexpensive and easy to implement. However, stress management programs have two major disadvantages:

- The beneficial effects on stress symptoms are often short-lived.

### Creating consensus in the definition of spinopelvic mobility [^f3b468aa]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding Relaxed-Seated Analysis

Relaxed-seated analysis is a passive process used to replicate the simultaneous relaxation of the lumbar spine and subsequent accompanying posterior pelvic tilt that occurs when sitting. Therefore, in relaxed-seated analysis, patients with lumbosacral hypomobility (stiff spines), defined as < 10° to 20° change in pelvic tilt or sacral slope from standing to sitting, have limited passive relaxation of their lumbar lordosis, which subsequently drives a limited posterior pelvic tilt. Buckland et alfound lumbar spinal degeneration to exist on a spectrum with the most severe spinal degeneration being associated with the greatest reduction in posterior pelvic tilt during relaxed sitting. Heckmann et al explained that decreased pelvic motion from degenerative lumbar stiffness is accompanied by increased femoral motion to allow for changes in posture. These patients are again considered hip users. Specifically, for every 1 degree of loss of pelvic mobility, femoral mobility must increase by 1° to allow for an upright position during sitting.

Alternatively, greater-than-usual change in posterior pelvic tilt with relaxed-seated analysis occurs in response to reduced hip range of motion — patients with stiff hips are spine users. Using severe hip osteoarthritis as a surrogate for hip stiffness, Buckland et alfound that those patients with severe hip osteoarthritis had twice as large a change in posterior pelvic tilt when going from standing to relaxed sitting (P < 0.001). They concluded that when patients are unable to flex their hips to sit in a chair because of degenerative changes causing capsular contractures and pain, they require greater posterior pelvic tilt to achieve a seated position. Similarly, patients with hip flexion contractures may require anterior pelvic tilt to stand. In a study looking at 136 patients with this type of pelvic hypermobility defined as a change in sacral slope from standing to sitting ≥ 30°, Sculco et alfound that pelvic hypermobility resolved in 95% of these patients after THA. This supports the notion that hip stiffness requires greater change in pelvic tilt to achieve sitting and standing positions; once hip motion improves, apparent pelvic hypermobility is alleviated (Figure 1).

### Lumbar spinal loads and lumbar muscle forces evaluation with various lumbar supports and backrest inclination angles in driving posture [^7232495c]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The low back pain of professional drivers could be linked to excessive lumbar load. This study aims at developing a musculoskeletal model to study the lumbar spinal loads and lumbar muscle forces of the human body in driving posture, so as to contribute to a better understanding of low back pain and to improve the design of vehicle seats.

Methods

A standing musculoskeletal model, including limbs, head and neck, that can reflect several activities of daily living was established based on the Christophy spine model. The model was then validated by comparing the calculated lumbar loads and muscle forces to the experimental data in the previous studies. Referring to radiology studies, the musculoskeletal model was adjusted into different driving postures with several different lumbar supports (0, 2 and 4 cm) and inclinations of the backrest (from 23° to 33°, by 2° intervals). The lumbar biomechanical load with various lumbar supports and backrest inclination angles was calculated.

Results

The results showed that the overall lumbar spinal load and lumbar muscle force with 4 cm lumbar support were reduced by 11.30 and 26.24%. The lumbar spinal loads and lumbar muscle forces increased first and then decreased with the increase in backrest inclination angles from 23° to 33°. The lumbar biomechanical load varied slightly with the backrest inclination angles from 29° to 33°.

Conclusions

There are two findings: (i) the lumbar spinal loads at the L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1, and lumbar muscle forces decreased obviously with the 4 cm lumbar support, while the seat cushion inclination angle was set to 10°. (ii) The recommended backrest inclination angles are 29° to 33° with a 10° seat cushion to the horizontal, which can keep a low level of the lumbar spinal loads and lumbar muscle forces. This study could be used to explain the association between drivers' sitting posture and the lumbar load change, and provide a reference for the prevention of low back pain.

### Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work [^1aad81bb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A large number of people are employed in sedentary occupations. Physical inactivity and excessive sitting at workplaces have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and all-cause mortality.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to 9 August 2017. We also screened reference lists of articles and contacted authors to find more studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over RCTs, cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs), and quasi-RCTs of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before-and-after studies. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self-reported or measured using devices such as an accelerometer-inclinometer and duration and number of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more. We considered energy expenditure, total time spent sitting (including sitting at and outside work), time spent standing at work, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required.

Main Results

We found 34 studies - including two cross-over RCTs, 17 RCTs, seven cluster-RCTs, and eight controlled before-and-after studies - with a total of 3,397 participants, all from high-income countries. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (16 studies), workplace policy changes (four studies), information and counselling (11 studies), and multi-component interventions (four studies). One study included both physical workplace changes and information and counselling components. We did not find any studies that specifically investigated the effects of standing meetings or walking meetings on sitting time. Physical workplace changesInterventions using sit-stand desks, either alone or in combination with information and counselling, reduced sitting time at work on average by 100 minutes per workday at short-term follow-up (up to three months) compared to sit-desks (95% confidence interval (CI) -116 to -84, 10 studies, low-quality evidence). The pooled effect of two studies showed sit-stand desks reduced sitting time at medium-term follow-up (3 to 12 months) by an average of 57 minutes per day (95% CI -99 to -15) compared to sit-desks. Total sitting time (including sitting at and outside work) also decreased with sit-stand desks compared to sit-desks (mean difference (MD) -82 minutes/day, 95% CI -124 to -39, two studies) as did the duration of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more (MD -53 minutes/day, 95% CI -79 to -26, two studies, very low-quality evidence). We found no significant difference between the effects of standing desks and sit-stand desks on reducing sitting at work. Active workstations, such as treadmill desks or cycling desks, had unclear or inconsistent effects on sitting time. Workplace policy changesWe found no significant effects for implementing walking strategies on workplace sitting time at short-term (MD -15 minutes per day, 95% CI -50 to 19, low-quality evidence, one study) and medium-term (MD -17 minutes/day, 95% CI -61 to 28, one study) follow-up. Short breaks (one to two minutes every half hour) reduced time spent sitting at work on average by 40 minutes per day (95% CI -66 to -15, one study, low-quality evidence) compared to long breaks (two 15-minute breaks per workday) at short-term follow-up. Information and counsellingProviding information, feedback, counselling, or all of these resulted in no significant change in time spent sitting at work at short-term follow-up (MD -19 minutes per day, 95% CI -57 to 19, two studies, low-quality evidence). However, the reduction was significant at medium-term follow-up (MD -28 minutes per day, 95% CI -51 to -5, two studies, low-quality evidence). Computer prompts combined with information resulted in no significant change in sitting time at work at short-term follow-up (MD -10 minutes per day, 95% CI -45 to 24, two studies, low-quality evidence), but at medium-term follow-up they produced a significant reduction (MD -55 minutes per day, 95% CI -96 to -14, one study). Furthermore, computer prompting resulted in a significant decrease in the average number (MD -1.1, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.3, one study) and duration (MD -74 minutes per day, 95% CI -124 to -24, one study) of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more. Computer prompts with instruction to stand reduced sitting at work on average by 14 minutes per day (95% CI 10 to 19, one study) more than computer prompts with instruction to walk at least 100 steps at short-term follow-up. We found no significant reduction in workplace sitting time at medium-term follow-up following mindfulness training (MD -23 minutes per day, 95% CI -63 to 17, one study, low-quality evidence). Similarly a single study reported no change in sitting time at work following provision of highly personalised or contextualised information and less personalised or contextualised information. One study found no significant effects of activity trackers on sitting time at work. Multi-component interventions Combining multiple interventions had significant but heterogeneous effects on sitting time at work (573 participants, three studies, very low-quality evidence) and on time spent in prolonged sitting bouts (two studies, very low-quality evidence) at short-term follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

At present there is low-quality evidence that the use of sit-stand desks reduce workplace sitting at short-term and medium-term follow-ups. However, there is no evidence on their effects on sitting over longer follow-up periods. Effects of other types of interventions, including workplace policy changes, provision of information and counselling, and multi-component interventions, are mostly inconsistent. The quality of evidence is low to very low for most interventions, mainly because of limitations in study protocols and small sample sizes. There is a need for larger cluster-RCTs with longer-term follow-ups to determine the effectiveness of different types of interventions to reduce sitting time at work.

### Effectiveness of the stand more AT (SMArT) work intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial [^42b7368a]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

A wealth of epidemiological evidence shows that sedentary behaviour is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers) and mortality, often independently of body mass index (BMI) and physical activity, poor mental health, and a lower quality of life. Office workers are one of the most sedentary populations, spending 70–85% of time at work sitting. It has also been reported that over a third of their total sitting time at work is accumulated in bouts of prolonged sitting (> 30 minutes). Occupational sedentary behaviour specifically has been associated with an increased risk of diabetes and mortalityand musculoskeletal problems such as neck and shoulder pain, as well as being detrimental for important work related outcomes such as engagementand presenteeism. Research on outcomes such as work engagement and presenteeism is, however, limited. These links between sedentary behaviour and health and work related outcomes are important because the estimated costs of presenteeism and absenteeism in the United Kingdom are reported to be more than £30bn ($39bn; €34bn), with presenteeism costing over twice as much as absenteeism. More positively, reductions in sitting and breaking up sitting through standing and walking in acute experimental settings have led to improvements in important cardiometabolic markers of health such as glucose and insulin levels and blood pressure, and feelings of fatigue and vigour.

In response to this evidence, interventions to reduce sitting time in the workplace have received increasing attention in recent years. These have focused on numerous strategies, including physical changes to the workplace, such as providing height adjustable desks to enable sitting or standing, pedalling workstations, treadmill desks, policy changes, information provision, counselling, and computer prompts. While positive findings were observed for some strategies in terms of reducing sitting time, particularly the provision of height adjustable desks, the quality of evidence was considered low for most studies owing to non-powered small studies and studies with a high risk of bias. Furthermore, interventions have typically been evaluated over the short term, so knowledge on longer term effectiveness is lacking. Although some studies have examined the impact of sitting reduction interventions on work related outcomes such as job performance and productivity, presenteeism, and absenteeism, it is difficult to draw conclusions across these studies owing to the limitations in study designs.

### A cluster randomized controlled trial to reduce office workers' sitting time: effect on activity outcomes [^9ba1db85]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to evaluate the initial and long-term effectiveness of a workplace intervention compared with usual practice, targeting the reduction of sitting on activity outcomes.

Methods

Office worksites (≥ 1 km apart) from a single organization in Victoria, Australia, were cluster randomized to intervention (n = 7) or control (n = 7). Participants were 231 desk-based office workers (5–39 participants per worksite) working at least 0.6 full-time equivalent. The workplace-delivered intervention addressed organizational, physical environment, and individual behavioral changes to reduce sitting time. Assessments occurred at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months, with the primary outcome participants' objectively measured (activPAL3 device) workplace sitting time (minutes per 8-h workday). Secondary activity outcomes were workplace time spent standing, stepping (light, moderate to vigorous, and total), and in prolonged (≥ 30 min) sitting bouts (hours per 8-h workday); usual duration of workplace sitting bouts; and overall sitting, standing, and stepping time (minutes per 16-h day). Analysis was by linear mixed models, accounting for repeated-measures and clustering and adjusting for baseline values and potential confounders.

Results

At baseline, on average, participants (68% women; mean ± SD age = 45.6 ± 9.4 yr) sat, stood, and stepped for 78.8% ± 9.5%, 14.3% ± 8.2%, and 6.9% ± 2.9% of work hours, respectively. Workplace sitting time was significantly reduced in the intervention group compared with the controls at 3 months (-99.1 [95% confidence interval = -116.3 to -81.8] min per 8-h workday) and 12 months (-45.4 [-64.6 to -26.2] min per 8-h workday). Significant intervention effects (all favoring intervention) were observed for standing, prolonged sitting, and usual sitting bout duration at work, as well as overall sitting and standing time, with no significant or meaningful effects observed for stepping.

Conclusions

This workplace-delivered multicomponent intervention was successful at reducing workplace and overall daily sitting time in both the short term and the long term.

### A systematic review of standing and treadmill desks in the workplace [^c6da9f26]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Standing and treadmill desks are intended to reduce the amount of time spent sitting in today's otherwise sedentary office. Proponents of these desks suggest that health benefits may be acquired as standing desk use discourages long periods of sitting, which has been identified as an independent health risk factor. Our objectives were thus to analyze the evidence for standing and treadmill desk use in relation to physiological (chronic disease prevention and management) and psychological (worker productivity, well-being) outcomes.

Methods

A computer-assisted systematic search of Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases was employed to identify all relevant articles related to standing and treadmill desk use.

Results

Treadmill desks led to the greatest improvement in physiological outcomes including postprandial glucose, HDL cholesterol, and anthropometrics, while standing desk use was associated with few physiological changes. Standing and treadmill desks both showed mixed results for improving psychological well-being with little impact on work performance.

Discussion

Standing and treadmill desks show some utility for breaking up sitting time and potentially improving select components of health. At present; however, there exist substantial evidence gaps to comprehensively evaluate the utility of each type of desk to enhance health benefits by reducing sedentary time.

### Management of lumbar spinal stenosis [^be6fcec5]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) affects more than 200,000 adults in the United States, resulting in substantial pain and disability. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery in patients over 65 years. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome of pain in the buttocks or lower extremities, with or without back pain. It is associated with reduced space available for the neural and vascular elements of the lumbar spine. The condition is often exacerbated by standing, walking, or lumbar extension and relieved by forward flexion, sitting, or recumbency. Clinical care and research into lumbar spinal stenosis is complicated by the heterogeneity of the condition, the lack of standard criteria for diagnosis and inclusion in studies, and high rates of anatomic stenosis on imaging studies in older people who are completely asymptomatic. The options for non-surgical management include drugs, physiotherapy, spinal injections, lifestyle modification, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, few high quality randomized trials have looked at conservative management. A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of non-surgical treatment. Several different surgical procedures are used to treat patients who do not improve with non-operative therapies. Given that rapid deterioration is rare and that symptoms often wax and wane or gradually improve, surgery is almost always elective and considered only if sufficiently bothersome symptoms persist despite trials of less invasive interventions. Outcomes (leg pain and disability) seem to be better for surgery than for non-operative treatment, but the evidence is heterogeneous and often of limited quality.

### Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work [^24b23c6e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Office work has changed considerably over the previous couple of decades and has become sedentary in nature. Physical inactivity at workplaces and particularly increased sitting has been linked to increase in cardiovascular disease, obesity and overall mortality.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, PsycINFO, Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to 2 June, 2015. We also screened reference lists of articles and contacted authors to find more studies to include.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), and quasi-randomised controlled trials of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) with a concurrent control group. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self-reported or objectively measured by means of an accelerometer-inclinometer. We considered energy expenditure, duration and number of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required.

Main Results

We included 20 studies, two cross-over RCTs, 11 RCTs, three cRCTs and four CBAs, with a total of 2180 participants from high income nations. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (nine studies), policy changes (two studies), information and counselling (seven studies) and interventions from multiple categories (two studies). One study had both physical workplace changes and information and counselling components. We did not find any studies that had investigated the effect of periodic breaks or standing or walking meetings. Physical workplace changesA sit-stand desk alone compared to no intervention reduced sitting time at work per workday with between thirty minutes to two hours at short term (up to three months) follow-up (six studies, 218 participants, very low quality evidence). In two studies, sit-stand desks with additional counselling reduced sitting time at work in the same range at short-term follow-up (61 participants, very low quality evidence). One study found a reduction at six months' follow-up of -56 minutes (95% CI -101 to -12, very low quality evidence) compared to no intervention. Also total sitting time at work and outside work decreased with sit-stand desks compared to no intervention (MD -78 minutes, 95% CI -125 to -31, one study) as did the duration of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more (MD -52 minutes, 95% CI -79 to -26, two studies). This is considerably less than the two to four hours recommended by experts. Sit-stand desks did not have a considerable effect on work performance, musculoskeletal symptoms or sick leave. It remains unclear if standing can repair the harms of sitting because there is hardly any extra energy expenditure. The effects of active workstations were inconsistent. Treadmill desks combined with counselling reduced sitting time at work (MD -29 minutes, 95% CI -55 to -2, one study) compared to no intervention at 12 weeks' follow-up. Pedalling workstations combined with information did not reduce inactive sitting at work considerably (MD -12 minutes, 95% CI -24 to 1, one study) compared to information alone at 16 weeks' follow-up. The quality of evidence was low for active workstations. Policy changesTwo studies with 443 participants provided low quality evidence that walking strategies did not have a considerable effect on workplace sitting time at 10 weeks' (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -54 to 23) or 21 weeks' (MD -17 minutes, 95% CI -58 to 25) follow-up respectively. Information and counsellingCounselling reduced sitting time at work (MD -28 minutes, 95% CI -52 to -5, two studies, low quality evidence) at medium term (three months to 12 months) follow-up. Mindfulness training did not considerably reduce workplace sitting time (MD -2 minutes, 95% CI -22 to 18) at six months' follow-up and at 12 months' follow-up (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -45 to 12, one study, low quality evidence). There was no considerable increase in work engagement with counselling. There was an inconsistent effect of computer prompting on sitting time at work. One study found no considerable effect on sitting at work (MD -17 minutes, 95% CI -48 to 14, low quality evidence) at 10 days' follow-up, while another study reported a significant reduction in sitting at work (MD -55 minutes, 95% CI -96 to -14, low quality evidence) at 13 weeks' follow-up. Computer prompts to stand reduced sitting at work by 14 minutes more (95% CI 10 to 19, one study) compared to computer prompts to step at six days' follow-up. Computer prompts did not change the number of sitting episodes that last 30 minutes or longer. Interventions from multiple categories Interventions combining multiple categories had an inconsistent effect on sitting time at work, with a reduction in sitting time at 12 weeks' (25 participants, very low quality evidence) and six months' (294 participants, low quality evidence) follow-up in two studies but no considerable effect at 12 months' follow-up in one study (MD -47.98, 95% CI -103 to 7, 294 participants, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

At present there is very low to low quality evidence that sit-stand desks may decrease workplace sitting between thirty minutes to two hours per day without having adverse effects at the short or medium term. There is no evidence on the effects in the long term. There were no considerable or inconsistent effects of other interventions such as changing work organisation or information and counselling. There is a need for cluster-randomised trials with a sufficient sample size and long term follow-up to determine the effectiveness of different types of interventions to reduce objectively measured sitting time at work.

### Changes in musculoskeletal pain among computer workers when working from home [^09fd0fad]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Remote working, especially working from home (WFH), has increased worldwide, particularly due to lockdown restrictions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In Germany, WFH almost doubled between 2019 und 2020, from 12.8% to 21.0% of the work force. Alongside the known positive aspects of home-based telework from prepandemic experiences (eg, better work-life balance, increased flexibility, and autonomy), WFH may also be associated with blurring of boundaries between work and leisure time, overwork, social isolation, lack of support, or inadequate equipment. A key difference of WFH during the pandemic compared to the period before the pandemic was that the switch from office work to WFH was hasty and unplanned. As a result, workstations at home had to be set up in due time, which oftentimes resulted in workplaces that did not meet ergonomic requirements.

Because of the special working conditions associated with remote working at changing locations inside and outside the home, employees in Germany are generally responsible for designing an ergonomic working environment at home. In contrast to regular home-based telework, which is usually permanently set up by the employer in the employees' home, companies have less control over remote workplaces' designs. In general, to enable users to adopt a safe and healthy posture, a workstation should be ergonomically designed including, among others, a height-adjustable chair and desk, foot support (if necessary under certain circumstances), an external keyboard and mouse, high-quality screens and their ergonomic position on the desk, as well as sufficient illumination. In the case of impaired visual eyesight, adjusted computer glasses should also be worn.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — imaging evidence and research priorities note that the data offers Level IV diagnostic evidence that CT is a useful modality in the diagnosis of stenosis in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, with prior research limited by nonconsecutive patients, lack of correlation with clinical signs or symptoms, and no gold standard; the work group recommends prospective, appropriately powered studies to better assess the utility of supine recumbent, axial loaded and positional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection and evaluation of stenosis in this setting.

### Low back pain and its risk factors among nurses working in east bale, bale, and west arsi zone government hospitals, oromia region, south east Ethiopia, 2021-multicenter cross-sectional study [^a38a5248]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Significant correlations between the feeling of LBP and the habit of exercising have also been found. Similar to studies from Finland and Tunisia, nurses who regularly exercised had a higher risk of experiencing low back pain.

The risk factors for LBP are still poorly recognized despite the significant frequency of LBP among nurses.LBP is thought to be a multi-factorial illness with a variety of potential underlying causes.

Researchers came to the conclusion that LBP may result from a lack of awareness, comprehension, or application of ergonomics' fundamental concepts and guidelines. Also, it is critical to customize the chair's sitting surface height to each user's unique bio-mechanical needs in order to allow for comfortable use of the surface without hurting the spine. The use of a chair with back support or a chair with an adjustable sitting surface, however, did not appear to be significantly associated with the prevalence of LBP in prior research. It was shown that using chairs with back supports could lower the incidence of LBP.

### Reallocating desk workers' sitting time to standing or stepping: associations with work performance [^47577479]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Studies have suggested that sitting time at work may lead to underperformance but they may underestimate the benefits to desk workers' performance of reducing occupational sitting time without considering the relative effects of the specific activities replaced.

Aims

To estimate differences in work performance (presenteeism, absenteeism and engagement) when occupational sitting time is reallocated to standing/stepping in desk workers.

Methods

Data for middle-aged desk workers were from a Japan-wide online survey (n = 2228). Self-report proportion of occupational sitting and standing/stepping, work hours and work performance indicators, including absolute (ratings relating only to self) and relative (ratings of self, compared to others) presenteeism and absenteeism, and dimensions of work engagement, were collected. Partition and isotemporal substitution models were used to investigate the associations of occupational sitting and standing/stepping time with work performance, including their reallocation effects.

Results

In partition models, longer occupational sitting time was associated with a lower absolute presenteeism score (i.e. less productivity), lower absolute absenteeism (i.e. longer-than-expected work hours), and lower engagement. Longer occupational standing/stepping time was associated with lower absolute absenteeism and more engagement. Isotemporal substitution models showed that each hour of occupational sitting reallocated to standing/stepping was favourably associated with overall work engagement (B = 0.087; 95% confidence interval 0.051, 0.122) and its dimensions (B ranged from 0.078 to 0.092), but was not associated with presenteeism or absenteeism.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that management support and practical initiatives to encourage desk workers to replace portions of their sitting time with standing/stepping may contribute to enhanced work engagement.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^52197e36]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — upright-sitting versus recumbent MRI — analyzed 89 patients (45 lumbosacral, 44 cervical), identifying degenerative spondylolisthesis in 13 patients (11 anterior, 2 posterior). Anterior spondylolisthesis was only seen on the upright-sitting examination in 4 patients (31%), was comparatively greater in degree on the upright-seated study in 7 patients (54%), and posterior spondylolisthesis was comparatively greater on the recumbent examination in 2 patients (15%). Due to limitations, the study was downgraded to Level IV and provides Level IV diagnostic evidence that upright-seated MRI may be superior to recumbent MRI of the lumbosacral spine in revealing degenerative spondylolisthesis.

### Interventions to reduce sedentary behavior [^a31b2f6f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article reports on the presentations and discussion from the working group on "Influences on Sedentary Behavior and Interventions To Reduce Sedentary Behavior" as part of the Sedentary Behavior: Identifying Research Priorities workshop.

Methods

Interventions were discussed in the context of targeting sedentary behavior (SB) as a concept distinct from physical activity. It was recommended that interventions targeting SB should consider a life course perspective, a position predicated on the assumption that SB is age and life stage dependent. In addition, targeting environments where individuals have high exposure to SB — such as workplace sitting — could benefit from new technology (e.g., computer-based prompting to stand or move), environmental changes (e.g., active workstations), policies targeting reduced sedentary time (e.g., allowing employees regular desk breaks), or by changing norms surrounding prolonged sitting (e.g., standing meetings).

Results and Conclusions

There are limited data about the minimal amount of SB change required to produce meaningful health benefits. In addition to developing relevant scientific and public health definitions of SB, it is important to further delineate the scope of health and quality-of-life outcomes associated with reduced SB across the life course and to clarify what behavioral alternatives to SB can be used to optimize health gains. SB interventions will benefit from having more clarity about the potential physiological and behavioral synergies with current physical activity recommendations, developing multilevel interventions aimed at reducing SB across all life phases and contexts, harnessing relevant and effective strategies to extend the reach of interventions to all sectors of society, as well as applying state-of-the-science adaptive designs and methods to accelerate advances in the science of SB interventions.

### The sedentary office: an expert statement on the growing case for change towards better health and productivity [^2ce6087d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

An international group of experts convened to provide guidance for employers to promote the avoidance of prolonged periods of sedentary work. The set of recommendations was developed from the totality of the current evidence, including long-term epidemiological studies and interventional studies of getting workers to stand and/or move more frequently. The evidence was ranked in quality using the four levels of the American College of Sports Medicine. The derived guidance is as follows: for those occupations which are predominantly desk based, workers should aim to initially progress towards accumulating 2h/day of standing and light activity (light walking) during working hours, eventually progressing to a total accumulation of 4h/day (prorated to part-time hours). To achieve this, seated-based work should be regularly broken up with standing-based work, the use of sit-stand desks, or the taking of short active standing breaks. Along with other health promotion goals (improved nutrition, reducing alcohol, smoking and stress), companies should also promote among their staff that prolonged sitting, aggregated from work and in leisure time, may significantly and independently increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and premature mortality. It is appreciated that these recommendations should be interpreted in relation to the evidence from which they were derived, largely observational and retrospective studies, or short-term interventional studies showing acute cardiometabolic changes. While longer term intervention studies are required, the level of consistent evidence accumulated to date, and the public health context of rising chronic diseases, suggest initial guidelines are justified. We hope these guidelines stimulate future research, and that greater precision will be possible within future iterations.

### Device-measured physical activity and cardiometabolic health: the prospective physical activity, sitting, and sleep (proPASS) consortium [^51a90620]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Findings must be interpreted at the population level as the starting point for all reallocation plots is the mean sample composition, which has relatively high levels of sleep (7.7 h/day), standing (3.1 h/day), and MVPA (1.3 h/day). Displacement into and away from MVPA did not demonstrate symmetrical associations with outcomes (Figures 1–6), and as introduced above, outcomes resulting from behavioural changes are likely to diverge depending on the initial starting profile. For example, previous investigation of dose-response associations between MVPA and cardiovascular outcomes has demonstrated steep risk reductions at low levels of MVPA, with benefits plateauing at higher MVPA volumes. This was consistent with MVPA-stratified results, where reallocation plots indicated greater theoretical benefits in those with lower levels of MVPA at baseline. This highlights an increasing need to identify personalized recommendations — or the 'sweet spot' — based on an individual's current 24 h movement behaviours.

Modelling displacement of time between five key daily behaviours can inform design of more realistic lifestyle-based interventions and enable personalized behavioural changes. For example, interventions focusing on displacement between sleep, SB, standing, and LIPA would likely require > 1 h of daily behavioural change to impact desired outcomes. This may have limited real-world plausibility compared with the potential impacts of displacing an additional ∼5 min in any other behaviour into MVPA. Notably, there are promising occupation-based interventions demonstrating the feasibility of reducing SB at this magnitude (e.g. standing desks or encourage active commuting via cycle to work schemes), yet interventions targeting non-working aged individuals or those in non-desk based roles have demonstrated much smaller effects on overall sedentary time.

### Lumbar spine posture and spinopelvic parameters change in various standing and sitting postures [^8c94b192]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare differences in lumbosacral and spinopelvic parameters between pain developers and non-pain developers as well as the effects of various posture changes.

Methods

A total of 38 consecutive participants, 20 standing-induced low back pain developers (mean age: 27.7 ± 5.3; mean BMI: 22.64 ± 2.95) and 18 non-pain developers (mean age: 29.0 ± 7.5; mean BMI: 24.2 ± 1.87) (p > 0.05), were prospectively evaluated. Six sagittal plane radiographs were taken. Upright standing posture was used as the reference posture. Lumbar lordosis, lumbosacral lordosis, L1/L2 and L5/S1 intervertebral (IV) joint angles, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt and sacral slope were measured on each radiograph.

Results

There were no significant differences in terms of age, BMI, SF-36 score, or Oswestry Disability Index scores between pain developer and non-pain developer groups (p > 0.05). Pain developers had significantly larger lumbar lordosis, larger L1/L2 intervertebral angles, larger pelvic incidences and sacral slopes in all postures (p < 0.05). The contribution of L5/S1 intervertebral angle to lumbar flexion was higher than that of the L1/L2 intervertebral angle during stair descent, the sitting and the leaning forward while sitting postures (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The current study supports the assertion that increased lumbar lordosis is associated with increased pain. Lumbar spine angles change in various postures. The changes were more prominent in pain developers than in non-pain developers. Larger lumbar lordosis due to larger pelvic incidence may be a risk factor for the development of standing-induced low back pain.

Non-pain relief measures of benefit

Whereas pain relief (eg, mean reduction in average pain) is by far the most common primary outcome measure in interventional and analgesic pain trials, two studies evaluating epidural steroid injections published in the New England Journal of Medicine used LBP functional capacity as the primary outcome measure. In individuals with chronic pain, improving function may be a more realistic benchmark than pain relief, and both the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and ODI are meant to provide a cross-sectional measure of function. However, in practice the parameters assessed in these instruments (sitting and standing tolerance, walking distance, ability to travel, dressing, lifting, sex, sleep, etc) preclude their use over the brief 2–4-hour therapeutic window after facet blocks. The same holds true for medication reduction, as long-acting medications cannot be tapered over a period of 3 hours, and withholding opioids may elicit hyperalgesia. In the prospective study by Cohen et al evaluating the effect percent pain relief on prognostic blocks has on RFA outcomes, when the six patients with < 50% pain relief on their diagnostic block underwent RFA based on their subjectively reported functional improvement and satisfaction, only one experienced a positive 6-month categorical outcome, which was defined as ≥ 50% relief.

Since patient recall is subject to error and expectation bias, the most objective means to measure benefit is by the use of 'real-time' pain diaries. But pain relief must be assessed in the context of analgesic consumption and function, so that the use of pain diaries to assess response after prognostic injections should evaluate function as well as analgesic requirements. In accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines on identifying responders, a clinically significant need for increased analgesic consumption for the index condition (ie, LBP) after a block would preclude that block from being designated 'positive'. For the same reasons, a modest reduction in pain that is attributed to a decrease in activity levels should be considered evidence against proceeding to RFA. Because the limitations in using non-pain-related measures as the benchmark for designating a prognostic block as positive are related to the relatively short duration of action of LAs, should sustained-release or ultra-long-acting formulations of LA become standard of care, the use of objective measures of function (eg, use of a pedometer, medication reduction, functional capacity) to assess block success will become an area ripe for investigation.

### Reducing back exertion and improving confidence of individuals with low back pain with a back exosuit: a feasibility study for use in BACPAC [^c695cfce]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Protocol highlighting the randomization of participants starting with the Exosuit Block or No-Suit Block. Within each block, participants performed four lifting tasks, completing a survey at the end of each task. The end of an experimental block involved completing a pain and photograph series of daily activities (PHODA) surveys and an exosuit-specific survey in the exosuit block only.

To limit the confounding influence of changing task dynamics and allow comparison between conditions, our sagittal plane squat and stoop lifting tasks were constrained spatially and temporally. The participants' feet and box position were marked on two separate force plates and the floor respectively, and a repetition would be repeated if the participant noticeably deviated. Lifting was timed to a 50 beats per minute metronome. On "go," participants would: 1) lower to the box, 2) lift the box to a neutral stand, 3) lower the box to the ground, and 4) return to a neutral stand without the box. The participant then had a brief (7.2 second) rest before their next repetition. For the stoop task, participants "kept their legs as straight as comfortable" as they lifted a 43 × 28 × 32 cm box placed at the height of their tibial tuberosity. In the squat task, participants "bent their knees" to pick up a slightly shorter 46 × 31 × 18 cm (WxLxH) box (Figure 1B and C).

Upon the completion of each task, participants performed a three-question survey. With the completion of an experimental block, participants were given a break to sit down and complete the "end block survey." Participants would indicate when they were ready to advance to the next task or block and were given the option to skip tasks if needed.

### Pain syndromes in children [^c294a8b3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

This review discusses the recent literature on pain conditions in children that should be of interest to rheumatologists. The focus of the review is therefore on musculoskeletal pains in children, particularly chronic or recurrent musculoskeletal pain. Articles that have a broader focus on pain are discussed when these are likely to be of general interest to rheumatologists. Chronic or recurrent pain in childhood is common and can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, several of which are discussed here. The importance of being able to measure pain in children has been emphasized repeatedly in the recent literature. With increased understanding of how to evaluate pain in children has come the recognition that pain in children is multifactorial and that even when there are obvious "organic" causes of the pain (such as arthritis), psychosocial factors are critical in how pain is perceived, and they influence the extent to which pain leads to dysfunction. There is also increasing evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapies are effective in managing chronic pain in children. The frequency of back pain in children is increasingly recognized, and the role of children's work and play, carrying heavy backpacks, and sitting for long periods of time at computers in causing back pain is of interest. The studies reviewed here add to an increasingly rich and informative literature on musculoskeletal and other chronic pain in children, and they help emphasize the importance of proper evaluation and management of pain in children.

### Reallocating desk workers' sitting time to standing or stepping: associations with work performance [^3ca3962d]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 1 presents the characteristics of the 2228 study participants (mainly working as company employees). The mean work time per day was 8.3 (± 1.9) hours, of which most of the time was spent sitting. On average, the participants reported a relatively high absolute presenteeism score, equal performance compared with co-workers, longer work hours than their supervisors/employers expected and relatively low work engagement.

Table 1.
Characteristics of the study participants (n = 2228)

The partition models for the associations of occupational sitting and standing/stepping behaviours with work performance are shown in Table 2. Occupational sitting was significantly associated with a lower absolute presenteeism score (i.e. less productivity) after adjusting for covariates and occupational standing/stepping. Hours spent in occupational sitting and standing/stepping behaviours were negatively associated with absolute absenteeism, indicating an individual worked more hours than expected. An increase in occupational sitting hours was associated with a decrease in work engagement, including overall and in most dimensions — vigour and dedication; by contrast, an increase in occupational standing/stepping behaviour was associated with an increase in overall and dimension-specific work engagement.

Table 2.
Partition models examining the associations of occupational sitting and standing/stepping hours with work presenteeism, absenteeism and engagement

The isotemporal substitution models show that each hour of occupational sitting reallocated to standing/stepping was favourably associated with overall work engagement and by dimension — vigour, dedication and absorption (Table 3). No significant associations were found for presenteeism or absenteeism.

### Impact of preferred surgical modality on surgeon wellness: a survey of workload, physical pain / discomfort, and neuromusculoskeletal disorders [^7d2f4344]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Body part discomfort or pain (immediately after surgery over the past 30 days) was lower in the shoulder for robotic surgeons compared to laparoscopic and open surgeons and in left hand fingers for robotic surgeons compared to endoscopic surgeons. However, the results show that robotic surgery could lead to relatively high pain and discomfort scores especially in neck, upper back, and lower back (Fig. 4 a and b). This is consistent with previous literature that underlined the neck and trunk as body parts potentially at risk during robotic surgery while reported finger symptoms associated with robotic surgery was not confirmed through our study. Despite the fact that the da Vinci surgeon console provides the ability to adjust the ergonomic positions of the stereo viewer, arm rest, and foot controls, improper setup of these settings may contribute to neck and trunk symptoms reported. This highlights the importance of taking the time to properly set up the console for optimal ergonomic experience. Hokenstad et al. suggested a protocol for the da Vinci surgeon console platform to make ergonomic adjustments and reported improved postures at surgeons' neck and right upper arm. More investigation is required to quantify the ergonomic impact of these adjustments on mitigating surgeons' intraoperative body part discomfort, fatigue and in the long run, work-related NMSDs.
