## Question

Is there a contraindication to starting ferric Maltol after bowel resection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ferric maltol (Accrufer) is contraindicated after a bowel resection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal, label-defined contraindications for ferric maltol. Then, I should review the drug's absorption physiology and how resection alters the absorptive surface. Next, I will examine guideline recommendations for iron deficiency after GI surgery and postoperative contexts. After that, I should compare the clinical effectiveness of ferric maltol versus intravenous iron from randomized trials. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and monitoring plan tailored to post-resection patients, making sure I confirm any assumptions along the way and correct them if needed [^1162Mt4E] [^115TvPGY].

> Let me first confirm the label. The FDA patient information and prescribing materials list hypersensitivity to ferric maltol, iron overload or disorders of iron utilization, and repeated transfusions as the reasons not to use Accrufer; they do not list prior bowel resection as a contraindication, so there is no label-specified prohibition on use solely due to resection, and the labeled adult dose is 30 mg twice daily, which I should keep in mind as I weigh options [^1162Mt4E] [^11349W6n] [^113VJRL1].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic implications. Ferric maltol is a ferric iron–maltol complex designed for oral delivery, with iron released and taken up across the proximal small intestine using canonical enterocyte transport pathways; in other words, effective uptake depends on functional duodenal–proximal jejunal mucosa and intact iron export through ferroportin, so surgical removal or bypass of these segments will predictably reduce bioavailability and increase the likelihood of treatment failure [^114A6NVM] [^115cLBoF].

> I need to check how surgery changes absorption in practice. Resections or bypasses that diminish stomach acid, bypass the duodenum, or reduce proximal jejunal surface area — as after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or segmental small-bowel resections — are well recognized to impair oral iron absorption and drive iron deficiency; long-term observational cohorts of RYGB show high rates of iron depletion and frequent need for IV iron support, reinforcing that the absorptive constraint is clinically meaningful postoperatively [^116UwsGD] [^1111TTk2].

> Next, I should review guideline direction so I don't overinterpret single studies. The British Society of Gastroenterology advises that after procedures likely to impair absorption, oral iron may be insufficient and that intravenous iron is often required, with ferric maltol considered an oral alternative only in mild to moderate anemia and with early reassessment for response; postoperative consensus statements similarly recommend IV iron first line when malabsorption or intolerance to oral iron is expected, emphasizing pragmatism and timely correction of anemia in surgical patients [^113K8Kha] [^112GLSj1].

> Hold on, I should verify comparative efficacy, not just theoretical absorption. In the head-to-head phase 3b trial in IBD with IDA, oral ferric maltol did not meet the prespecified noninferiority margin versus intravenous ferric carboxymaltose at 12 weeks, with a smaller mean hemoglobin rise and a clearly slower early response profile; this time course matters after surgery or resection, when faster repletion may be needed or oral uptake may be constrained [^115TvPGY] [^115wixoy] [^1154oUNb].

> I will now examine iron store kinetics and tolerability to ensure a balanced view. Compared with IV ferric carboxymaltose, ferric maltol produced smaller ferritin increases early that accrued gradually over time, and gastrointestinal adverse events and treatment-related adverse events were more frequent with ferric maltol, leading to higher discontinuation, whereas serious adverse events were uncommon and similar between groups, all of which should be weighed in a post-resection gut where GI tolerability can be tenuous [^112cLg7y] [^1174FhTp] [^116oynRd].

> But wait, what about specifically post-bariatric or post-resection populations rather than IBD broadly. Post hoc analyses and pooled datasets in patients with iron deficiency anemia after bariatric surgery show that intravenous iron, including ferric derisomaltose or iron sucrose, achieves faster and more pronounced hemoglobin responses with acceptable safety, and long-term RYGB series demonstrate that protocolized IV iron for depleted stores helps maintain hemoglobin over years, underscoring that IV delivery reliably bypasses impaired absorption in surgically altered anatomy [^114XMXP6] [^115teD9S] [^1111TTk2].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. Although bowel resection is not an absolute, label-defined contraindication to ferric maltol, the combination of reduced proximal small-bowel absorptive capacity, the need for timely correction, and the comparative inferiority of oral therapy versus IV iron for early hemoglobin rise create a practical, clinical relative contraindication in many post-resection patients, particularly when anemia is moderate to severe or urgent repletion is desired; when anemia is mild and proximal absorption is plausibly intact, a carefully monitored trial of ferric maltol may still be reasonable with a low threshold to switch if the response is suboptimal [^1162Mt4E] [^113K8Kha] [^112Lvexx].

> Hold on, I should verify the dosing logistics to make the recommendation actionable. If IV iron is chosen, ferric carboxymaltose can be given as 750 mg every 7 days for 2 doses or 15 mg/kg in two weekly administrations per FDA materials, allowing rapid repletion, whereas ferric maltol, if tried, is given at 30 mg twice daily, with an expectation of a slower hemoglobin trajectory and delayed ferritin restoration compared with IV iron [^1124tCKq] [^116BpQbe] [^11349W6n] [^112cLg7y].

> I should double-check follow-up and stopping rules so we do not prolong ineffective oral therapy. BSG guidance supports reassessing response within about 4–6 weeks and moving promptly to parenteral iron if hemoglobin fails to rise by roughly 1 g/dL or by 10 g/L within the defined interval for the oral formulation, with regular 4-weekly monitoring until normalization; this early checkpoint is especially crucial after resection where absorption is uncertain [^113K8Kha].

> Let me reconsider any earlier assumptions for accuracy. I initially worried there might be a hidden label restriction around IBD activity or prior surgery, but that is not the case; the FDA materials advise discussing IBD and other conditions with the prescriber without designating these as absolute contraindications, so the decision is clinical rather than regulatory, guided by anatomy, severity, and the need for rapid correction [^1162Mt4E].

> Final answer: There is no label-specified contraindication to ferric maltol solely due to prior bowel resection; however, resection commonly impairs the proximal small-bowel absorption required for ferric maltol to work and, compared with intravenous iron, oral ferric maltol produces a slower and smaller early hemoglobin response, so current evidence and guidelines favor IV iron as first-line after malabsorptive GI surgery or when moderate–severe anemia is present, reserving ferric maltol for selected mild cases with preserved proximal absorption and close early monitoring for response, with rapid escalation to IV iron if targets are not met [^1162Mt4E] [^115TvPGY] [^113K8Kha] [^112GLSj1].

There is no absolute contraindication to initiating ferric maltol after bowel resection. However, malabsorption may limit efficacy [^116UwsGD], and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) are common [^116oynRd]; therefore, monitor closely and consider intravenous iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated. Ferric maltol is contraindicated only in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or iron overload disorders.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Ferric maltol is an oral iron complex designed for improved absorption and tolerability compared to traditional ferrous salts. It delivers ferric iron to the intestinal mucosa in a stable complex [^114A6NVM], allowing efficient uptake into enterocytes while minimizing free iron in the gut, thereby reducing gastrointestinal toxicity [^116GyEsx].

---

## Clinical evidence in gastrointestinal conditions

Ferric maltol has been studied primarily in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), conditions often associated with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [^111eSp5F]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ferric maltol effectively increases hemoglobin levels and replenishes iron stores in these populations [^111fC9rM]. However, specific data on ferric maltol use in patients following bowel resection are limited. Bowel resection, particularly of the duodenum and proximal jejunum, can significantly impair iron absorption because of reduced absorptive surface area and altered gastrointestinal physiology, which may limit the efficacy of oral iron therapies, including ferric maltol [^116UwsGD] [^1111TTk2].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Ferric maltol is generally well tolerated [^116oynRd], and the most common adverse events are gastrointestinal — such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [^111fC9rM]. These effects are usually mild to moderate and may be more pronounced in patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy or function, such as those who have undergone bowel resection. There is no evidence that ferric maltol significantly increases the risk of postoperative complications — such as anastomotic leakage or infection — after bowel resection. However, careful monitoring for gastrointestinal intolerance and malabsorption-related issues is recommended [^113K8Kha].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not explicitly contraindicate the use of ferric maltol in patients following bowel resection. They emphasize individualized patient assessment, considering the extent of bowel resection, residual absorptive capacity, and the patient's overall clinical status. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines recommend oral iron therapy as the initial treatment for iron deficiency anemia, with intravenous iron reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to oral iron therapy. Ferric maltol is specifically mentioned as an alternative oral iron preparation for patients who cannot tolerate traditional ferrous salts.

---

## Alternative iron supplementation strategies

In patients with significant malabsorption or intolerance to oral iron therapy, intravenous iron supplementation may be considered. Intravenous iron formulations, such as ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose, bypass the gastrointestinal tract and provide rapid replenishment of iron stores [^116oRQZZ]. However, it carries risks — including hypersensitivity reactions and potential iron overload — and should be administered under careful medical supervision [^112fptXx].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

There is no absolute contraindication to initiating ferric maltol therapy in patients who have undergone bowel resection. Clinicians should carefully assess the patient's residual absorptive capacity, monitor for gastrointestinal intolerance, and consider alternative iron supplementation strategies if oral therapy proves ineffective or poorly tolerated [^113K8Kha]. Ferric maltol may be a suitable option for patients with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency anemia following bowel resection, particularly if they cannot tolerate traditional ferrous salts [^113K8Kha]. In cases of significant malabsorption or severe anemia, intravenous iron supplementation may be more appropriate.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111fC9rM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

To address the potential negative effects of oral iron supplementation in clinical practice, some new alternatives of oral iron treatment have been proposed. Recent work suggests that standard doses of oral iron may be too extensive. Daily iron absorption can vary from 0.5 mg in a healthy adult to 20 mg in iron deficiency. An excess of oral iron intake can increase oxidative stress and inflammation in the colon, leading to disturbances of the microbiome. Low-dose oral iron, with no more than 100 mg of total elemental iron, has been shown to be equally effective with preferable tolerability in new studies and is, therefore, recommended in the ECCO guidelines. Notably, a 2015 meta-analysis did not show a dose-dependent effect of GI side effects from oral iron.

Another new approach in oral iron treatment is the use of ferric (Fe3+) iron in a complex with maltol. Traditional oral iron supplements contain ferrous (Fe2+) iron in a complex with sulfate, gluconate, or fumarate. It has been suggested that ferric (Fe3+) iron can be better absorbed, that smaller doses are sufficient, and that the risk of GI side effects may be decreased. In a recent phase III trial, 128 patients with quiescent, mild, or moderate IBD and mild to moderate IDA were randomly assigned to receive ferric maltol or placebo. All participants had previously documented failure to respond to oral iron treatment. It was confirmed that ferric maltol can effectively increase Hb levels, and GI side effects or treatment compliance were not different compared with placebo. Although data are still limited, further research is warranted to explore these alternatives.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113K8Kha]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

For patients with intolerance or failure of hemoglobin (Hb) response at the 2–4 week point, alternate day traditional iron salts (if not already used) or ferric maltol may be alternatives to parenteral iron in those with mild to moderate anaemia (Hb > 95 g/L). The tolerability and response should be assessed, and failure of the Hb to rise by 10 g/L at 4 weeks for alternate day iron, or 6 weeks for ferric maltol, indicates the need for parenteral iron replacement therapy (IRT).

Regular Hb monitoring is recommended to ensure an ultimately satisfactory response. The optimal interval is not clear, but checking every 4 weeks until the Hb is in the normal range seems reasonable. After the normalization of Hb, oral iron needs to be continued to replenish iron stores. Traditionally, it has been recommended that oral iron is continued for 2–3 months to achieve this. However, the duration required and the appropriate measure of true iron repletion are both unclear. In healthy, almost iron-replete subjects, 2 months of continued iron was considered sufficient. However, in patients with chronic disease, ongoing blood loss, impaired absorption, or gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disease (where iron is lost from the GI mucosa), it is likely that a longer period would be required.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1121vCoS]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In patients with IBD, IV iron formulations have been compared with oral ferrous iron in four parallel-group, randomized controlled trials. A Bayesian network meta-analysis of these trials showed a significant superiority of ferric carboxymaltose over traditional oral ferrous iron (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% credible interval, 1.2–3.2), whereas other IV formulations did not reach statistical significance. Only one trial used IV ferric carboxymaltose, which was compared with oral ferrous sulfate 100 mg twice daily over 12 weeks. Improvements in Hb were 3.7 and 2.8 g/dL in patients receiving IV ferric carboxymaltose and oral ferrous sulfate, respectively. However, patients in that trial were considerably more anemic at baseline (median Hb, 8.7 g/dL [range, 5.0–11.5] and 9.1 g/dL [range, 5.3–11.1] for ferric carboxymaltose and ferrous sulfate, respectively) than in our trial (median Hb, 10.1 g/dL [range, 7.6–12.6] and 10.2 g/dL [range, 8.0–12.0] for ferric maltol and ferric carboxymaltose, respectively). Data are also available from a 12-week randomized comparison of IV ferric carboxymaltose and IV iron sucrose in patients with mean (SD) baseline Hb concentrations of 10.1 (1.5) g/dL and 10.3 (1.5) g/dL, respectively; 72.8% and 61.8% of patients achieved normalization of Hb. Improvements in Hb over 12 weeks with ferric carboxymaltose in these studies seem similar in terms of magnitude to those in the trial. Our study was designed to be consistent with these previous IV ferric carboxymaltose trials, with minor differences reflecting changes in clinical practice over time.

### Oral iron supplementation: New formulations, old questions [^116GyEsx]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Ferric maltol has been evaluated in several phase I to III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), mainly due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Compared to placebo, ferric maltol promoted statistically significant changes in hemoglobin within 12–16 weeks, with an average increase of ≥ 2 g/dL by week 12. This increase was sustained up to week 64. Increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were also observed. In an open-label phase IIIa RCT in IBD patients, ferric maltol achieved significant increases in hemoglobin but did not show non-inferiority versus intravenous iron by week 12, while the long-term effects over 52 weeks were comparable.

The efficacy of sucrosomial® iron has likewise been evaluated in several RCTs involving patients with iron deficiency (ID) or IDA of diverse etiologies, such as non-anemic pregnant women, oncologic patients with solid tumors, women undergoing bariatric surgery, and patients with pre-operative anemia, celiac disease, IBD, CKD, or congestive heart failure. The overall data suggest that sucrosomial® iron improved hemoglobinization but did not always efficiently replenish iron stores. For instance, sucrosomial® iron significantly increased hemoglobin but not serum ferritin in IDA patients with IBD. Similarly, liposomal iron has generally shown effectiveness in improving hemoglobinization in various populations of patients with IDA without, however, increasing serum ferritin.

Ferric maltol and sucrosomial® iron are certainly promising new oral iron formulations. Nonetheless, they have not proven to be superior to conventional ferrous salts and are considerably more costly.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112GLSj1]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

There are a number of statements and guidelines from professional associations recommending a systematic approach to the management of pre-operative anaemia. Most of these guidelines also recommend the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold for treating acute postoperative anaemia, but recommendations for pharmacological management of anaemia are scarce or even absent.

We aimed to update and utilize these few recommendations to provide a working practice document, based on scientific evidence and the clinical experience of an expert panel, on how to feasibly introduce these postoperative anaemia guidelines into clinical practice. Our goal was to provide pragmatic, clear, and easy-to-follow clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative anaemia and iron deficiency in order to improve patient recovery, reduce the need for blood transfusion, and improve functional outcomes in a cost-effective manner. Our recommendations are intended for non-actively bleeding adult patients in whom all the principles of patient blood management (PBM) have been implemented pre- and intra-operatively for the prevention of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia.

- **Further evaluation of the small bowel**: In those with negative bidirectional endoscopy of acceptable quality and either an inadequate response to IRT or reIDA, we recommend further investigation of the small bowel and renal tract to exclude other causes (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong). We recommend capsule endoscopy as the preferred test for examining the small bowel in IDA because it is highly sensitive for mucosal lesions. CT/MR enterography may be considered in those not suitable, and these are complementary investigations in the assessment of inflammatory and neoplastic disease of the small bowel (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

After a negative capsule endoscopy of acceptable quality, we recommend that further GI investigation needs to be considered only if there is ongoing IDA after IRT (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, recommendation — strong). We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of reIDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Efficacy and safety of ferric derisomaltose (FDI) compared with iron sucrose (IS) in patients with iron deficiency anemia after bariatric surgery [^115hSMid]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is a common cause of anemia following bariatric surgery, especially after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which restricts food intake and nutrient absorption. Indeed, Gesquiere et al. reported a 37.2% incidence of ID within five years of RYGB.

Multiple factors are associated with the development of ID post-bariatric surgery, including a reduction in the surface area available for iron absorption due to decreased stomach capacity and bypass of the duodenum, an inadequate intake of dietary iron due to a low tolerance of red meat, and reduced gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid is required for the conjugation of iron to vitamin C, amino acids, and sugar, which prevent its conversion to unabsorbable ferric hydroxide in the proximal duodenum.

Additionally, ID is frequently observed in individuals with obesity, which may be due to adiposity-related chronic inflammation inhibiting the absorption of iron. Pre-existing ID can be exacerbated following bariatric surgery. ID can have a considerable impact on an individual's health, particularly when the deficiency results in anemia. Anemia can manifest as fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath; in severe cases, anemia can lead to neurological damage and even heart failure. Other symptoms include pagophagia (a pathological craving for ice), which can impair dentition, and restless legs syndrome, which interferes with sleep, resulting in fatigue and impaired quality of life. Therefore, treating ID and any associated anemia is essential.

### Iron therapy for pre-operative anaemia [^1153tNJE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Pre-operative anaemia is common and occurs in up to 76% of patients. It is associated with increased peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusions, longer hospital stays, and increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of this anaemia. Oral iron therapy has traditionally been used to treat anaemia, but newer, safer parenteral iron preparations have been shown to be more effective in other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure, and post-partum haemorrhage. A limited number of studies look at iron therapy for the treatment of pre-operative anaemia. The aim of this Cochrane review is to summarise the evidence for the use of iron supplementation, both enteral and parenteral, for the management of pre-operative anaemia.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review is to evaluate the effects of pre-operative iron therapy (enteral or parenteral) in reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusions in anaemic patients undergoing surgery.

- **Search methods**: We ran the search on 25 March 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), PubMed, clinical trials registries, conference abstracts, and we screened reference lists.

### Ferric carboxymaltose with or without phosphate substitution in iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia before elective surgery - The DeFICIT trial [^116Z2rR6]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia in the perioperative setting is treated predominantly with intravenous iron formulation, of which ferric carboxymaltose may induce hypophosphatemia by modulating fibroblast growth factor 23.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, we consented 92 adult patients scheduled for elective major abdominal or thoracic surgery. These patients either had isolated iron deficiency (plasma ferritin < 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%) or iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) 100–130 g/L with plasma ferritin < 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%). Preoperatively, participants received a single preoperative intravenous dose of ferric carboxymaltose and were then randomly assigned to receive either phosphate or placebo, administered orally three times a day for 30 days, corresponding to an 18 mmol dose of daily phosphate supplementation in the intervention group. The primary endpoint was the minimum serum phosphate concentration during follow-up visits. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was mean perioperative hemoglobin concentration on postoperative days 0, 2, and 4, assessing the non-inferiority of additional phosphate supplementation.

- **Results**: We randomly consented 46 patients in each group (mean ± SD age 56 ± 17 years, 57% female). Minimal phosphate concentration was 0.49 ± 0.21 mmol/L in the treatment group and 0.42 ± 0.17 mmol/L in the placebo group (p = 0.12, two-sided p-value). Average mean hemoglobin was 110 ± 16 g/L in the treatment group and 113 ± 13 g/L in the placebo group (p = 0.023, one-sided).

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^116oynRd]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

After the first planned infusions scheduled according to local prescribing information and standard practice, 85 patients (68%) in the ferric carboxymaltose group had 178 additional IV infusions over the 52 weeks of the trial, with a median time to additional IV iron of 84 days (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Time to use of additional IV iron after first planned infusions scheduled according to local standard practice and prescribing information (ITT population, posthoc analysis).

- **Tolerability and adverse events**: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; i.e. any event starting or worsening on or after the day of the first dose up to 14 days after the last dose) were recorded in 75 patients (59%) receiving ferric maltol and 43 (36%) receiving ferric carboxymaltose, of which 15 were severe (ferric maltol, n = 11; ferric carboxymaltose, n = 4). The TEAEs were mainly gastrointestinal in the ferric maltol group (n = 40 [31%]) and infections/infestations in the ferric carboxymaltose group (n = 22 [18%]).

Seven patients (5%) on ferric maltol and 8 (4%) on IV iron had an IBD flare; only 1 of these events (in a patient receiving ferric maltol) was deemed to be treatment-related. TEAEs deemed by the investigators to be related to study medication occurred in 32 patients (ferric maltol, n = 25 [20%]; ferric carboxymaltose, n = 7 [6%]). The most frequently recorded treatment-related TEAEs were nausea in 5 patients (ferric maltol, n = 3; ferric carboxymaltose, n = 2) and upper abdominal pain in 5 patients (all on ferric maltol).

### Accrufer [^114beJUN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:
	- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:
		Ferric maltol in Accrufer is not absorbed systemically as an intact complex. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with ferric maltol. However, it was mutagenic in vitro in reverse bacterial mutation (Ames) assays, increasing revertant frequency both in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Fertility studies have not been conducted with ferric maltol.

- **Maltol**:
	- The carcinogenic potential of maltol has been evaluated in long-term animal toxicity studies using CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. It was not found to be carcinogenic in an 18-month study in mice at doses up to 400 mg/kg, approximately five times the human daily dose. Similarly, in a two-year study in rats, maltol showed no carcinogenic effects at doses up to 400 mg/kg, about ten times the human daily dose.

	- Maltol was mutagenic in vitro in reverse bacterial mutation (Ames) assays and increased revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. It was also clastogenic in vivo in a mouse micronucleus assay, indicated by an increase in polychromatic erythrocytes at intraperitoneal doses of 774 mg/kg. Absorbed maltol is rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid, making it unlikely that the mutagenic activity of maltol would be expressed under conditions of oral human intake.

	- In a multi-generation animal reproduction study involving male and female rats, no effects on mating, fertility, or early embryonic development were observed at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day, approximately ten times the human daily dose.

### Efficacy and tolerability of intravenous iron dextran and oral iron in inflammatory bowel disease: a case-matched study in clinical practice [^112DkWm8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the optimum route of administration of iron replacement therapy is unclear. As inflammation may limit the absorption and efficacy of oral iron, we hypothesized that in routine clinical practice IV iron would be more effective than oral iron in patients with IBD matched for disease type, extent, and activity.

Thirty-three IBD patients who had received IV iron dextran (Cosmofer) in 2008–2010 were identified and matched for age, sex, diagnosis, baseline disease activity, extent, and behaviour to IBD patients given oral iron. Patients given IV iron dextran were more anaemic at baseline than those receiving oral iron. Although haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations were normalized in about a third of patients, and increased significantly in both groups, the mean increase in Hb after 8 weeks was greater in the iron dextran group [2.0 g/dl (0.3) vs. 0.6 g/dl (0.1), P < 0.0001]. Response to oral or IV iron was unrelated to age, sex, ethnicity, disease duration, extent, or activity. Fifteen percent (five out of 33) of patients discontinued oral iron because of gastrointestinal side effects, and a further two out of 35 had anaphylactoid reactions to the IV iron dextran test doses. Neither of the iron formulations worsened disease activity.

In routine clinical practice, in anaemic patients with IBD of similar type, extent, and activity, IV Cosmofer is more efficacious in increasing Hb concentration than oral iron. Active disease does not impair the response to either IV or oral iron.

### Corrigendum to: Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1149S2ah]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In the article titled "Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial", the legends for Figures 3 and 4 were incorrect.

The incorrect legends read as follows:

"Figure 3. Mean change in Hb over 52 weeks of treatment with oral ferric maltol or IV ferric carboxymaltose (ITT population, observed patients). P values shown for test of null hypothesis of inferiority in risk difference with noninferiority margin of 20%".

"Figure 4. Patients achieving ≥ 1 and ≥ 2 g/dL increases, and normalization of Hb concentration between baseline and week 12 (ITT population with multiple imputation). P values shown for test of null hypothesis of inferiority in risk difference with noninferiority margin of 20%".

The legends should read as follows:

At baseline, the mean (SD) hemoglobin (Hb) was 10.0 (1.1) g/dL in the ferric maltol group and 10.1 (1.0) g/dL in the ferric carboxymaltose group. By week 12, the mean (SD) Hb increased to 12.5 (1.6) g/dL in the ferric maltol group and 13.2 (1.4) g/dL in the ferric carboxymaltose group. The least squares mean (LSM) changes in Hb from baseline to week 12 were 2.5 and 3.1 g/dL, respectively. The LSM difference between the treatment groups was −0.6 g/dL (95% CI, −1.0 to −0.2; P = 0.002), indicating a larger increase in Hb with ferric carboxymaltose than with ferric maltol.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112fptXx]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the true risks and contraindications of i.v. iron? Many clinicians and health authorities still consider that i.v. iron is strongly associated with major side effects such as anaphylaxis, infection, or oxidative stress. However, these side effects appear not to be significant with newer i.v. iron preparations, such as ferric carboxymaltose, iron isomaltoside, and low molecular weight iron dextran.

After an extensive review of the data, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that "all i.v. iron medicines have a small risk of causing allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly". However, the reported incidence of potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions (< 1:250,000 administrations) is vastly overestimated. The pathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood, although a substantial proportion is thought to be mediated by complement activation, resulting in complement activation-related pseudo allergy (CARPA). Minor infusion reactions due to 'labile' iron may occur, but are usually self-limiting without intervention and should not be misinterpreted as acute hypersensitivity events.

The CHMP's review also concluded that "the benefits of these medicines are greater than their risks, provided that adequate measures are taken to minimise the risk of allergic reactions". To this end, i.v. iron preparations should only be given in an environment where resuscitation facilities are available, so that patients who develop an allergic reaction can be treated promptly.

### The role of ferric carboxymaltose in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with gastrointestinal disease [^116oRQZZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common form of nutritional anemia worldwide. Iron plays a pivotal role in the vital functioning of almost every organ system. IDA affects both the physical and psychological functioning of humans. Oral iron is considered the first-line therapy for the treatment of IDA due to its low cost, good safety profile, and ease of administration. However, the absorption of oral iron is affected by several factors, and the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects can lead to a lack of adherence to therapy and poor efficacy. This has led to the emergence of intravenous iron therapy, which is clearly superior to oral iron, with a higher increment of hemoglobin levels and rapid replenishment of iron stores.

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a novel non-dextran intravenous iron form approved for use in patients with iron deficiency who have had an inadequate response to oral iron therapy, intolerance to oral iron, or non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. The safety and efficacy of using FCM for the treatment of IDA have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. One dose can provide a large amount of iron and has a very short infusion time. It should be considered as first-line therapy in patients with active inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, when gastrointestinal absorption of oral iron may be compromised. It should also be given to patients who have had an inadequate response to oral iron therapy. It has been shown to be non-inferior to other intravenous iron formulations with a good safety profile and has produced fewer anaphylactic reactions.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1132guTy]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Ferric maltol, an oral iron, is designed to enhance absorption and tolerability, addressing the absorption and gastrointestinal issues associated with standard oral irons.

Methods: In this open-label, phase 3b trial (EudraCT 2015–002496–26 and NCT02680756), adults with nonseverely active inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin 8.0–11.0/12.0 g/dL for women/men; ferritin < 30 ng/mL/ < 100 ng/mL with transferrin saturation < 20%) were randomized to receive oral ferric maltol 30 mg twice daily or intravenous ferric carboxymaltose, administered according to each center's standard practice. The primary endpoint was the hemoglobin responder rate (≥ 2 g/dL increase or normalization) at week 12, with a 20% noninferiority limit in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations.

Results: In the intent-to-treat analyses (ferric maltol, n = 125; ferric carboxymaltose, n = 125) and per-protocol analyses (n = 78/88), week 12 responder rates were 67% and 68%, respectively, for ferric maltol vs 84% and 85%, respectively, for ferric carboxymaltose. The primary endpoint was not achieved, as the confidence intervals crossed the noninferiority margin. Mean hemoglobin increases at weeks 12, 24, and 52 were 2.5 vs 3.0 g/dL, 2.9 vs 2.8 g/dL, and 2.7 vs 2.8 g/dL with ferric maltol vs ferric carboxymaltose. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 59% and 36% of patients, respectively, resulting in treatment discontinuation in 10% and 3% of patients.

Further evaluation of the small bowel:

1. In those with negative bidirectional endoscopy of acceptable quality and either an inadequate response to IRT or reIDA, we recommend further investigation of the small bowel and renal tract to exclude other causes (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

2. We recommend capsule endoscopy as the preferred test for examining the small bowel in IDA because it is highly sensitive for mucosal lesions. CT/MR enterography may be considered in those not suitable, and these are complementary investigations in the assessment of inflammatory and neoplastic disease of the small bowel (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

3. After a negative capsule endoscopy of acceptable quality, we recommend that further GI investigation needs to be considered only if there is ongoing IDA after IRT (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Capsule endoscopy (CE) is now the first-line test for the assessment of the small bowel in the setting of covert bleeding/IDA, as it has a higher diagnostic yield than radiology. A pooled diagnostic yield of 66.6% (95% CI 61% to 72%) has been reported in a systematic review of CE in IDA. Angioectasia, Crohn's disease, and NSAID enteropathy are common findings, and factors such as transfusion dependence, increasing age, and comorbidity all positively influence the diagnostic yield. A longer small bowel transit time on CE is also associated with a higher yield, so the possibility of missed pathology should be considered when transit is unduly rapid.

The safety of iron replacement therapy (IRT) is impacted by gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation, which are much more common with oral preparations. There is no convincing evidence for the superiority of any of the readily available traditional iron salts. Gastrointestinal side effects are significantly more common with oral ferrous sulfate than with placebo (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.74 to 3.08) or parenteral iron (OR 3.05; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.48), and there is no dose-effect relationship over the range of 50–400 mg of elemental iron per day. Despite the high prevalence of mild side effects, the rates of discontinuation in clinical trials due to adverse events are relatively low (0%–24%), though they are higher than the rates for discontinuation of parenteral iron (0%–18%). Discontinuation of oral IRT seems to be more common in observational and population studies, with reported rates of up to 40%.

### Intravenous iron sucrose versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease — a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study [^111YiyBU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The optimal route for iron supplementation to replenish iron stores has not been determined so far. We therefore evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron sucrose compared with oral iron sulfate for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with IBD.

A randomized, prospective, open-label, multicenter study was performed in 46 patients with anemia and transferrin saturation ≤ 20% and/or serum ferritin concentrations ≤ 20 μg/L. The intravenous group received a single dose of iron sucrose of 7 mg iron/kg body weight, followed by five 200 mg infusions over the following five weeks. The oral group received iron sulfate at 100–200 mg per day for six weeks.

While a comparable increase in hemoglobin was observed for both administration routes (median increase 0.25 g/L in the intravenous group vs. 0.21 g/L in the oral group), only iron sucrose led to a rise in serum ferritin concentrations. Intractable gastrointestinal adverse events caused permanent study drug discontinuation in five patients (20.8%) receiving iron sulfate, whereas only one patient (4.5%) had to be withdrawn due to side effects from iron sucrose.

Although being equal in short-term efficacy and overall tolerability, our results suggest better gastrointestinal tolerability for iron sucrose. Larger trials are mandatory to prove a possible advantage of iron sucrose in short- and long-term efficacy as well as tolerability over iron sulfate in the management.

- **Contraindications**: Do not initiate in patients with constipation. Alosetron tablets should not be started in patients with a history of chronic or severe constipation, or sequelae from constipation, including intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions. Other contraindications include ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or a hypercoagulable state. Patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, and severe hepatic impairment should also avoid alosetron.

- **Constipation (4.1)**: Alosetron tablets are contraindicated in patients with constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **History of severe bowel or hepatic disorders (4.2)**: Patients with a history of the following should not use alosetron tablets:
	- Chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation
	- Intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions
	- Ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state
	- Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
	- Diverticulitis
	- Severe hepatic impairment

- **Concomitant use of fluvoxamine (4.3)**: Concomitant administration of alosetron tablets with fluvoxamine is contraindicated. Fluvoxamine, a known strong inhibitor of CYP1A2, significantly increases mean alosetron plasma concentrations (AUC) approximately 6-fold and prolongs the half-life by approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^117FMiyr]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In this first comparative trial reflecting real-world conditions in patients with quiescent or mild to moderate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and mild to severe iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), both oral ferric maltol and standard regimens of intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose achieved clinically meaningful increases in hemoglobin (Hb) over 12 weeks of treatment, although ferric maltol did not meet the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to IV iron. Over the longer term, ferric maltol showed comparable efficacy in maintaining Hb improvements and increasing ferritin levels up to week 52, consistent with IV iron. The safety profile of each treatment was consistent with previous studies. Thus, ferric maltol offers a simple, tolerable, long-term treatment option for chronic IDA in patients with IBD.

### Efficacy and safety of ferric derisomaltose (FDI) compared with iron sucrose (IS) in patients with iron deficiency anemia after bariatric surgery [^114XMXP6]. Obesity Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is common following bariatric surgery, and treatment with intravenous iron is often required. This post hoc analysis of data from two randomized, open-label, multicenter trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of ferric derisomaltose (FDI; formerly iron isomaltoside 1000) versus iron sucrose (IS) over four weeks in adults with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) resulting from prior bariatric surgery.

Data were pooled for participants who received FDI or IS in the PROVIDE or FERWON-IDA trials for the treatment of IDA post bariatric surgery. Efficacy outcomes included changes in hemoglobin (Hb) and iron parameters; safety outcomes included the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and hypophosphatemia.

The analysis included 159 patients. Mean (standard deviation) cumulative iron doses were 1199 (± 347) mg for FDI and 937 (± 209) mg for IS. Compared with IS, FDI resulted in a faster and more pronounced Hb response, and a higher proportion of responders (Hb level increase ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline) at all time points. The incidence of ADRs was similar with FDI and IS (15.1% and 18.2%, respectively), with no serious ADRs or serious or severe HSRs reported. The incidence of hypophosphatemia was low and similar in both treatment groups, with no cases of severe hypophosphatemia observed.

In patients with IDA resulting from bariatric surgery, FDI produced a faster and more pronounced Hb response than IS. Both FDI and IS were well tolerated.

### Intravenous iron treatment in the prevention of iron deficiency and anaemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^1111TTk2]. Obesity Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Iron absorption is disturbed after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and iron deficiency with or without anaemia affects almost half of all patients. Intravenous iron is an option when oral iron is insufficient or not tolerated. This study explores whether routinely offering intravenous iron treatment when iron stores are empty can prevent anaemia and iron deficiency after RYGB.

- **Methods**: This study involves prospectively registered data on clinical information, haematological tests, and intravenous iron treatment from 644 RYGB patients who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2013, followed postoperatively for more than 5 years. Intravenous iron treatment was offered to patients with ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L.

- **Results**: Clinical information was available for all patients at baseline and for 553 out of 644 patients at 5 years; laboratory results were available for 540 out of 644 patients at baseline and 411 out of 644 patients after 5 years. The mean age was 39.8 (± 9.7) years. Overall, 187 out of 483 (38.7%) women and 9 out of 161 (5.6%) men were given intravenous iron treatment during the observation period. From baseline to 5 years, mean haemoglobin decreased by 0.3 g/dL in both men and women. Anaemia occurred in 18 out of 311 (5.8%) women and 9 out of 100 (9%) men at 5 years. Depleted iron stores (ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L) were seen among 44 out of 323 (13.6%) women and 3 out of 102 (2.9%) men, and low iron stores (ferritin 16–50 μg/L) occurred in 144 out of 326 (44.6%) women and 38 out of 102 (37.3%) men 5 years after RYGB.

- **Conclusion**: By routinely offering intravenous iron treatment to patients with depleted iron stores after RYGB, haemoglobin levels were maintained, reducing the incidence of anaemia and iron deficiency over a 5-year period.

Despite numerous guidelines on the management of anaemia in surgical patients, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians participated in a two-day expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presenting our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period.

- **Diagnostic approach**: The consensus includes a diagnostic approach to iron deficiency and anaemia in surgical patients.
- **Patient identification**: It provides criteria for identifying patients appropriate for treatment.
- **Practical management**: The statement offers advice on practical management and follow-up that is easy to implement.

Available data allow the fulfilment of the requirements of Pillar 1 of Patient Blood Management. We urge national and international research funding bodies to take note of these recommendations, particularly in terms of funding large-scale prospective, randomised clinical trials that can most effectively address the important clinical questions and this clearly unmet medical need.

### The use of iron after surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145kzB9]. Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

The study examined haemoglobin levels at the end of the study from twelve studies including 1174 patients, comparing iron therapy with control using a random effects model. In two additional studies involving 288 patients, intravenous iron was compared with oral iron. These studies reported that patients receiving intravenous iron had a higher mean haemoglobin level of 4.21 g/l (95% CI -16.47 to 24.89, I² = 0%, p = 0.24) compared to those receiving oral iron, although this difference was not statistically significant.

Four studies, involving 851 patients, investigated patient-reported outcome measures such as quality of life and follow-up periods. All of these studies compared intravenous iron with placebo or no intervention, and no significant difference was found between the groups (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.26, p = 0.58, I² = 0%).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- **Quality of life**: This outcome did not differ significantly between those receiving intravenous iron and those receiving placebo or no intervention.
	- **Blood transfusion requirements**: Eight studies with 1205 patients evaluated this measure post-surgery. There was no evidence of an association between intravenous iron and reduced blood transfusion requirements post-surgery (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.14, I² = 0%, p = 0.13). Additionally, two studies with 228 patients, comparing intravenous to oral iron, showed no difference (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.00 to 101.10).

The forest plots used for analysis included quality of life, blood transfusion requirements, and adverse event outcomes, using a random effects model.

### The association between iron deficiency and outcomes: A secondary analysis of the intravenous iron therapy to treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (PREVENTT) trial [^113V8mNF]. Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

In the intravenous iron therapy to treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (PREVENTT) trial, the use of intravenous iron did not reduce the need for blood transfusion, patient complications, or hospital stay length. As part of the trial protocol, serum was collected at randomisation and on the day of surgery. These samples were analysed in a central laboratory for markers of iron deficiency. We performed a secondary analysis to explore the potential interactions between pre-operative markers of iron deficiency and intervention status on the trial outcome measures.

Absolute iron deficiency was defined as ferritin < 30 μg/l; functional iron deficiency as ferritin 30–100 μg/l or transferrin saturation < 20%; and the remainder as non-iron deficient. Interactions were estimated using generalised linear models that included different subgroup indicators of baseline iron status. Co-primary endpoints were blood transfusion or death and the number of blood transfusions, from randomisation to 30 days postoperatively. Secondary endpoints included peri-operative change in haemoglobin, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay.

Most patients had iron deficiency (369/452 [82%]) at randomisation; one-third had absolute iron deficiency (144/452 [32%]) and half had functional iron deficiency (225/452 [50%]). The change in pre-operative haemoglobin with intravenous iron compared with placebo was greatest in patients with absolute iron deficiency, with a mean difference of 8.9 g/l, 95% CI 5.3–12.5; it was moderate in functional iron deficiency.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^116gGH72]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The increase in ferritin concentration at week 12 in the trial was smaller with ferric maltol than with ferric carboxymaltose. Ferritin concentrations with ferric maltol continued to increase slowly during the course of the trial and were maintained within normal limits for approximately three-quarters of patients during long-term treatment. This pattern is consistent with physiological correction of ferritin concentrations over time. In contrast, ferric carboxymaltose rapidly increased ferritin concentrations by week 4, followed by a decline thereafter. In general, continued exposure to supraphysiological levels of iron carries the risk of iron overload and potential organ damage over time, as suggested by radiographic analyses of liver iron concentrations in patients with end-stage renal disease. The clinical implications of iron toxicity are still debated and must be considered in light of blood loss through continuous intestinal bleeding in IBD, as yet there are no published radiographic studies of liver iron concentrations in patients with IBD receiving long-term IV iron.

Ferric maltol was generally well tolerated, with only 10% of patients stopping because of adverse events. The frequency of any TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs was greater with ferric maltol than with ferric carboxymaltose. In particular, gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with oral iron than with IV iron, but the rate with ferric maltol was generally consistent with that reported with placebo in previous phase 3 trials of ferric maltol, with the exception of constipation.

Treatment exposure

In total, 109 patients (87%) in the ferric maltol group and 118 (94%) in the ferric carboxymaltose group completed 12 weeks of treatment; 93 (74%) and 106 (85%), respectively, completed the trial with a scheduled final visit at or after week 12. The most frequent reasons for trial discontinuation were adverse events, loss to follow-up, and withdrawal of informed consent.

Mean (SD) treatment exposure was 30.2 (17.9) weeks for ferric maltol and 15.5 (15.6) weeks for ferric carboxymaltose, reflecting the different treatment schedules for the study drugs: twice-daily oral therapy vs intermittent IV iron given as required after the initial infusion. The median compliance with ferric maltol was 96.8% at week 12, 96.4% at week 24, 95.8% at week 36, and 98.1% at week 52.

Up to week 12, IV iron recipients received between 500 mg and 2500 mg of ferric carboxymaltose (median, 1500 mg; 500–1500 mg per injection) over 1 to 5 injections (median 2 injections), depending on the severity of the anemia and local treatment guidelines. Sixty-eight of 120 patients treated with ferric carboxymaltose received the originally planned IV iron dose, as calculated by the treating physician according to local prescribing information and standard practice; 21 patients received more than the planned dose, and 31 received less. Up to week 52, 341 IV iron infusions were given to 119 patients. The median total IV iron administered to patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group who completed 52 weeks of treatment (n = 55) was 2000 mg, with a wide range from a minimum of 1000 mg.

Iron deficiency is common following bariatric surgery, and treatment with intravenous iron is often required. This post hoc analysis of data from two randomized, open-label, multicenter trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of ferric derisomaltose (FDI; formerly iron isomaltoside 1000) versus iron sucrose (IS) over 4 weeks in adults with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) resulting from prior bariatric surgery.

- **Materials and methods**: Data were pooled for participants who received FDI or IS in the PROVIDE or FERWON-IDA trials for the treatment of IDA post-bariatric surgery. Efficacy outcomes included changes in hemoglobin (Hb) and iron parameters. Safety outcomes included the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and hypophosphatemia.

- **Results**: The analysis included 159 patients. Mean (standard deviation) cumulative iron doses were 1199 (± 347) mg for FDI and 937 (± 209) mg for IS. Compared with IS, FDI resulted in a faster and more pronounced Hb response, and a higher proportion of responders (Hb level increase ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline) at all time points. The incidence of ADRs was similar with FDI and IS (15.1% and 18.2%, respectively), with no serious ADRs or serious or severe HSRs reported. The incidence of hypophosphatemia was low and similar in both treatment groups, with no cases of severe hypophosphatemia observed.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with IDA resulting from bariatric surgery, FDI produced a faster and more pronounced Hb response than IS. Both FDI and IS were well tolerated.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose [^113Wcezh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In this patient population, only the sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated group achieved an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit from baseline.

- **Study C**: Study C was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of two sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection dose regimens (1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg of elemental iron), administered intravenously to 66 iron-deficient pediatric hemodialysis patients aged 6 to 15 years, who were receiving a stable erythropoietin dosing regimen.

Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at doses of 1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 125 mg of elemental iron) in 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride was infused intravenously over one hour during each hemodialysis session across eight sequential dialysis sessions. Thirty-two patients received the 1.5 mg/kg dosing regimen, consisting of 47% male and 53% female, with a demographic composition of 66% Caucasian, 25% Hispanic, and 3% Black, Asian, or Other, and a mean age of 12.3 years. Thirty-four patients received the 3.0 mg/kg dosing regimen, with 56% male and 44% female, comprising 77% Caucasian, 12% Hispanic, 9% Black, and 3% Other, and a mean age of 12.0 years.

The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin concentration from baseline to two weeks after the last sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups. Improvements in hematocrit, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and reticulocyte hemoglobin concentrations were noted compared to baseline values.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1154oUNb]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

At week 12, in the ITT population, the Hb responder rate (≥ 2 g/dL increase or normalization in Hb) was 67% in the ferric maltol group and 84% in the ferric carboxymaltose group; the risk difference was –0.17 (95% CI, –0.28 to –0.06; P = 0.298). In the PP population, the responder rates were 68% and 85%, respectively; the risk difference was –0.17 (95% CI, –0.30 to 0.05; P = 0.341). Because the CIs in both the ITT and the PP analyses crossed the prespecified 20% noninferiority margin, the primary endpoint of noninferiority was not met at week 12.

The time profile of the Hb response differed initially between treatments. At week 4, the responder rate in the ITT population was lower in the ferric maltol group (33%) than in the ferric carboxymaltose group (68%). However, the increase in the responder rate from week 4 to week 12 was greater with ferric maltol than with ferric carboxymaltose. From week 24 onward, the responder rates were similar with ferric maltol and ferric carboxymaltose, and both treatment groups achieved sustained Hb increases up to week 52 (week 24: 80% vs 76%; week 36: 82% vs 81%; week 52/end of treatment: 69% vs 73% for ferric maltol vs ferric carboxymaltose, respectively).

Hb responder rate was monitored over 52 weeks of treatment with oral ferric maltol or IV ferric carboxymaltose. In the ITT population, multiple imputation for missing values was conducted up to week 12, whereas observations were used for the PP population. Response was defined as a ≥ 2 g/dL rise in Hb or normalization of Hb (≥ 12 g/dL in women, ≥ 13 g/dL in men).

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^117CfN5G]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When and how to measure postoperative iron deficiency?

Although the underlying causes of postoperative anaemia are multifactorial, iron deficiency is often present. Pre-operative iron deficiency can be diagnosed based on low ferritin concentrations; however, diagnosing postoperative iron deficiency is more challenging as ferritin levels may be elevated due to the acute phase inflammatory response following surgery. Therefore, patients undergoing major surgery with a high risk of developing moderate-to-severe postoperative anaemia should have their haemoglobin and iron status checked on the day of surgery if it was not already assessed during the pre-operative evaluation. This recommendation also applies to patients with ongoing bleeding and anaemia, such as those with colorectal cancer, who have been treated in the pre-operative period. Since ferritin levels will not be elevated by inflammation immediately after surgery, a postoperative ferritin concentration of < 100 μg/L within 24 hours after surgery indicates insufficient iron stores to support erythropoiesis, potentially leading to significant drops in postoperative haemoglobin.

Further markers of postoperative iron deficiency include transferrin saturation < 20% with ferritin concentrations between 100–300 μg/L, or reticulocyte haemoglobin content < 28 pg. These parameters may signal the need for intervention in anaemic patients.

### The PREVENNT randomised, double-blind, controlled trial of preoperative intravenous iron to treat anaemia before major abdominal surgery: an independent discussion [^115KoXUT]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Low credibility.

Anaemia is a common finding in patients presenting for major elective surgery and is associated with poor outcomes, including death and complications. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of perioperative anaemia. Intravenous (i.v.) iron is considered an effective and safe treatment for iron deficiency anaemia and is recommended by expert opinion for the treatment of preoperative anaemia, although evidence from clinical trials is lacking.

The PREVENTT trial was a large multicentre trial investigating the effects of i.v. iron on red cell transfusion, death, complications, and quality of life in 487 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The principal finding of this multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was that there was no difference in the co-primary outcomes of blood transfusion or death, or the number of transfusion episodes, within 30 days after surgery, in patients that received preoperative i.v. iron therapy compared to placebo.

The major inferential differences in this independent discussion relate to the limitations of the PREVENTT trial and its implications for future practice. Although PREVENTT represents the best evidence available to guide the perioperative use of i.v. iron, it is likely that the study was underpowered. In the context of the already widespread adoption of preoperative i.v. iron therapy, many clinicians may have felt they lacked equipoise. In light of the PREVENTT study, routine use of i.v. iron in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery cannot be recommended. Further research should define the optimum red cell transfusion strategy.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^115TvPGY]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia is common in inflammatory bowel disease, requiring oral or intravenous iron replacement therapy. Treatment with standard oral irons is limited by poor absorption and gastrointestinal toxicity. Ferric maltol is an oral iron designed for improved absorption and tolerability.

- **Methods**: In this open-label, phase 3b trial (EudraCT 2015–002496–26 and NCT02680756), adults with nonseverely active inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin, 8.0–11.0/12.0 g/dL [women/men]; ferritin, < 30 ng/mL/ < 100 ng/mL with transferrin saturation < 20%) were randomized to oral ferric maltol 30 mg twice daily or intravenous ferric carboxymaltose given according to each center's standard practice. The primary endpoint was a hemoglobin responder rate (≥ 2 g/dL increase or normalization) at week 12, with a 20% noninferiority limit in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations.

- **Results**: For the intent-to-treat (ferric maltol, n = 125; ferric carboxymaltose, n = 125) and per-protocol (n = 78/88) analyses, week 12 responder rates were 67% and 68%, respectively, for ferric maltol vs 84% and 85%, respectively, for ferric carboxymaltose. As the confidence intervals crossed the noninferiority margin, the primary endpoint was not met. Mean hemoglobin increases at weeks 12, 24, and 52 were 2.5 vs 3.0 g/dL, 2.9 vs 2.8 g/dL, and 2.7 vs 2.8 g/dL with ferric maltol vs ferric carboxymaltose. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 59% and 36% of patients, respectively, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 10% and 3% of patients, respectively.

### Oral ferric maltol for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with CKD: A randomized trial and open-label extension [^111eSp5F]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT). We evaluated the effects of oral iron replacement therapy with ferric maltol in these patients.

- **Study design**: Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (AEGIS-CKD) and open-label extension.

- **Setting & participants**: Adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and iron-deficiency anemia at 30 US centers.

- **Intervention**: Oral ferric maltol at 30mg or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks (2:1 randomization) followed by ferric maltol at 30mg twice daily for up to 36 weeks (all patients).

- **Outcome**: Change from baseline in hemoglobin (primary endpoint at week 16), ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron; safety.

Results showed 167 patients were randomized (ferric maltol, n = 111; placebo, n = 56). At week 16, hemoglobin had increased significantly with ferric maltol versus placebo (least-squares mean difference: 0.5 ± 0.2 [SE] g/dL; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9; P = 0.01). Ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron increased with ferric maltol but declined with placebo (all P < 0.05). Hemoglobin levels were sustained up to week 52 in patients continuing ferric maltol and increased in patients switching from placebo to ferric maltol. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (randomized phase: 41% vs 30% [ferric maltol vs placebo]; open-label phase: 56% vs 46%, respectively). Adverse events led to treatment withdrawal in 7 patients (6%) receiving ferric maltol and 5 patients (9%) receiving placebo during double-blind treatment.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1148ZjQw]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

This trial was the first comparative study of oral ferric maltol vs. IV ferric carboxymaltose, used according to local prescribing information to reflect real-world practice in patients with quiescent or mild to moderate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and mild to severe iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). For the primary endpoint of the hemoglobin (Hb) responder rate at week 12, ferric maltol did not show noninferiority to IV ferric carboxymaltose (intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses) due to the slower time required to achieve an increase in Hb with ferric maltol compared to IV iron.

Noteworthy is that both groups achieved clinically meaningful increases in Hb after 12 weeks. Mean Hb increases for ferric maltol vs. ferric carboxymaltose were 2.5 g/dL vs. 3.0 g/dL. Studies have shown that IV administration can bypass physiological iron uptake mechanisms, whereas ferric maltol relies on the availability of iron transporters in the gut lumen. As a result, although iron uptake was initially slower with ferric maltol than with IV iron replacement, Hb and iron storage measures increased and sustained over time up to 52 weeks to clinically meaningful levels consistent with IV administration, even in patients with moderate to severe baseline Hb levels (≤ 8.5 g/dL).

By contrast, many patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group required several IV infusions to sustain Hb increases, and two patients on IV iron had to stop treatment in accordance with the protocol when their Hb concentration dropped below 7.5 g/dL. These findings support the use of IV iron in settings where urgent iron replacement is required, such as surgical interventions, whereas either IV or oral iron can be considered in less urgent scenarios.

### The important role for intravenous iron in perioperative patient blood management in major abdominal surgery: A randomized controlled trial [^116xq7Vx]. Annals of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

To determine if preoperative intravenous (IV) iron improves outcomes in abdominal surgery patients, a study was conducted focusing on preoperative iron deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA is common and, if untreated, increases the risk of allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT). Although limited evidence exists, this randomized controlled trial aimed to determine whether perioperative IV iron reduces the need for ABTs.

Between August 2011 and November 2014, 72 patients with IDA were assigned to receive either IV iron or usual care. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ABT. Secondary endpoints included various hemoglobin (Hb) levels, the change in Hb between time points, length of stay, iron status, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life four weeks post-surgery.

A 60% reduction in ABT was observed in the IV iron group compared to the usual care group (31.25% vs 12.5%). Hb values, although similar at randomization, improved by 0.8g/dL with IV iron compared to 0.1g/dL with usual care (P = 0.01) by the day of admission. The IV iron group had higher Hb levels four weeks after discharge compared to the usual care group (1.9 vs 0.9g/dL, P = 0.01), and a shorter length of stay (7.0 vs 9.7 days, P = 0.026). There was no difference observed in discharge Hb levels, morbidity, mortality, or quality of life.

Administration of perioperative IV iron reduces the need for blood transfusion and is associated with a shorter hospital stay, enhanced restoration of iron stores, and a higher mean Hb concentration four weeks after surgery.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1174FhTp]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 12 patients (9%) receiving ferric maltol and 4 patients (3%) receiving ferric carboxymaltose; none were deemed related to the study treatment. During the trial, an 82-year-old patient receiving ferric maltol died from natural causes unrelated to the study drug.

Study medication was discontinued prematurely due to adverse events in 13 patients (10%) on ferric maltol, including abdominal pain (n = 3), abdominal distension (n = 2), constipation (n = 2), Crohn's disease flare (n = 2), and nausea (n = 2). In contrast, discontinuation occurred in 3 patients (3%) on ferric carboxymaltose due to hypersensitivity reaction (n = 1), ulcerative colitis flare (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of the colon (n = 1). Additionally, 2 patients on IV iron had hemoglobin levels fall to ≤ 7.5 g/dL, necessitating discontinuation per protocol. There were no clinically meaningful trends in changes in routine clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, or physical examination findings in either treatment group.

- **Quality of life**: According to SF-36 scores, health-related quality of life improved from baseline to week 12 in both treatment groups. Improvements in physical and mental component summary scores were slightly greater with ferric maltol than with IV iron. For physical component summary scores, the mean change from baseline to week 12 was 3.9 with oral ferric maltol and 2.5 with IV ferric carboxymaltose.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^115d1NmV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) is a stable, macromolecular (150 kDalton) ferric hydroxide carboxymaltose complex that can be administered at a dose of up to 1000 mg in only 15 minutes. At the time of writing, safety and efficacy data regarding the IV administration of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) are available for over 3,500 patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) resulting from chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, and postpartum. In most of these trials, patients received FCM equivalent to an iron dose of ≤ 1000 mg (or 15 mg/kg in those weighing less than 66 kg) given as an infusion over ≤ 15 minutes, with subsequent weekly infusions.

Two randomized studies have confirmed the superiority of this new formulation in IBD patients. The first study showed the drug to be efficacious and well-tolerated compared to oral iron, and the second demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the drug compared to iron sucrose in a multinational, randomized study including more than 550 patients. Ferric carboxymaltose was considerably more effective in correcting anemia than iron sucrose; more patients on ferric carboxymaltose showed hemoglobin values increased by ≥ 20 g/L or achieved normalization of hemoglobin levels than with iron sucrose. Moreover, since FCM required a mean of only 2.1 15-minute infusions, as opposed to 5.8 infusions of 1-hour duration in the iron sucrose group, it was also found to be considerably more convenient for patients.

While transient hypophosphatemia has been encountered in some individuals treated with ferric carboxymaltose (e.g. 2.5% of patients in the Evstatiev trial), the potent

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^114VVriT]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Elemental iron is an essential growth factor for bacteria, with many species expressing iron transport proteins that compete with transferrin. It has long been suggested that patients with iron overload are at an increased risk of infection. However, data from meta-analyses and large observational studies showed that peri-operative intravenous (i.v.) iron did not increase postoperative infection or 30-day mortality rates in surgical patients. In contrast, red cell transfusion delivers haem and labile iron, which readily supports bacterial growth. Nevertheless, in the absence of definitive clinical data, it would seem logical to refrain from i.v. iron administration in the setting of acute infection.

The available evidence relating i.v. iron administration to oxidative stress leading to atherogenesis and vascular remodelling is sparse and indirect. It is mostly derived from retrospective observational studies addressing long-term i.v. iron therapy, whereas in the postoperative period, very short-term i.v. iron courses are administered (one or two large doses). Thus, it does not seem to be of concern in the postoperative setting.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^112Lvexx]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

An estimated 36% to 90% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have iron deficiency due to chronic inflammation, mucosal blood loss, and iron malabsorption. Iron deficiency is associated with symptoms such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, tachycardia, reduced cognitive function, and depression, greatly impacting patients' daily functioning, ability to work, and quality of life.

- **Treatment considerations**: Treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) typically involves iron replacement therapy with oral ferrous iron preparations. However, the poor bioavailability of ferrous salts and gastrointestinal adverse events limit their use, especially in IBD patients. Up to 90% of orally administered ferrous iron remains unabsorbed, undergoing oxidation in the gut and producing reactive oxygen species, which can cause mucosal damage and gastrointestinal issues. In some countries, oral ferrous compounds are contraindicated for ulcerative colitis patients. Compliance can also be poor even among patients eligible for oral iron therapy.

- **Intravenous (IV) iron use**: IV iron is often used for patients with more severe anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] < 10 g/dL), clinically active IBD, previous intolerance to oral iron, or those receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Research indicates that IV iron facilitates rapid Hb increase and replenishment of body iron stores even amidst inflammation, albeit with increased healthcare costs compared to oral iron.

### International consensus statement on the peri-operative management of anaemia and iron deficiency [^115gJnkj]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations on the management of pre-operative anaemia, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in an expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After the presentation of their own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. They developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the peri-operative period.

These statements include:

- **Diagnostic approach**: A diagnostic approach for anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients.
- **Identification**: Identification of patients appropriate for treatment.
- **Practical management**: Advice on practical management and follow-up.

The authors urge anaesthetists and peri-operative physicians to embrace these recommendations and hospital administrators to enable the implementation of these concepts by allocating adequate resources.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^112cLg7y]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

At baseline, the mean (SD) ferritin concentration was 16.6 (71.6) ng/mL in the ferric maltol group and 9.2 (12.1) ng/mL in the ferric carboxymaltose group. At week 12, the mean (SD) ferritin increased to 25.7 (24.1) ng/mL in the ferric maltol group and to 139.2 (174.6) ng/mL in the ferric carboxymaltose group. The least squares mean (LSM) change in ferritin from baseline to week 12 was significantly smaller with ferric maltol than with ferric carboxymaltose (13.7 ng/mL vs. 126.7 ng/mL; LSM difference: –113.1 ng/mL; 95% CI: –145.9 to –80.2; P < 0.001).

Ferritin levels increased steadily with ferric maltol throughout the trial (mean [SD] 19.7 [17.3] ng/mL at week 4, 42.4 [38.4] ng/mL at week 24, 51.8 [53.4] ng/mL at week 36, and 78.9 [141.8] ng/mL at week 52/end of treatment). In contrast, a sharp increase in ferritin was observed with ferric carboxymaltose at week 4, followed by a decrease thereafter (mean [SD] 158.7 [157.1] ng/mL at week 4, 116.6 [128.9] ng/mL at week 24, 109.9 [159.6] ng/mL at week 36, and 103.4 [143.0] ng/mL at week 52/end of treatment). Normalization of ferritin concentrations was achieved in 46% of ferric maltol recipients vs. 81% of ferric carboxymaltose recipients at week 4, 60% vs. 76% at week 12, 73% vs. 70% at week 24 (P < 0.001), 80% vs. 60% at week 36 (P < 0.001), and 67% vs. 70% at week 52 or end of treatment (P = 0.025).

### Enteral ferric citrate absorption is dependent on the iron transport protein ferroportin [^115cLBoF]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

Ferric citrate is approved as an iron replacement product in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anemia. Although ferric citrate-delivered iron is enterally absorbed, the specific mechanisms involved have not been evaluated, including the possibilities of conventional, transcellular ferroportin-mediated absorption and/or citrate-mediated paracellular absorption. We first demonstrate the efficacy of ferric citrate in high hepcidin models, including Tmprss6 knockout mice, characterized by iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, with and without adenine diet-induced chronic kidney disease.

To assess whether enteral ferric citrate absorption is dependent on ferroportin, we evaluated the effects of ferric citrate in a tamoxifen-inducible, enterocyte-specific ferroportin knockout murine model (Villin-Cre-ER T2, Fpn flox/flox). In this model, ferroportin deletion was efficient, as tamoxifen injection induced a 4000-fold decrease in duodenum ferroportin mRNA expression, with undetectable ferroportin protein on Western blot of duodenal enterocytes. This resulted in a severe iron deficiency anemia phenotype.

In ferroportin-deficient mice, three weeks of 1% ferric citrate dietary supplementation, a dose that prevented iron deficiency in control mice, did not improve iron status or rescue the iron deficiency anemia phenotype. We repeated the conditional ferroportin knockout experiment in the setting of uremia, using an adenine nephropathy model, where three weeks of 1% ferric citrate dietary supplementation again failed to improve iron status.

### Long-term effectiveness of oral ferric maltol vs intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^114A6NVM]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Ferric maltol is a chemically stable complex of ferric iron and maltol, specifically formulated for improved absorption from oral administration. Ferric iron is delivered to the intestinal mucosa in a biologically labile complex, allowing the efficient uptake of elemental ferric iron into enterocytes at a relatively low daily dose while avoiding free iron in the gut, thereby minimizing gastrointestinal toxicity. In phase 3 clinical trials in patients with quiescent or mild to moderate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), ferric maltol provided highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in hemoglobin (Hb) compared to placebo within 12 weeks that were maintained for up to 64 weeks. The rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with ferric maltol was low and similar to that seen with placebo.

Given this favorable benefit/risk profile, ferric maltol may offer an effective iron replacement option in patients for whom oral ferrous irons are unsuitable and who would otherwise require intravenous (IV) iron. The aim of the present noninferiority trial was to compare ferric maltol and IV ferric carboxymaltose for the treatment of IDA in patients with IBD in line with usual practice.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116UwsGD]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, there are important considerations for identifying and managing iron deficiency anaemia (IDA).

- **Prevalence after surgery**: IDA is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery. The condition is found in approximately a quarter of subjects two years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and is more common in women and those with preoperative evidence of low iron stores. The prevalence after sleeve gastrectomy is likely lower.

- **Factors contributing to IDA**: IDA often occurs due to reduced nutritional intake and malabsorption, and may be associated with other nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Recommendation for new presentations**: In new cases of IDA, a history of GI or bariatric surgery should not preclude investigating other potential causes of IDA. Despite a lower yield of finding other causative lesions on BDE (bowel diagnostic endoscopy) in post-surgery individuals, it remains crucial not to automatically attribute IDA solely to previous surgery.

- **Risk of malignancy**: There is a particular need to exclude other possibilities in individuals at risk of underlying GI malignancy, considering that partial gastrectomy may predispose individuals to the later development of cancer in the gastric remnant.

The existing evidence quality and consensus vary, with certain recommendations based on high evidence quality and strong consensus.
