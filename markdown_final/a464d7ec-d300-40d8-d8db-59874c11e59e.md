## Question

What is the suggested work up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the suggested workup is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the user is asking about a specific condition or a general diagnostic approach. Then, I should verify the universal first steps that apply across conditions. Next, I will consider how to tailor testing to pretest probability and the differential diagnosis. After that, I should review escalation strategies and when to involve specialists or advanced testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight key principles that change practice, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The question "What is the suggested workup?" is too broad without a condition, so I need to ensure I'm outlining a generalizable, condition-agnostic diagnostic approach that clinicians can adapt to specific presentations, while noting where disease-specific pathways diverge, such as for suspected Alzheimer's disease, COVID-19, or acute chest pain, which have their own guideline-driven algorithms [^56861bc0] [^52f99ecf].

> I will now examine the universal starting point: history and physical examination. Wait, let me verify that this remains foundational across high-quality guidelines. Yes, virtually all authoritative guidance begins with a careful history and focused physical exam to define the problem, generate a differential, and identify red flags that will shape testing and urgency, including in cognitive impairment, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular complaints [^35610d78] [^56b915ad] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to tailor initial testing to pretest probability and the working differential. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I apply Bayesian principles and test characteristics correctly. Guidelines consistently recommend selecting tests with the best diagnostic yield for the suspected condition, considering sensitivity, specificity, and how results will change management, while avoiding low-yield tests that won't alter decisions [^c6eaf0ad] [^6814a2eb] [^56861bc0].

> Let me consider first-line diagnostic testing by common categories. For suspected infection, I should confirm that molecular testing is preferred when available, for example NAAT for COVID-19, with antigen testing as an alternative when NAAT is unavailable or delayed, and I should remember that negative antigen results in high suspicion warrant NAAT confirmation [^046727cb] [^046727cb]. For suspected coronary artery disease in the ED, I should double-check that noninvasive testing selection is individualized by risk, pretest probability, and prior test results, with CT angiography, stress testing, or functional imaging chosen based on patient factors and institutional expertise [^6814a2eb]. For cognitive impairment, I need to ensure a tiered approach: start with Tier 1 labs and cognitive screening, then escalate to Tier 2 or 3 biomarkers or neuropsychology when etiology remains uncertain or atypical features emerge [^35610d78] [^5451b644].

> I should confirm escalation triggers and when to pursue advanced testing or specialist referral. Red flags, diagnostic uncertainty, atypical presentations, or failure to respond to initial management should prompt higher-tier testing or specialty input, such as neuropsychology for cognitive syndromes, advanced imaging for persistent diagnostic questions, or invasive testing when noninvasive results are inconclusive but suspicion remains high [^35610d78] [^6814a2eb] [^c6eaf0ad].

> But wait, what if resources are limited or the patient cannot access certain tests? I need to ensure the plan is adaptable. Guidelines emphasize aligning test selection with local availability, patient preferences, and feasibility, and they caution against overtesting when evidence is weak or when results won't change management, which is particularly relevant in low-resource settings or when patient risk is low [^046727cb] [^6814a2eb] [^35610d78].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm. First, define the clinical problem and generate a prioritized differential based on history and exam. Second, select initial tests with the highest diagnostic yield for the leading diagnoses, avoiding low-value testing. Third, interpret results in the context of pretest probability and decide whether the diagnosis is established or further testing is needed. Fourth, escalate to second-line tests, specialist referral, or advanced diagnostics if uncertainty persists or red flags appear. Fifth, reassess iteratively as new data emerge and adjust the differential and plan accordingly [^35610d78] [^6814a2eb] [^046727cb].

> Hold on, I should verify key principles that change practice. Shared decision-making and patient-centered communication are repeatedly emphasized, especially in cognitive impairment and chronic disease evaluations, and should start from the initial visit. Diagnostic stewardship to avoid unnecessary radiation, false positives, and cost is critical in imaging and in cascade testing. And timely escalation prevents diagnostic delay when serious disease is suspected, balancing the risks of delayed diagnosis against the harms of overtesting [^35610d78] [^6814a2eb] [^9f4b3141].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note disease-specific exceptions where the "general" workup does not apply. For example, suspected Alzheimer's disease follows a multi-tiered cognitive and biomarker pathway, COVID-19 prioritizes molecular diagnostics with antigen as a conditional alternative, and acute chest pain uses risk-stratified noninvasive testing algorithms; these are best followed per their dedicated guidelines rather than forcing them into a generic framework [^35610d78] [^ab30499b] [^6814a2eb].

---

The suggested workup depends on the clinical context, but a **structured approach** is essential: start with a focused history and physical exam, then order targeted labs and imaging based on the differential diagnosis. For undifferentiated complaints, begin with **CBC, CMP, TSH, urinalysis, and chest X-ray** as appropriate, and escalate to condition-specific tests (e.g. ECG, echocardiography, CT/MRI, endoscopy, or specialty referrals) when indicated. Always align testing with pretest probability, patient risk, and likely diagnoses to avoid unnecessary studies and delays in care [^6814a2eb] [^notfound].

## General principles of diagnostic workup

- **History and physical examination**: Foundation of all diagnostic workups; guides test selection and interpretation [^35610d78].
- **Targeted testing**: Order tests based on pretest probability, differential diagnosis, and patient-specific factors [^6814a2eb].
- **Avoid unnecessary testing**: Minimize low-yield tests to reduce harm, cost, and delays [^9f4b3141].
- **Iterative approach**: Reassess and refine the differential as new data emerge [^0dab30f2].

## Special considerations

- **Age and comorbidities**: Tailor testing to patient-specific risks and pretest probability [^6814a2eb].
- **Resource availability**: Adapt workup to local resources and patient preferences [^eec88614].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess and repeat tests if symptoms persist or evolve [^0dab30f2].

---

A structured, **context-driven workup** — history and exam first, then targeted labs and imaging — ensures accurate, efficient diagnosis while minimizing unnecessary testing and delays.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: a systematic and inclusive approach [^61c92d83]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence and experience based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

Summary

The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

Key Message

This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### The diagnostic workup in chronic spontaneous urticaria-what to test and why [^212061d7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the guidelines recommend very limited diagnostic procedures during the routine workup, although additional investigations might be indicated in some patients with CSU. For physicians treating patients with CSU, it is often difficult to decide which diagnostic tests are useful.

Objective

To provide recommendations on what diagnostic tests should be performed on which patients with CSU.

Methods

We performed an extensive literature search on the respective topics and identified relevant questions that should prompt diagnostic procedures based on the published evidence and expert consensus among all authors.

Results

We provide questions, diagnostic testing, where appropriate, and recommendation that should be included when assessing the history of a patient with CSU, to explore and rule out differential diagnoses, to assess patients for underlying causes and modifying conditions, to explore patients for comorbid diseases and consequences of having CSU, and to assess patients for CSU components that can help to predict their disease course and response to treatment.

Conclusions

Here, we provide physicians treating patients with CSU with information about which clues should lead to which tests and why.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^a01b9b18]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

- A complete diagnosis of acute leukemia requires knowledge of clinical information combined with morphologic evaluation, immunophenotyping and karyotype analysis, and often, molecular genetic testing. Although many aspects of the workup for acute leukemia are well accepted, few guidelines have addressed the different aspects of the diagnostic evaluation of samples from patients suspected to have acute leukemia.

Objective

- To develop a guideline for treating physicians and pathologists involved in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of new acute leukemia samples, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.

Design

- The College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in hematology and hematopathology to develop recommendations. A systematic evidence review was conducted to address 6 key questions. Recommendations were derived from strength of evidence, feedback received during the public comment period, and expert panel consensus.

Results

- Twenty-seven guideline statements were established, which ranged from recommendations on what clinical and laboratory information should be available as part of the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of acute leukemia samples to what types of testing should be performed routinely, with recommendations on where such testing should be performed and how the results should be reported.

Conclusions

- The guideline provides a framework for the multiple steps, including laboratory testing, in the evaluation of acute leukemia samples. Some aspects of the guideline, especially molecular genetic testing in acute leukemia, are rapidly changing with new supportive literature, which will require on-going updates for the guideline to remain relevant.

### Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults: guideline from the American Society for Clinical Pathology and the college of American pathologists [^bce463be]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

The diagnostic workup of lymphoma continues to evolve rapidly as experience and discovery led to the addition of new clinicopathologic entities and techniques to differentiate them. The optimal clinically effective, efficient, and cost-effective approach to diagnosis that is safe for patients can be elusive, in both community-based and academic practice. Studies suggest that there is variation in practice in both settings.

Objective —

To develop an evidence-based guideline for the preanalytic phase of testing, focusing on specimen requirements for the diagnostic evaluation of lymphoma.

Design —

The American Society for Clinical Pathology, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in the laboratory workup of lymphoma to develop evidence-based recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic review of literature to address key questions. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, recommendations were derived based on the available evidence, strength of that evidence, and key judgements as defined in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework.

Results —

Thirteen guideline statements were established to optimize specimen selection, ancillary diagnostic testing, and appropriate follow-up for safe and accurate diagnosis of indolent and aggressive lymphoma.

Conclusions —

Primary diagnosis and classification of lymphoma can be achieved with a variety of specimens. Application of the recommendations can guide decisions on specimen suitability, diagnostic capabilities, and correct use of ancillary testing. Disease prevalence in patient populations, availability of ancillary testing, and diagnostic goals should be incorporated into algorithms tailored to each practice environment.

### Diagnosis and management of adenocarcinoma in situ: a Society of Gynecologic Oncology evidence-based review and recommendations [^9a8c3152]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Clinical Question 1

What clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests should be performed for patients with suspected cervical AIS?

Recommendation 1.1

Evaluation of abnormal cytology or a positive HPV test result or both is recommended per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines (BII), and colposcopic examination should be performed using the ASCCP colposcopy standards (Table 2). Atypical glandular cells (AGC) and HPV-16 and -18 are associated with AIS and should be evaluated with colposcopy, endocervical sampling, and endometrial biopsy, as recommended by the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines. Given the association of HPV-18 with AIS, endocervical sampling in the setting of a positive HPV-18 test result regardless of colposcopy findings is acceptable (CIII).

Table 2.
ASCCP Risk-Based Colposcopy Standards and Atypical Glandular Cells Evaluation

Recommendation 1.2

A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for all patients with AIS diagnosed on cervical biopsy, as well as all patients whose cervical biopsy and endocervical curettage results are negative in the setting of cytology results showing AIS or AGC-favor neoplasia. For persistent AGC-not otherwise specified, refer to ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines. A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended to rule-out an invasive adenocarcinoma, even when definitive hysterectomy is planned (AII).

2.2.3 Core element six: Iterative diagnostic formulation and multitiered diagnostic testing

By following recommendations to this sixth core element in the evaluation process, the clinician should be able to integrate information about risk profile, history of symptoms, and examination findings to develop an opinion regarding the cognitive functional status and, at least preliminarily, a cognitive–behavioral syndromic diagnosis, if present. There should also be sufficient information for most primary care clinicians to arrive at a first decision point about whether consultative input should be obtained (i.e. from a neuropsychologist, specialist physician, or dementia subspecialist).

To achieve the goals of this three‐step diagnostic formulation, the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommends a structured and multi‐tiered approach to assessment and testing that begins with a fundamental set of Tier 1 assessments and tests, supplemented as needed by other tests tailored to the patient (see Figure 2). The clinician should formulate the results of the Tier 1 assessments and tests and decide which, if any, additional tests may be required to gain sufficiently high confidence in the presence or absence of a specific diagnosis. A stepped approach to diagnostic evaluation is also a cornerstone of other national, international, and intersocietal guidelines.,

FIGURE 2
In a primary care setting, this diagram shows the implementation of the seven core elements of the diagnostic evaluation process, illustrating how each clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow, using the first tier of assessments and diagnostic tests. Ultimately, the goal is to evaluate a person with cognitive and/or behavioral symptoms to determine whether they have cognitive impairment and if so its impact on daily function (cognitive functional status), the cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the likely etiology (‐ies) of the impairment. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated. CBC, complete blood count; CRP, C‐reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TSH, thyroid‐stimulating hormone.

### Applying recommendations for diagnostic disclosure of mild cognitive impairment and dementia: practical guidance for clinicians [^85f07c97]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The Alzheimer's Association Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD‐ADRD CPG), published in this special issue, provide recommendations for AD/ADRD diagnosis in primary and specialty care. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG offer comprehensive, evidence‐based guidance for performing a cognitive evaluation. Expert panels have also put forth recommendations for the disclosure of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Here, we use these guidelines and recommendations to develop a structure and process for diagnostic disclosure. The recommendations herein are the product of the process used to develop the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG. This process was in accordance with the best practices in guideline development described in the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust. Details of these methods can be found in the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Executive Summary of Recommendations for Primary Care Supporting Information.

We assume the clinician, having completed the cognitive evaluation, now wants to communicate the evaluation's results to the patient and care partner. Receiving a diagnosis of cognitive impairment – encompassing mild cognitive impairment and dementia – or AD/ADRD is a defining moment in a person's life. The individuals involved, disclosure setting, information conveyed, and approach to communication all impact how individuals react to and perceive the diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of cognitive impairment may negatively affect patients' ability to engage with their diagnosis. The recommendations and resources outlined here will help primary care and specialist clinicians apply best practices for diagnostic disclosure and navigate these complexities in dialogue with patients and their care partners in their clinical encounters.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.4 Core element seven: Diagnostic disclosure

Recommendations 10 and 11 provide guidance regarding the seventh core element of the process — the communication of diagnostic findings and recommended follow‐up care. These require that the patient and care partner's understanding and appreciation of the illness — together with the clinician's judgment — guide education, communication, and documentation of diagnostic findings and disclosure. In this context, the clinician should honestly and compassionately communicate the name/stage of the syndrome and the disease causing it; treatment options and expectations; prognosis and potential safety concerns — and the certainties, likelihoods, and unknowns related to these — and medical, psychosocial and community resources for education, care planning and coordination, and support services. A separate article in this special issue provides guidance about the principles of the diagnostic disclosure process as well as when immediate or full diagnostic disclosure may not be recommended or feasible.

2.3 DETeCD‐ADRD recommendations for elements of the diagnostic evaluation process typically performed in specialty or subspecialty care settings

In addition to the core elements of the diagnostic evaluation process and their implementation in the first 11 recommendations, which should be considered in all settings, we provide additional recommendations applicable to the specialist settings. Recommendations 12 and 13 pertain to whom to refer to a specialist and what would usually be expected from a specialist's evaluation. Recommendation 14 summarizes guidance regarding neuropsychological referral and assessment. Recommendations 15 through 19 provide a framework for the hierarchical use of Tier 2 to 4 diagnostic tests (specialized labs, imaging, genetic testing) and consultations, if needed, to determine the cause(s) of (and potential contributors to) the cognitive–behavioral syndrome with a high level of confidence. Recommendations 12 through 19 apply to fewer and fewer patients who are going through this process; the strength of these recommendations applies to this smaller group of patients who are deemed to need more specialized evaluation.

### How to assess quality of primary research studies in the medical literature? [^7bb5e130]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Accuracy studies are the cornerstone of the evaluation of new diagnostic tests. In an accuracy study, patients with a clinical suspicion of disease undergo both the new tests that is being evaluated, and the reference test or "gold-standard" test for the disease. Patients are stratified according to the test result and to whether or not the diagnosis was confirmed by the reference test. Main accuracy indices include the sensitivity (proportion of patients who test positive among those who have the disease), specificity (proportion of patients who test negative among those without the disease), as well as the positive and negative predictive values (proportion of patients with the disease among those with a positive test, and of patients without the disease among those with a negative test, respectively). In appraising an accuracy study, the reader should check that the study design and analysis follow methodological standards. The study population should be representative of the population in which the test will be used in practice. The new test should be interpreted in a blinded and independent fashion from the reference standard to avoid expectation bias, and should not be used to establish the diagnosis (incorporation bias). The reproducibility should be verified. Interpretation criteria and technical aspects should be described with enough details to allow replication. Provided that these conditions are met, the next step is to decide whether the test may be used for patient care. The clinical setting in which the test will be used, and the corresponding pretest probability of disease, will determine how best can the test be used in practice.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^de736875]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The workgroup attempted to phrase each recommendation as a practical action that is considered one of a series of steps in the evaluation and disclosure process. Recommendations 1 through 11 were purposefully written (and re‐written several times after several rounds of modified‐Delphi discussions and voting by the workgroup) so that they could be assigned the highest strength of recommendation. That is, the benefit of performing the recommended action, as part of the goal‐oriented and dynamic evaluation and disclosure process delineated in Figures 1 and 2, outweighs the potential harm and burden in the majority of circumstances. In so doing, the workgroup sought to describe the fundamental principles and steps of the process of a patient‐centered evaluation that should usually be performed from start to finish.

FIGURE 1
For patients who may be exhibiting symptoms and/or signs of cognitive impairment due to AD or ADRD, the three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be accomplished by following a process of seven core elements. AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADRD, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Dx, diagnosis; Hx, history.

### Comprehensive medical evaluation and assessment of comorbidities: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d0f404ee]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Comprehensive medical evaluation — Recommendation 4.3 specifies that a complete medical evaluation should be performed at the initial visit and follow-up, as appropriate, to confirm the diagnosis and classify diabetes; assess glycemic status and previous treatment; evaluate for diabetes complications, potential comorbid conditions, and overall health status; identify care partners and support system; assess social determinants of health and structural barriers to optimal health and health care; review risk factor management in the person with diabetes; begin engagement with the person with diabetes in the formulation of a care management plan including initial goals of care; and develop a plan for continuing care.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation process — To accomplish the three steps of the diagnostic formulation, "the evaluation follows a multi-tiered approach so the clinician can select assessments and tests that follow a structured process but that are tailored to the individual patient's circumstances". Depending on practitioner proficiency and patient profile, the evaluation "can be initiated and, in many situations, completed in a primary clinical practice setting". The three steps may be "relatively straightforward to determine by following a process of seven core elements… and using the first tier of assessment and diagnostic tests in a primary care setting", or may require "additional consultation (e.g., neuropsychological evaluation) and tiers of assessments and tests in the primary care… specialty… or dementia subspecialty settings".

### Pathology consultation clinic for patients with cancer: meeting the clinician behind the microscope | JCO oncology practice… [^ead29ba9]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

5demonstrated that adherence to molecular tumor board recommendations and matching patients with targeted therapies were associated with better outcomes. We suggest that the pathologist is a central figure in navigating a personalized medicine approach, highlighting the various molecular panels that could contribute to a more precise treatment regimen, a forum to stress recommendations of the treating oncologist and expand upon the standard proposals, as the field is dynamic and constantly evolving. Lindsay et al 6described a pilot patient-pathologist consultation program and affirmed the importance of the pathologist in showing empathy and describing pathology in lay terms using clear and simple language to explain diagnoses.

Direct patient-pathologist consultations were also reported by Booth et al, 7who found that 89% of the 18 patients confirmed that they would recommend the consultation to other patients, whereas 78% strongly agreed that they felt more empowered after seeing their disease. As a molecular pathologist, I was always pleased to hear from our oncologists that the molecular diagnosis we made led to successful and effective targeted treatment response in patients. This type of feedback, which is taken for granted by oncologists and other clinicians who see patients routinely, was very important and motivating for me. After several discussions with our oncologists we decided to establish the pathology consultation clinic. Our goal was to set up a patient-pathology consultation service, whereby patients could view their pathology slides and deepen their comprehension regarding all aspects of their diagnosis.

Our results suggest that increasing patients' direct encounters with pathologists could potentially heighten the pathologists' diagnostic accuracy and develop a more patient-centered personalized treatment regimen. Proposal of certified pathologist navigators was introduced by Gibson et al. Our patient-pathology clinics resulted in additional workup among 50. 8% of patients. Almost half of the patients were referred to genetic testing and other molecular evaluations as a result of their meeting with the pathologist. These tests could subsequently result in a change in patients' treatment. In conclusion, future studies should focus on reproducing results in a larger patient population and measuring patients' satisfaction with the patient-pathology consultation clinics.

We suggest that future studies integrate the treating oncologist in a joint patient-pathologist clinic, the optimal platform, in which the pathologists relay diagnostic recommendations and the oncologist may expand upon therapeutic implications, bridging two disciplines and introducing a personalized treatment approach in an era of patient-centered care.

### Clinical utility of genomic sequencing: a measurement toolkit [^a3359d6d]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Box 1 Recommendations for evaluating clinical utility of genomic testing

We recommend that assessment of clinical utility recognize four important dimensions: effects on diagnostic thinking, therapeutic management, patient health and non-health outcomes, and societal impacts.
We recommend that evaluation of clinical utility include assessment of impact on health care provider diagnostic thinking and decision-making. This assessment can include actively tracking changes in the differential diagnosis, influencing the diagnostic journey including decisions to use multiple genetic tests and various other diagnostic modalities, changes in prognostic certainty, and timeliness of the diagnostic information.
We recommend assessment of therapeutic efficacy include all medical recommendations and interventions that follow from a WGS result. While diagnostic results are more likely to lead to tailored recommendations/interventions, the absence of a pathogenic variant can enhance patient management decisions and should also be captured. Interventions can include therapies targeted to underlying disease mechanisms, supportive therapies, disease-specific monitoring plans, sub-specialist referrals, and any other resulting changes in management.
We recommend that assessment of clinical utility include evaluation of patient outcomes that may be directly and indirectly affected by the test. Patient outcomes can include health outcomes (e.g. hospitalization time, hospitalization events, morbidity and survival, disease-specific outcomes) and non-health outcomes (e.g. knowledge, psychosocial response, personal utility, decision quality).
We recommend that assessment of clinical utility include evaluation of societal effects that relate to family impacts, societal acceptability, and value for money. Benefits of information generated by WGS must be balanced against individual, community, and societal level costs and consequences.

### Applying recommendations for diagnostic disclosure of mild cognitive impairment and dementia: practical guidance for clinicians [^3a704626]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A comprehensive evaluation for cognitive impairment should culminate with the communication of the diagnosis to patients and their care partners. This diagnostic disclosure sets the stage for subsequent care. Diagnostic disclosure for individuals with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD‐related dementias (ADRD) is particularly nuanced and requires a conscientious approach. Clinicians must assess patients' understanding and appreciation of symptoms, goals for the evaluation, and desire for information. Because AD/ADRD can impact patients' perceptions of their symptoms, it is recommended to include an informant or care partner for this assessment and for future care. Here, we provide guidance for addressing the complexities of AD/ADRD diagnostic disclosure to build clinicians' confidence in communicating diagnostic findings and a plan of care.

Highlights

Diagnostic disclosure is a key part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment.
The disclosure process begins at the moment a cognitive evaluation is initiated.
Care partners must be included in the cognitive evaluation and diagnostic disclosure.
Clinicians should use patient‐centered communication for evaluation and disclosure.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Core element six: iterative diagnostic formulation and multi‐tiered diagnostic testing

By following recommendations to this sixth core element in the evaluation process (see Figures 1, 2, and 3), the clinician should have integrated information about risk profile, history of symptoms, and examination findings to develop an opinion regarding the cognitive functional status and, at least preliminarily, a cognitive–behavioral syndromic diagnosis, if present. There should also be sufficient information for most primary care clinicians to arrive at a first decision point with regard to whether consultative input should be obtained (i.e. from a neuropsychologist, specialist, or dementia subspecialist). In the primary care setting, two or more problem‐focused visits would usually be required to arrive at this point in the diagnostic evaluation process, especially when involving an informant/care partner and allowing sufficient time to assess cognition via a validated standardized instrument.

To achieve the goals of this three‐step diagnostic formulation, the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommends a structured and multi‐tiered approach to assessment and testing that begins with a fundamental set of Tier 1 assessments and tests, supplemented as needed by other tests tailored to the patient (see Figures 2, 3). The clinician should formulate the results of the Tier 1 assessments and tests and decide which, if any, additional tests may be required to gain sufficiently high confidence in the presence or absence of a specific diagnosis. A stepped approach to diagnostic evaluation of potential cognitive impairment or dementia is also a cornerstone of other national, European and international guidelines including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018 Guidelines on dementia diagnosis and care, Canadian (5th Canadian Consensus Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia) guidelines, the World Health Organization mhGAP 2016 Intervention Guide, and the 2024 European Intersocietal Recommendations for the biomarker‐based diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. It is ultimately each clinician who, depending on her or his proficiency, the available data and resources, and the goals of evaluation, must — in partnership with each patient‐care partner dyad — guide the evaluation process to achieve the desired confidence in the syndromic and etiological diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^f97d7ef3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, finding nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples, and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure. Methods: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability. Results: The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality. Conclusions: The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available.

Core element one: whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals — evaluation initiation and partnership are emphasized, including that "Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports — concerns regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive-behavioral syndrome arising due to specific neuropathologic changes (Recommendation 1)". The guidance states that "A clinician should not assume 'normality' or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to 'normal aging' without an appropriate evaluation", and that optimal evaluation "is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness". It highlights "the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process", and notes that dementia-related impairments "dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning". For communication and goal-setting, "The clinician should use patient-centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage", and it affirms that "The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice".

### The diagnostic evaluation [^a7777361]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation is performed to confirm the diagnosis and extent of the disease. The evaluation begins with a careful history and physical examination. Major changes have occurred in the diagnostic evaluation of patients. Frequently the diagnosis is suspected because of an abnormal mammogram or ultrasound, and image-guided biopsies have all but replaced open biopsy. For the primary care physician, the best strategy is to refer the patient to a specialist or a multidisciplinary breast center.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Core element one: whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals

The first core element of the process, covered by Recommendations 1 through 3, addresses foundational considerations when initiating and proceeding through a diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process. These include in whom and when to initiate an evaluation; the importance of a patient‐centered and collaborative partnership in the goal‐setting, diagnostic, and disclosure processes; and the three‐step conceptual framework for diagnostic formulation. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG also emphasizes the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process.

Recommendation 1 applies the basic tenets of a high‐quality medical approach to the evaluation of symptoms of cognitive or behavioral decline. The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice.,

Any middle‐aged or older patient who self‐reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising due to specific neuropathologic changes (Recommendation 1). A clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation. The optimal approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected cognitive or behavioral impairments, whether at the level of subjective cognitive decline, MCI, mild behavioral impairment, or dementia, is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness.

Clinicians evaluating a patient suspected of having a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising from neurodegenerative disease may face unique challenges arising from impairments that may be present in a patient's awareness of the illness (anosognosia) or understanding and appreciation of medical facts and the ability to use this information to make decisions about medical care or other important activities (capacity). Impairments in awareness and capacity that may be present at the outset or that will arise sooner or later in all patients with dementia due to AD or ADRD dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

DETeCD-ADRD recommendations — Recommendation 1 (evaluation trigger and scope): For patients who self-report or whose care partner or clinician report cognitive, behavioral, or functional change, the clinician should initiate a multi-tiered evaluation focused on the problem (Strength of Recommendation A). Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising as a result of a specific neuropathology, and a clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation, which would constitute suboptimal care. The evaluation process for possible cognitive or behavioral impairment can be initiated and in most cases completed at any of a variety of clinical practice settings: primary care, specialty care, or dementia subspecialty care, and the practitioner's proficiency with this patient population and the profile of the individual patient should guide the evaluation process. The evaluation begins with a history from not only the patient but also — importantly — from someone who knows the patient well (an informant).

Abstract

US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a related dementia (ADRD) are two decades old. This evidence‐based guideline was developed to empower all clinicians to implement a structured approach for evaluating a patient with symptoms that may represent clinical AD/ADRD. An expert workgroup conducted a review of 7374 publications (133 met inclusion criteria) and developed recommendations as steps in an evaluation process. This summary briefly reviews core recommendations and details specialist recommendations of a high‐quality, evidence‐supported evaluation process aimed at characterizing, diagnosing, and disclosing the patient's cognitive functional status, cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and likely underlying brain disease so that optimal care plans to maximize patient/care partner dyad quality of life can be developed; a companion article summarizes primary care recommendations. If clinicians use the recommendations in this guideline and health‐care systems provide adequate resources, outcomes should improve in most patients in most practice settings.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic workflow for suspected AD/ADRD emphasizes sequential formulation: In most cases, the goal is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, with the first step being determination that a person does or does not have dementia and integration of reliable history with performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains; the second step — determination of the cognitive-behavioral syndrome — may warrant additional information or specialist consultation, and a neuropsychological evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in AD/ADRD assessment is often invaluable and can also be very helpful to suggest next steps; third, clinicians implicate a specific disease and/or consider the likely cause(s) of cognitive impairment or dementia, recognizing a persistent differential diagnosis and using risk and resilience factors and established clinical diagnostic criteria while the field evolves toward separating clinical syndromes from likely neuropathologic changes informed by core and ancillary biomarkers.

### A guide for diagnostic evaluations [^d42e92b9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnostic tests have a key role in patient management and the control of most infectious diseases. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, clinical care is often critically compromised by the lack of regulatory controls on the quality of these tests. The information available on the performance of a diagnostic test can be biased or flawed because of failings in the design of the studies which assessed the performance characteristics of the test. As a result, diagnostic tests are sold and used in much of the developing world without evidence of effectiveness. Misdiagnosis leading to failure to treat a serious infection or wasting expensive treatment on people who are not infected remains a serious obstacle to health.

### Preferred reporting items for a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies: the PRISMA-DTA statement [^dee56aba]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy synthesize data from primary diagnostic studies that have evaluated the accuracy of 1 or more index tests against a reference standard, provide estimates of test performance, allow comparisons of the accuracy of different tests, and facilitate the identification of sources of variability in test accuracy.

Objective

To develop the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagnostic test accuracy guideline as a stand-alone extension of the PRISMA statement. Modifications to the PRISMA statement reflect the specific requirements for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies and the abstracts for these reviews.

Design

Established standards from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network were followed for the development of the guideline. The original PRISMA statement was used as a framework on which to modify and add items. A group of 24 multidisciplinary experts used a systematic review of articles on existing reporting guidelines and methods, a 3-round Delphi process, a consensus meeting, pilot testing, and iterative refinement to develop the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline. The final version of the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline checklist was approved by the group.

Findings

The systematic review (produced 64 items) and the Delphi process (provided feedback on 7 proposed items; 1 item was later split into 2 items) identified 71 potentially relevant items for consideration. The Delphi process reduced these to 60 items that were discussed at the consensus meeting. Following the meeting, pilot testing and iterative feedback were used to generate the 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist. To reflect specific or optimal contemporary systematic review methods for diagnostic test accuracy, 8 of the 27 original PRISMA items were left unchanged, 17 were modified, 2 were added, and 2 were omitted.

Conclusions and Relevance

The 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist provides specific guidance for reporting of systematic reviews. The PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline can facilitate the transparent reporting of reviews, and may assist in the evaluation of validity and applicability, enhance replicability of reviews, and make the results from systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies more useful.

### Diagnosing sexual dysfunction in men and women: sexual history taking and the role of symptom scales and questionnaires [^1f8ca676]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

A detailed sexual history is the cornerstone for all sexual problem assessments and sexual dysfunction diagnoses. Diagnostic evaluation is based on an in-depth sexual history, including sexual and gender identity and orientation, sexual activity and function, current level of sexual function, overall health and comorbidities, partner relationship and interpersonal factors, and the role of cultural and personal expectations and attitudes.

Aim

To propose key steps in the diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunctions, with special focus on the use of symptom scales and questionnaires.

Methods

Critical assessment of the current literature by the International Consultation on Sexual Medicine committee.

Main Outcome Measures

A revised algorithm for the management of sexual dysfunctions, level of evidence, and recommendation for scales and questionnaires.

Results

The International Consultation on Sexual Medicine proposes an updated algorithm for diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in men and women, with specific recommendations for sexual history taking and diagnostic evaluation. Standardized scales, checklists, and validated questionnaires are additional adjuncts that should be used routinely in sexual problem evaluation. Scales developed for specific patient groups are included. Results of this evaluation are presented with recommendations for clinical and research uses.

Conclusion

Defined principles, an algorithm and a range of scales may provide coherent and evidence based management for sexual dysfunctions.

2.2 DETeCD‐ADRD core elements of diagnostic and disclosure process and recommendations: A brief summary

The first 11 recommendations, briefly summarized here, are detailed in the companion article. These recommendations follow a series of seven core elements as illustrated in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
For patients who may be exhibiting symptoms and/or signs of cognitive impairment due to AD or ADRD, the three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be accomplished by following a process of seven core elements. AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADRD, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Dx, diagnosis, Hx, history.

2.2.1 Core element one: Whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals

The first core element of the process, covered by Recommendations 1 through 3, addresses foundational considerations when initiating and proceeding through a diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG emphasized the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process.

Any middle‐aged or older patient who self‐reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have AD or an ADRD (Recommendation 1). The clinician should use patient‐centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess the patient's capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage in the goal‐setting process for the evaluation (Recommendation 2). Such a relationship provides a foundation to ensure that all information necessary for an accurate diagnosis is obtained, that an explanation of the illness being faced is effectively communicated, and that a robust plan of care is formulated and implemented. Throughout the process, the clinician's assessment of the patient's awareness and capacity should guide the timing and content of the information shared with the patient and their care partner. A separate article in this special issue summarizes the challenges of and provides guidance on the assessment of capacity in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Analytic framework — CDC writing group members conducted a systematic literature review to compare outcomes of previous and proposed HIV testing algorithm recommendations, and evaluated evidence using criteria adapted to relevant study designs within an analytic framework linking key questions to outcomes related to performance of individual assays and their use in combinations. The evidence synthesis focused on the relative effects of previous and recommended testing algorithms on diagnostic accuracy and yield. Benefits were defined as tests or algorithms classifying specimens as true-positive or true-negative for HIV-1 or HIV-2, and as reduced turnaround time, whereas harms included being classified as false-positive or false-negative, receiving indeterminate or inconclusive results, and delayed diagnosis due to the need for additional specimens or follow-up testing. Services after diagnosis for persons with HIV and for those identified as uninfected would be needed regardless of which testing algorithm is used.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1b1904fa]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — diagnostic questions: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). For pain diagram findings, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions, and for assessment tools or questionnaires to identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether certain history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; however, the Work Group Consensus Statement notes that in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and that subgroups have shown higher or lower incidences of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers, but the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear.

Given the superior sensitivity of molecular diagnostics, the panel suggests using standard NAAT over Ag tests if standard NAAT is available and results of testing will be timely; however, rapid Ag testing has value when timely NAAT is unavailable, especially when results are positive, because the high specificity of Ag testing means that positive results are actionable without needing confirmation. In contrast, negative Ag results should be confirmed by standard NAAT when clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is high, and the panel notes treatment options are typically approved for administration within 5 days of symptom onset.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9edb4cb2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Adult growth hormone deficiency — diagnostic evaluation includes the following guidance: We suggest that when GHRH is not available and performance of an ITT is either contraindicated or not practical in a given patient, the glucagon stimulation test can be used to diagnose GHD. We recommend that because of the irreversible nature of the cause of the GHD in children with structural lesions with multiple hormone deficiencies and those with proven genetic causes, a low IGF-I level at least 1 month off GH therapy is sufficient documentation of persistent GHD without additional provocative testing. We recommend that a normal IGF-I level does not exclude the diagnosis of GHD but makes provocative testing mandatory to make the diagnosis of GHD. We recommend that the presence of deficiencies in three or more pituitary axes strongly suggests the presence of GHD, and in this context provocative testing is optional.

### International children's continence society's recommendations for initial diagnostic evaluation and follow-up in congenital neuropathic bladder and bowel dysfunction in children [^203a8946]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this ICCS standardization document is to report the initial diagnostic evaluation and subsequent work-up of children with neuropathic bladder dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

Due to a paucity of level I or level II, "levels of evidence" publications, these recommendations are actually a compilation of best practices because they seem to be effective and reliable, although not with any control.

Results

Throughout the document, the emphasis is on promoting early, comprehensive evaluation of lower urinary tract function that is thorough but with a minimum of unnecessary testing. This includes what tests to order, when to order them and what to do with the results. Some of the recommendations may not be practical in various worldwide locations but the suggested testing should be considered the ideal approach to completely diagnosing and then promulgating treatments based on the full knowledge of the condition and its effect on urinary tract function. Once the findings are delineated, those lower urinary tract patterns of dysfunction that put the kidneys at risk for deterioration, that are barriers to attaining eventual continence, and that have long-term consequence to the lower urinary track can be obviated by specific management recommendations. The indications and timing of investigations to achieve these objectives are clearly defined in each diagnostic category and during follow-up.

Recommendations

This document should be used as a basis for appropriate evaluation and timely surveillance of the various neuro-urologic conditions that affect children.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^56861bc0]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Tests listed in Tier 2 are reasonable to obtain in some patients when there is suspicion for one of these etiologies based on clinical characteristics, risk profile, or the results of other lab tests or diagnostic studies. Tests listed under Tiers 3 and 4 are warranted only under special circumstances and include tests typically performed by a specialist or dementia subspecialist when diagnostic uncertainty remains regarding the etiology of cognitive impairment, including when there may be atypical or rare or rapidly progressive conditions. Tests listed under Tier X are clinically emerging in specialist/subspecialist settings but may not be validated in diverse real‐world populations and clinical settings, widely accessible, reimbursed, or readily interpreted without high proficiency.,

In the following sections, we focus on FDG PET, CSF analyses for amyloid and tau, and amyloid PET. These three types of tests, as well as newer fluid and imaging biomarkers, can provide invaluable and, in some cases, highly accurate data that often helps increase confidence in the etiology of the cognitive–behavioral syndrome — and in some cases may help assess the severity of the disease. These three modalities were vetted by the workgroup for use in the diagnosis of AD (and in the case of FDG PET for ADRD). At the time the guideline was finalized, the strength of recommendation for these three biomarkers was lower than for the other recommendations. New evidence and greater accessibility in the context of disease‐modifying therapies will require a reconsideration of the strength of these recommendations. The workgroup fully expects that fluid and imaging biomarker testing for suspected neurodegenerative diseases in the context of cognitive–behavioral impairment and dementia will play a much larger role in the next few years as AD and ADRD diagnostics and therapeutics advance in all clinical settings.

Diagnostic algorithm and test selection considerations: "The suggested diagnostic approach for subsequent testing in patients at intermediate risk of 30-day major adverse cardiac events is summarized in Figure 6". The document states, "It is important that providers understand the unique features of each of the noninvasive testing modalities to enable selection of the optimal diagnostic test based on patient characteristics and guideline recommendations", and that "Decisions on the specific choice of test should include patient factors, test availability and timeliness of test reporting, and institutional expertise". It further notes, "Additionally, patients previously having nondiagnostic test results using a particular modality should be considered for testing using an alternative test for CAD where high diagnostic accuracy is likely".

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^983296b9]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — determinants of admission and care pathways states that the evaluating provider must decide whether further workup can continue in an outpatient setting or whether hospital-based evaluation is required, and that the purpose of hospital-based evaluation is to expedite the treatment of identified serious conditions or to continue the diagnostic evaluation in the absence of a presumptive cause of syncope. Decision support algorithms may reduce health service use in the evaluation of syncope, although there are currently insufficient data to advocate the use of specific decision support algorithms for making disposition decisions. Specialized syncope evaluation units may lead to reduced health service use and increased diagnostic rates; however, the logistical and financial feasibility in North American settings is unknown, and wider acceptance requires further evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes. Individual risk factors and risk scores are correlated with short- and long-term clinical outcomes, but they are not primary determinants for admission to hospital; presence of ≥ 1 serious medical condition is the key determinant for in-hospital management of patients after syncope.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) molecular COVID-19 diagnostic testing guideline — Because EUA submissions require analytical but not clinical performance data, the panel identified few studies reporting clinical performance and based most recommendations on diagnostic test accuracy. Accuracy metrics include sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are essential; calculating predictive values requires prevalence or pre-test probability, yet true community prevalence may be ill-defined or underestimated when testing is limited or results are not reported. Accordingly, the panel varied estimates of prevalence/pre-test probability and assay sensitivity and specificity in analyses using available literature and public dashboards to mirror what may be encountered in clinical practice.

### American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine consensus report on potential bioeffects of diagnostic ultrasound: executive summary [^217eb15b]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The continued examination of potential biological effects of ultrasound and their relationship to clinical practice is a key element in evaluating the safety of diagnostic ultrasound. Periodically, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) sponsors conferences bringing experts together to examine the literature on ultrasound bioeffects and to develop conclusions and recommendations related to diagnostic ultrasound. The most recent effort included the examination of effects whose origins were thermal or nonthermal, with separate evaluations for potential effects related to fetal ultrasound. In addition, potential effects due to the introduction of ultrasound contrast agents were summarized. This information can be used to assess risks in comparison to the benefits of diagnostic ultrasound. The conclusions and recommendations are organized into 5 broad categories, with a comprehensive background and evaluation of each topic provided in the corresponding articles in this issue. The following summary is not meant as a substitute for the detailed examination of issues presented in each of the articles but rather as a means to facilitate further study of this consensus report and implementation of its recommendations. The conclusions and recommendations are the result of several rounds of deliberations at the consensus conference, subsequent review by the Bioeffects Committee of the AIUM, and approval by the AIUM Board of Governors.

### Evaluation of tuberculosis diagnostics: establishing an evidence base around the public health impact [^886aa1ed]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent developments in tuberculosis diagnostics have led to much optimism, but we still lack the tools that meet the needs of patients in high-burden countries. The next 10–20 years will hopefully see further developments in diagnostic technology. We need to ensure that the framework for evaluating diagnostic tools is best suited to ensuring that the tools with the greatest public health impact and cost-effectiveness are implemented and that those with minimal impact are developed further or are discarded. Diagnostic accuracy studies are an important early step in the evaluation process but do not produce sufficient evidence to inform public health policies. Well-designed prospective studies (including RCTs) should be integrated in the research pathway to provide reliable information on therapeutic impact, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. This new era of tuberculosis diagnostics should be accompanied by a new era for diagnostic research focused clearly on the evaluation of public health impact.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^2060b586]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of experts in sarcoidosis was composed to construct clinically important questions related to diagnostic testing for sarcoidosis. Systematic reviews were then performed to inform recommendations that answered each question. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to formulate and grade the strength of the recommendations. The guideline included three patients who participated on the guideline panel and provided perspective on patient values and preferences. A detailed description of the methods, including the implications of the strengths of the recommendation (i.e. strong vs. conditional) and the meaning of best practice statements, are described in the online supplement. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by four content experts and one methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors. The guideline will be reviewed by the American Thoracic Society 3 years after publication, and it will be determined if updating is necessary.

Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline — initial diagnostic testing and evaluation for suspected Cushing's syndrome: After excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use, we recommend testing for Cushing's syndrome in patients with multiple and progressive features compatible with the syndrome and in patients with adrenal incidentaloma. We recommend initial use of one test with high diagnostic accuracy (urine cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight or 2 mg 48-h dexamethasone suppression test), and we recommend that patients with an abnormal result see an endocrinologist and undergo a second test, either one of the above or, in some cases, a serum midnight cortisol or dexamethasone-CRH test. Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome, patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation, and we recommend additional testing for patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^60b523ab]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — timing of antimicrobials in pediatric sepsis states that in children with septic shock, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible and ideally within 1 hour of recognition, and despite very low quality of evidence the panel provides a strong recommendation that most clinicians should seek to initiate antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after recognition of septic shock in most situations. For children without clinical signs of shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after sepsis recognition, while allowing up to 3 hours for appropriate diagnostic investigation for patients without clinical signs of shock and for those with an uncertain diagnosis. During evaluation, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed expeditiously and, if and when the evaluation supports a likely infection or evidence of septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction becomes manifest, antimicrobial therapy should be immediately administered.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® nontraumatic aortic disease [^c1ae7867]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic aortic disease can be caused by a wide variety of disorders including congenital, inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, neoplastic, and degenerative processes. Imaging examinations such as radiography, ultrasound, echocardiography, catheter-based angiography, CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine examinations are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and assessment of therapeutic response. Depending upon the clinical scenario, each of these modalities has strengths and weaknesses. Whenever possible, the selection of a diagnostic imaging examination should be based upon the best available evidence. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment. The purpose of this document is to assist physicians select the most appropriate diagnostic imaging examination for nontraumatic aortic diseases.

### Clinical imaging guidelines part 1: a proposal for uniform methodology [^9f4b3141]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Inappropriate imaging can lead to unnecessary medical radiologic exposures and cost and may not answer the clinical question. Imaging referral guidelines inform the justification of radiologic procedures and facilitate the choice of the best test first, but their acceptance by referrers, use, and value may be limited by shortcomings in the methodology of development. Focusing on common, essential elements of methodology will help guideline developers. In 2012 and 2013, the International Atomic Energy Agency hosted Technical Meetings on Radiation Protection of Patients Through the Development of Appropriateness Criteria in Diagnostic Imaging. Participants identified and agreed on issues concerning development of imaging referral guidelines. Items based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument were amended with additional items including development and consensus group composition. Consensus was sought on 28 items, 18 of which were agreed should be uniform, and 10 should allow for regional differences. Further work is required to encourage, provide, and identify higher quality evidence and to agree on a grading system for recommendations. Many key areas are common to guideline developers globally, opening the way for international collaboration to help demystify, simplify, and justify.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy [^e6ded443]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy summarize the accuracy, e.g. the sensitivity and specificity, of diagnostic tests in a systematic and transparent way. The aim of such a review is to investigate whether a test is sufficiently specific or sensitive to fit its role in practice, to compare the accuracy of two or more diagnostic tests, or to investigate where existing variation in results comes from. The search strategy should be broad and preferably fully reported, to enable readers to assess the completeness of it. Included studies usually have a cross-sectional design in which the tests of interest, ideally both the index test and its comparator, are evaluated against the reference standard. They should be a reflection of the situation that the review question refers to. The quality of included studies is assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 checklist, containing items such as a consecutive and all-inclusive patient selection process, blinding of index test and reference standard assessment, a valid reference standard, and complete verification of all included participants. Studies recruiting cases separately from (healthy) controls are regarded as bearing a high risk of bias. For meta-analysis, the bivariate model or the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model is used. These models take into account potential threshold effects and the correlation between sensitivity and specificity. They also allow addition of covariates for investigatation of potential sources of heterogeneity. Finally, the results from the meta-analyses should be explained and interpreted for the reader, to be well understood.

### Quantifying the reasoning abilities of LLMs on clinical cases [^13a3843f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Evaluation settings

To evaluate LLMs' clinical capabilities, we developed a framework covering three stages of the patient care journey: examination recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, as shown in Fig. 1 a (more detailed demonstrations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8). Below, we summarize these components (see Section "Evaluation framework" in the "Methods" for full implementation details).

Fig. 1
Overview of our main evaluation pipeline and results.

a Our evaluation framework across three critical patient stages. b The LLM-powered metrics for reasoning processes and final generations using our Reasoning Evaluator. c The performance of seven LLMs on examination recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning. Notably, for treatment planning, we include a comparison on rare disease cases. For other settings, as the rare disease results show minimal variation compared to all cases, we omit them here and provide them in the supplementary tables. d The qualities of reasoning processes, with results for rare cases also provided in the supplementary tables. For examination recommendation, 1-turn reasoning results are plotted, and for diagnostic decision, oracle reasoning results are plotted. Error bars show two-sided 95% z-based confidence intervals for the mean across cases; n denotes the number of independent patient cases.

Examination recommendation

This setting simulates a scenario where a patient first visits a hospital, and LLMs are tasked with recommending examination items such as lab tests or imaging studies, iteratively gathering information to aid diagnosis or treatment. Using the MedR-Bench-Diagnosis, the case summaries — excluding ancillary test results — serve as input, while the ancillary test events are used as for ground-truth reference. Similar to previous works, we initialize an LLM-powered agent to play the role of the patient. The assessed clinical LLM can interact with it by recommending relevant examination items, and the agent provides corresponding results.

To evaluate performance, we define two sub-settings: (i) 1-turn examination recommendation: LLMs can query examination results in a single round of interaction; (ii) Free-turn examination recommendation: LLMs can query information through multiple rounds until sufficient information is gathered for subsequent decisions.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^eec88614]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to make recommendations that address uncertainties that are commonly confronted by clinicians relating to the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. The target audience is pulmonary, rheumatology, or other clinicians who manage patients with suspected or confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis. This guideline was developed by an ad hoc committee of experts from the American Thoracic Society with guidance from experienced methodologists to objectively identify and summarize the best available evidence. The quality of the evidence was poor in most cases, reflecting the need for additional high-quality research to guide clinical practice. As such, clinicians, patients, payers, and other stakeholders should not consider these recommendations as mandates. Moreover, no guideline or recommendation can consider all potential clinical circumstances. Thus, clinicians are encouraged to apply the recommendations within the clinical context of each individual patient, including the patient's values and preferences, and on the basis of regional factors, such as the prevalence of alternative diagnoses or consideration of alternative diagnostic approaches when the preferred diagnostic modality is unavailable.
