## Question

Rash on child trunk and spread to face neck and extremities. Hx of recent viral infection. Pink macular on face, neck, and extremities. What diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a child with a pink macular rash that started on the trunk and spread to the face, neck, and extremities, following a recent viral illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and whether they fit a classic viral exanthem pattern. Then, I should verify which pediatric viral exanthems match this morphology and distribution. Next, I will compare leading candidates like measles, roseola, parvovirus B19, rubella, and enteroviruses. After that, I need to check for red flags that would push me toward urgent evaluation or alternative diagnoses. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline practical next steps, including when testing is warranted and when supportive care suffices.

> Let me first confirm the salient features: a child with a recent viral prodrome, a pink macular eruption that began on the trunk and then spread to the face, neck, and extremities, and a morbilliform (maculopapular) appearance. This pattern is highly suggestive of a viral exanthem rather than a drug eruption or bacterial process, and the centrifugal spread from trunk outward is a classic motif in several childhood viral illnesses [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the leading differential. Measles (rubeola) typically presents with a prodrome of fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by Koplik spots and then a morbilliform rash that starts on the face and spreads downward to the trunk and extremities. The timing and morphology fit, but I should confirm immunization status and exposure risk before concluding measles, especially given its public health implications and complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis [^bc1fbb88] [^8acd9c68].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Roseola infantum (exanthem subitum) classically features 3 days of high fever followed by defervescence and the emergence of a pink, blanching, macular rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the neck and extremities, often sparing the face initially. This "fever-then-rash" sequence and the age range of 6–24 months are very characteristic, and HHV-6 is the usual culprit, so I should ask about the fever curve and age carefully [^836908d1].

> I need to check parvovirus B19 (fifth disease) next. The classic is a "slapped cheek" facial rash with a lacy, reticulated eruption on the trunk and limbs that can recur with heat or sun. However, the description here emphasizes trunk-first spread and does not highlight the pathognomonic facial pattern, so parvovirus is less likely unless the face was prominently involved early or the lacy pattern is noted on exam [^4272cfb5].

> Let me consider rubella. Rubella causes a pink maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward, often with posterior auricular and occipital lymphadenopathy. The absence of lymphadenopathy in the vignette makes rubella less likely, though I should confirm nodes on exam before excluding it [^notfound].

> I should double-check enteroviral exanthems. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease and other enteroviruses can produce morbilliform or vesiculopapular rashes with acral and oral involvement; if there were vesicles, oral lesions, or prominent hand/foot findings, that would shift the pretest probability, but the description here is purely macular and generalized, which is less specific for enterovirus [^53572d46].

> But wait, what if this is pityriasis rosea? PR often starts with a herald patch on the trunk, followed days later by smaller oval macules with collarette scale in a Christmas-tree distribution. However, PR is not typically preceded by a documented viral prodrome, and the initial lesion is usually larger and scaly, which does not match this vignette's "pink macular" onset and recent viral illness, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute to PR here [^4ac23d5d].

> Next, I should review red flags that would change management. If there is petechiae or purpura, mucosal bleeding, hemodynamic instability, severe pain, bullae, or systemic toxicity, I need to urgently evaluate for meningococcemia, severe drug reactions, or other emergencies. None are described here, which supports a benign viral exanthem course, but I should explicitly ask about these features and examine the mucosa and acral surfaces [^189c2603] [^905159b7].

> Let me synthesize. Given a recent viral prodrome, a pink macular eruption beginning on the trunk and spreading to the face, neck, and extremities, and no atypical features, the most likely diagnosis is roseola infantum due to HHV-6, with measles as the key alternative if there was a measles-compatible prodrome with cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots. I should confirm age, fever chronology, immunization status, and exposure risks to separate these entities [^836908d1] [^bc1fbb88].

> I should confirm next steps. For a well-appearing child with a classic roseola course, no testing is routinely required. Supportive care for fever and reassurance about the self-limited nature are appropriate, with counseling that the rash typically resolves in 10–14 days. If measles is suspected based on prodrome or exposure, I should notify public health and arrange measles-specific testing, given its communicability and public health implications [^836908d1] [^bc1fbb88].

> In summary, after reconsidering the morphology, distribution, and temporal pattern, the diagnosis is most consistent with roseola infantum, with measles as the principal alternative if the prodrome and epidemiology fit. I need to ensure I screen for danger signs, verify immunization and exposure histories, and tailor testing accordingly, while providing supportive care and parent education about expected course and recurrence risk [^836908d1] [^bc1fbb88].

The most likely diagnosis is **roseola infantum** (exanthem subitum) due to HHV-6 or HHV-7, given the classic sequence of high fever followed by a pink, macular rash spreading from trunk to face, neck, and extremities after defervescence [^836908d1]. Measles is less likely without the **3 Cs** (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis) and Koplik spots, and rubella is less likely without lymphadenopathy [^bc1fbb88]. Fifth disease (parvovirus B19) is excluded by the absence of the **slapped-cheek** pattern and lace-like extremity rash [^4272cfb5]. Management is supportive, with reassurance that the rash is nonpruritic and self-limited, resolving in 1–2 weeks [^836908d1].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| Roseola infantum (HHV-6/7) | - High fever (3–4 days) <br/> - Then pink, macular rash on trunk spreading to face, neck, and extremities <br/> - Nonpruritic <br/> - Self-limited | High |
| Measles (rubeola) | - Prodrome: fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis <br/> - Koplik spots <br/> - Morbilliform rash from face to trunk <br/> - Not described | Low |
| Rubella (German measles) | - Mild fever <br/> - Pink maculopapular rash <br/> - Posterior auricular/occipital lymphadenopathy <br/> - Not described | Low |
| Fifth disease (parvovirus B19) | - Slapped-cheek facial rash <br/> - Lace-like extremity rash <br/> - Not described | Excluded |
| Enteroviral exanthem | - Variable rash <br/> - Often vesicular or papulovesicular <br/> - Not described | Low |

---

## Clinical reasoning

- **Roseola infantum**: Classic course of high fever followed by rash after defervescence; macular, pink, nonpruritic, spreading from trunk to face, neck, and extremities; fits this case [^836908d1].
- **Measles**: Requires prodrome with cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots; not described, making measles unlikely [^bc1fbb88].
- **Rubella**: Typically involves lymphadenopathy and a different distribution; not described, making rubella unlikely [^notfound].
- **Fifth disease**: Characteristic slapped-cheek and lace-like rash; not described, excluding parvovirus B19 [^4272cfb5].

---

## Management

Management is **supportive care** — antipyretics for fever and parental reassurance — because the rash is nonpruritic and self-limited, typically resolving within 1–2 weeks [^836908d1]. No specific antiviral therapy is indicated.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; roseola is self-limited, with rare complications such as febrile seizures during the febrile phase [^836908d1].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **roseola infantum** (HHV-6/7), given the classic fever–rash sequence and distribution. Management is supportive, with a very good prognosis [^836908d1].

Measles — clinical presentation and complications — The incubation period averages 11–12 days from exposure to onset of prodrome, and rash usually appears approximately 14 days after exposure; prodromal symptoms can include fever with temperature ≤ 40.6°C (≤ 105°F). A characteristic maculopapular rash appears 3–7 days after prodromal onset, begins on the face, becomes generalized to the trunk and extremities, and typically lasts 4–7 days. Common complications include diarrhea (8%), middle ear infection (7%–9%), and pneumonia (1%–6%). Encephalitis occurs in approximately 1 per 1,000–2,000 cases of measles, and approximately 25% of patients with acute measles require hospitalization. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually presents 7–10 years after recovery from primary infection and occurs in approximately 7–11 per 100,000 reported measles cases, with higher rates among children infected at < 2 years of age.

Fever and rash in returned travelers — differential diagnosis and dengue features state that fever and rash are most often, but not always, due to viral infections; bacterial infections, parasitic infections, systemic fungal infections, and some noninfectious conditions can also cause fever and rash; if the rash is characterized by petechiae/purpura or by abundant vesicles, pustules, or widespread blisters, the evaluation should be prompt and thorough; dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are viral diseases transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes and often present as undifferentiated fevers, and rashes — particularly widespread petechial eruptions — provide important diagnostic information, with viral illnesses often occurring in small outbreaks; dengue is characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, frontal headache, and myalgia, a widespread but faint macular rash may appear 2–4 days after illness onset, and a petechial rash may occur in classic and severe dengue.

Purpose Of Review

Arboviral infections caused by Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses continue to pose a significant global health threat, particularly in endemic regions. This review is timely because of the increasing prevalence of these infections, driven by factors such as urbanization and climate change. Dermatological manifestations of these viruses are crucial for early diagnosis, especially given the overlap in symptoms, which can complicate differential diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Recent studies emphasize the importance of mucocutaneous symptoms in diagnosing arboviral infections. In Dengue, distinctive rashes like the 'islands of white in a sea of red' and hemorrhagic skin manifestations have been key diagnostic features. Zika is marked by a pruritic maculopapular rash and nonpurulent conjunctivitis, whereas Chikungunya often results in persistent rashes, desquamation, and hyperpigmentation, particularly on the face. Emerging research highlights the skin's role as both a primary infection site and an immune mediator in these viral diseases, offering new insights into their pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets.

Summary

The unique dermatological profiles of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya are critical for guiding clinical diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings. Understanding these cutaneous manifestations can improve early recognition, particularly in differentiating between these viruses in co-endemic areas. Future research may uncover novel therapeutic strategies by focusing on the interaction between these viruses and the skin's immune responses.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^19034089]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a prevalent dermatological condition characterized by a distinctive herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions, often forming a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains uncertain, with hypotheses pointing to both infectious and noninfectious origins. Human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated, with evidence suggesting viral reactivation as a potential trigger. Epidemiologically, PR affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. The condition is observed globally, with varying incidence rates and seasonal variations, suggesting an infectious component. While PR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort owing to pruritus, and atypical presentations and recurrences complicate diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the current understanding of PR's pathogenesis, highlighting both infectious and noninfectious hypotheses, including viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. It also examines treatment options, such as antivirals and phototherapy, which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify etiological factors and to explore the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies, especially for atypical or recurrent cases.

Clinical Characteristics/Features

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is often clinically identified by the presence of a "herald patch," which is typically a single, large, slightly raised, oval or round erythematous scaly patch that appears on the trunk or neck. This patch is usually pink or salmon-colored and ranges from 2 to 10 centimeters in diameter and is observed in 50–90% of patients. Within a few days to 2 weeks after the herald patch appears, multiple smaller scaly, oval, pink, or salmon-colored plaques with fine scaling edges develop. These secondary lesions often align along the cleavage lines of the trunk and limbs, creating a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern. While the rash primarily affects the trunk and limbs, it can also appear on the neck, arms, and legs, though it rarely involves the face, palms, or soles. These lesions present as elliptical or oval macules and papules, exhibiting fine scaling and a central wrinkling that resembles cigarette paper. A distinctive feature of PR is the collarette scale appearance, where the scale is attached at the periphery but lifted near the center. The distribution of lesions is generally bilateral and diffuse, with the long axis parallel to the skin tension lines.

### Clinicopathological challenges of diagnosing reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption [^c2ac46d4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME) is a skin eruption. It is often mistaken for other conditions that are associated with more severe sequelae that require high-level care, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and multisystem inflammatory conditions. RIME mimickers and the poor specificity of pathology tests for infectious causes of RIME have made the diagnosis and management of this disease challenging. Children with a respiratory prodrome, in the absence of suggestive drug exposures and an acute onset mucosal eruption limited to < 10% surface area, are likely to have RIME.

Fever and rash in returned travelers — viral etiologies and dengue features are highlighted: "Many illnesses fall into the category of fever with a rash," and "In returned travelers, fever and rash are most often, but not always, due to viral infections," though "bacterial infections, parasitic infections, systemic fungal infections, and some noninfectious conditions can also cause fever and rash." When rash shows "petechiae/purpura or by abundant vesicles, pustules, or widespread blisters, the evaluation should be prompt and thorough." Among systemic viral illnesses, "The first 3 conditions discussed — dengue, chikungunya, and Zika — are viral diseases transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes and often present as undifferentiated fevers," with rashes providing clues because "Rashes, particularly widespread petechial eruptions, provide important diagnostic information" and "Viral illnesses often occur in small outbreaks." For dengue, it is "characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, frontal headache (often accompanied by retro-orbital pain), and myalgia," and a macular rash "may appear 2–4 days after illness onset," while "A petechial rash may occur in classic and severe dengue."

### Unusual acral bullous dyshidrosiform rash associated with acute human herpes virus-6 infection in a 2-year-old girl [^254fa2c3]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case underscores the importance of considering viral etiologies, such as HHV-6, when making a differential diagnosis of vesiculobullous eruptions in children. Atypical viral presentations can resemble primary immunobullous or eczematous disorders, making accurate virologic investigation crucial for proper diagnosis and management. This observation contributes to the growing body of evidence indicating that HHV-6 and HHV-7 may be associated with a wider range of cutaneous manifestations, including those in immunocompetent pediatric patients. Recognizing these patterns may facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate, conservative treatment.

Clinical manifestations — pediatric Kaposi sarcoma (KS) associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) features varied organ involvement, and primary HHV-8 infection in young, immunocompetent children may be asymptomatic or present as a self-limited mononucleosis-like illness with fever, mild upper respiratory symptoms, and a maculopapular rash; pediatric presentations differ from those of adults. Cutaneous lesions are characteristic and may be seen in 47% to 83% of affected children, lymphatic involvement occurs in 30% to 64% and is a particularly aggressive form, and as many as 10% to 18% of these children may not have skin lesions; intraoral lesions may be seen in 21% to 41%, occasionally (4%) without skin lesions; visceral dissemination occurs in 12% to 38%. Median age at presentation ranges from 6 years to 10 years, with diagnoses reported as young as 10 months to 2 years, and median CD4 percentage at presentation ranges from 7.4% to 16%. Additional HHV-8–associated conditions include multicentric Castleman disease, which may progress to multi-organ failure, and primary effusion lymphoma, which presents with fluid accumulation symptoms; reactivation of HHV-8 has been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in HIV-infected adults.

COVID-19 cutaneous findings — during acute COVID-19, many people develop rashes that fall into 2 large groups: morbilliform and urticarial eruptions resembling common non-specific viral exanthems, and eruptions associated with hypercoagulability such as net-like erythema (livedo reticularis) or retiform purpura; non-specific acute morbilliform eruptions are widely reported as the most common skin finding in COVID-19; children and young adults may develop "COVID toes," with sudden onset of painful, dusky red macules and patches typically on the plantar aspect of the distal phalanges of one or more toes.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^80963944]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral exanthems typically involve similar locations to high-risk drug eruptions, including involvement of the hands, feet, face, and buttocks. Features, including brighter erythema and less pruritus, are typically associated with viral eruptions but can be difficult to quantify. The primary differentiator of viral and drug eruptions is typically location, with acral, facial, and gluteal involvement all associated with viral eruptions. Seasonality should also be considered; viral eruptions more commonly occur in the spring and summer. Finally, systemic symptoms such as conjunctivitis, cough, headache, irritability, and vomiting are more frequently seen in viral eruptions, but can precede the rash by weeks.

Once a high-risk identification has been made and after evaluating for potential SCARs, evaluation of viral causes should be considered. Additional workup should be tailored on the basis of clinical suspicion. For instance, a respiratory panel should be ordered if upper respiratory tract infection symptoms are present. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis warrant specific testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Arthralgias should prompt workup for parvovirus B19 and, in patients with the appropriate travel history, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus. Acral and oral involvement should raise suspicion for enterovirus, coxsackievirus, and echovirus. Finally, those who are underimmunized or unimmunized should be tested for measles and rubella viruses. Viral testing is of particular importance if the virus in question, such as HIV, affects patient outcomes. Other laboratory values, such as skin or serum cytokines, are not clinically useful to differentiate viral from other causes of drug eruptions at this time. Because the histopathology of viral eruptions can be nonspecific, skin biopsy is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Murine typhus: an unlikely cause of cat scratch fever with ascending rash [^3cef2432]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Murine typhus is an acute febrile illness characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a truncal rash, leading to hospitalization in 10% of patients. The typhus fever group of rickettsial agents includes R. typhi, R.prowazekii, and O. tsustugamushi. Murine typhus is caused by R. typhi and is also known as flea-borne typhus or endemic typhus. Transmission typically involves rodent vectors, but many patients never recall a specific exposure history.

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of murine typhus can result in a prolonged fever lasting weeks and may lead to end-organ damage or fatality if left untreated. Severe cases often present with early laboratory abnormalities, as observed in this patient. Murine typhus has been associated with secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, characterized by cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and splenomegaly, which were also present in this case. As with other rickettsial infections, doxycycline remains the mainstay of treatment.

Our patient presented with the symptomatic triad of headache, fever, and rash, a combination seen in only one-third of murine typhus cases, along with hallmark lab abnormalities. However, the ascending hand rash is an atypical presentation compared to the classically reported maculopapular rash on the trunk and extremities. The clinical presentation in this case shares features with other infectious diseases, such as the visual floaters and chorioretinitis seen in toxoplasmosis, and localized rash with lymphadenopathy characteristic of cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae. Additionally, the serologies may reflect potential cross-reactivity among different Rickettsial species titers.

The ophthalmologic manifestations of R. typhi seen in this case are rarely seen, but existing reports aided in reaching the diagnosis. Early fundoscopic examination and thorough skin examination can help refine the differential diagnosis while awaiting serologic results. Given the low risk associated with doxycycline, its administration is justified prior to confirmatory diagnosis of murine typhus, as early treatment can prevent serious complications, as evidenced by this case.

Diagnosis of murine typhus in this case may have been complicated and delayed by a positive viral test, concerns over potential acetaminophen-induced transaminitis, and recent travel history. While doxycycline effectively prevented end-organ damage, the patient experienced prolonged effects of R. typhi infection, including slowly resolving anemia and lymphadenopathy. This case represents a unique presentation of murine typhus, characterized by an identifiable mammal exposure, an atypical rash, systemic infection, and disseminated chorioretinitis.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^5ad2a2b9]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

7 OTHER ATYPICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Between 6% and 13.7% of patients with MPOX present with a confluent maculopapular rash on the trunk and proximal extremities concurrent with the primary MPOX lesions(Figure 5), but up to 17% of patients do not present with the typical pseudopustules, which complicates the diagnosis. About half of affected patients present with MPOX pharyngitis and some with associated Forchheimer spots. Pruritus may or may not be present. The rash usually appears 3 to 11 days after the onset of the disease, although cases have been reported in which it occurs simultaneously. A viral cause has been postulated, but drug or concurrent infections have been proposed in some patients. The failure to detect these contributing factors in many cases gives strength to the theory of MPOX as the causative agent. Histology of these lesions shows a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate, consistent with a maculopapular exanthem of viral or drug‐induced origin.

FIGURE 5

A patient with hemorrhagic purpuric lesions in the inguinal region, who also had multiple perianal vesiculopustules and significant inguinal lymphadenopathy, has been reported (Figure 6). The authors propose that this phenomenon could be indirectly caused by the virus after negative results for viral RNA in the biopsy. A case of reactive panniculitis secondary to MPOX with a lupus panniculitis–like histology has recently been reported in a patient with recent MPOX infection.

COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations — During the course of acute COVID-19 infection, many people develop cutaneous findings, and the data are imperfect but seem to show that rashes fall into 2 large groups: morbilliform and urticarial eruptions that resemble common non-specific viral exanthems, and eruptions associated with hypercoagulability that are areas of net-like erythema (livedo reticularis, presumably due to altered vascular perfusion) or pathologic hypercoagulability (retiform purpura). Non-specific acute morbilliform eruptions are widely reported as the most common skin finding in COVID-19. Children and young adults may develop a condition known as "COVID toes", characterized by sudden onset of painful, dusky red macules and patches, typically on the plantar aspect of the distal phalanges of one or more toes.

### Add in a virus: four cases of severe Kawasaki disease and concurrent adenovirus infection [^7ae824fe]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis. KD typically presents in children between the ages of six months and five years as an acute illness characterized by fever, conjunctivitis, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, peri-oral erythema, and extremity swelling. These features often follow a brief prodrome of respiratory or gastrointestinal illness and may not all be present at the same point in time.

Recent population-based time series analyses have demonstrated a correlation between seasonal viral infections and KD incidence. One third of children with KD have a concurrent acute infection, and approximately 41% of KD patients have a respiratory virus detected on nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

The differential diagnosis in a child with KD is broad, as KD shares common features with many childhood infectious conditions, such as streptococcal infections and viral exanthems (e.g. measles, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus), rheumatic disorders (e.g. systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and drug reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Distinguishing between acute infections and KD early in the illness course is often challenging, particularly when concurrent infection is present. Diagnostic confusion between KD and acute infections contributes to delays in instituting early immunomodulatory management, which may contribute to higher complication rates.

Differentiating Viral Eruptions

Viral morbilliform eruptions, which include eruptions secondary to measles; rubella; hand, foot, and mouth disease; exanthema subitum; scarlet fever; and infectious mononucleosis, are historically the most frequently observed diseases that should be differentiated from drug-induced morbilliform eruptions. While usually low-risk in nature, most viral eruptions tend to mimic the high-risk morbilliform morphologies. Many location and morphologic clues, such as oral involvement, are similar between high-risk eruptions and viral disease. The most important aspect is recognizing the overlap and, if clinical features of high-risk morbilliform eruptions are identified, then using laboratory and drug-history information to identify the etiology. Typically in this setting, if a patient is on a high-risk drug with recent onset, we do not evaluate further for viral eruptions. Conversely, if a patient is showing high-risk features without supportive drug history, then we consider the potential benefits of viral testing with the patient.

Chikungunya — clinical features and course in travelers are described as follows: The incubation period is typically 3–7 days (range 1–12 days), with sudden onset of high fever (temperature typically 39° C [102° F]) and joint pains; fevers typically last for 1 week and can be biphasic. Joint symptoms are typically severe, debilitating, and usually bilateral and symmetric, most commonly affecting hands and feet but possibly more proximal joints. Other findings include conjunctivitis, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and a morbilliform rash that often pruritic and involves trunk and extremities and can include palms, soles, and face. Abnormal laboratory findings can include elevated creatinine and liver function tests, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia; rare but serious complications include hepatitis, myocarditis, neurologic disease, ocular disease, acute renal disease, and severe bullous skin lesions. Acute symptoms typically resolve in 7–10 days, but some patients have continuation or relapse of rheumatologic symptoms for months after acute illness, and studies report variable proportions, ranging from 5% to 80%, with persistent joint pains and prolonged fatigue for months or years. Deaths occur but are rare and are reported most commonly in older adults with comorbidities and young infants infected perinatally or by mosquito bites. In pregnancy, symptoms and outcomes are similar to others and most infections during pregnancy will not result in transmission to the fetus; however, intrapartum transmission can result in neonatal complications including hemorrhagic symptoms, myocardial disease, and neurologic disease, and rare spontaneous abortions after first-trimester maternal infection have been reported.

Introduction

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a common virus that primarily affects young children. It typically causes roseola infantum, which is characterized by a high fever followed by a transient maculopapular rash. Rarely, HHV-6 infection can lead to atypical dermatologic manifestations. Here, we present the case of a two-year-old girl who developed a dyshidrosiform rash on her hands after experiencing an acute HHV-6 infection.

Talaromycosis in people with advanced HIV disease — clinical manifestations are characterized by disseminated infection involving multiple organ systems as the most common manifestation, beginning as a subacute illness with nonspecific features that are indistinguishable from other infections. Skin lesions are the most specific late manifestation, present in 40% to 80% of patients, and are typically central-umbilicated papules that appear first on the face and then spread to the trunk and extremities. Pulmonary symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath occur in approximately 40% of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea or abdominal pain occur in 30% of patients, and hepatosplenomegaly is common, presenting in up to 60% of patients with intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy causing abdominal distention and pain. A rare complication occurring in about 4% of patients is meningoencephalitis, with a rapid disease course and a high mortality of up to 80%. Coinfection with oropharyngeal candidiasis occurs in up to 50% of patients and with tuberculosis in 22% of patients. Laboratory findings include anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration, anemia can be profound and may require multiple red cell transfusions, and elevation of aminotransferases is common with a serum aspartate aminotransferase over alanine aminotransferase ratio of approximately 2. Chest radiographical abnormalities are broad and nonspecific, ranging from diffuse interstitial disease to reticulonodular infiltrates to alveolar infiltrates.

Post-travel fever evaluation — clinical reassessment and skin findings can guide diagnosis. If the initial examination is unrevealing, the text advises to repeat the exam at least daily if the diagnosis is not clear because new findings might appear that will help in the diagnostic process, and notes that although most febrile illnesses are infectious, other conditions including pulmonary emboli and drug hypersensitivity reactions also can be associated with fever. Fever as part of a clinical syndrome deserves further scrutiny because it could indicate a disease of public health concern; yet undifferentiated presentations are common in malaria, typhoid fever, or dengue, and this distinction provides only a rough guide because malaria may present with focal symptoms, so misdiagnosing a patient with gastroenteritis who actually has malaria could negatively impact outcome. Dermatologic presentations are frequent in returned travelers; skin rashes can evolve rapidly and lesion types and locations can aid diagnosis of systemic infections (e.g., arboviral infections, measles, spotted fever group rickettsioses, typhoid fever, acute schistosomiasis, or acute HIV infection), and petechial or purpuric lesions may indicate meningococcal disease.

Introduction: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology that primarily affects children under five years of age. Exanthema is reported in 50%–90% of cases, typically within the first five days of illness, presenting as a diffuse, nonspecific erythematous maculopapular rash, often described as morbilliform, scarlatiniform, or urticarial. Less commonly, pustular or erythema multiforme-like eruptions have been described, usually during the convalescent phase. The occurrence of psoriasiform dermatitis during the active phase of KD is exceptional and may pose diagnostic challenges.

Objectives: To describe a rare case of psoriasiform dermatitis during the active phase of KD, and to highlight the importance of differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary management in the setting of persistent systemic inflammation.

Methods: We present the case of a 3-month-old male infant who developed a classical form of KD, including persistent fever, maculopapular rash, cheilitis, conjunctival injection, swelling of the hands and feet, and elevated inflammatory markers. Initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids led to temporary resolution of symptoms.

Results: On day 8 of illness, fever recurred, and by day 10 a new cutaneous eruption emerged, prompting a second IVIG infusion and escalation to anakinra due to persistent inflammation. The new rash consisted of crusted erythematous papules predominantly on the limbs, with perioral and perineal involvement. Additional features included erosive cheilitis and crusted blepharitis. These findings were atypical for classical KD and raised suspicion of viral or bacterial co-infection, alternative vasculitis, or a drug-related eruption. Herpes simplex virus co-infection was clinically suspected, leading to empirical initiation of intravenous acyclovir and temporary discontinuation of anakinra. Concurrently, coronary artery aneurysms developed, indicating ongoing systemic inflammation. Virologic testing (PCR on blood and skin) was negative. A skin biopsy revealed a psoriasiform dermatitis without cytopathic changes, ruling out viral etiology. After multidisciplinary review, the eruption was interpreted as KD-related psoriasiform dermatitis. Anakinra and corticosteroids were then reintroduced, with progressive improvement in systemic, cardiac, and cutaneous manifestations.

Presence of the Herald Patch in PR Variants

The presence of a herald patch is a key feature of classic PR, but it may be absent in atypical variants of the condition. In inverted PR, where the lesions predominantly involve the flexural areas, a herald patch may be less easily identified or entirely absent. Similarly, in localized PR, the exanthem may be confined to one area, and a distinguishable herald patch may not be present. Persistent PR and relapsing PR also tend to have more varied presentations, with a herald patch being less commonly reported.

In pediatric PR and PR associated with COVID-19, the presence of a herald patch is variable. Studies have suggested that in COVID-19-related PR-like eruptions, the exanthem may present without a classic herald patch, mimicking the morphology of viral exanthems. Identifying the herald patch can be crucial for diagnosis, but its absence should not rule out PR, particularly in atypical or variant forms, where the clinical course and morphology of lesions may differ.

Acute and recent HIV infection — clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis: Health care providers should consider the possibility of acute HIV infection in symptomatic people and in asymptomatic people with a possible acute (within 2–6 weeks) exposure to HIV. Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings may include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, pharyngitis, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with someone who has HIV or is at risk of HIV infection, sharing needles, syringes, or equipment for drug preparation or injection, or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with bodily fluids that may carry HIV. The differential diagnosis may include COVID-19, EBV and non-EBV (e.g. CMV) infectious mononucleosis syndromes, influenza, viral hepatitis, streptococcal infection, or syphilis, and diagnosis of any STI should prompt HIV testing and consideration of acute HIV infection.

Atypical Variants of PR

Atypical variants of pityriasis rosea account for approximately 20% of all cases. These variants can differ significantly from the classical presentation — owing to morphology, size, distribution, course, or symptoms — making diagnosis more challenging. Current research suggests that children are more predisposed to atypical variants of PR in comparison with adults, with atopy playing a possible role.

Atypical pityriasis rosea (PR) can present in diverse forms, deviating from the classic herald patch followed by smaller lesions. It may include vesicular, purpuric, urticarial, or papulovesicular lesions and, rarely, erythema multiforme-like or targetoid lesions. The size of these lesions varies, with some significantly smaller or larger than the typical 2–10 cm diameter. Unlike the usual "Christmas tree" pattern, atypical lesions may appear in unusual locations such as the face, palms, soles, or mucous membranes, which are generally spared in classic cases. The rash duration can also differ, sometimes lasting longer than the typical 6–8 weeks or resolving more quickly. While classic PR is often asymptomatic or mildly itchy, atypical forms may present with more severe symptoms, including significant pruritus, especially upon contact with sweat, leading to excoriations, pain, or systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.

Talaromycosis in people with HIV — diagnosis should be considered in all people with HIV with a CD4 count of < 100 cells/mm3 who have traveled to or have lived in talaromycosis-endemic areas and present with a systemic infection involving the reticuloendothelial system. Skin lesions develop on the face, trunk, and extremities with a central-necrotic appearance, but they are a late manifestation and are absent in up to 60% of patients. Diagnostic methods are still primarily based on conventional microscopy, histology, and culture, and culture results usually return within 4 to 5 days. Diagnostic delay, particularly in patients presenting without fever or skin lesions, is associated with increased mortality. The development of antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based assays has offered rapid, sensitive, and specific non-culture-based diagnostics. Microscopy allows a presumptive diagnosis based on microscopic examination of Giemsa-, Wright's-, or Grocott-Gomori Methenamine Silver–stained samples of skin.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^12cfbad1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common, self-limiting dermatological condition characterized by distinctive skin lesions, including a herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions that often form a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains largely uncertain, with hypotheses suggesting both infectious and noninfectious origins. Notably, human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated in its pathogenesis, with evidence pointing to viral reactivation as a potential trigger for the condition.

Epidemiologically, PR predominantly affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence reported in females compared with males. The condition is observed worldwide, with varying incidence rates of around 0.5–2% or greater. In the USA, a study utilizing the All of Us database found that PR affects approximately 0.13% of the population, with a higher prevalence in females and individuals aged 10–29 years. This aligns with global patterns, where PR is more common in younger populations. Seasonal variations have also been noted, with some studies suggesting a higher incidence during the fall and winter months. In Eastern Anatolia, Turkey, a study analyzing 391 patients with PR from 1992 to 1995 reported an average annual incidence of 0.75 per 100 dermatologic patients, with a slightly higher prevalence in females and a peak incidence in the 20–29 year age group. The incidence was notably higher during the rainy and snowy months. In Kaduna, Nigeria, PR was found in approximately 2.4% of dermatology clinic attendees, with a significant number of cases occurring during the rainy season.

While PR is generally considered benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort owing to pruritus, which affects the majority of patients. The condition typically resolves spontaneously within 6–8 weeks, though atypical presentations and recurrences can occur, complicating diagnosis and management. Understanding the epidemiological patterns and clinical manifestations of PR is crucial for effective diagnosis and patient reassurance, as well as for guiding future research on its underlying causes and potential treatments.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated rash in pediatric HIV infection presents across multiple antiretroviral (ARV) agents; Any ARV drug can cause rash, with onset in the first few days to weeks after starting new ARV drug(s), and most rashes are mild-to-moderate diffuse maculopapular eruptions. Estimated frequency categories are provided as follows: Common (> 10%) EFV, ETR, FTC, NVP; Less Common (5% to 10%) ABC, ATV, DRV, TDF; Uncommon (2% to 4%) BIC, LPV/r, MVC, RAL, RPV. Risk factors include that sulfonamide allergy is a risk factor for rash in patients who are taking PIs that contain a sulfonamide moiety (i.e. DRV), and polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and multiple HLA loci are associated with an increased risk of rash in patients who are taking NVP. When Starting NVP or Restarting NVP After Interruptions of > 14 Days, Utilize once-daily lead-in dosing.a This may not be necessary in children aged < 2 years.b Avoid the use of systemic corticosteroids during NVP dose escalation, and assess the patient for rash severity, mucosal involvement, and other signs of systemic reaction. For Mid-to-Moderate Maculopapular Rash Without Systemic or Mucosal Involvement, most rashes will resolve without intervention; ARV drugs can be continued while monitoring.a Antihistamines may provide some relief. For Severe Rash and/or Rash Accompanied by Systemic Symptoms, manage as SJS/TEN/EM major, DRESS, or HSR, as applicable. In Rash in Patients Receiving NVP, given the elevated risk of HSR, measure hepatic transaminases, and if hepatic transaminases are elevated, NVP should be discontinued and not restarted.

Recurrent PR episodes often resemble the initial rash in appearance and distribution. However, they can differ in duration, severity, and pattern of distribution to be more localized or involve different anatomic areas. For some patients, recurrent episodes are shorter, while others may experience longer durations compared with the initial episode. The interval between episodes can vary significantly, ranging from a few months to several years. Some studies suggest that recurrent episodes tend to be milder, with less body surface involvement and fewer systemic symptoms. However, this is not always the case, as some patients report equally or even more severe symptoms during recurrences.

Before diagnosing recurrent PR, it is crucial to rule out other conditions that may mimic the rash, particularly if the presentation differs from the typical PR pattern. Conditions such as tinea corporis, secondary syphilis, and drug-induced rashes should be initially excluded. A thorough history, including details about recent drug use, sexual history, and infections, is essential in the diagnostic workup. Serological testing for syphilis and other infections should be performed, especially if the patient is at high risk or the rash appears atypical. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, a skin biopsy may be useful. However, because PR is rarely biopsied, many cases labeled as recurrences may not be true PR recurrences. This diagnostic uncertainty is further complicated by the self-limiting nature of PR, which often resolves without intervention, making it less likely for clinicians to pursue biopsy in recurrent or atypical cases. Thus, caution should be exercised when diagnosing recurrences without biopsy confirmation. Histopathological examination can help distinguish PR from other mimicking conditions. If a drug-induced cause is suspected, discontinuing the offending medication and considering alternative treatments is recommended.

### Teledermatology viewpoint: sudden onset of a widespread rash [^fabe6988]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

An otherwise well child was sent to the school nurse after suddenly developing a net-like, pruritic rash on the arms and thighs associated with a bright red confluent rash on the cheeks. After calling the parents, a teledermatology consultation was sought for this dramatic rash to determine if it was infectious. The teledermatology reader report stated that the history of present illness included a 7-year-old child presented to the school nurse with sudden lace-like erythema on the bilateral arms and profoundly erythematous cheeks that suggested the patient was slapped. Prodrome: none. Prior treatment: none. Primary symptom: pruritus. Two images were provided with this teledermatology consultation. They demonstrated a lace-like erythematous rash along the lateral and dorsal aspects of the child's arms, which extended onto the dorsum of the hands (Fig 1). A brightly erythematous confluent rash was noted on the cheeks (Fig 2). Based on the report, the consulted dermatologist determined that this viral exanthem is benign and self-limiting. Images showed that findings are pathognomonic for EI ("Fifth disease"). Reassurance and symptomatic treatment with over-the-counter pramoxine-containing moisturizing lotion, mild potency topical corticosteroid (hydrocortisone 2.5% cream), and an oral antihistamine (hydroxyzine 25 mg by mouth every night at bedtime) was recommended as needed for pruritus. Although this exanthem is not infectious at the time of the eruption, the child was sent home so that she could be aggressively treated for her pruritus with frequent topical applications of the prescribed medications.

Case presentation

A man in his early 50s with no significant medical history presented with a 3 day history of shortness of breath, cough and diffuse petechial rash affecting the face, trunk and bilateral lower extremities. Three days after completing a 10–14 day course of TMP-SMX for a urinary tract infection, he developed chills, sweats and myalgias with an associated metallic taste. He denied taking any medications for these symptoms, including NSAIDs. Three days prior to admission and 5 days after completing the course of TMP-SMX, he developed a non-pruritic rash over the trunk and bilateral lower extremities. The next day, he developed a cough and shortness of breath. The shortness of breath progressively worsened, which prompted his visit to the emergency department. He denied any allergies to medications and any previous adverse drug reactions. He denied a sulfa allergy, prior allergic reactions, adverse reactions to medications or drugs and a family history of similar reactions.

On presentation, the patient was afebrile and had an oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of 87% on room air. He was immediately started on 4 L nasal cannula. On physical examination, a diffuse macular erythematous rash was noted on the face and trunk, and a petechial rash was noted on the bilateral lower extremities. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Pulmonary examination was notable for left basilar rales with no increased work of breathing or use of accessory respiratory muscles. Over the course of the hospitalisation, the petechial rash spread to the patient's bilateral upper extremities.

NVP chronic dosing — cutaneous toxicity and dosing precautions are as follows: More common adverse effects include skin rash with severe cases (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and elevated hepatic transaminases; in children, "the incidence rate was estimated between 1.4% and 7.1%." NVP should be discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop severe rash, rash with constitutional symptoms, or rash with elevated levels of hepatic transaminases. NVP-associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy, and if rash occurs during the initial 14-day lead-in period, do not increase the dose until rash resolves; the risk of developing NVP resistance with extended lead-in dosing is unknown and must be weighed against antiviral response and tolerability.

### Unusual acral bullous dyshidrosiform rash associated with acute human herpes virus-6 infection in a 2-year-old girl [^8156ed31]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HHV-6 is known to cause roseola infantum, a common childhood illness characterized by a high fever followed by a rash. However, the development of a dyshidrosiform rash is atypical. Acute HHV-6 or HHV-7 infections can present with atypical manifestations, including acral involvement, as documented in existing literature in adults. The pathogenesis of this palmoplantar vesiculobullous eruption is unclear; however, some observations support a virus-mediated mechanism. Transcriptomic profiling of vesicular hand eczema shows marked upregulation of innate host-defense genes and downregulation of epidermal differentiation markers. This suggests that exaggerated innate immunity can promote intraepidermal vesiculation. In this context, HHV-6 infection may act as a trigger by directly infecting epithelial and immune cells or by promoting local immune dysregulation. HHV-6 exhibits broad cellular tropism, including keratinocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, which supports its potential for direct cutaneous involvement. Additionally, the virus modulates host immunity by inducing proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-α) and expressing proteins (eg, U21 and U24) that interfere with antigen presentation and T cell signaling. These combined effects, direct epithelial involvement and immune-mediated inflammation, may lead to vesiculation, even in immunocompetent children. The relative immaturity of the epidermal barrier in early childhood may further amplify these mechanisms, predisposing individuals to bullous changes.

Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions may mimic PR and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:
Secondary syphilis: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution, and lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.
Tinea corporis: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.
Erythema multiforme: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.
Guttate psoriasis: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis, scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules that may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, one or more of them showing a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.
Pityriasis alba: Hypopigmented, scaly patches usually seen in children with a history of eczema. The absence of a herald patch and the chronic nature of the condition help differentiate it from PR.
Lichen planus: Pruritic, purple, polygonal papules often involving the wrists, lumbar spinal region, glans penis, and oral mucosa. The chronicity and distribution help differentiate it from PR.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Erythematous, annular, or polycyclic lesions that may mimic PR but often have photosensitivity and systemic symptoms, and histology shows epidermal atrophy and basal layer degeneration.
Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped, scaly patches that may resemble PR. The chronic, relapsing nature, intense pruritus, and shin and dorsal hand localizations, rarely found in PR, are key differentiators.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Early stages may resemble PR, as the initial patch does not respond to topical steroids mimicking PR. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically has a chronic course and does not respond to standard PR treatments. Multiple serial biopsies are essential for diagnosis.
Kaposi sarcoma: Can present with red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules. Unlike PR, Kaposi sarcoma is associated with immunosuppression and has a more progressive course.

An atypical herald patch may be absent in up to 20% of cases or may appear at unusual sites such as the face, scalp, or genitalia. Inverse PR primarily affects acral and flexural areas, including the axilla, groin, and face. Acral PR features lesions on the palms and soles, necessitating differentiation from conditions like erythema multiforme, syphilis, necrolytic acral erythema, and drug eruptions. Unilateral PR is an extremely rare form in which lesions appear only on one side of the body, observed in both children and adults. Blaschkoid PR follows the lines of Blaschko, which are thought to trace the path of embryonic ectodermal cell migration running along but not crossing the anterior truncal midline. Limb-girdle PR, also known as PR of Vidal, is confined to the shoulders or pelvic girdle, typically affecting the axilla and groins with larger, more annular lesions. Mucosal involvement in PR occurs in about 16% of patients, affecting the oral mucosa with punctate, erosive, bullous, or hemorrhagic lesions, often without symptoms. Localized PR presents with eruptions confined to a specific area of the body.

In individuals with darker skin tones, PR may present differently, more frequently involving the face and manifesting with papular lesions. Additionally, oral ulcers have been reported to occur more often in skin of color patients. These cases tend to be more pruritic, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common outcome.

Despite these variations, typical clinical features, such as a preceding prodrome, a primary lesion followed by secondary lesions, and coexistent classical lesions, are still beneficial in diagnosing most PR cases. Figure 2 shows atypical lesions of pityriasis rosea on the hand, an uncommon site for this condition as the rash typically spares the distal extremities.

Conclusions

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common dermatological condition with a distinct clinical presentation, yet its etiology remains elusive. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise etiological factors, particularly the role of viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. Additionally, exploring the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities, including antivirals and phototherapy, could enhance management strategies for PR, especially in atypical or recurrent cases. Understanding these aspects will be crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies.

Diagnosis of mpox — A high index of suspicion is warranted for mpox. Clinical presentation with symptoms such as a characteristic rash is strongly suggestive of mpox; however, diagnosis of mpox based solely on clinical presentation can be challenging because illness can be atypical with isolated proctitis or rectal bleeding or a small number of lesions, lesions can mimic herpes zoster, herpes simplex, syphilis, and molluscum contagiosum, and due to the high frequency of coinfection with STIs during the multinational 2022 clade II mpox outbreak, a broad differential diagnosis is encouraged.

Differential Diagnosis of Atypical Pityriasis Rosea

In cases of atypical PR, particularly when systemic symptoms are present or when the herald patch is absent and the exanthem is widespread, it is essential to consider other infectious exanthems in the differential diagnosis. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Parvovirus B19 are two potential infectious agents that can present with exanthems similar to PR.

EBV, a herpesvirus, can cause a variety of dermatological manifestations, including morbilliform, papulovesicular, and petechial eruptions during systemic infection. In some cases, EBV can lead to a florid morbilliform eruption or other atypical exanthems, which may resemble PR. EBV-associated exanthems may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fatigue, which can overlap with the prodromal symptoms of PR. A thorough clinical history, including serological testing for EBV (e.g. positive viral capsid antigen IgM in acute infection), can help differentiate EBV-related exanthems from PR in patients presenting with systemic signs.

Similarly, Parvovirus B19 should be considered in patients with an atypical PR-like presentation and systemic involvement. Parvovirus B19 is known to cause erythema infectiosum, which can mimic PR with its characteristic facial rash ('slapped cheek' appearance) and systemic symptoms, such as fever and arthralgia. In some cases, Parvovirus B19 infection can present with a widespread, nonspecific exanthem that can be confused with PR.

Given the overlapping clinical features between PR and these viral exanthems, particularly in the setting of systemic symptoms, serological testing for EBV and Parvovirus B19 may be considered to exclude these infectious causes. This is particularly important in cases where the herald patch is absent or the rash is more generalized and atypical in distribution.

Abstract

Lichenoid and granulomatous dermatitis is an uncommon cutaneous reaction pattern, which combines features of lichenoid and granulomatous inflammatory patterns. It can represent an idiopathic lichenoid eruption or be associated with a variety of disorders including drug reactions, hepatobiliary disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, infections, tattoo reactions, pigmented purpuric dermatosis, lichenoid contact dermatitis, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Clinical manifestations include pruritic, pink to violaceous, macules, papules, plaques, or nodules, with or without scaling, usually distributed on the trunk and extremities. In this article, we present a case of a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus who developed a pruritic rash within the exact distribution of a preceding varicella zoster infection. Histopathology showed a dense lymphocytic lichenoid interface dermatitis with superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic and granulomatous inflammation, consistent with the diagnosis of lichenoid and granulomatous dermatitis. The patient was started on a topical steroid and at 3-month follow up, demonstrated significant improvement of the skin lesions.

Etravirine (ETR) major toxicities — more common effects are "Nausea, diarrhea, and mild rash." Rash occurs most commonly during the first "6 weeks" of therapy and generally resolves after "1 to 2 weeks" on continued therapy; people with a history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use "should not receive ETR." Less common (more severe) events include "Peripheral neuropathy, severe rash, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and erythema multiforme," and clinicians should "Discontinue ETR immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or HSRs develop," "monitor a person's clinical status, including levels of liver transaminases," and note that "Continuing to use ETR after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction"; people with a history of severe rash while using NVP or EFV "should not receive ETR."

Scarlet Fever Scarlet fever is diagnosed in 10% of children presenting with streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. 8 It is caused by certain strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci that release a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. Patients who have a hypersensitivity to the toxin may develop the characteristic rash associated with scarlet fever. Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. In skinfolds, such as the axilla, antecubital fossa, and buttock creases, an erythematous, nonblanching linear eruption may develop.

Petechiae on the palate may occur, as well as erythematous, swollen papillae with a white coating on the tongue. Red strawberry tongue occurs after desquamation of the white coating. After several weeks, the rash fades and is followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the face, in skin-folds, and on the hands and feet, potentially lasting four to six weeks. 9 With a sensitivity of 90% to 95%, throat culture is the first-choice method for diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection, but this is not always practical. 8 Rapid antigen tests are routinely used in clinicians' offices and have a sensitivity of approximately 86%. 10 Cultures may be ordered when the suspicion for group A streptococcal infection is high, but the rapid antigen test result is negative. 11 Penicillin is the therapy of choice for streptococcal infection.

Those allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins may be treated with oral macrolides or clindamycin.
10. 12 Although Streptococcus pyogenes was once the most common cause of nonbullous impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus has surpassed it in more recent years. However, S. pyogenes may still be the predominant cause in warm and humid climates. S. aureus is the main source of bullous impetigo. Initially, children may develop vesicles or pustules that form a thick, yellow crust. With autoinoculation, the lesions may quickly spread. The face and extremities are most commonly affected. Although impetigo is usually a self-limited disease, antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
12. Erythema Infectiosum Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19.

It is a common childhood infection characterized by a prodrome of low-grade fever, malaise, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed several days later by an erythematous "slapped cheek" facial rash. After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities. After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress. Arthralgias occur in approximately 8% of young children with the disease but are much more common in teens and young adults. Patients are no longer considered infectious once the rash appears. Treatment is symptomatic and includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for arthralgias and antihistamines for pruritus.
13. Molluscum Contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a poxvirus.

Varicella-zoster virus disease (VZV) post-exposure prophylaxis in children with HIV — first choice is VariZIG 125 IU/10 kg body weight (maximum 625 IU) IM, administered ideally within 96 hours (potentially beneficial up to 10 days) after exposure. If VariZIG is not available, IVIG 400 mg/kg body weight, administered once should be considered, and IVIG should ideally be administered within 96 hours of exposure. When passive immunization is not possible, some experts recommend prophylaxis with acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose (maximum dose acyclovir 800 mg) by mouth, administered four times a day for 7 days, beginning 7–10 days after exposure. Primary post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated for patients with substantial exposure to varicella or zoster who have no verified history of varicella or zoster, or who are seronegative for VZV on a sensitive specific antibody assay, or who lack evidence of vaccination. Many experts limit the recommendation for passive immunization to varicella- or zoster-exposed children with HIV considered severely immunocompromised (i.e., in CDC Immunologic Category 3), especially if severely symptomatic (i.e. CDC Clinical Category C) and experiencing a high HIV RNA plasma viral load. Some experts start acyclovir at first appearance of rash in children with HIV, rather than providing acyclovir as prophylaxis, and VariZIG is commercially available in the United States from a broad network of specialty distributers.

Moreover, oropharyngeal lesions can occur in up to 28% of patients with pityriasis rosea (PR). These lesions are painless and are typically associated with the exanthem of PR. The most frequently observed patterns include petechial and macular and papular lesions. While petechial enanthema has been predominantly associated with persistent PR and pediatric PR, macular and papular lesions are seen across various forms of the disease, including relapsing PR and classic PR. Thus, it is important to examine the oropharyngeal mucosa in patients with PR, as the presence of these lesions can help distinguish PR from other mucosal diseases and may indicate a more atypical course of the disease (e.g. persistent or relapsing forms).

Some patients may experience mild prodromal symptoms before the appearance of the herald patch, including a sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbances, fever, and arthralgia. Although the rash may be asymptomatic, some individuals may experience mild to moderate itching, which can worsen with heat or sweating. Severe itching occurs in about 25% of cases. Occasionally, patients may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, or slight enlargement of lymph nodes. The rash of pityriasis rosea typically resolves within 6 to 8 weeks in more than 80% of patients, though it may persist longer in some cases. It usually resolves spontaneously without leaving scars, and the herald patch may last longer than the secondary lesions. Figure 1 shows the classic presentation of pityriasis rosea on the chest, with oval erythematous patches distributed along skin tension lines in a 'Christmas tree' pattern.

Recurrent Pityriasis Rosea

Although PR is a common disorder among children and young adults, recurrent PR is rare, found in only 1–3% of known cases. Multiple recurrences (three or more episodes) are extremely uncommon, and only a few patients have been identified.

Several factors are thought to trigger recurrent PR, including viral reactivation, drug-induced episodes, and immune system alterations. Reactivation of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7, which are also linked to the initial PR episode, has been identified as a possible cause of recurrence. These viruses may remain dormant and be reactivated by stress or immunosuppression. Certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and some antibiotics, have also been implicated. These drug-induced cases often mimic idiopathic PR, complicating diagnosis. Additionally, immune system dysfunction, either due to underlying health conditions or external factors such as infections, might contribute to PR recurrence, though this area requires further study.

Treatments

PR is a self-limiting disease with a low risk of transmission and typically resolves on its own within weeks to a few months; for most patients, monitored waiting and symptomatic treatment are sufficient. General measures such as moisturizing, using emollients, and applying topical steroids can help alleviate itching or discomfort, while oral antihistamines may also provide relief. However, using stronger therapies is generally discouraged due to the unclear underlying etiopathology and the challenges in evaluating the specific effects of these treatments. Given that the disease usually resolves spontaneously, clinicians should carefully compare the benefits of potentially faster resolution with the risk of side effects or drug resistance if considering more potent therapeutics.

Steroids

Both topical and systemic steroids are occasionally used to treat PR, but evidence for their effectiveness is limited. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study found that tapering daily low-dose of prednisolone 20 mg to 10 mg for 15 days helped with rash clearance at 2 weeks but showed a higher relapse rate at 12 weeks, indicating a potential viral reactivation after initial suppression. A study by Leonforte found that corticosteroid treatment worsened PR symptoms, including itching, irritation, and new lesion formation, especially when started in the early stages. Given PR's viral nature, oral steroids may not be ideal, and topical steroids should be limited to severely pruritic cases to prevent skin atrophy associated with prolonged use.

Antihistamines

Antihistamines are also often administered topically and orally to patients to mitigate irritation and trouble sleeping. A recent report suggests that systemic antihistamines, combined with a moisturizing cream, accelerated the healing of lesions in COVID-19-related PR, indicating their potential role in reducing SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation. There has also been some evidence of the oral antihistamine dexchlorpheniramine in improving PR rash clearance.

Antivirals

Evidence supports the effectiveness of antivirals, particularly acyclovir, in treating PR, likely due to the involvement of HHV-7 and HHV-6. A systematic review of three randomized controlled trials found acyclovir significantly improved rash outcomes (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.33–4.53), and a meta-analysis of seven studies showed it effectively cleared lesions by week 1 (RR 5.72, CI 2.36–13.88). Acyclovir improved rash and pruritus in both high (800 mg daily) and low (400 mg daily) doses. Its therapeutic effect is limited to HHV-6, as HHV-7 lacks the thymidine kinase gene that acyclovir targets, while other antivirals like cidofovir and foscarnet have more severe side effects and have not been studied in PR.

Some studies have demonstrated that high-dose acyclovir (800 mg five times daily for 7 days) is effective for the resolution of PR lesions, particularly when administered early, with notable reductions in erythema and pruritus. However, other randomized clinical trials have reported no significant difference between acyclovir and placebo in the duration of disease resolution, suggesting that acyclovir may not be universally effective. A meta-analysis by Chang et al. supported the efficacy of acyclovir in reducing erythema and lesion formation but highlighted that its benefits are primarily seen in high-dose regimens during the early course of PR. Therefore, while acyclovir may be beneficial in certain cases, it is not recommended for all patients and should be considered primarily for those with severe pruritus, extensive rash, or early disease onset. For most patients with mild to moderate PR, supportive care with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines remains the preferred approach.

Differentiating R. felis infections from viral encephalitis can be challenging due to overlapping clinical presentations, imaging findings, and CSF analyses, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Rickettsial infections often go undiagnosed, particularly in patients who do not exhibit classic skin rashes or insect bites. Research has demonstrated the presence of R. felis DNA in the CSF of two fatal meningoencephalitis cases from preserved samples of CSF and serum derived from 64 hospitalized individuals with central nervous system infections in Indonesia.

In this case, symptoms primarily included orbital and temporal headaches without noticeable rash or eschar. Cranial MRI revealed abnormal signals in the basal ganglia and frontal-parietal lobes bilaterally, accompanied by thickening and enhancement of the meninges. Analysis of the CSF indicated a substantially elevated white blood cell count, predominantly composed of mononuclear cells, along with significantly increased protein levels. However, following the initiation of antiviral therapy, the child's condition deteriorated rapidly, marked by severe photophobia and lethargy. Consequently, in cases that do not respond to standard treatment and continue to worsen, clinicians should be vigilant in identifying the underlying pathogen promptly.

### Clinicopathological challenges of diagnosing reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption [^d3066bc2]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME) is a severe mucocutaneous adverse reaction that commonly follows a bacterial or viral respiratory tract infection, while Mycoplasma pneumoniae is frequently implicated, other organisms including Chlamydia pneumoniae, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, norovirus and COVID-19 have also been implicated.

Although rare cases of RIME have been reported in adults, it remains primarily a paediatric disease.RIME commonly occurs in pre-adolescent males, with studies demonstrating a male to female ratio of 2:1. It spikes during the winter, matching community outbreaks of respiratory infections. This seasonal pattern has recently been demonstrated in the USA where M. pneumoniae epidemics have led to an increase in RIME cases.

RIME causes painful mucositis that typically involves the mouth and eyes. Often, this occurs together with cutaneous lesions on the torso and limbs. Occasionally, the urogenital mucosa may also be involved. Oral haemorrhagic crusting lesions of the lips and erosions of the buccal mucosa and tongue (figure 1) are almost universal. By comparison, the cutaneous involvement is often sparse or absent; however, two patients in this case series exhibited it. The classic cutaneous morphology of scattered vesiculobullous lesions occurs in 80% of cases.

Figure 1
Oral reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption characterised by widespread labial haemorrhagic crusting and erosions involving the bilateral oral commissures. There is also concomitant lip oedema. The patient also had tongue and buccal mucosa erosions, which are not pictured.

RIME can also be associated with severe systemic complications, including epiglottitis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumomediastinum, pericardial effusion, hepatitis, restrictive lung disease and chronic obliterative bronchitis. Similarly, ocular complications including sub-corneal pustulosis, conjunctival shrinkage, corneal ulceration, blindness, synechiae, dry eyes and loss of eyelashes can occur.

Limitations

While this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and differential diagnoses of pityriasis rosea (PR), it is subject to some limitations. The review relies on the available literature, and variations in study quality, sample sizes, and geographic differences may limit the generalizability of the conclusions. Additionally, publication bias may have led to an overrepresentation of unusual or positive findings. We also did not perform a systematic meta-analysis, which limits the ability to quantitatively synthesize the data. As PR research evolves, more rigorous studies and controlled trials are needed to further refine our understanding.

### Fever and skin rash… [^836908d1]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

A 23-month-old child presented with fever and lethargy. Two days earlier, her parents noticed she was warm on waking, and her temperature was recorded as 101. 6°F. She was given acetaminophen and ibuprofen and slept more than usual that day. Her evening temperature was 103. 7°F. The patient had been exposed to a child with streptococcal throat infection at day care earlier in the week. At the time of presentation the patient was drinking well but pickier than usual with food. She had no significant medical history and was current on immunizations, including those for COVID-19. She was irritable, but there were no abnormal findings on physical examination. Laboratory testing was negative for COVID-19, influenza, and group A streptococci. Over the next few days, her activity level returned to normal; however, low-grade fevers between 100. 4°F and
101. 3°F persisted.

Question Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis. A. Fifth disease. B. Measles. C. Roseolainfantum. D. Rubella. E. Scarlet fever. Discussion The answer is C: roseola infantum. This viral exanthem of childhood is characterized by three days of high fever that can exceed 104°F, which may lead to febrile seizures. The fever or seizures are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department but rarely necessitate admission. After several days, the fever abruptly subsides, and the characteristic rash appears. The rash is classically erythematous, blanching, and macular. It starts on the trunk or neck and spreads to the extremities and face. It is asymptomatic and not associated with pruritus, pain, bleeding, or ulceration. The rash resolves spontaneously 10 to 14 days after the initial fever.

1 Roseola infantum is most prevalent in children seven to 13 months of age, and most cases occur in children younger than two years. Overall, the most common cause of roseola is human herpes-virus 6B. Less common causes include human herpesvirus 7, enterovirus, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Roseola infantum has a seasonal distribution, occurring most often in late summer to early fall. It affects males and females equally. The most common mode of transmission is shedding of the virus from asymptomatic carriers, such as older siblings or parents. Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is caused by human parvovirus B19. The illness begins with fever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea followed by a rash two to five days later. The classic slapped cheek rash is erythematous with circumoral pallor, with a lacelike rash developing on the trunk and extremities several days later.

The rash may recur after stimuli such as change in temperature, sunlight exposure, stress, or exercise. 2 Measles begins with fever, malaise, and anorexia followed by conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough. Characteristic Koplik spots appear 48 hours before the exanthem. Two to four days after the onset of fever, an erythematous maculopapular rash begins on the face and spreads caudally to the neck, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are initially blanchable. The rash can include petechiae, and the palms and soles are rarely affected. Two or three days after the rash appears, lymphadenopathy, high fever, respiratory symptoms, and conjunctivitis may occur. After three or four days, the rash darkens to a brown color, begins to fade, then desquamates in more involved areas. The rash typically lasts six or seven days before fading. 3, 4 Rubella is a viral illness that is usually self-limited in children.

Pityriasis Rosea in Pregnancy

Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy, although rare, has been associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly when it occurs in the first trimester. Earlier studies, such as those by Drago et al. reported a higher risk of miscarriage (up to 57–62%) in women who developed PR before the 15th week of gestation, particularly when the rash was extensive or accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and malaise. However, recent findings offer a more nuanced perspective. Wenger-Oehn et al. conducted a case series involving 46 pregnant women with PR and found a significantly lower rate of unfavorable outcomes (10.9%) compared with a pooled cohort of previous reports (39.6%). Their study highlighted that the timing of PR onset, rash distribution, and the presence of extracutaneous symptoms were key factors influencing pregnancy outcomes, with earlier onset and widespread rash being associated with higher risks.

Despite these concerns, the majority of pregnancies affected by PR result in healthy deliveries. Chuh et al. and other studies have also noted that PR occurring later in pregnancy is typically associated with more favorable outcomes. Given the variability in outcomes, pregnant women with PR, especially those in the early stages of gestation or presenting with widespread rashes or systemic symptoms, should be closely monitored by their healthcare providers.

Clinical, Histologic, and Molecular Features of the Herald Patch

The herald patch, a hallmark of classic pityriasis rosea (PR), is typically the first lesion to appear and is often larger and more well-defined than the subsequent smaller lesions. Clinically, it presents as a solitary, oval or round, erythematous plaque with a fine, trailing edge of scale, often referred to as a "collarette." This lesion is commonly found on the trunk or proximal limbs and precedes the generalized eruption by several days to 2 weeks.

Histologically, the herald patch can exhibit features similar to other inflammatory dermatoses, with a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and mild spongiosis. However, some studies suggest that the herald patch may show more prominent epidermal changes compared with the secondary lesions, such as parakeratosis and focal necrosis of keratinocytes. Molecular differences between the herald patch and subsequent lesions have not been extensively characterized, though studies imply that viral reactivation, particularly of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7, may play a role in initiating the herald patch.

Case report

A 2-year-old girl presented to our dermatology clinic with a bullous rash on her hands (Fig 1) and feet (Fig 2). The rash was characterized by tense vesiculobullous lesions without an erythematous base, which is consistent with a dyshidrosiform pattern. The patient's mother reported that the rash had appeared approximately 1 week after the child had experienced a high fever lasting 5 days and irritability.

The patient had no significant past medical history and was previously healthy. There was no family history of immunodeficiency or dermatological conditions.

Blood tests were performed to further investigate the cause of the rash. Routine laboratory tests and inflammatory markers showed no significant abnormalities. Additionally, anti-desmoglein (anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3) antibodies, anti-bullous pemphigoid (anti-BP180 and anti-BP230) antibodies, and anti-collagen VII antibodies were negative. Anti-tissue transglutaminase 3 autoantibodies were also negative. Microbiological investigations included testing for IgG and IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and coxsackievirus. Notably, the patient had cytomegalovirus IgG at 118 U/mL (positive if > 14 U/mL) and Parvovirus B19 IgG at 42.20 U/mL (positive if > 2.5 U/mL) but had negative IgM. Calibrated quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the presence and copy number of HHV-6 and HHV-7 revealed the presence of more than 40,000 copies/mL of HHV-6 DNA, indicating an active infection.

The child was treated with betamethasone 0.1% cream applied twice daily and emollients for 10 days until the skin symptoms resolved. Four weeks later, HHV-6 DNA levels were undetectable, confirming resolution of the infection.

Noninfectious Hypotheses

Pityriasis Rosea-Like Eruptions Post-vaccination

PR-like eruptions have been reported following various vaccinations, including Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), influenza, polio, H1N1, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, smallpox, papillomavirus, Hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and COVID-19. Papakostas et al. proposed that vaccines may trigger a T-cell mediated response and that the activated immune system thus reactivates the pathogen. In fact, it has been suggested that the pathophysiology of PR is predominantly T-cell mediated, supported by the proliferation of T-cells and the lack of natural killer (NK) cells and B-cells found in PR lesions. The presence of anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) keratinocytes in PR patients also suggests that this immune response is responsible for the clinical signs of PR.

Drug-Induced Pityriasis Rosea-Like Eruptions

There have also been reports of patients developing lesions resembling PR following new administration of medications (Table 1). Drug-induced PR-like eruptions usually occur without a herald patch or typical collarette scaling and may require lower dosage or discontinuation of the drug to resolve. Table 1 displays many of the drugs or associated drug classes that have been reported to cause PR.

Etiology and Pathophysiology

Despite its common incidence and distinct clinical presentations, the exact cause of PR remains unknown owing to conflicting evidence. However, there are numerous hypotheses implicating both infectious and noninfectious factors.

Infectious Hypotheses

A large body of literature points to the possibility of an infectious origin of PR, due to its seasonal variations, familial clustering, and prodromal presentations. PR occurs more commonly during the winter, outbreaks happen in clusters, and patients often report upper respiratory infection-like symptoms preceding PR lesions. In addition, only 1–3% of patients experience second episodes, and even fewer report more than two recurrences, often with smaller and fewer lesions. Although there is no consistent pattern regarding morphology, age, or sex affected, a few studies note the association between recurrences and episodes of stress, suggesting the role of viral reactivation in PR recurrence.

Studies have reported different viruses, bacteria, and spirochetes as causative pathogens of PR, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus, parvovirus B19, picornavirus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, Legionella spp. Mycoplasma spp. and Chlamydia spp. but failed to identify a single infectious agent. There has also been a growing discussion of human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 in the etiology of PR. HHV-7 DNA is frequently detected in blood and saliva of patients with PR. Studies suggest a link between primary infection of HHV-6 or HHV-7 in early childhood and its manifesting as PR in future systemic reactivation. A few studies explored the role of Streptococcus in causing PR as patients had preceding upper respiratory infections and increased antistreptolysin O (ASLO) titers, although this was not supported in future studies.

Post-travel respiratory infections — clinical presentation and differential considerations — Most respiratory infections, especially those of the upper respiratory tract, are mild, whereas lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, can be more severe. Lower respiratory tract infections are more likely than upper respiratory tract infections to cause chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; cough is often present in either upper or lower respiratory tract infections; and rash may be present, especially in measles, rubella, and varicella. People with influenza commonly have acute onset of cough, fever, headache, and myalgias, and people with COVID-19 might have a similar clinical presentation but mild disease and asymptomatic infection also are common, with similar symptoms seen in bacterial infections including legionellosis. Consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of travelers who present with cough, dyspnea, tachycardia, or fever and pleurisy, especially those who have recently been on long car or plane trips.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^73ec7a6c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied to affected and immediately surrounding areas once to twice daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis, or tinea cruris. Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied once daily in the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor should be treated for 2 weeks and tinea pedis for 1 month to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reviewed.

Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk that may extend to the neck, arms, and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora.

### Localized inflammation in dengue vaccine-induced skin rash is not associated with continuous presence of dengue virus genome [^260a680a]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination with the tetravalent live-attenuated dengue virus (DENV) vaccines TV003 and TV005 causes a mild, relatively localized erythematous maculopapular skin rash in most dengue-naïve vaccinees. Human challenge model DENV strains, DENV2Δ30 and DENV3Δ30, trigger a confluent skin rash over most of the body in most unvaccinated participants. To determine the etiology of these rashes, we performed in situ hybridization for DENV genome and assessed cellular infiltration by H&E staining in skin biopsies from humans infected with live-attenuated dengue vaccine DENV2Δ30 or DENV3Δ30 challenge strains. Sixty-three biopsies from 40 participants were included in the study, of which 43 biopsies from 32 patients contained intact RNA. Of these, 1 sample taken from a nonerythematous site from a DENV2Δ30-infected participant experiencing a rash was positive for DENV2 genome. Incidence and severity of lymphocytic infiltration were highest in rash biopsy samples than in those from noninvolved areas in participants experiencing a rash or from those taken from participants not experiencing a rash. These results indicate that the rash associated with infection with live-attenuated dengue vaccines or challenge strains is predominantly lymphocyte-driven perivascular dermal inflammation without local concomitant active viral replication.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^bb886572]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — virologic failure with no antiretroviral drug resistance identified is usually due to nonadherence, though poor drug absorption, incorrect dosing, and drug interactions should be considered. Resistance testing should take place while a child is on therapy; after discontinuing therapy, plasma viral strains may quickly revert to wild type and resistance testing can fail to identify the drug-resistant virus. In this situation, resistance can be identified by restarting the prior medications while emphasizing adherence and repeating resistance testing in 4 weeks if plasma virus remains detectable; if the HIV plasma viral load becomes undetectable, then nonadherence was likely the original cause. If a new, more convenient regimen could address adherence barriers, it is reasonable for a clinician to switch a child or adolescent to this new regimen (e.g., a single fixed-dose combination [FDC] tablet taken once daily) while closely monitoring adherence and viral load.

P006 Kawasaki disease in an infant with chikungunya infection

C. Lafay, M. Ruin, A. Burtz, on behalf of Select.

Pediatrics, Saint Pierre University Hospital, Saint Pierre, France

Correspondence: C. Lafay

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): P006

Introduction: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that primarily affects children. To this day, its cause is still unknown. Multiple studies have reported virus in children presenting with KD, in particular Epstein-Barr virus, measles virus, herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus, coxsackie virus, bocavirus, sars-cov-2 virus. So far, most described viruses were transmitted by air, by droplets or by contact.

Considerably less information is available on arbovirus in children with KD. However, some observational studies have reported an overlap between KD outbreaks and seasonal peaks of arboviral infections, suggesting the possible role of these pathogens as triggers of KD.

In the beginning of the year 2025, there was a massive outbreak of Chikungunya infection on the Reunion Island with many children affected. Paediatric presentations for Chikungunya infection usually include high fever, skin, joint and neurological manifestations.

Although Kawasaki disease is known to be triggered by certain virus, no cases of kawasaki-like disease have been yet described in these patients.

Objectives: Here we reported the case of a 9 years-old boy diagnosed with a Chikungunya infection who presented with Kawasaki-like disease 2 weeks after the beginning of the infection.

Methods: A 9-years-old caucasian male was first diagnosed with Chikungunya infection by his general practitioner. He had fever, arthralgia and cutaneous rash. The symptoms improved and the fever stopped for 7 days before starting up again. After 1 week of high fever (40°), he developed gastrointestinal symptoms with diarrhea, vomit and weight loss. The general practitioner prescribed an abdominal ultrasound which was normal and bacterial urinalysis which was negative. Given the deterioration of the general condition, he was put on antibiotics for a week.

Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects (6 Years to Less Than 18 years of age)

The safety assessment in pediatric subjects is based on a single-arm trial. TMC125-C213 is a Phase 2 trial in which 101 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age received etravirine in combination with other antiretroviral agents (Week 24 analysis) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

In TMC125-C213, the frequency, type and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age were comparable to those observed in adult subjects, except for rash which was observed more frequently in pediatric subjects. The most common adverse drug reactions in at least 2% of pediatric subjects were rash and diarrhea. Rash was reported more frequently in female subjects than in male subjects (rash ≥ Grade 2 was reported in 13/64 [20.3%] females versus 2/37 [5.4%] males; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 4/64 [6.3%] females versus 0/37 [0%] males). Rash (greater than or equal to Grade 2) occurred in 15% of pediatric subjects from 6 years to less than 18 years of age. In the majority of cases, rash was mild to moderate, of macular/papular type, and occurred in the second week of therapy. Rash was self-limiting and generally resolved within 1 week on continued therapy. The safety profile for subjects who completed 48 weeks of treatment was similar to the safety profile for subjects who completed 24 weeks of treatment.

Kaposi sarcoma inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) — definition and diagnostic considerations: KICS has been described primarily in patients with concurrent KS; in initial reports, patients had inflammatory signs and MCD-like inflammatory symptoms without pathological findings of MCD, were frequently critically ill, and showed marked elevations in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 with high plasma HHV-8 viral loads. Patients with PEL meet criteria for KICS, but because it is a distinct process, it is essential to appropriately work up and exclude PEL among individuals who meet KICS criteria; therefore, KICS is a diagnosis of exclusion and it is essential to rule out other HHV-8 conditions, including both MCD and PEL, which have different treatment paradigms.

Macrolides

In a nonrandomized, placebo-controlled study, Sharma et al. found that 73% of patients on a 2-week oral erythromycin regimen achieved complete clearance of PR by week 6. Subsequent randomized controlled studies yielded conflicting results. A Cochrane systematic review by Conteras-Ruiz et al. reported at least fair-quality evidence from 14 studies with 761 participants, indicating: no evidence for oral clarithromycin or azithromycin (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47–1.52; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.28–2.48), weak evidence for erythromycin in rash and itch improvement (RR 4.02, 95% CI 0.28–56.61; MD 3.95, 95% CI 3.37–4.53), and moderate evidence for acyclovir in itch reduction (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12–0.94). The potential therapeutic effects of macrolides on PR are thought to arise from their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties rather than antibiotic action, but antibiotic resistance poses a significant risk.

Because TachoSil may cause the formation of clots in blood vessels if exposed intravascularly, advise patients to consult their physician if they experience chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty speaking or swallowing, or leg tenderness or swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Instruct patients to consult their physician if symptoms of B19 virus infection appear (fever, drowsiness and chills) followed about two weeks later by a rash and joint pain. Parvovirus B19 most seriously affects pregnant women (fetal infection); immune-compromised individuals or individuals with an increased erythropoiesis (e.g., hemolytic anemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
Advise patients that, because TachoSil is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents (e.g., viruses), and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) agent [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Neurologic manifestations associated with parvovirus B19 epidemic, Madrid, Spain, 2024 [^90d346ee]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Some studies reported findings that support parvovirus B19 infection as a cause of neurologic manifestations. A comprehensive review identified 129 cases related to parvovirus B19 infection and neurologic symptoms; one third of the patients had a previous history of altered immunity. Another study found the most common parvovirus B19–associated neurologic manifestation was encephalitic syndromes (39%). Rash was observed more frequently among immunocompetent patients than in those with altered immunity; in some cases, rash preceded the onset of other clinical findings. Arthralgia or arthritis symptoms were infrequent. CSF alterations did not show a clear pattern; the median leukocyte count was 9 cells/mL, and a slight increase in protein levels (51%) was the most notable finding. Up to 42% of cases had hematologic disturbances.

In our case series, parvovirus B19 infection manifested in the absence of typical cutaneous manifestations. Among patients in our study, thrombocytopenia was the most prevalent hematologic disorder, and analysis of CSF samples revealed protein levels greater than the established threshold in all cases. In addition, most cases in our study were among adults without underlying immunocompromising diseases.

Parvovirus B19 is frequently underestimated in differential diagnosis schemes of meningoencephalitis. To accurately diagnose parvovirus B19 infection when neurologic involvement is observed, use of additional microbiological investigations is recommended, including serologic markers and virus DNA analysis in plasma and CSF.

In terms of management, steroids and IVIg have been identified as treatment options for clinical syndromes linked to parvovirus B19 infection. The choice to use IVIg is based on the assumption that it contains a substantial quantity of antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus. However, the precise mechanism of IVIg action remains uncertain. We did not observe any clinical differences between the patients who received IVIg and those who did not. The prognosis for neurologic manifestations associated with parvovirus B19 seems favorable; we saw a high rate of spontaneous recovery and an absence of sequelae. Nevertheless, long-term neurologic effects have been documented, including bradyphemia (slow speech), learning difficulties, and slurred speech, as well as more severe outcomes, such as mental and motor impairment and death. In this particular context, our findings are consistent with the available literature on parvovirus B19 infections with neurologic manifestations.
