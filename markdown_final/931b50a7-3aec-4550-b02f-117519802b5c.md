## Question

Postmenopasual vaginal brown discharge

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a guide to evaluating and managing postmenopausal brown vaginal discharge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this constitutes postmenopausal bleeding and therefore mandates evaluation. Then, I should verify the immediate diagnostic workup to exclude malignancy and other serious pathology. Next, I will consider common benign etiologies such as atrophic vaginitis, infections, and device-related discharge. After that, I should review medication and procedural contributors. Finally, I will outline management strategies, including when to use local estrogen, nonhormonal options, and when to refer, while double-checking safety nuances and patient counseling points throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priority: any brown discharge in a postmenopausal woman is a form of postmenopausal bleeding and warrants evaluation to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, even if scant or intermittent, because approximately 5–10% of women with postmenopausal bleeding harbor endometrial cancer and guidelines uniformly recommend assessment [^111cdmgq] [^116FTFV1] [^111TCFDr] [^113BKfDe].

> Wait, let me verify the initial workup before jumping to conclusions about etiology: I should obtain a focused history including onset, duration, timing relative to intercourse, associated symptoms, medication exposures, and device use; perform a speculum and bimanual exam to visualize the cervix and vagina; and order a transvaginal ultrasound with endometrial thickness measurement, recognizing that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less in a postmenopausal woman without bleeding has a high negative predictive value for hyperplasia or cancer, though any bleeding still warrants tissue diagnosis if the lining is thick or symptoms persist [^111cdmgq].

> Hold on, I should verify the threshold for endometrial sampling: if the endometrial thickness is 4 mm or greater, or if bleeding persists despite a thin lining, I need an endometrial biopsy or pipelle sampling to rule out hyperplasia or malignancy; if the cervix is abnormal, I should add cervical cytology and consider colposcopy, and if the exam reveals a mass or lesion, I must biopsy it to exclude vaginal or cervical cancer [^114WRQ4V].

> Next, I will examine benign etiologies once serious pathology is excluded, starting with genitourinary syndrome of menopause: atrophic vaginitis is common and can present with scant brown discharge due to friable, thin mucosa, often with dryness, irritation, or postcoital spotting; objective findings may include pale, thin epithelium, petechiae, and an elevated vaginal pH, and these features can guide toward local estrogen therapy if symptoms are bothersome [^117T3jjC] [^116oT8Ze] [^111TxWBU].

> I need to check for infectious causes because discharge color alone is unreliable in postmenopausal patients; bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and candidiasis remain prevalent and require targeted testing with vaginal pH, whiff test, saline and KOH microscopy, and NAATs when available, given the limited diagnostic accuracy of symptoms alone and the high frequency of mixed infections in this population [^113LrPTr] [^11342oLa] [^1139Lyf3].

> But wait, what if a pessary is in place or the patient recently had pelvic organ prolapse management; I should confirm device use because pessaries are associated with bothersome discharge in about 30% of users and early inflammatory changes can develop within two weeks of fitting, so counseling, culture if infection is suspected, and more frequent removal/cleansing are reasonable steps, with observational data suggesting vaginal estrogen may reduce discharge-related discontinuation, though high-quality randomized data are emerging and should be interpreted carefully [^117G43bf] [^116tJhSY] [^113f3Bek] [^115f1fjo].

> I will now examine medication and treatment-related contributors: systemic menopausal hormone therapy frequently causes vaginal discharge and spotting, particularly in the first year, and FDA labeling for systemic and local estrogen products advises patients to report any vaginal bleeding promptly; similarly, prasterone (DHEA) vaginal inserts list vaginal discharge as a common adverse effect, and energy-based vaginal devices can cause discharge or spotting in the short term, so I should reconcile timing, dose, and device exposure with symptom onset before attributing causality [^114uKCPg] [^115a2Az5] [^114bo5MZ] [^113eLTpS] [^1147XtUN] [^115GfMSw].

> Let me consider management once malignancy is excluded and GSM is likely: first-line conservative therapy includes regular vaginal moisturizers and lubricants for comfort, recognizing they treat symptoms but not the underlying atrophy; if symptoms persist, low-dose local vaginal estrogen in cream, tablet, or ring form is effective and has minimal systemic absorption, and importantly, routine progestogen is not required with low-dose local estrogen; if estrogen is contraindicated or declined, options include ospemifene or, in select settings, compounded vaginal oxytocin, though evidence and availability vary and should be framed within shared decision-making [^115uU3Kh] [^113CYWcW] [^117Vqe2F] [^115mnMhv] [^115oXgqX] [^116WGqEg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought moisturizers and lubricants might be sufficient for most patients with moderate-to-severe GSM; hold on, I should verify guideline hierarchies — while nonhormonal options are appropriate first-line for mild symptoms, persistent moderate-to-severe GSM generally warrants local estrogen given superior reversal of atrophic changes, so I should correct that overstatement and tailor therapy to severity and response [^115uU3Kh] [^113CYWcW].

> I should double-check safety counseling: any recurrent or persistent bleeding, even on local therapy, warrants repeat endometrial evaluation; patients should be instructed to report bleeding promptly, and clinicians should maintain vigilance for endometrial pathology if bleeding recurs or the lining thickens on surveillance imaging, aligning with endocrine and menopause society guidance [^112MEM2F] [^114XRgd9] [^116FTFV1].

> Next, I should review when to refer: suspicion for malignancy, complex pelvic pathology, refractory GSM despite optimized therapy, or patient preference for procedural options should prompt gynecology or gynecologic oncology referral; if considering energy-based devices, I need to counsel that short-term safety appears acceptable but long-term efficacy and safety are uncertain and not established for many menopause-related indications, so expectations should be cautious and evidence-based [^113HA7Pp] [^1147XtUN] [^1152E2eb].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education and follow-up: explain that brown discharge represents old blood and is a form of postmenopausal bleeding, clarify the rationale for evaluation, discuss likely benign contributors once cancer is excluded, and provide written instructions to report any new bleeding, pain, malodor, or systemic symptoms promptly; schedule reassessment in 4–6 weeks to review biopsy results, symptom response, and adherence, adjusting the plan accordingly [^116FTFV1].

Postmenopausal brown vaginal discharge is most often due to **atrophic vaginitis** from estrogen loss [^notfound], but it is essential to **rule out malignancy** because 5–10% of postmenopausal bleeding signals endometrial cancer [^111cdmgq]. Immediate evaluation should include a pelvic exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and endometrial sampling if the lining is ≥ 4 mm or bleeding persists [^114WRQ4V]. Brown discharge can also result from cervical polyps, endometrial polyps, infection, or medication effects (e.g. tamoxifen, anticoagulants) [^11342oLa] [^116dfHru]. Management depends on the cause: local vaginal estrogen for atrophy [^115uU3Kh], antibiotics for infection [^11342oLa], and surgical removal for polyps; any unexplained or persistent discharge warrants urgent gynecologic assessment [^111uyhtQ].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize the discharge by onset, duration, and frequency, and ask about associated symptoms such as **bleeding**, pain, odor, itching, and dyspareunia [^113Gxmr3]. Review medical and surgical history, including menopause details, hormone use, and prior gynecologic procedures. Document medications — particularly **tamoxifen**, anticoagulants, and hormone therapy [^116dfHru] [^114uKCPg]. Assess risk factors for **malignancy**, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking [^116V6iWm].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a **speculum exam** to assess the vagina and cervix for atrophy, polyps, lesions, or masses [^notfound]. Palpate the uterus and adnexa on **bimanual exam** for enlargement, tenderness, or masses. Obtain a **Pap smear** and HPV test if indicated, and perform targeted biopsies of suspicious lesions [^116qqVPc].

---

### Diagnostic tests

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Evaluate endometrial thickness; ≥ 4 mm in postmenopausal women with bleeding warrants endometrial sampling [^114WRQ4V].
- **Endometrial biopsy**: Essential to exclude hyperplasia or carcinoma when the endometrium is ≥ 4 mm or bleeding persists [^114WRQ4V].
- **Infection screening**: Vaginal swabs for bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and other pathogens as indicated [^11342oLa].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, thyroid function, and coagulation profile if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Benign conditions

- **Atrophic vaginitis**: Local vaginal estrogen therapy (cream, tablet, or ring) is effective and safe [^11125N9F]; moisturizers and lubricants can help symptoms [^115uU3Kh].
- **Cervical/endometrial polyps**: Polypectomy is curative and provides tissue for histology [^notfound].
- **Infections**: Treat bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis with appropriate antibiotics [^11342oLa].

---

### Malignant conditions

Management of malignancy involves **oncology referral** for surgical staging and treatment, including hysterectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy tailored to cancer type and stage [^113HA7Pp].

---

### Medication-related causes

Medication-related causes may require **adjustment or cessation** of offending agents (e.g. tamoxifen, anticoagulants) when feasible, with alternative therapies considered [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and counseling

- **Report bleeding**: Emphasize that any postmenopausal bleeding, including brown discharge, requires evaluation [^116FTFV1].
- **Regular follow-up**: Encourage ongoing gynecologic care and symptom monitoring [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Discuss weight management, smoking cessation, and safe sex practices [^116V6iWm].

---

Postmenopausal brown vaginal discharge is most often benign, but **malignancy must be excluded** [^111uyhtQ]. A structured evaluation — history, exam, imaging, and biopsy when indicated — guides diagnosis and management, with therapy tailored to the underlying cause [^113Gxmr3].

### Should I stay for local hormone therapy or should I go for radiofrequency to treat vulvovaginal atrophy? A patient preference trial [^115TL9XK]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

The population of developed countries is aging considerably due to an increasing life expectancy. From this perspective, improving the quality of life (QoL) of the older population has become essential, and this also entails ensuring these individuals an adequate sexual life.

In the last decades, there has been an increasing interest in sexual health, and a special consideration has been given to menopause; although society tends to consider postmenopausal women less interested in their sexuality, many women continue to consider sex as a fundamental element of their lives. Women are now more careful and demanding about their body, their sexual function, and their sexual image.

It is acknowledged that the hormone withdrawal that occurs following menopause may worsen sexual function for women by reducing sexual desire and lubrification and by causing dyspareunia. In fact, hypoestrogenism causes loss of collagen fibers and adipocytes in tissues, reduced vascular flow, reduced vaginal secretion and lubrication, and a rise in vaginal pH. It is estimated that almost 40% to 60% of all postmenopausal women suffer from genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), although the actual number is likely underreported.GSM was described by The Menopause Society (formerly known as The North American Menopause Society) in 2014 as a clinical condition, which is due to the postmenopausal reduction in the concentration of sexual hormones and is characterized by vulvovaginal (dryness, burning, itching, vaginal discharge, bleeding, or spotting) and lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, urinary frequency, or recurrent urinary tract infections). This is a very common chronic and progressive condition that negatively interferes with female postmenopausal quality of life (QoL), with a significant negative impact on physical, emotional, and sexual life.

### Perimenopausal vaginal bleeding: diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic options [^114hZwdq]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

While significant awareness has been raised about menopause, less attention has been focused on the perimenopausal or "menopausal transition" period. Many women and their physicians remain unaware of the impact of this transitional phase into menopause. Specifically, heavy and unpredictable perimenopausal bleeding is extremely common. It is a normal phenomenon of aging and tends to improve over time. However, about one quarter of perimenopausal women will have heavy flow that persists beyond 3 months and will require medical assistance. The purpose of this review is to focus on the hormonal and physiologic changes that are associated with perimenopausal heavy vaginal bleeding, to present the essential evaluation of causes for this heavy flow, and to outline the evidence for effective medical and surgical treatments. Advances in the understanding of the normal physiology of perimenopause have led to medical therapies that may lead to fewer surgical procedures and hysterectomies and should be of interest to health care practitioners focusing on women's health. Although these issues are addressed in the gynecologic literature, there is relatively less published in other disciplines.

### Atrophic vaginitis [^112sA6Rd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

With the loss of estrogen that occurs with menopause, physiologic and structural changes occur within the vulvovaginal mucosa that lead to a condition commonly called atrophic vaginitis. Although mild genital changes occur in most women, 10–47% of postmenopausal women will develop one or more debilitating symptoms that include vulvovaginal dryness, dyspareunia, vulvar itching or pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, as well as abnormal vaginal discharge. Topical estrogen replacement therapies reverse these mucosal changes and are effective treatments for the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Vaginal moisturizers and lubricants also provide symptomatic relief for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, respectively.

Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause: AUA/SUFU/AUGS Guideline — harms, symptom trajectory, and endometrial outcomes indicate that harms reporting (KQ3) was limited, most studies did not find evidence of frequent serious harms, and infrequent adverse events (AEs) varied by treatment. Reported associations included vaginal estrogen with vaginal bleeding, discharge, and breast tenderness; vaginal DHEA with increased facial hair, voice changes, and headaches; oral ospemifene with hot flushes and vaginal candidiasis; and CO2 laser with vaginal bleeding, pain, and discharge. For KQ4, limited evidence within studies of effective treatments suggests that symptoms begin improving within 1–2 months and continue to improve through 12 weeks. For endometrial outcomes (KQ5), among hormonal interventions, ospemifene was associated with thickened endometrial lining, proliferative endometrial histology, and one case of endometrial hyperplasia.

### The effect of pessaries on the vaginal microenvironment [^117G43bf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the differences in vaginal culture, microscopy, and Gram stain between postmenopausal women who wear pessaries and those who do not to explain pessary-related, bothersome vaginal discharge.

Study Design

Postmenopausal women not using exogenous estrogen who had either been wearing a pessary for at least 3 months or who were undergoing their first pessary fittings were approached for enrollment. Symptoms were assessed, and vaginal fluid was collected for culture, microscopy, and Gram stain. A cross-sectional analysis was performed, comparing the new and return pessary wearers. The new pessary users were also sampled at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after fitting.

Results

Women who wore pessaries were more likely to be bothered by discharge (30.0% vs 2.1%, P < .001). They were also more likely to show microscopic evidence of vaginal inflammation and vaginitis. Prospective data showed that these changes developed during the first 2 weeks of pessary use. Aerobic and anaerobic organisms were nearly identical in women with and without bothersome vaginal discharge in the cross-sectional analysis and at all time points in the prospective analysis.

Conclusion

Pessary-related, bothersome vaginal discharge develops early and may be due to an inflammatory process in the vagina.

### Effects of ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol on postmenopausal symptoms in women aged 60 to 80 years [^1148mij4]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol on postmenopausal symptoms and side effects in a cohort of largely asymptomatic postmenopausal women aged 60 to 80 years.

Design

This secondary analysis used data from the UltraLow-dose Transdermal estRogen Assessment trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in postmenopausal women to determine the skeletal effects and safety of ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol. Four hundred seventeen postmenopausal women, aged 60 to 80 years, were randomly assigned to receive either unopposed transdermal estradiol at 0.014 mg/d (n = 208) or placebo (n = 209). Participants were queried at each clinic visit about postmenopausal symptoms and side effects purported to be associated with estrogen therapy using a standardized questionnaire.

Results

At baseline, 16% of women reported hot flashes, 32% reported vaginal dryness, and 35% reported trouble sleeping. Women who received ultralow-dose estradiol were no more likely to report improvement of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or sleep difficulties than those who received placebo. Treatment with ultralow-dose estradiol did not cause breast tenderness, uterine bleeding, or other symptoms often attributed to estrogen, but vaginal discharge was more common in women who received estradiol compared with those who received placebo.

Conclusion

In this population of older, largely asymptomatic women, ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol did not improve postmenopausal symptoms and did not cause side effects other than vaginal discharge. Further study is needed to determine whether this dose of transdermal estradiol is effective in treating symptoms of postmenopause in younger, more symptomatic women.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^116M61E2]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the gynaecology clinic with a 1-week history of vaginal bleeding. She was investigated to rule out local and systemic causes including genital malignancy. The investigations were negative for genital malignancy and her symptoms settled spontaneously. The bleeding was attributed to a corticosteroid treatment for shoulder joint pain. A short literature review of this rare side effect is discussed.

### Evaluation of vaginal complaints [^113LrPTr]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis using some combination of physical examination, pH, the wet mount, and the whiff test.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of the clinical examination and determine the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis.

Data Sources

Using a structured literature review, we abstracted information on sensitivity and specificity for symptoms, signs, and office laboratory procedures. We chose published (1966 to April 2003) articles that appeared in the MEDLINE database and were indexed under the combined search terms of diagnosis with vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.

Study Selection

Included studies of symptomatic premenopausal women seen in primary care settings. Tests were evaluated only if they would provide diagnostic information during the office visit and were compared with an acceptable criterion standard.

Data Extraction

All 3 authors extracted the data and computed sensitivity and specificity from each article independently. The absence of standard definitions for symptoms and signs made it impossible to combine results across studies.

Data Synthesis

Symptoms alone do not allow clinicians to distinguish confidently between the causes of vaginitis. However, a patient's lack of itching makes candidiasis less likely (range of LRs, 0.18 [95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.70] to 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72–0.87]) and lack of perceived odor makes bacterial vaginosis unlikely (LR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01–0.51]). Similarly, physical examination signs are limited in their diagnostic power. The presence of inflammatory signs is associated with candidiasis (range of LRs, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5–2.8] to 8.4 [95% CI, 2.3–31]). Presence of a "high cheese" odor on examination is predictive of bacterial vaginosis (LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.1–4.7]) while lack of odor is associated with candidiasis (LR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.4–5.0]). Office laboratory tests, particularly microscopy of vaginal discharge, are the most useful way of diagnosing these 3 conditions.

Conclusions

The cause of vaginal complaints may be easily diagnosed when typical findings appear in microscopy. However, the poor performance of individual symptoms, signs, and office laboratory tests often makes it problematic to identify the cause of vaginal symptoms.

### Patient acceptability and satisfaction with a low-dose solubilized vaginal estradiol softgel capsule, TX-004HR [^116XyPgd]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) often results from a decline in circulating estrogen levels experienced at the onset of menopause. VVA is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, including dyspareunia; vaginal dryness, irritation, soreness, stinging pain, and discharge; and dysuria. In 2014, the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health and The North American Menopause Society adopted genitourinary syndrome of menopause as a medically more accurate and all-encompassing term for describing VVA and its urogenitary symptoms; however, this term has yet to be adopted by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

The North American Menopause Society recommends nonhormonal lubricants and vaginal moisturizers as first-line therapies for women with symptomatic VVA and low-dose vaginal estrogens for those with moderate-to-severe VVA or who have failed to respond to lubricants and moisturizers, which do not address the underlying physiological condition. The vaginal route of administration allows for localized treatment with low-dose estrogens to relieve symptoms with little to no systemic estrogen exposure. Potential benefits of vaginal versus oral administration are avoidance of gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass effects, which allows for lower dosing and lower systemic exposure, and potentially a lower incidence of adverse effects.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^113kc18i]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause — adverse events with moisturizers and lubricants: Studies on moisturizers and placebo lubricants documented adverse events (AEs) including increased vaginal secretions, breast tenderness, body rash, vaginal itching, spotting or bleeding, vaginal candidiasis, vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, urinary tract infection, non-cancer breast disorders, and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, and these were not different among treatment groups; among breast cancer survivors, there were no significant differences in AEs (irritation, itching, discharge) for lactic acid versus placebo gel and all AEs were deemed mild or moderate. The text notes that moisturizers or lubricants may irritate thin vulvovaginal tissues and that treating with local vaginal hormones can improve tolerance and patient experience.

### A case of crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever presenting to the emergency department with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding [^115Rw86D]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a common cause of tick-borne hemorrhagic infections. The aim of this study is to report a case of a postmenopausal woman presenting with vaginal bleeding.

Case Report

A 52-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with high fever, weakness, loss of appetite, and vaginal bleeding. The patient was engaged in animal husbandry and had no history of tick bites. She had entered menopause 1 year prior. Laboratory tests revealed bicytopenia, abnormal kidney and liver function tests, and impaired coagulation parameters. The diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). She was hospitalized and treated with hydration, bleeding monitoring, and ribavirin. She was discharged on the 6th day of admission. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? CCHF presents various clinical manifestations, beyond fever and bleeding. In women living in endemic areas, postmenopausal bleeding may also be a symptom of CCHF, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis if the clinical history and laboratory findings are consistent.

Vaginal energy-based devices (EBD) — safety considerations: All 6 drafted statements on the safety of vulvovaginal EBD therapy achieved consensus, and although serious adverse events have been reported, these incidents are relatively infrequent in the short term for menopausal dyspareunia, VVA, or vaginal dryness; based on short-term data, EBD therapies have a favorable safety profile, but long-term sequelae are unknown, with potential adverse events including increased vaginal discharge, spotting, bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infection, and rarely scarring or burning, and the effects on existing cervical pathology or development of cervical stenosis are unknown with no evidence supporting EBD for pelvic irradiation–induced vaginitis.

### Menopausal symptoms and treatment-related effects of estrogen and progestin in the women's health initiative [^114uKCPg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effects of estrogen plus progestin (E+P) therapy on menopausal symptoms, vaginal bleeding, gynecologic surgery rates, and treatment-related adverse effects in postmenopausal women.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 16,608 postmenopausal women, ages 50–79 (mean ± standard deviation 63.3 ± 7.1) years, with intact uterus, randomized to one tablet per day containing 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8,506) or placebo (n = 8,102), and followed for a mean of 5.6 years. Change in symptoms and treatment-related effects were analyzed at year 1 in all participants. Bleeding and gynecologic surgery rates were analyzed through study close-out.

Results

Baseline symptoms did not differ between the treatment groups. More women assigned to E+P than placebo reported relief of hot flushes (85.7% versus 57.7%, respectively; odds ratio 4.40; 95% confidence interval 3.40–5.71), night sweats (77.6% versus 57.4%; 2.58; 2.04–3.26), vaginal or genital dryness (74.1% versus 54.6%; 2.40; 1.90–3.02), joint pain or stiffness (47.1% versus 38.4%; 1.43; 1.24–1.64), and general aches or pains (49.3% versus 43.7%; 1.25; 1.08–1.44). Women asymptomatic at baseline who were assigned to E+P more often developed breast tenderness (9.3% versus 2.4%, respectively; 4.26; 3.59–5.04), vaginal or genital discharge (4.1% versus 1.0%; 4.47; 3.44–5.81), vaginal or genital irritation (4.2% versus 2.8%; 1.52; 1.27–1.81), and headaches (5.8% versus 4.7%; 1.26; 1.08–1.46) than women on placebo. Estrogen plus progestin treatment prevented the onset of new musculoskeletal symptoms. Vaginal bleeding was reported by 51% of women on E+P and 5% of women on placebo at 6 months; most bleeding was reported as spotting. Gynecologic surgeries (hysterectomy and dilation and curettage) were performed more frequently in women assigned to E+P (3.1% versus 2.5% for hysterectomy, hazard ratio = 1.23, P = 0.026; 5.4% versus 2.4% for dilation and curettage, hazard ratio = 2.23, P < .001).

Conclusion

Estrogen plus progestin relieved some menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms and vaginal or genital dryness, but contributed to treatment-related effects, such as bleeding, breast tenderness, and an increased likelihood of gynecologic surgery.

Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause — vaginal lubricants: 5.1b For women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. (2|⊕⊕○○) Vaginal lubricants are used to enhance the sexual experience in women with symptoms of VVA by alleviating vaginal dryness and preventing dyspareunia, but lubricants do not treat the underlying problem and only briefly alleviate symptoms. Several OTC options are available, and because data do not demonstrate the superiority of one to another, women can experiment with these products. Olive oil is also effective, whereas petroleum jelly has been associated with an increased rate of bacterial vaginosis.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause — vaginal oxytocin: Two RCTs (n = 243) of vaginal oxytocin gel versus placebo yielded mixed results; one study showed improvement in vaginal discomfort or irritation, while another showed no significant improvement in self‑identified MBS at 12 weeks. No studies evaluated QoL or treatment satisfaction, and one trial showed significant improvement in sexual function after 8 weeks versus placebo. Serious adverse events included vaginal discharge, UTI, and vaginal odor, yet oxytocin may result in little to no difference in serious AEs compared to placebo, with no safety concerns regarding endometrial thickness. Vaginal oxytocin is not commercially available in the United States but may be obtained through compounding pharmacies, and the Panel was not able to make recommendations on its use.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom [^1148oBU5]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The reduced estrogen levels that occur after menopause are associated with vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), a chronic condition that leads to increased vaginal pH, thinning of the vaginal and lower genitourinary epithelial lining, and loss of vaginal elasticity. - Symptoms include dyspareunia, dysuria, and vaginal or vulvar dryness, itching, irritation, and burning, any of which can negatively impact sexual health and quality of life. In the large US REVIVE survey of postmenopausal women, the most commonly reported VVA symptoms were vaginal dryness (55%) and dyspareunia (44%). In addition to these vulvovaginal symptoms, lower urinary tract symptoms can also occur after menopause onset; this led to the 2014 proposal to replace VVA with the more inclusive term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). For the purposes of this article, the term VVA will be used to avoid inconsistencies in terminology as US prescribing inserts of treatments discussed herein commonly refer to vulvar and vaginal atrophy rather than GSM.

Although there is a high prevalence of VVA (over 50% of postmenopausal women report symptoms), it is typically underdiagnosed and undertreated, with only 56% of postmenopausal survey participants with vulvovaginal symptoms reporting a discussion of their problem with a healthcare provider. Although other bothersome symptoms of menopause — such as flushes, hot flashes, and night sweats — can wane over time, vulvovaginal symptoms are chronic and can intensify if untreated. Nonhormone moisturizers and lubricants can relieve mild symptoms, but have a brief window of effectiveness (< 24 h per use) and fail to reverse many atrophic signs. In the 2017 position statement from The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), it is recommended that estrogen treatment for vulvovaginal symptoms be individualized by offering the most appropriate dose, route of administration, regimen, and duration of use that results in maximal benefits with minimal risk. For example, lower-dose vaginal estrogen is recommended for vulvovaginal symptoms that fail to respond to nonhormone measures or are moderate–severe in their intensity. Using appropriately low vaginal estrogen doses is consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on estrogen treatment for menopause symptoms. Topical, localized estrogen treatments via vaginal tablets, rings, or creams reduce systemic estrogen exposure.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^116oT8Ze]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — diagnosis and objective measures are described as follows: Clinicians generally diagnose GSM based on symptoms, with or without related physical findings, and after ruling out other etiologies; objective measures of postmenopausal vaginal changes include the Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) and vaginal pH. Trials have sometimes limited inclusion to patients with moderate to severe GSM symptoms, 5% or fewer superficial cells on VMI, and vaginal pH greater than 5; however these measures are neither required nor commonly used for clinical diagnosis and treatment of GSM. Presence and severity of physical exam findings do not directly correlate with self-reported GSM symptoms.

Variations in estrogen levels across a woman's lifetime lead to important changes in genital physiology and pathophysiology. Low estrogen states like menopause and the prepubertal period share important physiologic changes, including more friable, dry, and inelastic mucosa that is prone to irritation, injury, and infection. These and other factors lead to unique gynecologic pathologic conditions encountered at the extremes of age. Age-specific pathologic conditions and differences in examination techniques are discussed.

### MsFLASH network vaginal health trial: absence of evidence is NOT evidence of absence [^117PVcKG]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 50% of postmenopausal women experience vulvovaginal symptoms associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). GSM is a chronic and progressive condition with a well-defined treatment algorithm. Analysis of the MsFLASH Vaginal Health Trial data produced two main conclusions, which were that prescribed vaginal 10μg estradiol tablet and over-the-counter (OTC) vaginal moisturizer did not provide additional benefit over placebo vaginal tablet and placebo gel in reducing postmenopausal vulvovaginal symptoms; or increasing the proportions of women reporting sexual activity or improving pain scores with sexual activity. These treatment conclusions are contrary to all prior robust clinical trial data for dyspareunia and vaginal dryness, and not in line with the good clinical practice for GSM management presented by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, The North American Menopause Society, and the Endocrine Society. Overall, the flaws of the MsFLASH Vaginal Health Trial were to incorrectly identify the therapeutic outcomes of most interest using metrics that exhibit high degrees of placebo bias; and to utilize low statistical power with which to appreciate any significant differences between groups.

### Physical characteristics and properties of estradiol softgel vaginal inserts [^113B9hJt]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, only one case (2.1%, 1/48) of vaginal discharge possibly related to study drug was reported in the phase 2 capsule assessment study. A similar vaginal discharge rate (3.7%; 28/764) was observed in the phase 3 REJOICE trial, although a higher rate for vaginal discharge was observed in the placebo group (6.8%, 13/192) than in the TX-004HR groups (4 μg, 2.6% [5/191], 10 μg, 3.1% [6/191], and 25 μg, 2.1% [4/190]). Similar to the pilot study, most AEs in the REJOICE trial were mild to moderate, and no participants discontinued because of vaginal discharge AEs.

### Effect of vaginal estrogen on pessary use [^113f3Bek]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Many providers recommend concurrent estrogen therapy with pessary use to limit complications; however, limited data exist to support this practice. We hypothesized that vaginal estrogen supplementation decreases incidence of pessary-related complications and discontinuation.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent a pessary fitting from 1 January 2007 through 1 September 2013 at one institution; participants were identified by billing code and were eligible if they were postmenopausal and had at least 3 months of pessary use and 6 months of follow-up. All tests were two sided, and P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Data from 199 women were included; 134 used vaginal estrogen and 65 did not. Women who used vaginal estrogen had a longer median follow-up time (29.5 months) compared with women who did not (15.4 months) and were more likely to have at least one pessary check (98.5% vs 86.2%, P < 0.001). Those in the estrogen group were less likely to discontinue using their pessary (30.6% vs 58.5%, P < 0.001) and less likely to develop increased vaginal discharge than women who did not [hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17–0.58]. Vaginal estrogen was not protective against erosions (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54–1.6) or vaginal bleeding (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36–1.7).

Conclusions

Women who used vaginal estrogen exhibited a higher incidence of continued pessary use and lower incidence of increased vaginal discharge than women who did not.

### Vaginal pH: a simple assessment highly correlated with vaginal morphology and symptoms in postmenopausal women [^111TxWBU]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine the utility of vaginal pH as a marker of menopause and vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) before and after local estrogen treatment.

Methods

Vaginal pH was determined using standard pH paper strips in two clinical trials involving postmenopausal women with signs and symptoms of VVA evaluated before and after intervention with vaginal estradiol in softgel capsules. The utility of vaginal pH was evaluated as a screening method for VVA due to menopause and correlations were analyzed between vaginal pH and VVA symptoms, physical changes, and maturation of the vaginal epithelium.

Results

Changes in vaginal pH were significantly correlated with changes in superficial and parabasal cell counts; vaginal epithelial changes of color, integrity, thickness, and secretion; and the VVA symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (vaginal pain with intercourse).

Conclusions

Vaginal pH consistently correlated with parabasal and superficial cells and the visual vaginal epithelial changes and symptoms of dryness and dyspareunia, and is thus a simple outpatient procedure that reflects the hormonal milieu and its effects on the vaginal epithelium.

### Side effects of low-dose tamoxifen: results from a six-armed randomised controlled trial in healthy women [^116Pti7T]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparing low dose vs high dose

To contrast the effect of low-dose tamoxifen (2.5 and 5 mg) to high-dose (10 and 20 mg), we compared the sum of mean Likert score change (from baseline to end of treatment) in the five side effects ('hot flashes', 'night sweats', 'cold sweats', 'vaginal discharge' and 'muscle cramps') significantly associated with 20 mg tamoxifen in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We found a significant difference in the severity of side effects in premenopausal, but not in postmenopausal women. Premenopausal women at low-dose tamoxifen reported 34% less severity of side effects compared to women in the high-dose group (sum of mean Likert score change: 1.61 (95% CI: 1.17–2.04) versus 2.47 (95% CI: 1.98–2.96)) (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Symptom severity change by low (2.5 mg, 5 mg) and high (10 mg, 20 mg) dose tamoxifen and stratified by menopausal status.

Sum of mean Likert score change is calculated from start to end of treatment, in symptoms significantly related to tamoxifen exposure regardless of menopausal status (hot flashes, cold sweats, night sweats, vaginal discharge, and muscle cramps). P value for difference between low and high dose within each menopausal group. Symptom severity change for each of the symptoms included can be found in Supplementary Fig. 1.

When comparing the proportion of women increasing in Likert score it could be seen that significantly fewer premenopausal women in the low-dose arm reported an increase in Likert score, regardless of the difference in score, compared to women randomised to 10 and 20 mg of tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. 2A). A finding not seen in postmenopausal women (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

Case presentation

A postmenopausal woman in her 70s, with past history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, presented with pain in the suprapubic and left iliac regions with minimal white discharge per vaginum for 6 weeks. She didn't reveal any significant previous gynaecological history. On examination, the patient was afebrile and vitals were stable. General physical examination was normal and systemic examination revealed the scar of previous sterilisation. On abdominal examination she had mild tenderness in the suprapubic region but no mass was palpable. On speculum examination, parous external os with purulent yellowish discharge was noted which was non-foul smelling. Erosion was noted in the posterior lip of the cervix. On bimanual examination the uterus was retroverted, enlarged to 8–10 weeks size, and bilateral forniceal tenderness was present.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115uU3Kh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) management — For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly, and for women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. For women without a history of hormone-(estrogen) dependent cancers whose GSM symptoms, including vulvovaginal atrophy, persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, we recommend low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer whose symptomatic GSM does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop GSM symptoms that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest adding low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, and for women using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, we suggest against adding a progestogen (ie, no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). For women using vaginal estrogen therapy who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, we recommend prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology.

### Efficacy of erbium: YAG laser treatment compared to topical estriol treatment for symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^11125N9F]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Before menopause, in the presence of endogenous estrogen levels, the vagina is characterized by a thickened rugated vaginal surface, increased vaginal blood flow, and vaginal lubrication. Estrogen is a dominant regulator of vaginal physiology, its effects including increased blood flow, improved epithelial thickness, reduced pH, and increased secretions. GSM is most commonly associated with the diminished estrogen levels that accompany spontaneous or induced menopause and aging 1. Estrogen plays an essential role in maintaining the elasticity and health of genital tissues. Declining levels of estrogen during menopause result with increased tissue fragility and higher risk of vaginal and urinary infections, irritation, dryness, urogenital pain, and vaginal tissue trauma. GSM is characterized by changes in the quantity and quality of vaginal secretions, loss of collagen, adipose‐ and water‐retaining ability. The vaginal walls become thinner, less elastic, and pale with loss of rugation; the vaginal surface becomes friable with petechiae, ulcerations, and bleeding often occurring after minimal trauma 1, 5. The prevalence of urogenital symptoms in postmenopausal women includes vaginal dryness in 29% of patients, burning or irritation in 21.3%, nocturia/pollakiuria in 16.4%, urinary incontinence in 15.2%, dyspareunia in 14%, chronic leukorrhea in 13.5%, and dysuria in 7.2% of patients 5. The goals of GSM management are to alleviate symptoms and to reverse atrophic anatomic changes. Treatment with exogenous estrogen preparations delivered either systemically or locally is the therapeutic standard for prescription therapies. Even though systemic estrogen therapy (e.g. oral, transdermal) is an effective treatment, there are some drawbacks to be considered. Women with a previous medical history of hormone‐dependent cancer must be evaluated and informed in relation to the risks/benefits 6. There is a high rate of patient abandonment of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and not all patients wish to receive HRT; many have valid concerns to its long‐term use. There is also speculation that recurrences of certain hormone‐dependent cancers are dose dependent. In the study by Von Schoultz 7, researchers established that different doses of estrogen and progesterone and treatment regimens for menopausal hormone therapy may be associated with the recurrence of breast cancer. Local estrogen preparations in the form of tablets, rings, or creams are often prescribed as they are perceived to have a low systemic absorptionand have been shown to result in significant symptomatic benefit 1, 8.

### Visual improvements in vaginal mucosa correlate with symptoms of VVA: data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114f75g4]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Clinically, a variety of objective and subjective tools are available to practitioners to determine the extent of VVA in postmenopausal women, based mostly on patient history and/or physical examination. - The most common objective measures used to assess VVA include measuring vaginal pHand vaginal maturation index (VMI). A vaginal pH ≤ 4.5 is considered normal, whereas a pH ≥ 4.6 is supportive of VVA, as long as the patient does not have bacterial vaginosis. Superficial cells above 15% on a vaginal smear is considered normal, whereas ≤ 5% is typical for postmenopausal women with VVA. Whereas VMI is the standard for VVA confirmation, it is generally not used in clinical practice, because vaginal cytological smears need to be collected and sent for analysis.

Symptoms of VVA can be subjectively assessed using patient questionnaires evaluating the severity of symptoms, such as dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, soreness, irritation, or discharge. These are reflected in quality-of-life measures. VVA can also be objectively measured with a visual examination of the vagina using assessment tools such as the Vaginal Atrophy Index (VAI), the Genital Health Clinical Evaluation (GHCE), the Vaginal Physical Examination Scale, the Vaginal Health Index (VHI), or the Global Atrophy Score. However, no clear consensus has been reached as to which tool is best when visually evaluating VVA. An accepted method of visually assessing the vagina of postmenopausal women could aid clinicians in opening dialog about VVA with their patients, accurately diagnosing VVA, and ultimately determining their patients' optimal treatment and response to treatment.

### Endometrial cancer associated symptoms: a case-control study [^111uyhtQ]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of women with endometrial cancer (EC) present at an early stage with an associated 5-year survival rate of > 90%. High rates of early detection are attributed to warning symptoms; however, the prevalence of such symptoms has not been well defined.

Methods

A case-control study was conducted assessing the prevalence of symptoms in EC patients at a large cancer center compared with healthy controls. Controls included patients seen for an annual gynecologic care visit (AV) or for a gynecological problem-based visit (PV). A self-administered questionnaire was given to all participants addressing EC-associated symptoms, at the time of initial clinic visit. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare prevalence of symptoms between EC cases and controls. Logistic regression was used to determine the impact of menopausal status and obesity on symptom prevalence.

Results

The cases (n = 75) were significantly older than the AV (n = 203) and PV (n = 151) controls (59.7 vs. 49.8 vs. 51.0 years, p < 0.01), had a higher body mass index (35.5 vs. 29.4 vs. 30.9kg/m², p < 0.01), and were more likely to be postmenopausal (76% vs. 53.7% vs. 52.0%, p < 0.01). The cases were more likely to report postmenopausal bleeding (OR = 32.99 and 5.83, p < 0.01) and abnormal vaginal discharge (OR = 8.8 and 3.3, p < 0.01) compared with the AV and PV groups. Overall, 55.4% of cases reported abnormal vaginal discharge.

Conclusions

Symptoms of both postmenopausal bleeding and abnormal vaginal discharge were significantly higher in EC compared with controls. The presence of such symptoms should raise concern for malignant disease and prompt immediate gynecological evaluation.

### Visual improvements in vaginal mucosa correlate with symptoms of VVA: data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1173khUd]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Depletion of estrogens during menopause can lead to symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) in women. VVA is a component of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), and collectively includes changes to the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra, and bladder. A review of surveys reported up to two-thirds of women have physical evidence of VVA, and approximately 50% of postmenopausal women have VVA symptoms. These symptoms may include vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, dysuria, and/or pain or bleeding with sexual activity. Symptoms of VVA are not limited to sexually active women, can range from mild to debilitating, and can negatively affect quality of life. Unfortunately, VVA is unlikely to improve over time without treatment, and if treatment is discontinued, the signs and symptoms of VVA tend to recur.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In four (4) placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trials [91% - White Caucasian non-Hispanic women, 7% - Black or African American women, and 2% - "Other" women, average age 58.8 years of age (range 40 to 80 years of age)], vaginal discharge is the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reaction in the INTRAROSA treatment group with an incidence of ≥ 2 percent and greater than reported in the placebo treatment group. There were 38 cases in 665 participating postmenopausal women (5.71 percent) in the INTRAROSA treatment group compared to 17 cases in 464 participating postmenopausal women (3.66 percent) in the placebo treatment group.

In a 52-week non-comparative clinical trial [92% - White Caucasian non-Hispanic women, 6% - Black or African American women, and 2% - "Other" women, average age 57.9 years of age (range 43 to 75 years of age)], vaginal discharge and abnormal Pap smear at 52 weeks were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reaction in women receiving INTRAROSA with an incidence of ≥ 2 percent. There were 74 cases of vaginal discharge (14.2 percent) and 11 cases of abnormal Pap smear (2.1 percent) in 521 participating postmenopausal women. The eleven (11) cases of abnormal Pap smear at 52 weeks include one (1) case of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and ten (10) cases of atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS).

### Predictors of urinary incontinence in a prospective cohort of postmenopausal women [^1117tuBj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively assess risk factors associated with occurrence of urinary incontinence among postmenopausal women.

Methods

We followed up 1,017 postmenopausal health maintenance organization enrollees, aged 55 to 75 years, for 2 years. The primary outcome measures were any urinary incontinence and severe incontinence reported at 12- or 24-month follow-up visits.

Results

Baseline prevalence of any amount or frequency of urinary incontinence in the past year was 66%. Among the 345 women without incontinence at baseline, 65 (19%) at 1 year and 66 (19%) at 2 years reported any incontinence. Ninety-two of 672 (14%) and 96 of 672 (14%) women with incontinence at baseline reported no incontinence at years 1 and 2. In an adjusted multiple logistic regression model, independent predictors of any incontinence included white race (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–2.6), vaginal estrogen cream (OR 2.0, CI 1.1–3.7), vaginal dryness (OR 1.6, CI 1.2–2.2), vaginal discharge (OR 1.5, CI 1.0–2.2), 6 or more lifetime urinary tract infections (OR 1.8, CI 1.2–2.6), and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (OR 1.7, CI 1.0–3.1). In adjusted models, predictors of severe incontinence were history of hysterectomy (OR 1.8, CI 1.1–2.7) and any vaginal symptom (OR 1.7, CI 1.0–2.8).

Conclusion

A substantial proportion of incontinence-free postmenopausal women developed urinary incontinence during 2 years of follow-up. Because vaginal symptoms are associated with urinary incontinence, their relationship with other risk factors, including vaginal Escherichia coli colonization and vaginal estrogen cream use, warrant additional study. Similarly, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and hysterectomy associations suggest areas for future investigation.

### First-time postmenopausal bleeding as a clinical marker of long-term cancer risk: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^111cdmgq]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) refers to any genital tract bleeding in postmenopausal women, other than that expected during cyclic postmenopausal hormone therapy.PMB is frequently encountered in both general and hospital settings, and accounts for ~5% of office gynaecology visits. The incidence of PMB decreases with increasing time after menopause, while the risk of an underlying malignancy increases with increasing age.

The most common causes of PMB are benign, such as vaginal atrophy or benign focal lesions. However, PMB is also the most common presenting sign of endometrial carcinoma. Approximately 5–10% of women with hospital-diagnosed PMB has an underlying endometrial cancer. – Although PMB is most commonly attributed to an intrauterine source, it may also originate from other gynaecological or non-gynaecological sources, such as the cervix, vagina, ovaries, bladder, urethra or lower gastrointestinal tract. Occasionally, PMB also occurs due to non-structural causes such as coagulopathies as seen in haematologic cancers.

While the short-term risk of underlying endometrial cancer has been studied previously, –, few studies investigated the long-term risk of gynaecological as well as the risk of non-gynaecological cancers, and these studies were limited by size (< 700 participants) and selective inclusion of patients from specific hospitals.

We therefore conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to investigate the long-term risk of cancer and the particular risks of gynaecological, urological, gastrointestinal and haematological cancers after a first-time hospital diagnosis of PMB.

### Menopausal symptoms in older women and the effects of treatment with hormone therapy [^116aNv5G]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In some women, hot flashes and other symptoms attributed to menopause persist for many years after the cessation of menses. The frequency and severity of such symptoms and response to hormone therapy in older women have not been well documented.

Methods

We used data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a blinded, clinical trial among 2763 women with documented coronary disease and a uterus who were randomized to receive either conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg in one tablet or placebo. Participants were queried at baseline and annually regarding menopausal symptoms. Breast symptoms were self-reported, and uterine bleeding was recorded on a daily diary.

Results

Symptoms associated with menopause were relatively common among Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study participants, whose average age was 67 years and who averaged 18 years since menopause. At baseline, 16% of women reported frequent hot flashes, 26% vaginal dryness, 10% genital irritation, 55% trouble sleeping, and 53% early awakening. Women assigned to hormone therapy reported less frequent hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and trouble sleeping compared with women assigned to placebo, but more frequent vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms. The reporting of breast symptoms among women in the hormone group decreased from 40% at 1 year to 13% by the 4th year. Uterine bleeding was reported by 31% and spotting by an additional 33% of women in the hormone group during the 1st year of treatment; by the 4th year, these proportions had fallen to 11% and 20%, respectively.

Conclusion

Symptoms typically attributed to menopause are common in elderly women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces hot flashes, trouble sleeping, and vaginal dryness, but at standard doses in elderly women is associated with vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^114ZUErx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Adverse effects of endocrine therapy — agent-specific profiles for prevention are outlined as follows: In postmenopausal women, anastrozole is associated with reduction in bone density, musculoskeletal symptoms (ie, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome), vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, reduced libido, hypertension, dry eyes, and alopecia; exemestane is associated with reduction in bone density, musculoskeletal symptoms (ie, arthralgia), muscle pain, vasomotor symptoms, diarrhea, fatigue, and insomnia; and raloxifene shows a lower risk of adverse effects than tamoxifen in the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, with thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular disease (ie, stroke and transient ischemic attack), vasomotor symptoms, and dyspareunia listed. For tamoxifen in pre- and postmenopausal women, adverse effects include endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events, other gynecologic conditions (endometrial hyperplasia, vaginal discharge, vaginal dryness), vasomotor symptoms, and cataracts.

### Vaginal pessary use and management for pelvic organ prolapse: developed by the joint writing group of the American Urogynecologic Society and the society of urologic nurses and associates. individual writing group members are noted in the acknowledgments section [^116tJhSY]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Q30 vaginal discharge with pessary use — although many women have vaginal discharge when using pessaries, it usually is not due to a vaginal infection; approximately 30% of women using a pessary will report bothersome vaginal discharge, and clinicians should inform patients that pessaries may cause additional vaginal discharge, which is not typically infectious and does not require treatment; if patients are significantly bothered by discharge, the clinician may consider obtaining vaginal or cervical swabs to test for infection or consider increasing the frequency of pessary removal to reduce vaginal discharge; there are several cohort studies that suggest frequent self-replacement of the pessary decreases the rate of vaginal discharge, and it is unclear if vaginal estrogen or hydroxyquinoline-based gel prevents these symptoms.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — evaluation and coexisting conditions: During evaluation, clinicians should assess for coexisting genitourinary conditions, utilizing additional testing or referral when appropriate, and for diagnosis "the patient must express bother related to these symptoms and they cannot be accounted for by another diagnosis". Blood levels of sex steroid hormones are not used to make the diagnosis; clinicians should consider other etiologies or co-occurring conditions that mimic GSM symptoms. Depending on history and examination, "additional testing may be indicated, including urinalysis with culture and sensitivity for suspected UTI and vaginal smear with culture and sensitivity for suspected vaginitis", and if there are concerns for malignancy, "an appropriate referral to gynecology/gynecologic oncology should be made".

### The vaginal microbiome: II. vaginal dysbiotic conditions [^1113euXo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

More than half of the women with diagnosable BV have no clear symptoms. Patients' perception of their vaginal symptoms varies significantly and does not necessarily correlate with signs of BV. Some women do not report symptoms; nevertheless, discharge is noted on examination by a clinician, and diagnostic criteria are present, highlighting that many women with BV may consider their discharge to be normal. These women may be asymptomatic despite the presence of BV. This may contribute to the debate regarding the definition of "normal" VMB, as was discussed in part I.

### Oestrogens for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in postmenopausal women [^1116K7UU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infection (RUTI) is defined as three episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the previous 12 months or two episodes in the last six months. The main factors associated with RUTI in postmenopausal women are vesical prolapse, cystocoele, post-voidal residue and urinary incontinence, all associated with a decrease in oestrogen. The use of oestrogens to prevent RUTI has been proposed.

Objectives

To estimate the efficacy and safety of oral or vaginal oestrogens for preventing RUTI in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles without language restriction. Date of last search: February 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which postmenopausal women (more than 12 months since last menstrual period) diagnosed with RUTI received any type of oestrogen (oral, vaginal) versus placebo or any other intervention were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors extracted data and assessed quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Nine studies (3345 women) were included. Oral oestrogens did not reduce UTI compared to placebo (4 studies, 2798 women: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33). Vaginal oestrogens versus placebo reduced the number of women with UTIs in two small studies using different application methods. The RR for one was 0.25 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.50) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.86) in the second. Two studies compared oral antibiotics versus vaginal oestrogens (cream (1), pessaries (1)). There was very significant heterogeneity and the results could not be pooled. Vaginal cream reduced the proportion of UTIs compared to antibiotics in one study and in the second study antibiotics were superior to vaginal pessaries. Adverse events for vaginal oestrogens were breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding or spotting, nonphysiologic discharge, vaginal irritation, burning and itching.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on only two studies comparing vaginal oestrogens to placebo, vaginal oestrogens reduced the number of UTIs in postmenopausal women with RUTI, however this varied according to the type of oestrogen used and the treatment duration.

### Vulvovaginal discomfort is common in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women [^114YiyCH]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We surveyed women from a primary care population to assess the prevalence of unreported vulvovaginal symptoms.

Materials and Methods

A random sample of women aged 18 to 84 years without a diagnosis of vulvovaginitis or vulvodynia in the past year were surveyed anonymously about prevalence and severity of vulvar and vaginal symptoms of itching, burning, irritation, vaginal discharge, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal pain in the past month. Women reporting at least 1 moderate-severe symptom were considered symptomatic. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between women with and without symptoms using Pearson's χ and Student's t test.

Results

Of 1,676 mailed surveys, 272 (16.2%) were returned. Respondents were primarily non-Hispanic (254, 93.4%), White (214, 78.7%), and English speaking (267, 98.2%). More than a third of women (107, 39.3%) reported 1 or more moderate-severe symptoms. Symptomatic women were younger (49 ± 14 years vs 54 ± 15 years, p = .004) and more likely to report a history of asthma (22% vs 12%, p = .028), eczema or seasonal allergies (56% vs 40%, p = .011), or a previous diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis or yeast (36% vs 15%, p < .001) than asymptomatic women. Premenopausal versus postmenopausal women reported similar prevalence of moderate-severe symptoms: 57/136 (42%) vs 50/136 (37%), respectively (p = .39). Symptoms frequently or always interfered with both interest in sex (33/107, 31%) and ability to have sex (32/107, 30%).

Conclusions

This study suggests that moderate-severe vulvovaginal symptoms are prevalent in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women and that these symptoms have a significant impact on sexual health.

### Primary fallopian tube carcinoma: review of MR imaging findings [^116EsZKG]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

The aetiology of this type of tumour has not been completely explained. Hormonal, reproductive, and genetic factors may play a role, along with the presence of chronic inflammation of the pelvis.

PFTC may have a constellation of characteristic symptoms, namely colicky abdominal or pelvic pain and adnexal mass, relieved by intermittent, profuse, serosanguineous vaginal discharge, which constitute Laztko's triad (seen in only 15% of patients). Hydrops tubae profluens is a syndrome characterized by the relief of pain and shrinkage of the abdominal or pelvic mass by a vaginal discharge, which is caused by filling and emptying of a sub-occluded fallopian tube (seen in only 5% of patients). Typical symptoms, however, occur in only a minority of patients with PFTC, and most women present with less specific symptoms at the time of diagnosis. The age of presentation is commonly between 40 and 60 years, with a mean age of 55 years. The pre-operative diagnosis of PFTC is rarely performed, with clinical signs and symptoms pointing towards the more frequently occurring ovarian cancer or pelvic inflammatory disease. Tumour markers, particularly CA-125, have no role in the diagnosis of PFTC. Elevated CA-125 levels are, nevertheless, indicative of poor prognosis, and can be used during follow-up, as a marker of disease recurrence.

PFTC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with postmenopausal bleeding with negative diagnostic curettage, cervical smear with intermittent suspicious abnormalities, and unexplained persistent vaginal discharge.

### Phenomenology, disability and sexual functioning in female dhat syndrome: a study of tertiary care gynaecology outpatients [^111Rcyk1]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dhat, a word derived from the Sanskrit language, refers to a bodily produced 'elixir' considered essential to life as it guarantees health and longevity. It is related to a well-established, culture-bound syndrome found on the Indian subcontinent known as male Dhat syndrome, a clinical condition related to semen loss in urine. However, Dhat syndrome in females is lesser known and has rarely been described as a separate clinical condition. Some researchers and clinicians have discussed a female equivalent of male Dhat syndrome. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) includes Dhat syndrome under 'Other specified neurotic disorder'. It is defined as an undue concern about the debilitating effects of the passage of semen. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) includes Dhat syndrome under the appendix as a 'Glossary of cultural concepts of distress '.

Vaginal discharge is a common reason for seeking consultation in outpatient departments (OPD) in India. Females with the condition can be excessively concerned and preoccupied with it and report various medically unexplainable bodily symptoms. Vaginal discharge is physiological and subject to hormonal variations. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone levels can alter the consistency and composition of the discharge. Because the quality and quantity of vaginal discharge vary during the ovulatory and menstrual cycles throughout a woman's life, defining normality for the amount of vaginal discharge is difficult. Thus, some women may perceive a normal physiological vaginal discharge as abnormal. Women presenting in OPDs with a whitish vaginal discharge often have multiple vague-associated symptoms. Of note, numerous false beliefs are prevalent among Asian women regarding the cause and effect of this vaginal discharge. For example, one of these beliefs is stated, '100 drops of blood are required to make a single drop of safed pani'. Various physical symptoms are believed to be caused by the loss of this genital secretion.

Low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy (ET) — risk profile and adverse events: Because serum estradiol levels during therapy usually fall within the normal postmenopausal range, the risk profile with low-dose vaginal ET is expected to be lower than with systemic ET; however, long-term endometrial safety data are lacking and 1 year is the maximum duration of randomized controlled trials of vaginal ET; side effects include vulvovaginal candidiasis and, with higher dosing and systemic absorption, vaginal bleeding and breast pain; increased CVD or VTE risk has not been reported; and available evidence does not support the boxed warning regarding increased risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, dementia, and breast cancer.

### Predicting the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding: the norwich DEFAB risk assessment tool [^116V6iWm]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal bleeding refers to any genital tract bleeding in a postmenopausal woman, other than the expected bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. Approximately 10% (range 1–25%) of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding will be diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial atrophy is the most common cause of genital tract bleeding among postmenopausal women. Endometrial hyperplasia and polyps are also common causes.

Two different forms of endometrial carcinoma have been identified. Type-I cancers have an endometrioid histology and account for 70–80% of endometrial carcinomas. They are associated with unopposed oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium and tend to arise in women with obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and other hyper-oestrogenic conditions. Type-II cancers have a non-endometrioid histology and arise in women who are less likely to have the clinical associations seen in type-I cancers. Several risk factors such as obesity, tamoxifen use, increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, and unopposed use of exogenous oestrogens are strongly associated with increased risk of type-I endometrial cancer. Early menarche and late menopause have also been implicated due to prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium. Nulliparity as an isolated risk factor does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer, although due to the high frequency of anovulatory cycles there may be an association in women with subfertility. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is a significant but rare risk factor, with descendants of an affected family member carrying a theoretical 50% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer.

Currently, controversy exists as to whether transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy should be used as the initial diagnostic step for clinical evaluation of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. In addition, decisions made about the most appropriate investigations that need to be performed, are not always guided by clinical history. The few studies that attempt to include information gained from clinical history to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma are too small to develop a predictive model.

The aim of our study was to use routinely collected clinical data from history and ultrasound evaluation of the endometrium to develop an algorithm to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma in women presenting to secondary care with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.

### Climacteric complaints in the community [^1164vViQ]. Family Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Background

At the onset of the climacteric, healthy middle-aged women present with a variety of complaints, especially in general practice. In these first years of entering the menopause, vaginal blood loss alters from irregular periods to complete amenorrhoea. According to these different menstrual patterns, we can distinguish a pre-, peri- and postmenopausal phase. It could be useful to know whether specific climacteric complaints are related to these different phases.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between climacteric complaints and the menstrual pattern during the menopausal transition in a population-based cross-sectional survey of healthy middle-aged women.

Methods

All women aged 47–54 years, living in the city of Eindhoven, were invited to participate in the Eindhoven Osteoporosis Study (EPOS); 6648 (78%) agreed to participate. All women completed a questionnaire concerning climacteric complaints. Climacteric status was defined by menstrual history. Odds ratios (ORs) were obtained for the relationship between climacteric status and climacteric complaints. Multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out, with climacteric status as the dependent variable.

Results

Of the 27 items in the questionnaire concerning climacteric complaints, seven were significantly different between all three climacteric phases (P: < 0.1). After multiple logistic regression analysis, comparing peri- and premenopause, only flushing (OR 5.9) was significantly different. Between post- and perimenopause, seven symptoms appeared to be different: three urogenital complaints [vaginal dryness (OR 1.6), vaginal discharge (OR 0.4) and pain during intercourse (OR 1.9)], three vasomotor symptoms [daytime sweating (OR 1.4), night-time sweating (OR 0.7) and flushing (OR 1.9)] and, finally, insomnia (OR 1.3). When comparing post- and premenopause, flushing (OR 13.4), insomnia (OR 2.1) and depressed mood (OR 0.6) were significantly different, in addition to three urogenital symptoms: vaginal dryness (OR 2.6), vaginal discharge (OR 0.3) and pain during intercourse (OR 2.1).

Conclusion

The major findings of the study are that flushing is strongly associated with the transition from pre- to perimenopause, while urogenital complaints, daytime sweating and insomnia are more prominent in the transition from peri- to postmenopause.

### Primary invasive carcinoma of the vagina after Le fort partial colpocleisis for stage IV pelvic organ prolapse: a case report [^117Av8h9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We present here the case report of a postmenopausal woman who complained of recurrent pus-like vaginal discharge and perianal pain 1 year after Le Fort colpocleisis, which was subsequently identified as a primary invasive carcinoma of the vagina. Biopsy confirmed a squamous cell carcinoma in the vagina, and the disease was classified as stage III according to FIGO staging. The patient received pelvic radiotherapy. This case emphasizes that differential diagnosis of recurrent vaginal discharge that presents remote from obliterative procedure for pelvic organ prolapse should consider not only pyometra, but also other causes.

Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause — vaginal moisturizers: 5.1a For postmenopausal women with symptoms of VVA, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly. (2|⊕⊕○○) Vaginal moisturizers, when used regularly (at least twice weekly), may provide an effective nonhormonal approach to alleviating symptoms of vaginal atrophy, but studies have been small, mostly open-labeled, and limited to 12 weeks. Although helpful, these approaches are not likely as effective as vaginal ET. Vaginal moisturizers have not been shown to reduce urinary tract symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria, and use of a vaginal moisturizer may not eliminate the need for a vaginal lubricant during intercourse.

A 22-year-old woman presented with amenorrhoea, lower abdominal pain and brown vaginal discharge. She was noted to be in hypovolaemic shock with a distended and peritonitic abdomen. On bimanual examination, the uterus was not palpated, the posterior fornix was full and cervical excitation was present. A clinical diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was made. She was resuscitated and an emergency laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, a ruptured rudimentary horn with an ex utero pregnancy was discovered. The right horn and tube were removed, as was the non-viable fetus. There were no postoperative complications and the patient was discharged after 5 days of observation.

### Prognosis and treatment of desquamative inflammatory vaginitis [^112JDRkq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is a clinical syndrome frequently unrecognized, characterized by vaginal rash and purulent discharge. We describe patient outcomes and treatment at follow-up in a case series of 98 women diagnosed with this syndrome.

Methods

We performed a chart review of 130 patients diagnosed with desquamative inflammatory vaginitis between 1996 and 2007 in a referral university-based vaginitis clinic. Clinical findings, laboratory findings, and treatment were documented during the first 12 months and at 2 and 4 years.

Results

Of the 98 patients reviewed, 97 were white; mean age was 48.6 years (plus or minus 10.2 years), and 50% were postmenopausal. All patients were symptomatic with vaginal inflammation and 72% had vestibular findings. Treatment with topical 2% clindamycin (54%) or 10% hydrocortisone (46%) dramatically relieved symptoms within 3 weeks (median) in 86% of patients. Treatment was discontinued (median 8 weeks) in 53 patients experiencing clinical remission accompanied by normal wet mount appearance; however, 17 (32%) relapsed within 6 weeks. At 1 year, cure was achieved in 25 patients (26%), 57 (58%) were asymptomatic but remained dependent on maintenance treatment, and 16 (16%) were partially controlled only. A favorable initial response to therapy was associated with positive clinical prognosis by 20 weeks of follow-up (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is a chronic inflammatory process involving both vagina and vestibule, occurring almost exclusively in white women, that responds well to topical anti-inflammatory therapy, although long-term maintenance therapy frequently is required.

### The REJOICE trial: a phase 3 randomized, controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel vaginal estradiol soft-gel capsule for symptomatic vulvar and vaginal atrophy [^1126WZ1m]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The low doses of this novel vaginal estradiol soft-gel capsule, TX-004HR, were well-tolerated. Indeed, the four most commonly reported TEAEs, including vaginal discharge and vulvovaginal pruritus, were experienced by fewer women in any TX-004HR group than in the placebo group, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. By comparison, in a 12-week study of the efficacy of ospemifene, vaginal discharge was reported more than six times more frequently in the ospemifene group than in the placebo group. Genital pruritus was also reported four times more frequently in women treated with Vagifem 10-μg tablets than with placebo in a 12-month randomized study. Importantly, endometrial findings after TX-004HR were benign as no hyperplasia or malignancies were reported in biopsies at 12 weeks.

One of the limitations of this study was the narrowly defined inclusion criteria. Additionally, women were required to have identified moderate-to-severe dyspareunia as their MBS; however, it is well-known that most women with moderate-to-severe dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal VVA also suffer from multiple other vulvar and vaginal symptoms. The concept of the MBS has been referred to as a false construct that may not provide a full clinical evaluation of a product's efficacy. Another limitation of this study is that women were mostly white, in good health, and had an average BMI of 26.7 kg/m², and thus, may not be representative of the US population of postmenopausal women with VVA.

### Emphysematous vaginitis [^1177xdgm]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysematous vaginitis is a rare condition, characterized by the presence of multiple gas-filled cysts in the vaginal and/or exocervical mucosa. Although its etiology is not completely understood, it is self-limited, with a benign clinical course. Vaginal discharge, sometimes bloody, and pruritus are the most common symptoms. Chronic and acute inflammation can be found, and diseases that impair the immune system and pregnancy have been associated with this condition.

Case Report

A 48-year-old postmenopausal woman, with a history of hysterectomy with several comorbidities, presented with a 4-month history of bloody discharge and vulvar pruritus. Examination showed multiple cystic lesions, 1 to 5 mm, occupying the posterior and right lateral vaginal walls. Speculum examination produced crepitus. Vaginal wet mount was normal, except for diminished lactobacilli; results of Trichomonas vaginalis DNA test and vaginal cultures were negative. Lugol's iodine applied to the vagina was taken up by the intact lesions. Biopsy result showed typical features of emphysematous vaginitis.

Conclusions

This is an unusual entity, presenting with common gynecological complaints, and both physicians and pathologists should be aware to prevent misdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113gaxsD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) and tibolone — efficacy, harms, and candidate selection in postmenopausal osteoporosis are detailed as follows. Estrogen therapy reduces fractures (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89), including a 29% reduction in hip fractures (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) and a 21% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.90). Tibolone shows a 44% reduction in vertebral fractures (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.74) and a 27% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), but side effects limit use, including stroke (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.23), vaginal discharge, and bleeding; benefits include lower risks of breast cancer (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.80) and colon cancer (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.96), and patients taking tibolone have fewer falls. The risk of venous thromboembolic disease may be lower with transdermal rather than oral estrogen, and there was increased recurrence of breast cancer with tibolone in women with previous breast cancer in LIBERATE. For candidate selection, there is a recommendation to select women < 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause, and if menopausal HT is prescribed for osteoporosis and it is stopped, alternative treatments for osteoporosis should be given.

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^114PMNCc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal symptoms account for more than 10 million physician visits in the United States annually, making them a leading cause of medical consultations among women. Since vaginal symptoms such as vaginal discharge, odour, itching and burning can be indicative of a variety of bacterial or fungal infections for which pharmacological treatment is pathogen-specific, accurately identifying the cause of presenting symptoms is crucial in the clinical assessment process. The clinical and laboratory methods commonly used to detect pathogens responsible for vaginal symptoms in women include a visual assessment of vaginal discharge by the treating physician, wet prep microscopy, urine culture or the collection of vaginal swabs for subsequent molecular testing; each method has its own benefits and drawbacks in terms of results turnaround time, accuracy, costs, and availability.

Determining symptom aetiology based on a clinical workup is notoriously inaccurate given the difficulty with microscopy (which is no longer available in many settings), the lack of specificity of the appearance of discharge and the high frequency of co-infections. Clinical diagnosis has also been hampered by SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic as many patients, even those with symptoms, were not undergoing full pelvic examinations with visualisation of the cervix. This rendered the already difficult task of separating vaginitis from cervicitis as a cause of discharge nearly impossible. Given these challenges, laboratory diagnostics are needed to fully understand the pathogens that may be present in these patients.

### Phenomenology, disability and sexual functioning in female dhat syndrome: a study of tertiary care gynaecology outpatients [^112DDHMt]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Procedure

The first two consecutive patients who presented with complaints of vaginal discharge in the gynaecology OPD on the specified days were initially evaluated and clinically examined by a gynaecologist. This was purposefully done to minimise the selection biases. Relevant investigations were done to rule out any organic pathology. Patients without abnormal investigation reports and no other contributory medical causes were referred to the research investigator, who screened and evaluated them for FDS. The operational criteria we used for this diagnosis in our studies included: (1) presentation with non-pathological vaginal discharge, (2) reports of distress due to the passing of this vaginal discharge, and (3) attribution of other symptoms due to the loss of vaginal fluids. Other inclusion criteria were ages between 18 and 45 years and those giving valid informed consent. Exclusion criteria were less than 18 years of age, not meeting the operational criteria, failure to give consent, postmenopausal or menstrual irregularities. All patients with medical conditions that could confuse the diagnosis were also excluded.

A semistructured evaluation of the included patients' sociodemographic and menstrual and sexual history details was carried out, and the DSM-5 was used to diagnose psychiatric illnesses. The subjects were assessed with the Scale for Assessment of Female Dhat Syndrome (SAFeD)to explore the phenomenology of vaginal discharge. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered to rate anxiety and depression. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)was used to assess the stress perceived in the past month, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 (WHO-DAS 2.0)was applied to determine disability. The DSM-5 Level 2-Somatic Symptom-Adult Patient (adapted from the Patient Health Questionnaire Physical Symptoms (PHQ-15)was used to rate the severity of somatic symptoms. Sexual functioning was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for women who had had sexual intercourse in the past month. All scales were administered by a trained mental health professional. The relationship between the duration of vaginal discharge, the severity of perceived stress and somatic symptoms, and the disability summary scores were analysed using Spearman's correlation.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^116q9w68]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a cardinal symptom of carcinoma of the endometrium or cervix but not one of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical awareness of this unusual mode of presentation is important.

Case

We report a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a 60-year-old woman, who presented primarily with postmenopausal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a "thickened" area on the posterior vaginal wall. Repeated vaginal biopsies showed fibrosis and inflammatory tissue only. Immunohistochemistry revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges such a complex case presents.

Conclusion

This case not only represents a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with genital involvement but also highlights the importance of diagnosis and management of such complex cases.

Aromatase inhibitor versus selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) comparisons for prevention in postmenopausal women indicate that there is no primary prevention trial comparing tamoxifen to the aromatase inhibitors, and in women with DCIS there was no difference in breast cancer incidence in a randomized trial of tamoxifen versus anastrozole; adverse effect profiles differed, with a higher incidence of osteoporosis, fractures, joint stiffness, carpal tunnel syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, stroke, and vaginal dryness with anastrozole versus tamoxifen, but a higher incidence of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, and vaginal discharge with tamoxifen than with anastrozole, and about half the women in both groups had vasomotor symptoms, which were slightly more frequent with tamoxifen.

### Premenarchal vaginal discharge: findings of procedures to rule out foreign bodies [^111n8NXK]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Vaginal discharge in children is a common gynecologic complaint and may be resistant to symptomatic and/or antibiotic treatment. In recurrent or unresponsive patients, an evaluation to rule out a foreign body is traditionally recommended. The objective of this study is to review cases of vaginal discharge referred to our institution and assess outcome and diagnosis in those who required irrigation or vaginoscopy to rule out a foreign body. A retrospective chart review was performed on all premenarchal girls identified through the University of Michigan Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Clinic database who were seen for evaluation of vaginal discharge between June 1996 and December 2001. The records were reviewed for age, length of time of discharge, aspects of discharge, procedures done to rule out foreign bodies, and findings of such procedures.

Setting

The study was performed in a tertiary care university hospital.

Participants

Forty-one premenarchal girls were evaluated for vaginal discharge. The average age was 6.0 yr (range 3 months-11 yr).

Results

The average duration of vaginal discharge prior to presentation was 13.7 months (range 1–42 months). Of the 41 girls, 18 girls underwent 1 procedure each, 2 girls underwent 2 procedures each, and 1 girl underwent 5 procedures. Ten vaginal irrigations in clinic were performed in 7 girls, 3 by the referring physician and 7 by us. These irrigations removed a foreign body (tissue paper) in 4 of 10 (40%) cases, 3 at our institution and 1 at an outside institution. In the three irrigation cases with foreign bodies performed at our institution, the foreign body was visible on genital examination prior to the irrigation. Seventeen vaginoscopies under anesthesia were performed in 16 girls, 5 by the referring physician and 12 by us. In the girls who underwent a vaginoscopy under anesthesia a foreign body was found in 3 of 17 (17.6%). The other findings of the vaginoscopies included: biopsy-proven severe dermatitis with no infection in 1 patient, lymphatic duct chylous drainage in 1 patient, nonspecific vulvovaginitis in 11 patients, and normal exam with eventual diagnosis of malingering in 1 patient. In all cases where a foreign body was identified, the patient presented with bloody or brown discharge.

Conclusions

Foreign bodies as a cause of persistent vaginal discharge in a tertiary care referral clinic were identified in 4 of 41 girls (9.8%) and 7 of 27 procedures (25.9%). One child had recurrent foreign bodies removed during 4 of 5 procedures for discharge. In children with persistent vaginal discharge, vaginal irrigation was feasible in older children (average age 7.7 yr). However, no foreign bodies were removed by irrigation that had not already been visually identified prior to the procedure. Exam under anesthesia and vaginoscopy allowed the identification of foreign bodies, and it facilitated the diagnosis of other unusual conditions.

### Long-term endometrial effects in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer participating in the intergroup exemestane study (IES) – a randomised controlled trial of exemestane versus continued tamoxifen after 2–3 years tamoxifen [^116dfHru]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

introduction

Tamoxifen, for many years the 'gold-standard' endocrine treatment of breast cancer, is associated with an increased incidence of uterine abnormalities such as endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, cysts and fibroids and an increased risk of uterine cancer and sarcoma. These effects are thought to be related to the agonistic pathway elicited by tamoxifen on uterine estrogen receptors.

Data from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview indicate that the incidence of uterine cancer in patients with primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant tamoxifen is increased by a factor of ∼3 (1.9 versus 0.6 per 1000 per year). Although the absolute risk of endometrial cancer in patients under tamoxifen is low, screening programmes using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) have been proposed. In postmenopausal women, an endometrial lining measuring < 5 mm is considered an accurate cut-off in excluding endometrial disease. Abnormal endometrial thickness (ET) i.e. ≥ 5 mm occurs in 8% of asymptomatic postmenopausal women but has been reported in up to 85% of asymptomatic postmenopausal breast cancer patients on tamoxifen. Following tamoxifen discontinuation, ET tends to decrease but in some patients abnormal thickness may be long lasting; two follow-up studies have reported abnormal thickness in 45% and 42% of patients after 12 and 30 months, respectively, from withdrawal of tamoxifen.

The relationship between ET and the presence of endometrial pathological abnormality varies, but most investigators agree that endometrial thickening has low specificity and low positive predictive value for histological abnormalities in tamoxifen-treated patients. This effect is mainly due to tamoxifen-induced subepithelial stromal proliferation, entrapping gland lumens leading to cystic changes. This anatomical condition mimics endometrial hyperplasia at ultrasound, while the epithelium remains normal or atrophic in the majority of cases. Such false-positive results, in a population known to be at risk for uterine cancer, may generate stress and anxiety among patients and clinicians and lead to unnecessary invasive procedures. Based on the limited availability of efficacious or cost-effective diagnostic tests, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends routine yearly gynaecological examination with further evaluation limited to patients presenting with bleeding or vaginal discharge. Despite this, active surveillance for endometrial pathological abnormalities is commonly practised among tamoxifen users.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 pilot trial evaluating a novel, vaginal softgel capsule containing solubilized estradiol [^111p7BjF]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Study participants

Postmenopausal women (40–75 y of age) were enrolled if they had a body mass index less than or equal to 34 kg/m²; less than or equal to 5% superficial cells on vaginal smear cytology; a vaginal pH more than 5.0; an E₂ level less than or equal to 50 pg/mL; and at least one of the following symptoms of VVA with a moderate-to-severe severity score: vaginal dryness, vaginal pain associated with sexual activity, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, or vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity.

Women were excluded if they had a current or prior medical condition considered clinically significant, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, or a current vaginal infection requiring treatment; had a contraindication to estrogen therapy (ET) or an allergy to E₂; smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day; or had substance abuse in the past year. Participants could not have taken any prescription or over-the-counter drug that might interact with E₂ therapy within 28 days of screening, or used progestogen implants, vaginal or injectable ET, or vaginal or injectable estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) within the past 3 months; transdermal ET or EPT or ET lotions or gels within the past 8 weeks; or estrogen pellets or injectable progestogen therapy within the past 6 months.

Study endpoints

Efficacy endpoints were based on the FDA's Guidance, and included change from baseline (screening) to day 15 in the percentage of parabasal vaginal cells, percentage of superficial vaginal cells, and percentage of intermediate vaginal cells; in vaginal pH; and change from baseline (randomization) to day 15 in self-assessed severity of most bothersome VVA symptom (MBS). The range of MBS severity scores was 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Endpoints also included change from baseline to day 15 in investigator assessment of the vaginal mucosa (secretions, epithelial integrity, epithelial surface thickness, and color). The severity scale ranged from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no atrophy and 3 indicating severe atrophy.

Safety endpoints included changes in vital signs, weight, results of a physical examination (including breast and pelvic examination), and AEs.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^115qwheY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasomotor and vaginal symptoms are cardinal symptoms of menopause. Vasomotor symptoms can be particularly troubling to women and are the most commonly reported menopausal symptoms, with a reported prevalence of 50–82% among U.S. women who experience natural menopause (1, 2). The occurrence of vasomotor symptoms increases during the transition to menopause and peaks approximately 1 year after the final menstrual period (3–5). The purpose of this document is to provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of vasomotor and vaginal symptoms related to natural and surgical menopause.

Postmenopausal bleeding triggers urgent investigation by sequential invasive tests that are avoidable for the 90–95% of women who do not have endometrial cancer. A simple, non-invasive tool that accurately identifies cancer and safely reassures healthy women could transform patient care. Here we report, in a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study of 103 women with known cancer and 113 with unexplained postmenopausal bleeding, that urine and vaginal cytology has a combined sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI 85.0%, 96.1%) and specificity of 88.8% (81.2%, 94.1%) for gynecological cancer detection. Cytology identifies 91 endometrial, two fallopian tube and one cervical cancer from 103 known cancer cases. In women with unexplained postmenopausal bleeding, cytology identifies all four endometrial cancers and three others (cervical, ovarian and bladder), for a 12/107 (11.2%) false positive rate. We show proof-of-principle that endometrial cancer can be detected in urine and vaginal fluid. Prospective validation of these findings will support incorporation of this non-invasive test into clinical practice.

Approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women experience symptoms associated with GSM, and additional at-risk groups include individuals experiencing menopause between ages 40 and 45 years, patients with primary ovarian insufficiency characterized by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in women younger than age 40 years, women using medications such as oral contraceptives or chemotherapeutic agents that may cause GSM symptoms, and surgically menopausal patients; women at any age may have low estrogen levels due to genetic, autoimmune, or other acquired conditions leading to GSM symptoms. GSM may be screened through a focused history and review of genitourinary symptoms, and clinical genital-tract symptoms can include vulvar, vestibular and vaginal dryness; irritation; discomfort and/or burning; introital stenosis causing insertional dyspareunia and pain; spontaneous bleeding; and fissuring during intercourse, which could lead to postcoital bleeding.

Identification of side effects associated with tamoxifen and influence of menopausal status on tamoxifen-associated side effects

Five symptoms ('hot flashes', 'cold sweats', 'night sweats', 'vaginal discharge' and 'muscle cramps') were found to have a significant change from start to the end of treatment in both pre- and postmenopausal women when contrasting the effect of 20 mg tamoxifen compared to women on placebo. These symptoms also demonstrated the largest magnitude in mean change of Likert score (Table 2).

'Skin rashes' and a negative mean change in 'sensitive/tender breasts' showed a significant association with tamoxifen in premenopausal women only while 'vaginal itching/irritation' and 'lost interest in sex' were significant in postmenopausal women (Table 2). Both pre- and postmenopausal women in the tamoxifen arm reported problems with muscle cramps. However, postmenopausal women had significantly higher differences from start to end compared to premenopausal, with a doubled magnitude of mean change of severity score. Premenopausal women reported higher severity of vaginal dryness in contrast to postmenopausal women (Table 2).

Premenopausal women treated with 20 mg tamoxifen experienced significantly reduced waist circumference, weight and BMI (Table 3). No significant changes in anthropometric measures related to tamoxifen were seen in postmenopausal women.

### Vulvovaginal symptoms prevalence in postmenopausal women and relationship to other menopausal symptoms and pelvic floor disorders [^1167SAcp]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to use the Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire (VSQ) to estimate the prevalence and examine the emotional, lifestyle, and sexual impact of vulvovaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women.

Methods

We administered the VSQ, a previous validated instrument to 358 postmenopausal women recruited from primary care physician offices and local senior centers. The first seven questions of the VSQ comprise the symptom subscale (itching, burning, hurting, irritation, dryness, discharge, and odor). Women who answered "Yes" to any of the first seven symptom questions were considered to have vulvovaginal symptoms.

Results

Two hundred seventy-nine women were recruited from primary care offices and 79 women were recruited from senior centers. One hundred eighty-three postmenopausal women (51.1%; 95% CI 45.9%, 56.3%) reported at least one vulvovaginal symptom. The most common symptom was being dry 35.8% (n/N = 128/358). Ten percent of women (n/N = 38/358) reported five or more symptoms and 6% of women reported all seven symptoms in the last week. For women reporting one or more vulvovaginal symptoms, 40.4% (n/N = 74/183) reported emotional impact (Yes to ≥ 1 out of 4 emotional impact subscale items) and 32.8% (n/N = 60/183) reported lifestyle impact (Yes to ≥ 1 out of 5 lifestyle impact subscale items) from these symptoms. For sexually active women reporting vulvovaginal symptoms, 75.3% (n/N = 67/89) reported sexual impact (Yes to ≥ 1 out of 4 sexual impact subscale items). Vulvovaginal symptoms were associated with increased co-occurrence of specific pelvic floor disorders, including pelvic organ prolapse (P = 0.001), anal incontinence to solid stool (P = 0.001), urinary frequency (P = 0.02), urgency urinary incontinence (P = 0.001), and dysuria (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Vulvovaginal symptoms are common and present in over 50% of postmenopausal women. Sizeable proportions of women with vulvovaginal symptoms report emotional, lifestyle, and sexual impact from these symptoms.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^114UaexW]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) — mechanism, populations, and adverse effects are summarized as follows: SERMs act as estrogen agonists or antagonists depending on the target tissue; tamoxifen has been used to prevent and treat hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women and in men, whereas raloxifene reduces the risk of HR+ breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women but is not used to treat patients already diagnosed with HR+ breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene competitively inhibit estradiol by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER); both exert an antiestrogenic effect on breast tissue and an estrogenic effect on the skeletal system, with tamoxifen, but not raloxifene, an estrogen agonist in the uterus. Both lower cholesterol and increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE); a family history of VTE is not a contraindication to SERM use, but SERMs should be used cautiously in those with a personal or family history suggestive of a coagulopathy. Frequent side effects include vasomotor symptoms (VMS), increased vaginal discharge, arthralgias and myalgias, and peripheral edema.

### Vaginitis [^1139Lyf3]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis are the most common infectious causes of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the normal lactobacilli of the vagina are replaced by mostly anaerobic bacteria. Diagnosis is commonly made using the Amsel criteria, which include vaginal pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, milky discharge, and the presence of clue cells on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid. Oral and topical clindamycin and metronidazole are equally effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis. Symptoms and signs of trichomoniasis are not specific; diagnosis by microscopy is more reliable. Features of trichomoniasis are trichomonads seen microscopically in saline, more leukocytes than epithelial cells, positive whiff test, and vaginal pH greater than 5.4. Any nitroimidazole drug (e.g., metronidazole) given orally as a single dose or over a longer period resolves 90 percent of trichomoniasis cases. Sex partners should be treated simultaneously. Most patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis are diagnosed by the presence of vulvar inflammation plus vaginal discharge or with microscopic examination of vaginal secretions in 10 percent potassium hydroxide solution. Vaginal pH is usually normal (4.0 to 4.5). Vulvovaginal candidiasis should be treated with one of many topical or oral antifungals, which appear to be equally effective. Rapid point-of-care tests are available to aid in accurate diagnosis of infectious vaginitis. Atrophic vaginitis, a form of vaginitis caused by estrogen deficiency, produces symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, discharge, and dyspareunia. Both systemic and topical estrogen treatments are effective. Allergic and irritant contact forms of vaginitis can also occur.

Clinical presentation

Cervical cancer is an increasingly rare cancer in the United Kingdom because of the success of the National Screening Programme. It is much less likely to occur in previously screened women than unscreened women and although it most commonly presents with clinical symptoms, it may be identified during the investigation of a screening cytology abnormality, that is, by colposcopy. When it presents clinically, this usually involves abnormal patterns of vaginal bleeding in premenopausal women or postmenopausal bleeding in older women. There may also be an unpleasant vaginal discharge. When the cancer is more advanced it may present with low abdominal or buttock pain due to pressure on the lumbosacral nerve plexus.

### Frequency and determinants of urogenital symptoms in postmenopausal islamic women [^111XwVoW]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of genitourinary symptoms and their relationships with several factors in a large cohort of postmenopausal women in Turkey.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study to review genitourinary complaints among 1,328 postmenopausal women; 1,071 of these women were enrolled in the study. They were questioned about their vaginal and urinary symptoms, and the relationships between these symptoms and their demographic characteristics were evaluated.

Results

The most common vaginal and urinary symptoms were dryness (n = 358; 33.4%) and nocturia (n = 421; 39.3%), respectively. Cigarette smoking and regular exercise were not associated with any vaginal symptoms (P > 0.05), with the exception of an association between regular exercise and vaginal dryness (P = 0.026). Nocturia was more common in women older than 60 years (P = 0.001) and in obese women (P = 0.013). Based on multiple binary logistic regression analysis, lower educational status (primary school vs secondary school or higher) and higher parity were the factors most significantly associated with the appearance of at least three vaginal symptoms. Lower educational status was associated with vaginal pain (P = 0.002; odds ratio [OR], 1.75), itching (P < 0.001; OR, 1.23), and discharge (P = 0.011; OR, 1.46). Higher parity was associated with vaginal itching (P < 0.001; OR, 1.23), discharge (P = 0.07; OR, 1.18), and burning (P = 0.012; OR, 1.16). Body mass index (BMI) was the only factor that was significantly associated with the appearance of at least three urinary symptoms, with each one-unit increase in BMI increasing the risk of urgency (P < 0.001; OR, 1.06), nocturia (P < 0.001; OR, 1.06), and frequency (P = 0.009; OR, 1.04).

Conclusions

We identify associations between the frequency of genitourinary complaints and educational status, parity, and BMI. There is no association between regular exercise and urogenital symptoms. However, prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effects of regular exercise on urogenital symptoms. When examining postmenopausal women with risk factors for urinary and vaginal symptoms, clinicians should evaluate these symptoms more thoroughly to facilitate earlier treatment.

### Effects of intravaginal conjugated oestrogen on pessary continuation for pelvic organ prolapse: multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial [^115f1fjo]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), characterised by the descent of pelvic organs into or past the vaginal introitus, affects millions of postmenopausal women. The condition causes urinary, bowel, and sexual symptoms that can reduce quality of life. The reported prevalence varies, ranging from 3% to 50%. In China, the prevalence of symptomatic POP in postmenopausal women is about 15% and the rate increases with age. It has been estimated by 2050, with population ageing, the number of women affected by POP will increase by 45% in the United States.

Pessary treatment is commonly recommended for patients with symptomatic POP. However, in previous studies, 24–49% of women discontinued pessary use within 12–24 months because of adverse events such as excessive discharge, discomfort, and vaginal ulcers. Vaginal atrophy might increase the risk of adverse events associated with pessary use. Oestrogen has been shown to alleviate genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and it is used as a routine treatment for vaginal ulcers. A recent clinical consensus statement from the US suggested vaginal oestrogen might be considered for women who wish to optimise their long term use of a pessary. A Cochrane review published in 2023 identified three randomised controlled trials that assessed oestrogen treatment in conjunction with vaginal pessaries versus vaginal pessaries alone. None of these studies examined patient reported subjective improvement of POP symptoms, and they only reported reduction in minor adverse vaginal events including bacterial vaginosis and vaginal ulcers. Additionally, they were small studies (with 216 patients in total) and had methodological issues including blinding. Therefore, there is a need for studies with sufficient power to assess the effects of oestrogen on pessary use over a longer time frame. To address the evidence gap, we conducted a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to compare the efficacy of intravaginal oestrogen cream versus placebo cream in the pessary treatment outcomes for POP.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome symptom [^11642CDG]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Assessments

Vaginal dryness severity was determined by a self-assessment 4-point scale: 0 = none (symptom is not present); 1 = mild (symptom is present but may be intermittent and does not interfere with activities/lifestyle); 2 = moderate (symptom is present and only occasionally interferes with activities/lifestyle); and 3 = severe (symptom is present and bothersome and activities/lifestyle have been modified because of it). Vaginal pH was measured via pH paper (values < 4 or > 7 were recorded as 4 or 7, respectively) at screening and Week 12; participants were asked to abstain from sexual intercourse for 48 hours before assessment. Vaginal cytology was assessed at screening and Week 12 to determine the percentage of superficial and parabasal cells. Vaginal and/or vulvar itching and dysuria were participant assessed on a 4-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe), and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity was classified as present, not present, or not applicable due to lack of sexual activity. Extent of vaginal atrophy, pallor, vaginal dryness, friability, and petechiae was determined by the investigator via visual examination using a four-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). These assessments occurred at screening and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

Safety was evaluated throughout the study, including via adverse event (AE) reporting and vital signs at each visit and at baseline and Week 12 via clinical laboratory tests and physical and gynecological examinations.

Outcomes

The coprimary outcomes of this study were change from baseline to final assessment (defined as the last available postbaseline assessment) in self-assessed severity of vaginal dryness, vaginal cytology (percentage of vaginal superficial and parabasal cells), and vaginal pH. Secondary outcomes comprised change from baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 in severity of vaginal dryness, and change from baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and final assessment in severity of vaginal/vulvar itching, dysuria, dyspareunia, and the number of participants with sexual activity-related vaginal bleeding at each visit. Change from baseline to Week 12 and final assessment in vaginal atrophy, pallor, dryness, friability, and petechiae were scored and analyzed.

### Mayores detalles sobre sangrado posmenopáusico y… [^113P4XRL]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

En el mayor análisis realizado hasta la fecha para estudiar hasta qué punto el sangrado vaginal está asociado con el cáncer de endometrio en mujeres que han pasado por la menopausia, 90% de las mujeres que recibieron el diagnóstico de cáncer de endometrio notificaron la presencia de sangrado antes del diagnóstico. Aproximadamente 9% de las mujeres en etapa posmenopáusica que consultaron a un doctor debido al sangrado, más tarde recibieron el diagnóstico de cáncer de endometrio. Generalmente, cuando las mujeres en etapa posmenopáusica tienen sangrado se las remite para hacerse más pruebas a fin de descartar o diagnosticar cáncer de endometrio. Si bien se sabe que el sangrado vaginal es un síntoma de cáncer de endometrio, este estudio grande corrobora la práctica de remitir a las mujeres para hacerse más pruebas, explicó la doctora Christina Chu, del Centro Oncológico Fox Chase, quien no participó en la investigación.

"Si usted tiene sangrado después de la menopausia, debe llamar al doctor e informárselo", dijo la doctora Chu. "Para la mayoría de las mujeres, se trata de un problema benigno, pero hay cosas simples que pueden hacerse para descartar cáncer de endometrio". En general, el resultado del análisis mostró que, al igual que se había observado en estudios anteriores, 90% de las mujeres con diagnóstico de cáncer de endometrio tuvieron sangrado posmenopáusico. El número de mujeres con sangrado posmenopáusico con diagnóstico de cáncer de endometrio tuvo variaciones alrededor del mundo. Aunque el índice general fue 9%, varió de 5% en Norteamérica a 13% en Europa Occidental. "Solo si el sangrado persiste después de los 6 meses iniciales podría ser más preocupante" y debería poner en marcha la realización de pruebas de detección de cáncer de endometrio, dijo la doctora.

Ampliación del beneficio Los hallazgos confirman que "las mujeres en etapa posmenopáusica que presentan sangrado, tienen un riesgo bajo de padecer cáncer de endometrio, pero la gran mayoría de las mujeres con cáncer de endometrio presentan sangrado. Solo se trata de razonar el problema desde dos ángulos diferentes", explicó la doctora Chu.

### Vulvovaginal-STI treatment guidelines… [^11342oLa]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Error processing SSI file Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor or Discharge The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider. Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication, trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH is common with BV or trichomoniasis. Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.

9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT or culture. Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis.
