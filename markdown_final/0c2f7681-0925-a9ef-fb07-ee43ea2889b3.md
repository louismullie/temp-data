Diarrhea work uo

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup of diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify diarrhea by duration and severity. Then, I should verify the initial history and physical examination priorities. Next, I will consider when to test versus when to treat supportively. After that, I need to check which stool tests to order and when, including multiplex panels and C. difficile. Then, I will examine the approach to chronic diarrhea, including malabsorption, IBD, and IBS-D. Finally, I should review special populations and red flags, and close with a concise algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Acute diarrhea is typically defined as less than 4 weeks, persistent as 14 to 29 days, and chronic as 30 days or more, and I should also categorize severity and stool characteristics such as watery, fatty, or bloody to guide testing and empiric therapy decisions [^2a08cd30] [^3bf816e4].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities before jumping to tests. A careful history should cover onset, frequency, stool form, nocturnal symptoms, blood or mucus, travel, food exposures, animal or childcare contacts, antibiotic use, immunocompromise, and medication review, while the physical exam should focus on dehydration, abdominal tenderness, fever, and signs of systemic illness; this anchors pretest probabilities and helps avoid unnecessary testing in straightforward viral watery diarrhea [^3bf816e4] [^2b41bfde].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. For acute, nonbloody, watery diarrhea without alarm features in immunocompetent hosts, supportive care with oral rehydration is first-line and routine stool testing is not indicated; I should confirm that this aligns with IDSA and ACG guidance, which discourage empiric antibiotics and emphasize hydration and symptom control in this scenario [^f927eebd] [^3bf816e4].

> I need to check the triggers for diagnostic testing in acute diarrhea. Testing is warranted for dysentery, moderate to severe disease, persistent symptoms beyond about a week, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, outbreak settings, high-risk occupations, travel to high-risk regions, or when results will change management; restricting testing to these contexts improves yield and stewardship [^79d75d81] [^49e8eb08] [^e69d31c5].

> Next, I should review which stool tests to order and when. For suspected bacterial infection, I should request stool culture or a multiplex molecular panel that includes Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and STEC; for suspected C. difficile, a single diarrheal specimen with a two-step algorithm or NAAT is recommended; for parasitic disease, ova and parasite testing is appropriate in persistent diarrhea, travel, or immunocompromise; and I should remember that multiplex panels detect DNA and may identify colonization, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^79d75d81] [^5ed0fc11] [^511a9ccf].

> But wait, what if the patient has bloody diarrhea or suspected STEC? I should confirm that we avoid empiric antibiotics in suspected STEC because of HUS risk, and instead prioritize supportive care and targeted testing for Shiga toxin or the genes encoding it, ideally distinguishing stx1 from stx2 given differing potencies, while monitoring for HUS complications during follow-up [^45c45239] [^3c3125a9].

> Let me consider chronic diarrhea now, because the differential and workup diverge. I should categorize as watery, fatty, or inflammatory, then start with basic labs including CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, TSH, and celiac serology with total IgA; stool studies should include fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin, C. difficile, and selective O&P testing, with fecal fat or elastase considered if malabsorption is suspected [^d6257c3e] [^cf4b4c95].

> I should double-check the endoscopic strategy for chronic diarrhea. Colonoscopy with biopsies from right and left colon is indicated for suspected IBD, microscopic colitis, or when alarm features are present; flexible sigmoidoscopy can be a reasonable first step in some patients; upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies is indicated for suspected celiac disease or malabsorption when serology is positive or colonoscopy is unrevealing; and I should remember to intubate the terminal ileum during colonoscopy for completeness, though routine biopsy of a normal-appearing ileum has low yield [^419982c2] [^802506b2] [^b1085c3b].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to IBS-D versus organic disease. If Rome IV criteria are met and there are no alarm features, the likelihood of IBS-D is high and minimal testing is warranted; if alarm features are present or symptoms are atypical, I should pursue targeted evaluation for celiac disease, IBD, EPI, SIBO, or other organic causes rather than labeling as IBS-D prematurely [^6a74eefd] [^37b6d84b].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with immunocompromised patients. In HIV or other immunocompromised states, I should broaden the infectious differential and obtain stool cultures, viral studies, and O&P testing, and consider early endoscopic evaluation if symptoms persist; in severe disease or low CD4 counts, inpatient management and empiric IV antibiotics may be indicated while diagnostics are pending [^9d948568] [^c36e1ba1].

> I should confirm the approach to immune checkpoint inhibitor–related diarrhea. For grade 2 or higher symptoms, or persistent grade 1 beyond about 5 days, I need to check CBC, CMP, and fecal calprotectin, obtain infectious testing including C. difficile and CMV, and proceed to flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsies; management includes corticosteroids and escalation to infliximab or vedolizumab if refractory, with HBV, HIV, and TB screening before biologics [^d4238204] [^b989b3bc].

> Next, I should review elderly patients, because mimics are common. In those over 60 with diarrhea, I need to maintain a high suspicion for ischemic colitis, NSAID-related injury, diverticular segmental colitis, microscopic colitis, and colorectal cancer; cross-sectional imaging is reasonable when pain predominates, and colonoscopy with biopsies remains central to diagnosis [^3766d4af].

> I will now examine red flags that mandate expedited workup. Unintentional weight loss, nocturnal diarrhea, persistent blood, anemia, fever with systemic toxicity, severe dehydration, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, or family history of IBD or colorectal cancer should prompt earlier diagnostic testing and consideration of endoscopy, even if the duration is less than 4 weeks in some scenarios [^3bf816e4] [^d6257c3e].

> Let me reconsider the role of multiplex panels to avoid overuse. While multiplex molecular diagnostics can increase pathogen detection and guide therapy, they can also detect colonization or low-level carriage; therefore, I should reserve them for patients with moderate to severe disease, persistent symptoms, travel or outbreak risk, immunocompromise, or when results will change management, and I should interpret results alongside the clinical picture to avoid unnecessary antibiotics [^511a9ccf] [^49e8eb08].

> To synthesize, I should confirm a practical algorithm: for acute watery diarrhea without alarms, hydrate and observe; for dysentery, severe disease, persistence beyond a week, high-risk exposures, or immunocompromise, obtain targeted stool testing including C. difficile; for chronic diarrhea, start with basic labs and selective stool tests, then escalate to colonoscopy with biopsies and consider upper endoscopy if malabsorption or celiac disease is suspected; throughout, align testing with pretest probability and the likelihood that results will change management [^3bf816e4] [^d6257c3e] [^419982c2].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that this is consistent with guidelines: most acute diarrheas are viral and self-limited, so supportive care and judicious testing are essential; chronic diarrhea requires a structured, stepwise approach that balances cost, yield, and patient risk; and special populations such as the immunocompromised, elderly, and those on ICIs need tailored pathways and a lower threshold for endoscopic evaluation [^3bf816e4] [^d6257c3e] [^d4238204].

---

The diarrhea workup should be **guided by duration, severity, and alarm features** [^3bf816e4]. For acute diarrhea (< 4 weeks), prioritize **hydration and supportive care** [^3bf816e4]; test selectively for bacterial pathogens, C. difficile, and parasites when fever, blood, severe illness, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, or outbreak risk is present [^79d75d81] [^5ed0fc11] [^e69d31c5] [^5b07aa36]. For chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks), obtain CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, TSH, celiac serology, and stool studies (calprotectin, C. difficile, O&P) [^d6257c3e]; if nonrevealing, proceed to colonoscopy with biopsies to assess for IBD, microscopic colitis, or malignancy [^419982c2]. Reserve upper endoscopy for suspected malabsorption or celiac disease [^e17f2f77]. Empiric antibiotics are not routine; use only when clearly indicated [^f927eebd].

---

## Initial assessment and history

A thorough history and physical examination are essential to **guide testing and management** [^3bf816e4]. Key elements include:

- **Duration and frequency**: Acute (< 4 weeks) vs chronic (> 4 weeks) [^2a08cd30].
- **Stool characteristics**: Watery, fatty, bloody, mucus, nocturnal, incontinence [^d4f33ec8].
- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting [^3bf816e4].
- **Risk factors**: Travel, antibiotic use, immunocompromise, family history of IBD or celiac disease, recent hospitalization, daycare exposure, food handlers [^1c492a79].
- **Medications**: Laxatives, metformin, PPIs, NSAIDs, chemotherapy, immunosuppressants [^d4f33ec8].

---

## Physical examination

Assess for **dehydration**, fever, abdominal tenderness, distension, masses, and perianal disease. Evaluate for **alarm features** such as weight loss, anemia, nocturnal diarrhea, and blood in stool [^3bf816e4].

---

## Categorization of diarrhea

Categorizing diarrhea helps narrow the differential and guide testing:

| **Category** | **Characteristics** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute watery | - < 4 weeks <br/> - Watery stools <br/> - No blood | - Viral gastroenteritis <br/> - Traveler's diarrhea <br/> - Medication-induced [^3bf816e4] |
| Acute bloody | - < 4 weeks <br/> - Blood in stool | - Bacterial infections (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7) <br/> - IBD flare <br/> - Ischemic colitis [^79d75d81] [^aa466d66] |
| Chronic watery | - > 4 weeks <br/> - Watery stools | - IBS-D <br/> - Celiac disease <br/> - Bile acid diarrhea <br/> - Medication-induced [^4d4b6de4] |
| Chronic fatty | - > 4 weeks <br/> - Greasy, oily stools | - Malabsorption (celiac, EPI, SIBO) [^d4f33ec8] |
| Chronic inflammatory | - > 4 weeks <br/> - Blood, mucus, fever | - IBD <br/> - Infections (C. difficile, CMV) <br/> - Ischemic colitis [^d6257c3e] |

---

## Indications for diagnostic testing

Testing is not routinely required for mild, acute, nonbloody diarrhea but is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Severe illness**: Dehydration, high fever, systemic toxicity [^79d75d81].
- **Bloody diarrhea**: Suspected bacterial or inflammatory etiology [^79d75d81].
- **Persistent symptoms**: > 7 days without improvement [^49e8eb08].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV, immunosuppressive therapy [^9d948568].
- **Recent antibiotic use**: Risk of C. difficile [^5ed0fc11].
- **Outbreak settings**: Multiple cases or suspected foodborne illness [^5b07aa36].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

### Acute diarrhea

- **Stool studies**: Culture for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7; C. difficile toxin/NAAT; O&P if persistent or travel-related [^79d75d81] [^5ed0fc11].
- **Molecular panels**: Multiplex PCR for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens in moderate-to-severe or persistent cases [^7a5de80b].
- **Blood tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal function in severe cases [^notfound].

---

### Chronic diarrhea

- **Basic labs**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, TSH, celiac serology (tTG-IgA with total IgA) [^d8c08c2a].
- **Stool studies**: Calprotectin or lactoferrin (inflammation), C. difficile, O&P, fecal fat if malabsorption suspected [^259377e9] [^d6257c3e].
- **Endoscopy**: Colonoscopy with biopsies (right and left colon) for IBD, microscopic colitis, malignancy; EGD with duodenal biopsies if celiac or malabsorption suspected [^419982c2] [^e17f2f77].
- **Specialized tests**: Bile acid diarrhea test, pancreatic elastase, hydrogen breath test (SIBO), as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Role of endoscopy

Endoscopy is **not indicated for acute, self-limited diarrhea** but is essential in chronic diarrhea or when alarm features are present [^09bcc4e6]. Colonoscopy with biopsies is recommended for suspected IBD, microscopic colitis, or malignancy, and EGD with small-bowel biopsies is indicated for suspected celiac disease or malabsorption [^419982c2] [^e17f2f77].

---

## Empiric therapy

Empiric antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** for acute watery diarrhea but may be considered in select scenarios:

- **Severe illness**: Sepsis, immunocompromise, or high-risk travel [^3c3125a9].
- **Bloody diarrhea**: Suspected Shigella or invasive bacterial infection [^3c3125a9].
- **Persistent diarrhea**: > 14 days with suspected bacterial etiology [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and management

Follow-up should monitor for dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and response to therapy. Persistent or recurrent diarrhea warrants **re-evaluation** and escalation of testing, including endoscopy and specialized studies [^20014029].

---

The diarrhea workup should be **individualized** based on duration, severity, and patient risk factors, with testing reserved for cases in which results are likely to change management.

Diarrhea generates a wide range of diagnostic considerations and has profound individual and public health significance. The setting and circumstances under which a patient presents with diarrhea drastically influences the concern brought to the encounter. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are often provisionally labeled "gastroenteritis" with appropriate expectant management. In resource-poor countries, the significance of diarrhea is even greater. This review focuses on diarrhea and its initial evaluation and management in the emergency department.

### Chronic unexplained diarrhea: a logical and cost-effective approach to assessment [^4d4b6de4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The workup of chronic unexplained diarrhea can be equally frustrating for care providers and patients. It carries a physical, financial, and social toll. In this review we provide a sensible approach to evaluating and managing chronic diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Bile acid diarrhea is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential cause behind some cases of chronic diarrhea.

Summary

A detailed history and physical examination can provide clues that guide a logical approach to the evaluation. We suggest a cost-effective approach to the workup and management of chronic diarrhea based on individual patient factors related to clinical history and physical exam. We find that this approach leads to initiation of treatment in a time-efficient fashion and avoids unnecessary testing.

Infectious diarrhea — diagnostic yield and selective testing report that among adults presenting with diarrhea to emergency departments in the United States, 17% of patients who submitted a stool specimen (as opposed to rectal swab) were found to have a bacterial enteric infection, that a bacterial etiology was found in 5%–11% of children seeking care in emergency departments and outpatient settings, and that restricting testing to patients with bloody stools, fever, or abdominal tenderness can increase the likelihood of identifying a bacterial pathogen; testing all patients with acute diarrhea for these pathogens would be inefficient.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^419982c2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea endoscopy — recommendations (initial evaluation and small-bowel workup) state that stool and laboratory tests should be the initial step for the evaluation of clinical scenarios suggestive of infectious diarrhea. In patients with chronic unexplained diarrhea, we suggest colonoscopy with random biopsies of the right and left side of the colon, and sigmoidoscopy is an alternative option, although this may miss right-sided organic disease. We recommend intubation of the terminal ileum during colonoscopy for patients undergoing evaluation of chronic diarrhea, and there are insufficient data to determine whether biopsy of an endoscopically normal-appearing terminal ileum should be routinely performed, but the yield of this is likely low. We recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with small-bowel biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhea or suspected malabsorption and inconclusive evaluation after colonoscopy with biopsy and in patients with positive celiac serology. We recommend obtaining a minimum of 4 duodenal biopsy specimens for evaluation of suspected celiac disease. Enteroscopy is not recommended for the routine evaluation of chronic diarrhea but may be useful for evaluation of small-bowel disease when other investigations are nondiagnostic.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^09bcc4e6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Immunocompetent host — initial approach to acute diarrhea specifies that infectious diarrheal illnesses in otherwise healthy individuals are common and short-lived and rarely require specific therapy, therefore endoscopy is not warranted for the initial evaluation of acute diarrhea. An endoscopic evaluation should be considered for patients with persistent symptoms, inconclusive diagnosis after routine blood and stool tests, or failure to respond to empirical therapy.

Infectious diarrhea — workup when no pathogen is identified or symptoms worsen: If no pathogen has been identified, it may be reasonable to reevaluate stool and/or blood if there is evidence of systemic symptoms to evaluate for an undetected pathogen; if symptoms worsen after antibiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non–C. difficile) should be considered, and if hospitalized or with healthcare exposure, C. difficile becomes an additional consideration, particularly if there is fever or leukocytosis > 20000 cells/µL, and stool should be assessed for C. difficile toxin or a toxigenic C. difficile strain (eg, NAAT); stool also should be submitted for culture and susceptibility, and if a bacterial etiology is confirmed and antibiotics are indicated or have been used, susceptibility testing may reveal antimicrobial resistance.

### Acute bloody diarrhea: a medical emergency for patients of all ages [^aa466d66]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV, evaluation, IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to develop a broad differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with diarrhea, especially those with moderate and severe primary or secondary immune deficiencies, and obtain evaluation of stool specimens by culture, viral studies, and examination for parasites.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, more specifically with respect to evaluation for IBD, BSG 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining fecal immunochemical testing for fecal blood loss in primary or secondary care, either as an exclusion test or to guide the priority of investigations, in patients with chronic diarrhea without rectal bleeding.

---

### Severe acute diarrhea [^2abcddeb]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea is commonly caused by an infection. Severe acute diarrhea warrants immediate medical evaluation and hospitalization. Indications for stool studies include fever; bloody diarrhea; recent travel to an endemic area; recent antibiotics; immunosuppression; and occupational risks, such as food handlers. Noninfectious causes include inflammatory bowel disease, radiation enteritis, and intestinal ischemia. Management of severe acute diarrhea includes intravenous fluid rehydration and empiric antibiotics. Use of antidiarrheal agents is controversial when invasive pathogens are suspected.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^3bf816e4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^45c45239]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — initial assessment and Shiga toxin–producing organisms: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults. When the clinical or epidemic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish Escherichia coli O157:H7 from other Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) in stool; if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used. In addition, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially in people with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler. Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^f927eebd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Appropriateness of colonoscopy in Europe (EPAGE II). Chronic diarrhea and known inflammatory bowel disease [^d29ab05f]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

To summarize the published literature on assessment of appropriateness of colonoscopy for investigation of chronic diarrhea, management of patients with known inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and for colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in such patients, and to report report appropriateness criteria developed by an expert panel, the 2008 European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, EPAGE II.

Methods

A systematic search of guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies regarding the evaluation of chronic diarrhea, the management of IBD, and colorectal cancer surveillance in IBD was performed. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was applied to develop appropriateness criteria for colonoscopy for these conditions.

Results

According to the literature, colonoscopic evaluation may be justified for patients aged > 50 years with recent-onset chronic diarrhea or with alarm symptoms. Surveillance colonoscopy for CRC should be offered to all patients with extensive ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease of 8 years' duration, and to all patients with less extensive disease of 15 years' duration. Intervals for surveillance colonoscopy depend on duration of evolution, initial diagnosis, and histological findings. The EPAGE II criteria also confirmed the appropriateness of diagnostic colonoscopy for diarrhea of > 4 weeks' duration. They also suggest that, in addition to assessing extent of IBD by colonoscopy, further colonoscopic examination is appropriate in the face of persistent or worsening symptoms. Surveillance colonoscopy in IBD patients was generally appropriate after a lapse of 2 years. In the presence of dysplasia at previous colonoscopy, it was not only appropriate but necessary.

Conclusions

Despite or perhaps because of the limitations of the available published studies, the panel-based EPAGE II (http://www.epage.ch) criteria can help guide appropriate colonoscopy use in the absence of strong evidence from the literature.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^802506b2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy — indications and biopsy strategy in diarrhea notes that flexible sigmoidoscopy may be a suitable initial investigation for the evaluation of acute diarrhea in patients with suspected diffuse colitis or for chronic diarrhea in patients who are pregnant, have significant comorbidities, or when symptoms characteristic of left-sided colonic disease predominate; in many situations, flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient as the initial endoscopic test in chronic diarrhea. Biopsies should be performed for histologic evaluation even when the mucosa appears normal to exclude microscopic colitis and other etiologies, and colonoscopy should be considered if sigmoidoscopy findings are inconclusive, symptoms persist, there is large-volume blood loss, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer is suspected.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^d4f33ec8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^3766d4af]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^ed28163f]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^717dfbbc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

Diarrhea and colitis

Diagnostic workup for grade 1 diarrhea or colitis symptoms should include CBC, CMP, and fecal lactoferrin.
Additional workup should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 2, and these additional tests should include fecal calprotectin, and stool infectious analysis (stool ova and parasite, C. difficile and cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if available or if high index of suspicion is present, among other infectious studies (eg, COVID-19)). Serum TSH and celiac serologies (antitransglutaminase antibodies with total IgA level) may also be considered, if clinical suspicion of ICI-induced celiac disease is present.
Abdominal CT scan should be obtained in patients with signs and symptoms of colitis complications, such as bowel perforation or toxic megacolon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy with biopsy should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 3 or with persistent (≥ 5 days) diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade 2 (LE: 4).
ICIs may be temporarily withheld (instead of discontinued) in patients experiencing grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or colitis symptoms. These patients may be re-challenged with ICIs if their symptoms are stable (grade ≤ 1 or baseline) with < 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) (LE: 4).
Close monitoring for recurrence of diarrhea or colitis symptoms is recommended after re-challenging patients with ICI therapy.
Corticosteroids should be started in patients experiencing diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 2. The initial dose of prednisone should be 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) for grade 2 diarrhea or colitis and 1–2 mg/kg/day for grades 3 and 4. Grade 4 diarrhea or colitis should initially be treated with IV corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered within 4 weeks after improvement of diarrhea or colitis symptoms to grade ≤ 1 (LE: 1).
Prior to administration of infliximab or vedolizumab, patients should be tested for HBV, HIV, and TB. Administration of infliximab or vedolizumab should not be delayed if test results are pending.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms do not respond to corticosteroid therapy within 3–5 days, if diarrhea or colitis symptoms recur after tapering corticosteroids, or if there is severe ulcerative presentation on colonoscopy, 3 doses of infliximab (5 mg/kg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks (LE: 1) to reduce the risk of colitis recurrence.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms persist after the second dose of infliximab treatment, the third dose should be held and 3 doses of vedolizumab (300 mg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks (LE: 1).
If no clinical improvement is observed following immunosuppressive therapy in patients with grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or colitis, a repeat endoscopy with infectious workup (C. difficile and CMV) should be performed. Repeat endoscopy should be performed prior to resuming ICI therapy.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms recur following corticosteroid taper, they should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as the first episode.

### Prevalence of enteric infections in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors and impact on management and outcomes [^3d391300]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study is the largest analysis of stool pathogen testing in patients with diarrhea on ICI, the first to examine all-comers within this group undergoing initial GI PCR testing for the workup of new onset diarrhea and the first to assess endoscopic and histological associations with treatments within this group. By analyzing patients at the time of presentation for diarrhea and initial GI PCR testing, we were uniquely able to capture the clinical reality of irEC evaluations and in turn maximize the applicability of our results to real world practice settings.

There are several limitations to our study. Due to its retrospective design, our results are unable to describe causal relationships between GI infections and diarrhea severity, treatment regimens, and patient outcomes. The PCR panel is unable to distinguish between active infection, colonization, or contamination and does not assess for all potential infectious agents, especially less-common pathogens. Furthermore, patients with C. diff were excluded due to the pathogen's exclusion from the PCR panel and distinct risk factors, associations with colitis, and outcomes. However, C. diff remains a major infectious cause of diarrhea in cancer patients, and we plan to study patients with suspected irEC and superimposed C. diff infection and their unique considerations in a dedicated future analysis. Treatment protocols for diarrhea on ICI are not standardized, and so the decision for therapy escalation or endoscopic evaluation were at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist and/or oncologist.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

### Chronic diarrhea as the presenting feature of primary systemic AL amyloidosis: serendipity or delayed diagnosis? [^65198534]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic diarrhea is common with a prevalence of 3% to 5% in the general population. The major causes of chronic diarrhea can be assessed by combining a patient's history and characteristic of the stool (inflammatory, fatty or watery). The differential diagnosis covers a wide range of diseases from common encountered entities such as chronic infection, inflammatory bowel disease, laxative abuse, and irritable bowel syndrome to rare disorders. Guidelines recommend categorizing chronic diarrhea as osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or motile, which help focus the diagnosis and further tests. Despite careful evaluation of the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea, physicians can sometimes fail to recognize the cause. In this case, physicians should take into consideration causes less frequent or even rare diseases. In the present report, a case of primary AL amyloidosis with GI involvement presented as chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Although similar conditions have been reported scantly, none of them was initially diagnosed via random intestine biopsy, and with a detailed therapeutic follow-up.

### Oral rehydration solutions for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea… [^7eba4d60]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are the most appropriate oral rehydration solutions for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea. Evidence-Based Answer Oral rehydration solutions are distinguished by high or low osmolarity and by whether they are made with complex or simple carbohydrates. When oral rehydration solutions with high osmolarity are compared, polymer-based solutions may result in lower stool output in the first 24 hours and shorter duration of diarrhea than glucose-based solutions. Practice Pointers Oral rehydration solutions are essential in the management of acute watery diarrhea. The original oral rehydration solution formulation, introduced by the World Health Organization in 1979, consisted of glucose and other electrolytes with an osmolarity of 310 mOsm per L.

It improved signs of dehydration but did not reduce stool volume loss or diarrhea duration, and the high osmotic load potentiated fluid losses and electrolyte imbalances. Since 2004, the WHO has recommended low-osmolarity glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. In studies of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions, patients receiving polymer-based solutions had a mean duration of diarrhea that was eight hours shorter than those receiving glucose-based solutions, but the results were underpowered. In studies of high-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions, patients receiving polymer-based solutions had lower stool output and a mean duration of diarrhea that was 8. 5 hours shorter than those receiving glucose-based solutions. Both results were statistically significant but limited by heterogeneity.

The need for unscheduled intravenous fluids was low in most trials comparing high-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients with noncholera mixed-pathogen diarrhea, results slightly favored high-osmolarity polymer-based solution for a decrease in unscheduled administration of intravenous fluids.

In patients with suspected graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and diarrhea, we suggest flexible sigmoidoscopy with distal colon biopsies as the initial endoscopic evaluation, and in the event of negative colonic histology findings or when upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms predominate, we recommend an EGD with biopsies.

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^6eb3dc1c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrheal illness, primarily acute infectious diarrhea, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young children worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 billion cases and approximately 450 000 deaths per year. In the US, infectious gastroenteritis continues to place a substantial burden on the health care system. The recent development of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels for gastroenteritis has enabled the rapid identification of multiple gastrointestinal pathogens (up to 22 bacteria, viruses, and parasitic organisms) from stool samples. Multiplex molecular methods have high sensitivity and specificity for gastrointestinal pathogens and have a faster turnaround time than traditional culture-based methods. However, differentiation between a disease-causing pathogen and asymptomatic carriage can be challenging, especially when multiple pathogens are detected. Although the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2017 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea provide broad recommendations for when diarrhea-related diagnostics should be used, clear guidelines specific to the use of multiplex PCR panels do not exist. When used appropriately, multiplex PCR panels can facilitate the prompt initiation of organism-specific treatment for some bacterial and parasitic infections and alleviate the need for more invasive workups and repeat health care encounters. However, especially given the self-limited nature of most cases of pediatric gastroenteritis, the misuse of these panels can lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics, increased financial burden within the health care system, and potential time and financial costs for families.

### Clinical and microbiological profile of patients with diarrhea evaluated using the gastrointestinal panel in a high-complexity center [^ce668439]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding treatment, most patients initially received empirical antibiotic management. An impact was observed in more than 50% of the management after the PGI result given by continuing without antibiotic treatment, maintaining the initial empirical regimen or changing the treatment. These results are consistent with previous studies, where empirical treatment was prescribed in up to 70% of the adult diarrhea population. In addition, other studies evaluating the impact of the gastrointestinal panel on treatment describe that in approximately 50% of patients, the result of the panel allows for treatment tailoring.

GIP is emerging as a useful tool in the personalized management of gastrointestinal infections; however, it should be considered as a diagnostic support element in decision making, encompassing other clinical parameters of the patient that can be considered in additional studies.

Strengths and limitations

This retrospective study on the identification of microorganisms by GIP presents significant strengths, such as the evaluation of an advanced diagnostic technique in a real clinical context. However, an important limitation was that the results were not communicated in a timely manner to the treating physicians, which probably reduced their impact on the clinical management of patients. This limitation underscores the need for prospective studies that evaluate the real impact of this diagnostic tool when effectively integrated into clinical practice. Future studies should focus on measuring the impact of timely use of GIP on variables such as length of hospital stay, days of antibiotic treatment, need for abdominal imaging studies, and associated costs per patient. This would allow a more complete evaluation of the clinical and economic utility of this technology in the management of gastrointestinal infections.

For watery illness with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), consider ≤ 48 h of loperamide therapy. For dysenteric diarrhea with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), it specifies microbiologic assessment, then anti-microbial agent directed to cause for all but STEC infection. In severe illness with fever (≥ 101°F) in a single case (not outbreak), listed actions include to consider microbiologic assessment and empiric treatment with Azithromycin 1 g in single dose OR 500 mg once daily for 3 days. Persistent diarrhea (14–30 days) should be worked up by culture and/or culture-independent microbiologic assessment, then treated with an anti-microbial agent directed to cause.

### Functional diarrhea [^d5ffe6b2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.

### Recognizing gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of primary immunodeficiency diseases [^4f8154a0]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Given the complex immune function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it is not surprising that many children with primary immunodeficiencies present with GI tract manifestations. Although many immunodeficiency disorders present with overt evidence of immune dysregulation, a few can present in older children with more subtle signs and symptoms. Such children may present first to a gastroenterologist with common symptoms, including malabsorption, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, or inflammatory bowel disease, which may actually be a manifestation of their underlying immune disorder. A thorough clinical history in combination with a careful review of histology from biopsies may reveal clues that one is dealing with a disease entity outside the norm and may prompt additional laboratory studies beyond the usual set of screening laboratory tests. Once the true underlying diagnosis is revealed, more appropriate therapy can be initiated. Additionally, more appropriate anticipatory guidance regarding the expected disease course, response to medications, and any additional risks that therapy may entail can be provided to the family.

9 Summary and conclusions

Establishing a clear definition of diarrhoea based on history alone can prove difficult, and this tends to lead to overinvestigation of functional diarrhoea including IBS. Serological testing for coeliac disease, the most common small bowel enteropathy in Caucasian populations, should be performed early in the course of investigations. The initial assessment should direct the clinician to determine whether further investigation is necessary and, if so, whether the focus should be on colonic, small bowel or pancreatic disease. This analysis could reasonably be performed in the primary care setting.

Most chronic diarrhoea is due to colonic abnormalities. Colonic investigations should be age stratified, in keeping with the risk of neoplasia and inflammation, and the high prevalence of bile acid diarrhoea estimated to be similar to coealic disease should be recognised and investigated. After appropriate normal investigations, those with persistent diarrhoea are likely to be self-limiting 'idiopathic' diarrhoea or undiagnosed factitious diarrhoea. Since the overall prognosis appears to be good in this group, including those that self-report and self-remedy, further investigation in this group is not warranted and symptomatic treatment could be instituted.

### Visual diagnosis: chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive in a 5-year-old girl [^0712d6f2]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic GVHD usually develops 100 days after BMT and is a serious and potentially life-threatening long-term complication. Chronic GVHD can occur after previous or ongoing acute GVHD or in patients without a history of acute GVHD (eg, de novo disease) as illustrated by this case. In evaluating a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea more than 100 days after BMT, one must consider a serious underlying illness such as chronic GVHD because it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As indicated by this case, chronic GVHD can cause diarrhea. Complete evaluation of the diarrhea state should be part of the initial investigation. In many cases, however, the diagnosis of GVHD is not straightforward, and gastrointestinal biopsy and histologic confirmation is often necessary to corroborate a clinical impression of chronic GVHD.

### Chronic diarrhea as the presenting feature of primary systemic AL amyloidosis: serendipity or delayed diagnosis? [^04b9b15f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic diarrhea in adults is a common symptom with a wide range of underlying etiologies. Although various strategies have been proposed for evaluation, there are still cases with undetermined origins even after extensive workup. Amyloidosis with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is one of the causes that should be considered in adult patients with chronic diarrhea. We report a case of primary systemic amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, presenting initially as chronic diarrhea and weight loss.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old man with chronic diarrhea and weight loss was referred to our hospital. Prior to his presentation, extensive evaluation including an exploratory laparotomy was carried out and did not yield any valuable findings. An echocardiography performed after repeated episodes of orthostatic hypotension revealed infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Moreover, biopsies of the terminal ileum revealed amyloid deposition confirmed by Congo Red staining. Finally, a diagnosis of systemic AL amyloidosis was made after hematological workup. Anti-plasma cell therapy did ameliorate his GI symptoms.

Conclusion

Although amyloidosis with GI involvement is a rare cause of chronic diarrhea, it should be considered especially in patients with intestinal malabsorption and extra-GI manifestations, such as orthostatic hypotension. The delayed diagnosis in the present case highlights the importance of recognizing clinical "red flags" not seemingly related to one another, and underscores the need to get intestinal biopsies even with normal endoscopic appearance of the mucosa.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^4640005b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Diarrhea is a common yet complex disorder precipitated by multiple etiologic and pathogenic mechanisms. Distinguishing these conditions from each other can be problematic, especially where symptoms overlap. This is highlighted in individuals with IBS-D: in the United States, up to 75% of patients meeting the criteria remain undiagnosed. This is concerning because IBS is the most common cause of diarrhea and can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on a few simple binary questions and minimal diagnostic testing.

One of the most reported mimickers of IBS-D is EPI, and it is not uncommon for patients with EPI to be misdiagnosed with IBS-D. Consequently, we have proposed an algorithm designed specifically to help distinguish between these 2 disorders (Fig. 3) and differentiate them from other etiologies of chronic diarrhea. Most importantly, this algorithm incorporates recommendations from the recently published ACG and AGA IBS guidelines stressing a positive diagnostic strategy. This simple algorithm should assist practitioners in making timely diagnoses and reduce superfluous testing, thus reducing delays in treatment and improving patient health and quality of life.

Empiric management of infectious diarrhea — bloody diarrhea indications and agents: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of bacterial etiology, ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella, and people who have recently traveled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). In adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment and should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). People with clinical features of sepsis who are suspected of having enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy after blood, stool, and urine culture collection (strong, low).

Stool diagnostic studies may be of value in cases of dysentery, moderate-to-severe disease, and symptoms lasting > 7 days to clarify the etiology of the patient's illness and enable specific directed therapy. Traditional methods of diagnosis fail to reveal the etiology of the majority of cases of acute diarrheal infection; if available, the use of FDA-approved culture-independent methods of diagnosis can be recommended at least as an adjunct to traditional methods. Antibiotic sensitivity testing for management of the individual with acute diarrheal infection is currently not recommended.

This document describes the role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea with separate discussions for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, and notes that there are few indications for endoscopy in the management of acute diarrhea and that the document primarily focuses on the evaluation on chronic diarrhea. Recommendation strength wording is specified, with weaker recommendations indicated by "we suggest", and stronger recommendations typically stated as "we recommend".

AN ALGORITHM FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA: FOCUS ON IBS-D AND EPI

Using the four-step procedure described above, we have refined and developed a straightforward algorithm to assist clinicians in differentiating IBS-D and EPI from other diarrhea syndromes (Fig. 3). Use of this algorithm should minimize diagnostic testing and reduce health care expenditure by avoiding unnecessary investigations and may result in more timely and appropriate diagnosis and management. The algorithm provides a simple framework for making a rapid and accurate diagnosis of IBS-D. It begins with three "rule-in" questions to determine alignment with Rome IV criteria for IBS: (1) Do you experience pain? (2) Does the pain improve or worsen with defecation? and/or (3) Is the pain associated with changes in stool frequency or texture? If the answers to these three rule-in questions are positive, and in the absence of a few alarm symptoms/signs (Fig. 3), IBS-D can be diagnosed with an accuracy approaching 97%. In this scenario, minimal diagnostic testing is warranted. However, if alarm symptoms are present (eg, weight loss) and if EPI is suspected as the cause of chronic diarrhea, nutritional markers, and FE-1 are indicated, with any abnormal results making exploration of the pancreas mandatory. If the pancreas looks normal, then a false positive FE-1 test is likely, EPI can be excluded, and another cause of chronic diarrhea should be sought.

### A case of checkpoint inhibitor-induced celiac disease [^d114e944]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Both early recognition and initiation of the appropriate treatment of irAEs are crucial to relieve symptoms, avoid complications, and when indicated enable continued ICI therapy. While enterocolitis is by far the most common cause of diarrhea, we here report a case of celiac disease induced by ICI therapy. In a patient with symptomatic diarrhea following initiation of ICIs, infectious pathology should be ruled out followed by initiation of systemic corticosteroids. In patients with unusual features and/or failure to respond to steroid treatment, consideration should be given to a full endoscopic work up including a colonoscopy and exam of the terminal ileum and an upper endoscopy with biopsies in order to discern the underlying etiology. This case of ICI-induced celiac disease demonstrates that multidisciplinary collaboration among oncologists, gastroenterologists, and pathologists is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diarrhea and colitis — evaluation and stepwise management include endoscopy for severe or persistent symptoms, corticosteroids with weight‑based dosing, and escalation to infliximab or vedolizumab when indicated. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy with biopsy should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 3 or with persistent (≥ 5 days) diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade 2. ICIs may be temporarily withheld in grade ≥ 3 cases, and patients may be re-challenged if symptoms are stable (grade ≤ 1 or baseline) with < 10 mg/day of prednisone. Corticosteroids should be started for grade 2; prednisone should be initiated orally at 1 mg/kg/day for grade 2 and 1–2 mg/kg/day for grades 3 and 4, with grade 4 ideally treated with IV corticosteroids, and corticosteroids tapered within 4 weeks after improvement to grade ≤ 1. If symptoms do not respond within 3–5 days, recur after taper, or there is severe ulcerative presentation, 3 doses of infliximab (5 mg/kg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks; before infliximab or vedolizumab, patients should be tested for HBV, HIV, and TB, and administration should not be delayed if results are pending. If symptoms persist after the second infliximab dose, the third dose should be held and 3 doses of vedolizumab (300 mg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. If no clinical improvement is observed after immunosuppressive therapy in grade ≥ 3 cases, a repeat endoscopy with infectious workup should be performed, and repeat endoscopy should be performed prior to resuming ICI therapy, with close monitoring after re-challenge.

### Chest pain and diarrhea: a case of Campylobacter jejuni-associated myocarditis [^59e082b8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea and chest pain are common symptoms in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). However, rarely is a relationship between these two symptoms established in a single patient.

Objective

Describe a case of Campylobacter-associated myocarditis.

Case Report

A 43-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the ED with angina-like chest pain and a 3-day history of diarrhea. Electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads. Coronary angiogram revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease. Troponin T rose to 1.75 ng/mL. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed subepicardial and mid-myocardial enhancement, particularly in the anterolateral wall and interventricular septum, consistent with a diagnosis of myocarditis. Stool studies were positive for Campylobacter jejuni.

Conclusions

Campylobacter-associated myocarditis is rare, but performing the appropriate initial diagnostic testing, including stool cultures, is critical to making the diagnosis. Identifying the etiology of myocarditis as bacterial will ensure that appropriate treatment with antibiotics occurs in addition to any cardiology medications needed for supportive care.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

### Early diagnosis, early stratification, and early intervention to deliver precision medicine in IBD [^6b25a7cd]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Early Diagnosis

It has consistently been demonstrated that there are significant delays in presentation, referral, and diagnosis for both UC and CD. Despite major improvements in many aspects of IBD clinical care over the last few decades, including a greater number of tools to help establish a diagnosis of either UC or CD, there appears to have been no major reduction in diagnostic delay for either condition. This diagnostic delay has been reported to be greater in CD, which is likely due to many factors including that patients can typically present with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea which may be mistaken for other gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Delayed diagnosis has also been associated with more emergent presentation, which in turn has been associated with more adverse clinical outcomes.

The issue of delayed diagnosis is further compounded by an increasing awareness that many patients report prevalent symptoms for several years before a formal diagnosis of IBD is established. Unsurprisingly, in this period before diagnosis of IBD, high health care usage has been reported as patients seek help to manage their symptoms. In addition to symptoms being present, simple laboratory abnormalities are often detectable even up to 12 months before diagnosis in patients with CD. Accordingly, one solution to overcome these delays in diagnosis is likely to be through increasing awareness in the medical community and encouraging use of tools to identify red flags, which allow more timely referrals to specialist clinics and greater pickup for cases of early IBD.

### Recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea [^f3878369]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update and expand on previously published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary panel was convened to review the recent literature and discuss recommendations for updating the practice guidelines previously published by this group in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1998. MEDLINE searches were performed and the relevant literature published since 1998 was reviewed by all panel members. The treatment recommendations and algorithm were revised by panel consensus.

Results

A recent review of early toxic deaths occurring in two National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group trials of irinotecan plus high-dose fluorouracil and leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer has led to the recognition of a life-threatening gastrointestinal syndrome and highlighted the need for vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for this serious complication. Loperamide remains the standard therapy for uncomplicated cases. However, the revised guidelines reflect the need for recognition of the early warning signs of complicated cases of diarrhea and the need for early and aggressive management, including the addition of antibiotics. Management of radiation-induced diarrhea is similar but may not require hospitalization, and chronic low- to intermediate-grade symptoms can be managed with continued loperamide.

Conclusion

With vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for cancer treatment-induced diarrhea, particularly in patients with early warning signs of severe complications, morbidity and mortality may be reduced.
