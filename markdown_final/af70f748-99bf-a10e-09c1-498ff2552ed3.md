## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C presents for follow-up after an episode of acute esophageal variceal bleeding, which was managed successfully with endoscopic band ligation and initiation of nonselective beta-blocker therapy. At his clinic visit, he is stable and asymptomatic. The resident suggests ordering serial hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements to monitor his response to therapy and also proposes using transient elastography as a noninvasive alternative to assess portal pressure changes.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the appropriate approach to monitoring portal pressure in this patient, and how should you respond to the resident's suggestions regarding HVPG and noninvasive testing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether serial hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements or transient elastography should be used to monitor portal pressure response after acute variceal bleeding, now that the patient is on nonselective beta-blocker therapy and has undergone endoscopic band ligation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the standard of care for secondary prophylaxis. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about routine HVPG monitoring. Next, I will examine the evidence base for HVPG-guided therapy and whether it changes practice. After that, I need to check whether noninvasive tests like transient elastography track changes in portal pressure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant monitoring plan and communicate it clearly to the resident.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and standard of care. This patient has cirrhosis with prior variceal bleeding and is now receiving combination secondary prophylaxis with endoscopic band ligation plus a nonselective beta-blocker, which is first-line therapy to reduce rebleeding risk, with TIPS reserved for failure of combination therapy or other indications such as refractory ascites [^4892d1da] [^c87dd5bd].

> Wait, let me verify the role of HVPG monitoring in routine care. The AASLD explicitly advises that monitoring changes in HVPG should not be performed routinely outside of clinical trials, reflecting limited applicability and availability, and the fact that noninvasive tests do not reliably track HVPG changes. This applies to both primary and secondary prophylaxis settings, so routine serial HVPG is not recommended here [^a2f944b3] [^21d8acd3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about HVPG-guided therapy. I initially thought the randomized trial showing improved survival with HVPG-guided therapy might justify routine use, but I should double-check the strength and context of that evidence. The Hepatology 2017 RCT did show lower mortality and rebleeding with HVPG-guided pharmacotherapy, yet this remains investigational and has not been adopted into mainstream guidelines; moreover, cost-effectiveness analyses suggest marginal gains at added expense, reinforcing that routine HVPG monitoring is not standard of care pending broader validation and access considerations [^ac21f01e] [^97b30dbe] [^f8281a8f].

> Next, I should review whether transient elastography can substitute for HVPG to monitor portal pressure changes. Let me think about this carefully. Guidelines emphasize that noninvasive tests, including liver stiffness by transient elastography, do not correlate with changes in HVPG and therefore cannot be used to monitor hemodynamic response to beta-blockers; liver stiffness reflects fibrosis burden and may indicate clinically significant portal hypertension at baseline, but it does not track acute or chronic changes in portal pressure after therapy [^a2f944b3] [^21d8acd3] [^9a2e99f9].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan aligns with evidence-based follow-up. The appropriate approach is to titrate the nonselective beta-blocker to a resting heart rate of about 55–60 bpm while maintaining systolic blood pressure at or above 90 mmHg, and to continue indefinitely if tolerated, without routine HVPG checks. Clinically, I should confirm heart rate and blood pressure at each visit and adjust the dose accordingly, recognizing that heart rate is an imperfect surrogate for portal pressure reduction but is the practical target used in guidelines [^a7179fde] [^0d7c9375].

> But wait, what if the patient rebleeds despite optimized therapy. I should confirm escalation triggers. If rebleeding occurs despite adequate beta-blocker dosing and endoscopic eradication, rescue TIPS is indicated; preemptive TIPS within 72 hours is reserved for high-risk patients after acute bleeding, which is a different decision point than routine outpatient monitoring after secondary prophylaxis has been initiated [^c87dd5bd] [^de517eb2].

> Let me reconsider the resident's suggestions and craft a clear response. I would explain that while HVPG response correlates with better outcomes, current guidelines do not recommend serial HVPG monitoring in routine practice due to limited availability, invasiveness, and lack of definitive cost-effectiveness data, and that transient elastography does not track changes in portal pressure, so it cannot be used to monitor therapy response. Instead, we will optimize beta-blocker therapy to heart rate and blood pressure targets and maintain surveillance endoscopy per protocol, escalating to TIPS only if rebleeding occurs despite combination therapy [^a2f944b3] [^21d8acd3] [^4892d1da].

Routine HVPG monitoring is **not recommended** for patients with cirrhosis and prior variceal bleeding who are receiving secondary prophylaxis with NSBB and EVL, as it does not change management or outcomes [^a2f944b3] [^21d8acd3]. HVPG may be considered in select research or tertiary-care settings, but it is **invasive, costly, and not widely available**. Transient elastography does not reliably track portal pressure changes and should not be used for this purpose [^a2f944b3]. The standard of care is to titrate NSBB to heart rate 55–60 bpm or the highest tolerated dose, with ongoing endoscopic surveillance and rescue TIPS if rebleeding occurs despite optimal therapy [^a7179fde] [^c87dd5bd].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

### AASLD guidance (2017 and 2024)

- **Routine HVPG monitoring**: Not recommended outside clinical trials; noninvasive tests do not correlate with HVPG changes [^a2f944b3] [^21d8acd3].
- **Secondary prophylaxis**: NSBB plus EVL is first-line; TIPS is reserved for rebleeding despite combination therapy [^e60e2e35] [^c87dd5bd].
- **NSBB titration**: Target heart rate 55–60 bpm or highest tolerated dose; monitor blood pressure and adverse effects [^a7179fde] [^0d7c9375].

---

### Baveno VII consensus (2022)

HVPG response to NSBB is associated with reduced rebleeding, but **routine HVPG monitoring is not recommended** due to invasiveness and limited availability [^fc554229].

---

### ESGE guidance (2022)

ESGE guidance emphasizes **NSBB plus EVL for secondary prophylaxis** and does not recommend routine HVPG monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Evidence for HVPG-guided therapy

### Potential benefits

HVPG reduction to ≤ 12 mmHg or by ≥ 20% is associated with lower rebleeding and improved survival [^fb08ac5c] [^fc554229]. A randomized trial suggested that **HVPG-guided therapy** reduced rebleeding and improved survival, but this has not been widely adopted due to practicality and availability [^ac21f01e].

---

### Limitations

HVPG is **invasive**, requires specialized equipment and expertise, and is not universally available; cost-effectiveness remains uncertain outside research settings [^49727014] [^97b30dbe].

---

## Noninvasive alternatives: transient elastography

Transient elastography (TE) is **useful for detecting CSPH** (LSM ≥ 25 kPa) but does not reliably track changes in portal pressure with therapy [^f4d438f6] [^9a2e99f9]. Therefore, TE is not recommended for monitoring response to NSBB or EVL [^a2f944b3].

---

## Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness

Routine HVPG monitoring does not improve outcomes or reduce rebleeding in standard practice. Cost-effectiveness is **unfavorable** given invasiveness, limited access, and lack of proven benefit in routine care [^97b30dbe].

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **NSBB titration**: Adjust to heart rate 55–60 bpm or highest tolerated dose; monitor blood pressure and adverse effects [^a7179fde] [^0d7c9375].
- **Endoscopic surveillance**: Repeat EGD every 3–6 months until eradication, then every 6–12 months [^a7179fde] [^0d7c9375].
- **Rescue therapy**: TIPS for rebleeding despite NSBB plus EVL [^c87dd5bd] [^4892d1da].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Routine HVPG monitoring | Not recommended outside trials [^a2f944b3] [^21d8acd3] |
| Transient elastography for monitoring | Not recommended [^a2f944b3] [^9a2e99f9] |
| NSBB plus EVL | First-line secondary prophylaxis [^e60e2e35] [^4892d1da] |
| TIPS | Rescue for rebleeding despite combination therapy [^c87dd5bd] [^4892d1da] |

---

Routine HVPG monitoring is **not recommended** for patients with cirrhosis and prior variceal bleeding who are receiving NSBB and EVL, as it does not change management or outcomes. Transient elastography does not track portal pressure changes and should not be used for this purpose. The standard approach is to optimize NSBB dosing, maintain endoscopic surveillance, and escalate to TIPS if rebleeding occurs despite optimal therapy.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis [^10755e9d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the result of portal hypertension, which is a major complication of liver cirrhosis and carries a high mortality rate. Because of the mortality associated with variceal bleeding, strategies for prevention of the first bleed is important. Risk stratification is important in determining those at risk of bleeding from varices and current data suggest that patients with large varices with red signs, severe underlying liver disease and those who have a hepatic venous pressure gradient of greater than 12 mmHg are at high risk of bleeding. Surveillance for varices in patients with cirrhosis is therefore important. The current review evaluates the role of various treatments in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The current first choice treatment is non-selective beta-blockers; which is cheap, easy to administer, and reduces the risk of first variceal haemorrhage significantly. Combination of beta-blockers and nitrates looks promising but needs further evaluation. Endoscopic variceal band ligation compares favourably with non-selective beta-blockers in preventing the first bleeding episode in cirrhotic patients and may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate, or have contraindications to beta-blockers. The role of monitoring the hepatic venous pressure gradient in those being treated with pharmacological agents, the role of newer drugs such as non-selective beta-blockers with intrinsic alpha-adrenergic activity and angiotensin receptor blockers require further evaluation.

### Ligation or propranolol for esophageal varices?-AAFP (...) [^5fbd622d]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices often spontaneously bleed; this condition is associated with mortality rates of 30 to 70 percent. Consequently, various therapies have been used to treat patients with bleeding from hepatic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. The most effective medical therapy is use of a nonselective beta blocker, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of first bleeding episodes and bleeding-related mortality. However, side effects often limit the use of these drugs. More aggressive therapies include endoscopic sclerotherapy and variceal ligation. Because of conflicting results in some studies, sclerotherapy is no longer recommended. Sarin and colleagues performed a prospective randomized trial that compared the safety and efficacy of endoscopic ligation and propranolol therapy in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. Eligible patients included those with portal hypertension and grade 3 or grade 4 varices diagnosed by endoscopy.

None of the patients had a prior history of variceal bleeding. After application of exclusion criteria, patients were randomly assigned at the time of the first endoscopic examination to undergo ligation or receive propranolol. Baseline electrocardiography and cardiac evaluation were performed after 15 minutes of rest. Propranolol was administered in a dose of 40 mg, with monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure 12 hours and 24 hours after dosing. The dosage of the beta blocker was increased in increments of 20 to 40 mg per day until a 25 percent decrease in baseline heart rate was attained. Treatment was stopped if the heart rate dropped below 55 beats per minute or if the systolic blood pressure was less than 80 mm Hg. Patients assigned to the ligation group underwent ligation at the first endoscopy session or within 24 hours, with as many bands as possible placed in the distal 5 to 7 cm of all variceal columns.

Endoscopic ligation was performed weekly until varices were obliterated or reduced to grade 1 size. After ligation was complete, patients underwent endoscopy monthly for three months, then once every three months until the 18-month end point. Any varices that recurred and became grade 2 or more were treated with repeat ligation. The principle end point of the study, bleeding from the varices, was diagnosed by endoscopy. Serious bleeding was considered to be a volume greater than 1, 500 mL, hemorrhage resulting in a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg and the patient's requiring more than 4 units of blood in six hours. Ninety patients were enrolled in the study, with 46 assigned to receive ligation and 44 to propranolol therapy. The mean dose of propranolol was 70 mg per day. In patients receiving ligation, the mean number of endoscopy sessions was 3. 2, which were performed over an average of
4. 1 weeks.

During the study period, four patients in the ligation group and 12 patients in the medication group experienced variceal bleeding. In three of the four patients from the ligation group, the bleeding occurred within the first six weeks, before all of the varices could be eradicated. After 18 months of follow-up, the cumulative risk of bleeding was 43 percent in the propanolol group and 15 percent in the ligation group. Each group had five deaths, all related to liver disorders. The number of deaths related to bleeding was similar between the two groups: three patients in the ligation group and four patients in the propranolol group. No serious complications occurred in the ligation group and, although 16 patients receiving a beta blocker experienced adverse effects, only two patients stopped this therapy. The authors conclude that in patients with significant grade 3 or grade 4 esophageal varices, rubber band ligation is superior to propranolol therapy in preventing primary bleeding.

### Preventing first variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis [^ee379b9f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is still a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension responsible for an appreciable rate of morbidity and mortality. The most appropriate treatment approach, whether drugs (nonselective beta-blockers) or endoscopic (variceal band ligation) therapy, to prevent the initial bleed, or primary prophylaxis, is an issue of controversy. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that banding seems to be somehow slightly more effective than beta-blockers at preventing a first bleeding episode, but this does not translate to improved survival. The firmness of this conclusion is, in addition, diminished by the small sample size and short follow-up of most studies. Moreover, adverse events due to banding are more severe than those associated with beta-blockers. Thus, beta-blockers remain as first-line therapy in patients with cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers can be considered in patients with small varices, especially in those with red signs or Child class C liver disease. The available evidence does not support the idea that organic nitrates improve the efficacy of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis. The method used to establish the dose of beta-blockers and check its effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) has also been disputed. An attractive strategy is to measure the HVPG response to beta-blockers as a guide to primary prophylaxis, with the aim of switching to another therapy, that is, band ligation, in HVPG nonresponders. However, no study has yet demonstrated that banding as rescue therapy in nonresponders lowers the risk of first bleeding and improves survival.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^d993a2fe]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension—management of compensated cirrhosis with a contraindication to or intolerance of beta-blockers: Patients with compensated cirrhosis who have contraindication for beta-blockers or who do not tolerate beta-blockers have at present no further therapeutic options to avoid clinical decompensation other than control of the underlying disease. Although a possible benefit of statins to prevent decompensation in this setting is pathophysiologically plausible and retrospective studies suggest that statins reduce the incidence of decompensation, there are insufficient data to recommend its routine use. Patients with a standard indication for statin therapy should continue treatment, and statins should not be discouraged when indicated. In patient with cACLD with CSPH for whom beta-blockers cannot be safely administered, endoscopic surveillance should be initiated with an intent to prevent first variceal hemorrhage (primary prophylaxis) through prophylactic endoscopic band ligation of high-risk varices. Performance of an endoscopy every 2 years is recommended; however, if cause of the liver disease is under control (alcohol abstinence, weight control, viral suppression or elimination, etc.), endoscopic surveillance may be done every 3 years. In some cases, cessation of surveillance may be considered after negative serial endoscopic assessments.

### Portal hypertension: pre-primary and primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^e90f225e]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

In liver cirrhosis, variceal bleeding is the last in a chain of events initiated by the increase in portal pressure (estimated in clinical practice by the hepatic venous pressure gradient). When hepatic venous pressure gradient goes above 10 mmHg the patient is at risk of developing varices, and when hepatic venous pressure gradient reaches 12 mmHg variceal bleeding might develop. Currently, there is not any effective therapy for the prevention of the development of varices. When varices are small, beta-adrenergic blockers might prevent the enlargement of the varices, and may reduce the risk of variceal bleeding. In patients with medium to large varices, beta-blockers are clearly effective in reducing the risk of variceal bleeding. Endoscopic band ligation might be more effective than beta-blockers, but available evidence is still very weak.

### Precision medicine in variceal bleeding: are we there yet? [^57a0fb83]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the most feared complications of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis because of its deleterious impact on prognosis. Adequate management of patients at risk of developing variceal bleeding includes the prevention of the first episode of variceal bleeding and rebleeding, and is crucial in modifying prognosis. The presence of clinically significant portal hypertension is the main factor determining the risk of development of varices and other liver-related decompensations; therefore, it should be carefully screened for and monitored. Treating patients with clinically significant portal hypertension based on their individual risk of portal hypertension-related bleeding undoubtedly improves prognosis. The evaluation of liver haemodynamics and liver function can stratify patients according to their risk of bleeding and are no question useful tools to guide therapy in an individualised manner. That said, recent data support the idea that tailoring therapy to patient characteristics may effectively impact on prognosis and increase survival in all clinical scenarios. This review will focus on evaluating the available evidence supporting the use of individual risk characteristics for clinical decision-making and their impact on clinical outcome and survival. In primary prophylaxis, identification and treatment of patients with clinically significant portal hypertension improves decompensation-free survival. In the setting of acute variceal bleeding, the risk of failure and rebleeding can be easily predicted, allowing for early escalation of treatment (i.e. pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) which can improve survival in appropriate candidates. Stratifying the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding based on liver function and haemodynamic response to non-selective beta-blockers allows for tailored treatment, thereby increasing survival and avoiding adverse events.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^07f406a1]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI <30kg/m 2 ] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] >10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography >25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding.Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding [^31ad7546]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension bleeding is a common and serious complication of cirrhosis. All patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopy and be evaluated for possible causes of current or future portal hypertensive bleeding. Possible causes of bleeding include esophageal varices, gastric varices, and PHG. Patients with esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding should be treated with nonselective beta-blockers for primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. HVPG measurements represent the optimal way to monitor the success of pharmacologic therapy. EVL may be used in those with high-risk varices who do not tolerate beta-blockers. When active bleeding develops, simultaneous and coordinated attention must be given to hemodynamic resuscitation, prevention and treatment of complications, and active control of bleeding. In cases of acute esophageal variceal (Fig. 5) and PHG bleeding, terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide should be started. Endoscopic treatment is provided for those with bleeding esophageal varices. If first-line therapy fails, TIPS or surgery may need to be performed. Unlike esophageal variceal or PHG bleeding, there is no established optimal treatment for gastric variceal bleeding. Individual and specific treatment modalities for acute gastric variceal bleeding must be calculated carefully after considering side effects.

Prevention of recurrent esophageal variceal hemorrhage—dosing, targets, and follow-up: Propranolol is given as 20-40 mg orally twice a day with adjustment every 2-3 days until the goal is achieved; maximal daily dose is 320 mg/day in patients without ascites and 160 mg/day in patients with ascites, with therapy goals of resting heart rate of 55-60 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure should not decrease <90 mm Hg, and maintenance to verify at every outpatient visit that heart rate is on target and to continue indefinitely. Nadolol is given as 20-40 mg orally once a day with adjustment every 2-3 days until the goal is achieved; maximal daily dose is 160 mg/day in patients without ascites and 80 mg/day in patients with ascites, with the same therapy goals and maintenance. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is performed every 1-4 weeks until eradication, with the goal of variceal eradication (no further ligation possible) and follow-up with first EGD performed 3-6 months after eradication and every 6-12 months thereafter; the combination of either propranolol or nadolol plus EVL is recommended, and carvedilol is not recommended in this setting.

### Targeting portal pressure measurements: a critical reappraisal [^f8281a8f]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Many of the complications of cirrhosis reflect the presence of portal hypertension, which is commonly expressed as the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Baseline and repeat measurements of HVPG have been recommended for the management of patients with cirrhosis in the setting of pharmacologic prophylaxis of variceal bleeding and for gaining information about prognosis. However, published studies have demonstrated problems with the interpretation of the data on HVPG monitoring, making its use controversial. We view the current data as insufficient evidence to support the monitoring of a targeted reduction of HVPG as routine clinical practice. We recommend the performance of new prospective studies to establish the clinical importance of HVPG measurements.

Our analysis of data from a large collection of electronic healthcare records represents robust evidence on the outcomes and mortality of patients with diagnosed/suspected portal hypertension. Despite use of beta blockers and surveillance endoscopy with variceal banding in modern care, morbidity and mortality remain high both in patients with more and less severe disease states, that is, those with and without variceal haemorrhage. A renewed effort is required to manage patients with portal hypertension using existing treatment strategies but also by developing new therapies, particularly with respect to reducing the risk of variceal haemorrhage and worsening of ascites.

Disease management strategies have gained attention in recent years because of their potential to improve health-related quality of life and prevent excessive resource use. Despite recognition as an important cause of mortality, cirrhosis with portal hypertension has not been widely discussed as a condition amenable to planned care management. Given the effect of variceal hemorrhage as the most immediate life-threatening complication of portal hypertension, a number of high-quality controlled clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis. Despite the existence of practice guidelines that incorporate this information, specific clinical scenarios that demand consideration for beta-blocker therapy have not been well described. In this article, a number of hypothetical patient-based cases drawn from the authors' experiences are utilized to illustrate these issues.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^70aaee47]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

### Variceal bleeding and portal hypertensive gastropathy [^82624d31]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis can be the end stage of any chronic liver disease. At the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis varices are present in about 60% of decompensated and 30% of compensated patients. The risk factors for the first episode of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients are the severity of liver dysfunction, large size of varices and the presence of endoscopic red colour signs but only one-third of patients who have variceal haemorrhage have the above risk factors. Recent interest has been directed at identifying haemodynamic factors that may reflect the pathophysiological changes which lead to variceal bleeding, e.g. it has been confirmed that no bleeding occurs if HVPG falls below 12 mmHg and also a hypothesis has been put forward in which bacterial infection is considered a trigger for bleeding. Pharmacological treatment with beta-blockers is safe, effective and is the standard long-term treatment for the prevention of recurrence of variceal bleeding. Combination of beta-blockers with isosorbide-5-mononitrate needs further testing in randomized controlled trials. The use of haemodynamic targets for reduction in HVPG response needs further study, and surrogate markers of pressure response need evaluation. If endoscopic treatment is chosen, variceal ligation is the modality of choice. The combination of simultaneous variceal ligation and sclerotherapy does not offer any benefit. However, the use of additional sclerotherapy for the complete eradication of small varices after variceal ligation needs to be evaluated. The results of current prospective randomized controlled trials comparing variceal ligation with pharmacological treatment are awaited with great interest. Finally, the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding is not substantiated by current data, as survival is not improved and because of its worse cost-benefit profile compared to other treatments. In contrast, there still is a role for the selective surgical shunts in the modern management of portal hypertension. The ideal patients should be well compensated cirrhotics, who have had troublesome bleeding - either who have failed at least one other modality of therapy (drugs or ligation), have bled from gastric varices despite medical or endoscopic therapy, or live far from suitable medical services. Recently, ligation has been compared to beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis but so far there is no good evidence to recommend banding for primary prophylaxis, if beta-blockers can be given.

### Beta-blockers in liver cirrhosis [^bed38517]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Since the original description of the effectiveness of β-blockers in lowering the portal pressure and therefore the risk of variceal bleeding, more than 500 articles in the English literature on the use of non selective β-blockers (NSBB) in cirrhosis have been published. The use of NSBB in pre-primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is currently not indicated. In primary prophylaxis, patients with high risk small varices or large/medium varices should receive primary prophylaxis either with NSBB or with endoscopic band ligation if there are contraindications to NSBB. For secondary prophylaxis the current recommendation is to receive a combination of NSBB and endoscopic variceal ligation. In addition to lowering portal pressure, NSBB can also reduce bacterial translocation, potentially exerting multiple beneficial effects which go beyond the reduction of bleeding risk. Carvedilol is a NSBB with intrinsic anti-α(1)-adrenergic activity, possibly more effective than propranolol in lowering portal hypertension. A potential harmful effect of propranolol in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites deserves further confirmation. NSBB remain the cornerstone of therapy in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.

### Differences in bleeding behavior after endoscopic band ligation: a retrospective analysis [^cfdbf100]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension is a hemostatic disorder that is often caused by liver cirrhosis. It is defined as an increase in blood pressure in the portal venous system. Portal hypertension can be the origin of severe complications in cirrhosis. Gastroesophageal varices are a potentially life-threatening complication of portal hypertension. Even though the outcome of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices has improved, it is still associated with a high mortality rate. The mortality rate of acute variceal bleeding has decreased from 42% in 1981 to about 15% to 20% at present [-].

Risk factors for bleeding from esophageal varices have been identified in several randomized controlled trials (RCT). Poor Child-Pugh score [,-], bacterial infection [-], elevated aspartate amino transferase levels, and a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 20 mmHg, measured shortly after admission [,,-], are associated with a higher bleeding rate.

Management of acute variceal bleeding consists of pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment. Endoscopic techniques currently used to stop variceal bleeding are endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal obturation with glue and endoscopic band ligation (EBL). EBL is the endoscopic treatment of choice because it is an effective treatment for bleeding from esophageal varices. It is generally accepted and recommended for the treatment of acute bleeding events. EBL is also used for the secondary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal hemorrhage [-].

Non-selective beta-blockers are the treatment of choice to prevent initial bleeding episodes. However, beta-blockers do not prevent formation of esophageal varices. For primary prophylaxis of esophageal bleeding, EBL should be restricted to patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers [,-].

EBL sessions are usually repeated at 1-2 week intervals until complete obliteration of all esophageal varices has been achieved. Complete obliteration is achieved in about 90% of patients after 2-4 sessions. Variceal recurrence occurs frequently, with 20%-75% of patients requiring repeated EBL sessions.

Screening, surveillance and prophylaxis of variceal bleeding

All patients with DC who are not on a non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) should undergo endoscopy to screen for varices. The risk of progression to high-risk varices is higher in decompensated disease,so we recommend annual surveillance in all patients not already receiving primary prophylaxis. Patients with Child-Pugh C disease and small varices should have primary prophylaxis with NSBB if tolerated. All patients with medium-to-large varices/red signs should have primary prophylaxis with NSBB or variceal band ligation (VBL) (figure 2). Patients on NSBB for primary prevention do not require further surveillance endoscopy. Those who have VBL for primary prevention should be scoped approximately every 4 weeks until the varices are eradicated and then have ongoing surveillance annually until they recompensate and the underlying aetiological driver for their liver disease is removed (eg, abstinence from alcohol).

Figure 2 
Surveillance and treatment of non-bleeding gastrooesophageal varices indecompensated cirrhosis. + Titrate from 6.25 mg od to target 12.5 mg od in single or divided doses if tolerated (maintain HR, 50–60, systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg). *Small varices defined as <5 mm diameter or varices which completely disappear with moderate insufflation of the oesophagus, medium-large varices >5 mm diameter. NSSB, non-selective beta blocker; VBL, variceal band ligation.

Secondary prevention of variceal haemorrhage is important, as the risk of rebleeding can be as high as 60% with 20% mortality for each rebleeding episode.A combination of NSBB and VBL is recommended.Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPSS) has a role in secondary prevention in high-risk cases, where patients rebleed despite NSBB and VBL, or where there are additional indications such as refractory/recurrent ascites.Careful patient selection is necessary (see BSG guidelines on TIPSS in portal hypertension), including consideration of liver transplantation (LT) where appropriate.

Table 3—management of patients with moderate/large varices that have not bled—details dosing, targets, and follow-up for propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Propranolol is 20-40 mg orally twice a day, adjusted every 2-3 days to achieve resting heart rate of 55-60 beats per minute while systolic blood pressure should not decrease <90 mm Hg; maximal daily doses are 320 mg/day without ascites and 160 mg/day with ascites, with checks at every outpatient visit to ensure heart rate target, continued indefinitely, and no need for follow-up EGD. Nadolol is 20-40 mg orally once a day, adjusted every 2-3 days with the same goals (resting heart rate of 55-60 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure should not decrease <90 mm Hg); maximal daily doses are 160 mg/day without ascites and 80 mg/day with ascites, continued indefinitely without need for follow-up EGD. Carvedilol starts with 6.25 mg once a day with a maximal dose of 12.5 mg/day (except in patients with persistent arterial hypertension); the goal is that systolic arterial blood pressure should not decrease <90 mm Hg, therapy is continued indefinitely, and there is no need for follow-up EGD. EVL is performed every 2-8 weeks until eradication of varices with variceal eradication (no further ligation possible) as the goal, followed by first EGD at 3-6 months after eradication and every 6-12 months thereafter.

### A randomized trial to assess whether portal pressure guided therapy to prevent variceal rebleeding improves survival in cirrhosis [^ac21f01e]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Monitoring the hemodynamic response of portal pressure (PP) to drug therapy accurately stratifies the risk of variceal rebleeding (VRB). We assessed whether guiding therapy with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) monitoring may improve survival by preventing VRB. Patients with cirrhosis with controlled variceal bleeding were randomized to an HVPG-guided therapy group (N=84) or to a control group (N=86). In both groups, HVPG and acute β-blocker response were evaluated at baseline and HVPG measurements were repeated at 2-4 weeks to determine chronic response. In the HVPG-guided group, acute responders were treated with nadolol and acute nonresponders with nadolol+nitrates. Chronic nonresponders received nadolol+prazosin and had a third HVPG study. Ligation sessions were repeated until response was achieved. The control group was treated with nadolol+nitrates+ligation. Between-group baseline characteristics were similar. During long-term follow-up (median of 24 months), mortality was lower in the HVPG-guided therapy group than in the control group (29% vs. 43%; hazard ratio [HR]=0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.35-0.99). Rebleeding occurred in 19% versus 31% of patients, respectively (HR=0.53; 95% CI=0.29-0.98), and further decompensation of cirrhosis occurred in 52% versus 72% (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.46-0.99). The survival probability was higher with HVPG-guided therapy than in controls, both in acute (HR=0.59; 95% CI=0.32-1.08) and chronic nonresponders (HR=0.48; 95% CI=0.23-0.99). HVPG-guided patients had a greater reduction of HVPG and a lower final value than controls (P<0.05).

Conclusion

HVPG monitoring, by stratifying risk and targeting therapy, improves the survival achieved with currently recommended treatment to prevent VRB using β-blockers and ligation. HVPG-guided therapy achieved a greater reduction in PP, which may have contributed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and of further decompensation of cirrhosis, thus contributing to a better survival.

### Prevention of variceal rebleeding [^6c4fd2e5]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Variceal bleeding is the most frequent severe complication of portal hypertension and a leading cause of death and liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis. Patients surviving a variceal bleed are at high risk of rebleeding (over 60% at 1 year). Portacaval shunts and transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunts (TIPS) are effective for prevention of rebleeding but carry a high risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Endoscopic techniques include band ligation (EBL) and injection sclerotherapy (EIS). Drug approaches are based on non-selective beta blocker with or without isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN).

Starting Point

David Patch and colleagues (Gastroenterology 2002; 123: 1013-19) randomised 102 patients surviving a variceal bleeding to EBL or drug therapy with propranolol with the addition of ISMN if target reductions in portal pressure (evaluated by the hepatic venous pressure-gradient [HVPG]) were not achieved at 3 months. Overall, results of drug therapy were similar to those of EBL (44% vs 54% rebleeding at 1 year). There were no differences in survival or non-bleeding complications. Christophe Bureau and colleagues (Hepatology 2002; 36: 1361-66) treated 34 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension with propranolol and measured HVPG after a median of 4 days. Target HVPG reductions were achieved in 13 "responders". ISMN was added in the 21 "non-responders" and HVPG measured again: seven more patients achieved target HPVG reduction. Re-bleeding rates were lower in responders than in non-responders (10% vs 64%). Both studies suggest that drug therapy can be improved by adding ISMN to b blockers in those patients with an insufficient decrease in HVPG. WHERE NEXT? Long-term drug therapy is emerging as effective treatment for the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The role of HVPG monitoring as a guide to identifying patients requiring further treatment needs to be further evaluated. Trials to determine the best treatment for patients who do not respond to drug therapies are also required.

### Monitoring target reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient during pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension: a close look at the evidence [^181b8ef6]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent variceal bleeding is very frequent after variceal haemorrhage and pharmacological therapy is the first choice treatment. Recently, baseline and repeat measurements of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) have been considered necessary to optimally manage patients receiving pharmacological therapy so as to reduce the frequency of rebleeding. However, the clinical validity and applicability of monitoring for target HVPG reductions is not sufficiently proven and needs to be specifically evaluated in a prospective trial.

### Variceal rebleeding and recurrence after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (...) [^c55134ed]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Hypothesis Eradication of esophageal varices by repeated injection sclerotherapy and maintenance of eradication using continued surveillance endoscopy may reduce recurrent variceal bleeding and death from esophageal varices. Design A prospective study of consecutive adult patients with endoscopically proved esophageal variceal bleeding. Rebleeding was markedly reduced after eradication of varices. Varices recurred in 56 patients, of whom only 10 rebled from recurrent esophageal varices. Cumulative survival by life table analysis was 55%, 41%, and 30% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Conclusions Repeated injection sclerotherapy eradicated esophageal varices in most long-term patients. Complications related to injection sclerotherapy were mostly minor. Complete eradication of varices reduced rebleeding and death from esophageal varices. with actively bleeding esophageal varices.

5-12 Even though the initial bleed may effectively be controlled by sclerotherapy, the risk of subsequent rebleeding is substantial. 13-18 There is general consensus that patients surviving a bleeding episode should be treated to prevent rebleeding. 19-21 Considerable evidence has. The data presented are based on a protocol using a standardized injection technique, with eradication of esophageal varices the predetermined end point of repeated sclerotherapy.
37. All patients included in the study were referred either with active variceal bleeding or after an endoscopically proved variceal bleed, and received emergency sclerotherapy. All injection treatments, emergency and subsequent elective injections, were analyzed to assess the role of fiberoptic sclerotherapy in long-term management. All patients were studied prospectively, and the data were entered in a computer program by a research assistant.

During the 66-month study period, 218 consecutive adult patients were treated for esophageal variceal bleeding. Two hundred four patients were examined. Fourteen patients were excluded from the study analysis, 13 of whom underwent esophageal transection and gastric devascularization as part of a randomized trial after initial control of acute variceal bleeding by sclerotherapy and 1 who underwent liver transplantation. Rebleeding was treated according to endoscopic findings. Additional sclerotherapy was undertaken if bleeding was the result of patent residual or recurrent varices. Other sources of bleeding, such as peptic ulceration, gastric varices, erosive gastritis, or portal hypertensive gastropathy, were included in the definition of rebleeding. Eradication of varices was defined as the absence of varices on subsequent endoscopic examination during follow-up visits. Sixty-one patients bled from varices, and 13 bled from nonvariceal sources.

The 61 patients had 86 variceal bleeds that were successfully treated with short-term emergency IST on 61 occasions. The remaining 25 patients with variceal bleeds were not treated by short-term sclerotherapy and were managed with esophageal balloon tamponade followed by subsequent IST. Thirteen patients had 26 bleeding episodes from nonvariceal causes. Nine bleeding episodes were due to bleeding from esophageal injection–induced ulceration and were settled with conservative treatment, which included blood transfusions, intravenous vasopressin, and oral sucralfate. The remaining 17 bleeding episodes were from gastric varices, 4 gastric erosions, 7 portal hypertensive gastropathy, 3 gastric ulceration, 2 or duodenal ulceration.
1. Varices were eradicated in 11 of the 13 patients with primary extrahepatic portal venous obstruction after a mean of 5 injections during a mean of 11 months in the eradicated patients.

The hepato-venous pressure gradient (HVPG), a surrogate marker of portal pressure [-], has been utilized to monitor the hemodynamic response in patients with portal hypertension taking NSBB. Previous studies have shown that those patients who obtain a reduction of HVPG greater than 20% from baseline or to <12 mmHg, are to be considered “hemodynamic responders”, and will benefit from a significant reduction in risk of variceal bleeding.

The most commonly used guidelines for the management of portal hypertension are the ones agreed at the last international consensus conference on portal hypertension (Baveno V), which include recommendations for pre-primary, primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding with NSBB.

Pre-primary prophylaxis is aimed at preventing the development of esophageal varices. While some pathophysiological experimental studies have suggested a role of NSBB in preventing the development of the collateral circulation, only few studies were performed to test this hypothesis in humans. A multicenter study randomized 213 cirrhotics without varices and HVPG >6 mmHg to be treated with NSBB or placebo. This study showed that NSBB did not prevent the formation of varices and were even associated with an increased number of adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment. As a result, the use of NSBB in pre-primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is currently not indicated.

### The cost-effectiveness of hepatic venous pressure gradient monitoring in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage [^97b30dbe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Recurrent variceal hemorrhage is common following an initial bleed in patients with cirrhosis. The current standard of care for secondary prophylaxis is endoscopic band ligation (EBL). Combination of beta-blocker and nitrate therapy, guided by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) monitoring, is a novel alternative strategy. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of these competing strategies.

Methods

Decision analysis with Markov modeling was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of three competing strategies: (1) EBL; (2) beta-blocker and nitrate therapy without HVPG monitoring (HVPG-); and (3) beta-blocker and nitrate therapy with HVPG monitoring (HVPG+). Patients in the HVPG+ strategy who failed to achieve an HVPG decline from medical therapy were offered EBL. Cost estimates were from a third-party payer perspective. The main outcome measure was the cost per recurrent variceal hemorrhage prevented.

Results

Under base-case conditions, the HVPG+ strategy was the most effective yet most expensive approach, followed by EBL and HVPG-. Compared to the EBL strategy, the HVPG+ strategy cost an incremental 5,974 dollars per recurrent bleed prevented. In a population with 100% compliance with all therapies, the incremental cost of HVPG-versus EBL fell to 5,270 dollars per recurrent bleed prevented. The model results were sensitive to the cost of EBL, the cost of HVPG monitoring, and the probability of medical therapy producing an adequate HVPG decline.

Conclusions

Compared to EBL for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal rebleeding, combination medical therapy guided by HVPG monitoring is more effective and only marginally more expensive.

### A randomized, controlled trial of medical therapy versus endoscopic ligation for the prevention of variceal rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis [^536f74fd]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients who have had one variceal bleed are at high risk of rebleeding. Since its introduction, endoscopic variceal banding has been shown to be superior to needle sclerotherapy. Banding has not been compared with hepatic venous pressure-guided medical therapy (beta-blockers and nitrates).

Methods

One hundred two patients with cirrhosis and a recent esophageal variceal bleed were randomized to either endoscopic banding (51 patients) or medical therapy (51 patients). The hepatic venous pressure gradient was measured in all patients at baseline, at 3 months (drug therapy arm), and at yearly intervals (all patients). Primary end points were death or rebleeding.

Results

The 2 groups were well matched. Fifty-one percent were Pughs C, with a median Pughs score of 9.5. Nineteen patients rebled in the drug arm (median time, 24 days) and 27 patients in the banding arm (median time, 24 days). At 1 year, 43.7% of patients had bled in the drug arm compared with 53.8% in the banding arm (P = 0.25). Thirty-two percent of patients on medical therapy had died at 1 year, 22.5% on banding (P = 0.97).

Conclusions

In the prevention of variceal rebleeding, beta-blockers +/- nitrates are as effective as endoscopic banding.

### Hemodynamic response to primary prophylactic therapy with nonselective β-blockers is related to a reduction of first variceal bleeding risk in liver cirrhosis: a meta-analysis [^7c4170a6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The current primary prophylaxis for esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients consists of nonselective β-blocker (NSBB) therapy. However, only approximately half of the patients achieve a sufficient hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy. Clinical application of hemodynamic response monitoring is still under debate. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the potential clinical value of monitoring the hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy using hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements in the primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the COCHRANE Library. Randomized-controlled trials and case series that included cirrhotic patients receiving primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding with NSBBs and hemodynamic response monitoring using HVPG measurements were included for analysis. The primary outcome measure was variceal bleeding. A fixed-effect analysis was carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel method for relative risks. Six of the 1172 papers found were selected on the basis of stringent selection criteria. Hemodynamic response (HVPG ≤12mmHg and/or a reduction of ≥20%, or ≥10% in one study, from baseline) to β-blocker therapy was associated significantly with a lower risk of variceal bleeding (relative risk=0.13, 95% confidence interval=0.06-0.29) compared with a nonresponse. Patients achieving a hemodynamic response to NSBB therapy have a lower risk of variceal bleeding than hemodynamic nonresponders. Hemodynamic monitoring in primary prophylaxis is of potential clinical value and requires further assessment in large cohort randomized-controlled trials.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^fe144fe7]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

APASL PBC guidance—Portal hypertension screening and prophylaxis: A screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be performed in patients with cirrhotic features at the time of the diagnosis, and patients with features of portal hypertension (ie. splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia) should be screened for gastroesophageal varices (II, 2). The Baveno-VI criteria (LSM by TE < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150×10^9/L) can identify patients who may not need screening EGD, with one study showing this strategy could avoid 39% of screening EGD with a false negative rate of 0%. Nonselective beta-blockers and/or endoscopic band ligation is indicated for large esophageal varices or variceal hemorrhage.

### Bleeding caused by portal hypertension [^b6a09b7d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the dreaded complications of portal hypertension. Patients who have suspected or proven cirrhosis should undergo diagnostic upper endoscopy to detect medium and large gastro-esophageal varices. Patients with medium and large gastro-esophageal varices should be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol), and these agents should be titrated to a heart rate of 55 beats per minute or adverse effects. If there are contraindications to or if patients are intolerant to beta-blockers, it is appropriate to consider prophylactic banding therapy for individuals with medium-to-large esophageal varices. When patients who have cirrhosis present with GI bleeding, they should be resuscitated and receive octreotide or other vasoactive agents. Endoscopy should be performed promptly to diagnose the source of bleeding and to provide endoscopic therapy (preferably banding). The currently available treatment for acute variceal bleeding provides hemostasis in most patients. These patients, however, are at significant risk for rebleeding unless secondary prophylaxis is provided. Although various pharmacological, endoscopic, radiological, and surgical options are available, combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy is the most common form of secondary prophylaxis. TIPS is a radiologically placed portasystemic shunt, and if placed in suitable patients, it can provide effective treatment for patients with variceal bleeding that is refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy.

### Management of varices in patients with cirrhosis [^d6d662f7]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Variceal bleeding remains a life-threatening condition with a 6-week mortality rate of ∼20%. Prevention of variceal bleeding can be achieved using nonselective β-blockers (NSBBs) or endoscopic band ligation (EBL), with NSBBs as the first-line treatment. EBL should be reserved for cases of intolerance or contraindications to NSBBs. Although NSBBs cannot be used to prevent varices, if the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is ≤10 mmHg, prognosis is excellent. Survival after acute variceal bleeding has improved over the past three decades, but patients with Child-Pugh grade C cirrhosis remain at greatest risk. Vasoactive drugs combined with endoscopic therapy and antibiotics are the best therapeutic strategy for these patients. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) should be used in patients with uncontrolled bleeding or those who are likely to have difficult-to-control bleeding. Rebleeding from varices occurs in ∼60% of patients 1-2 years after the initial bleeding episode, with a mortality rate of 30%. Secondary prophylaxis should start at day 6 after initial bleeding using a combination of NSBBs and EBL. TIPS with polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents are the preferred option in patients who fail combined treatment with NSBBs and EBL. Despite the improvement in patient survival, further studies are needed to direct the management of patients with gastro-oesophageal varices and variceal bleeding.

### Portal hypertension and variceal bleeding in patients with liver cancer: evidence gaps for prevention and management [^88080ff8]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Portal hypertension (PHT) and HCC are 2 major complications of cirrhosis that often coexist in the same patient and impact the prognosis, especially in patients with acute variceal bleeding. In this review, we aim to discuss the best strategy for PHT screening and primary prophylaxis, as well as the management of acute variceal bleeding, to improve the management of PHT in HCC patients.

Results

Recent therapeutic advances observed in the management of HCC, notably through the advent of immunotherapy, have led to a clear improvement in the survival of patients. The prevention of complications related to underlying cirrhosis, such as PHT and acute variceal bleeding, is now part of the management of HCC patients. The Baveno VII conference recently redefined screening and prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis. However, data regarding the applicability of these criteria in patients with HCC have been sparse. From our point of view, the Baveno criteria are not appropriate to exclude high-risk esophageal varices (EV) in HCC patients, and endoscopy should be performed except in HCC patients with a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥25 kPa, who should benefit from nonselective beta-blockers (NSSBs) without performing endoscopy. We are also in favor of using NSBBs as primary prophylaxis in patients with EV regardless of the size and with gastric varices since these patients display clinically significant PHT.

Conclusions

Appropriate evaluation and treatment of PHT remain major issues in improving the outcomes of HCC patients. Many questions remain unanswered, opening the field to many areas of research.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients: a cohort study [^63d6003d]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend beta-blockers for primary prevention of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients, and band ligation for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers. However, it has been suggested that these patients may respond poorly to band ligation.

Aim

We evaluated the usefulness of a strategy in which band ligation was used to treat patients with contraindications or intolerance and patients not responding to beta-blockers identified by hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement. Haemodynamic responders and patients refusing hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement were given long-term beta-blockers.

Methods

One hundred and thirty-five consecutive patients with high-risk oesophageal varices and no prior bleeding were enrolled. Twenty-five patients with contraindications (group A), 26 with intolerance to beta-blockers (group B) and 25 showing a poor haemodynamic response (Group C) underwent band ligation. Twenty-two haemodynamic responders (Group D) and 37 refusing hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement (Group E) were treated with beta-blockers.

Results

Median follow-up was 32 months. 12/135 patients (8.9%) bled: 3/25 (12%) in group A, 1/26 (3.8%) in group B, 0/25 (0%) in group C, 0/22 (0%) in group D and 8/37 (22.2%) in group E. Mortality was 8/135 (5.9%).

Conclusions

Patients with contraindications, intolerance or not responding to beta-blockers treated with band ligation achieve protection from variceal bleeding comparable to that of good responders to beta-blockers.

### Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of carvedilol versus variceal band ligation in primary prevention of variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis (CALIBRE trial) [^53cec91e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Beta-blockers as first-line therapy in primary prevention will lead to a large change in practice as NICE guidance presently recommends variceal band ligation. Beta-blockers require much less National Health Service (NHS) resources than variceal band ligation for primary prevention, which usually requires at least 3–5 treatments to eradicate varices followed by indefinite endoscopic surveillance. There is no requirement for patients on carvedilol for primary prevention to undergo endoscopic surveillance.Bed pressures for other elective procedures could be eased and waiting times improved.

Internal pilot trial

The first 12 months of the CALIBRE trial will constitute an internal pilot, to assess and confirm logistics, and to determine if it is both feasible and practical for the trial to continue. Integrated qualitative research with patients and staff will contribute to assessments of feasibility and acceptability as detailed later. The qualitative research could lead to changes in the trial protocol as necessary to minimise potential barriers to recruitment and facilitate recruitment in the main trial. The results of the internal pilot will be assessed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and the funder.

Primary objective

The primary aim of this study is to compare carvedilol versus variceal band ligation in preventing any variceal bleeding within 1 year of randomisation in patients with cirrhosis and medium to large oesophageal varices that have never bled.

Secondary objectives

These include the effect of carvedilol and variceal band ligation on survival, development of other complications of cirrhosis and adverse events. The study will also investigate cost-effectiveness, patient preference and use of alternative or cross over therapies.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^7ddaf726]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Coagulation in cirrhosis—portal vein thrombosis (PVT) anticoagulation strategy, monitoring, and variceal prophylaxis are outlined as follows: In acute PVT with uncertain bleeding risk, heparin infusion may be used in hospital then transitioned to low‑molecular‑weight heparin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for compensated cirrhosis, and Warfarin should be avoided when possible. Anticoagulation may reduce PVT volume as early as 2 weeks on therapy; in a systematic review/meta-analysis, treatment ranged from 3 to 12 months with outcomes of 71% achieved at least partial recanalization and 53% had complete recanalization after approximately 6 months of treatment. Consequently, repeat imaging at 6 months is appropriate and if clot resolution is incomplete after therapeutic anticoagulation of at least 6 months’ duration, treatment options include prolonging therapy, switching anticoagulant class, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting. Patients with PVT should be assessed for varices and managed with nonselective β-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation; studies reported significantly lower variceal bleeding with anticoagulation (odds ratio, 0.23), and primary prophylaxis while on therapeutic anticoagulation seems ideally with non-selective β-blockade.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^9c9ac334]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are present in almost half of patients with cirrhosis at the time of initial diagnosis. Variceal bleeding occurs in 25% to 35% of patients with cirrhosis. Effective and timely care can prevent variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis). For example, clinical studies demonstrate that both beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation are effective in preventing a first episode of variceal bleeding. The major challenge is to screen patients in a timely manner and institute a form of therapy that has the highest chance of success in terms of patient compliance and effectiveness.

### Dose optimization of non-selective beta blockers among esophageal varices patients at university of gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, northwest Ethiopia: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^25f518b4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy with non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) is the mainstay for treating portal hypertension. To lower the risk of variceal bleeding by decreasing the hepatic venous portal pressure gradient, nonselective b-blockers (NSBBs) are commonly administered. NSBB therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in lowering variceal bleeding or re-bleeding in both primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding, either by itself or in combination with endoscopic band ligation. It has also been demonstrated that NSBB therapy affects other outcomes, such as lowering the incidence of ascites.

Non-selective B-blockers are beneficial in reducing variceal bleeding when the dose is titrated to the highest tolerated dosage to achieve the therapeutic aim. In Ethiopia and throughout Africa, the level of B-blocker optimization is unknown. The optimization rate was a pitiful 9.8% when it was done in Texas, USA, so doing this study is crucial in our setup; we used mainly medical management (B-blockers) in managing esophageal varices. This study highlights scientific gaps in the management of patients with esophageal varices in rural areas of Ethiopia and may provide guidance for enhanced quality of care. Additionally, the findings can serve as a baseline for further research in this area. This study primarily aimed to assess the optimization rate of non-selective B-blockers for the prevention of variceal bleeding and associated factors.

### Non-selective β-blockers in advanced cirrhosis: a critical review of the effects on overall survival and renal function [^16eafdfd]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bleeding oesophageal varices in cirrhosis are associated with a 40% 1-year mortality.Non-selective β-blockers (NSBBs) reduce the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)and remain the mainstay for primary prophylaxis in combination with endoscopic band ligation for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis.Since the seminal work by Lebrec et al 35 years ago, pharmacological prophylaxis of portal hypertensive haemorrhage has experienced little variation and these drugs are still widely prescribed today in at-risk patients.Although HVPG should be measured at baseline and 4–8 weeks after starting NSBB treatment to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from continuing prophylaxis with NSBBs (HVPG reduction to <12 mm Hg or a 20% decrease in HVPG vs the baseline value), this procedure is not widely available in clinical practice.This haemodynamic response may also help prevent the development of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).Several other drugs designed to reduce portal pressure have been tested over the past 30 years, such as selective β-blockers, nitrates, angiotensin receptor antagonists, α-receptor antagonists and endothelin receptor antagonists. None of them, however, have revealed any advantages over NSBBs in terms of their safety profiles in the prophylaxis against variceal bleeding.In addition to the clinical benefits derived from their haemodynamic effects, it has been suggested that NSBBs might provide non-haemodynamic-mediated benefits such as preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Although several high-quality studies have demonstrated the benefits of NSBBs in both the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, either alone or combined with endoscopic procedures, and in overall survival,only a few studies have reported patients with advanced cirrhosis, particularly decompensated patients with refractory ascites (RA).

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^8707da3d]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension in cirrhosis—medical, endoscopic, and shunt therapies are outlined: Drugs causing splanchnic vasoconstriction, including non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs; propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol), vasopressin, terlipressin, and somatostatin analogues, are described as the current mainstay to reduce portal pressure and treat varices and variceal hemorrhage. The effect of NSBBs in decreasing flow is attributed more to β-2 than β-1 blockade, explaining the lack of correlation between decreases in portal pressure and heart rate. Carvedilol decreases portal flow and also acts as a vasodilator, with a greater hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) response than propranolol or nadolol but with a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure. In mild portal hypertension (HVPG > 5 but < 10 mm Hg), response to NSBB is suboptimal compared to clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), indicating that there is no role for NSBB in mild portal hypertension. Endoscopic variceal ligation is a local therapy without effect on portal hypertension, so recurrence is expected and indefinite endoscopic monitoring is required. For gastric varices, local therapies include transendoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. In decompensated cirrhosis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt causes a significant decrease, and even normalization, of portal pressure, and in patients with functional shunts there is no need for other portal hypertension therapies such as NSBB or endoscopic variceal ligation.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^a05799c9]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of first variceal hemorrhage in patients with small esophageal varices—risk stratification depends on whether patients are high risk (with red wale marks and/or occurring in a CTP-C patient) or low risk, and NSBB is the recommended therapy for patients with high-risk small EV (Table 3 for doses).

### Endoscopic band ligation in the treatment of portal hypertension [^0a533cdd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The evidence that endoscopic band ligation (EBL) has greater efficacy and fewer side effects than endoscopic injection sclerotherapy has renewed interest in endoscopic treatments for portal hypertension. The introduction of multishot band devices, which allow the placement of 5-10 bands at a time, has made the technique much easier to perform, avoiding the use of overtubes and their related complications. EBL sessions are usually repeated at 2 week intervals until varices are obliterated, which is achieved in about 90% of patients after 2-4 sessions. Variceal recurrence is frequent, with 20-75% of patients requiring repeated EBL sessions. According to current evidence, nonselective beta-blockers are the preferred treatment option for prevention of a first variceal bleed, whereas EBL should be reserved for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers. Nonselective beta-blockers, probably in association with the vasodilator isosorbide mononitrate, and EBL are good treatment options to prevent recurrent variceal rebleeding. The efficacy of EBL might be increased by combining it with beta-blocker therapy. Patients who are intolerant, have contraindications or bled while receiving primary prophylaxis with beta-blockers must be treated with EBL. In the latter situation, EBL should be added to rather than replace beta-blocker therapy. EBL, in combination with vasoactive drugs, is the recommended form of therapy for acute esophageal variceal bleeding; however, endoscopic injection sclerotherapy can be used in the acute setting if EBL is technically difficult.

Summary of all recommendations

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 2) 
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend non-cardioselective β blockers (NSBB) or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of <50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by the clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of NSBB in patients without varices, with focus on carvedilol. Role of NSBB in patients with small varices, with focus on carvedilol. Comparison of carvedilol versus propranolol in primary prophylaxis. Identification of, and trials assessing, new drugs for primary prophylaxis such as statins.
Quality indicator: Percentage of patients at diagnosis of cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy to screen for varices (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy either before or after diagnosis within 6 months. Denominator; patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis. Percentage of patients receiving primary prophylaxis among those newly diagnosed with grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices. Numerator; patients who have grade 1 varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices receiving primary prophylaxis. Denominator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have grade I varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices.

### Beta-blockers to prevent gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis [^8bcc5a82]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers decrease portal pressure and prevent variceal hemorrhage. Their effectiveness in preventing varices is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned 213 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (minimal hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] of 6 mm Hg) to receive timolol, a nonselective beta-blocker (108 patients), or placebo (105 patients). The primary end point was the development of gastroesophageal varices or variceal hemorrhage. Endoscopy and HVPG measurements were repeated yearly.

Results

During a median follow-up of 54.9 months, the rate of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the timolol group and the placebo group (39 percent and 40 percent, respectively; P=0.89), nor were there significant differences in the rates of ascites, encephalopathy, liver transplantation, or death. Serious adverse events were more common among patients in the timolol group than among those in the placebo group (18 percent vs. 6 percent, P=0.006). Varices developed less frequently among patients with a baseline HVPG of less than 10 mm Hg and among those in whom the HVPG decreased by more than 10 percent at one year and more frequently among those in whom the HVPG increased by more than 10 percent at one year.

Conclusions

Nonselective beta-blockers are ineffective in preventing varices in unselected patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension and are associated with an increased number of adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00006398.)

Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)—advantages, limitations, and surveillance—can theoretically be done in the same session as screening endoscopy and has few contraindications, but carries risks related to sedation and risks of dysphagia, esophageal ulcerations, strictures, and bleeding; although overall side effects are more frequent with NSBBs, the number of severe side effects is greater with EVL, and because EVL is a local therapy, after eradication surveillance endoscopies are necessary to detect variceal recurrence, which approaches 90%; physician practice patterns may influence choice, with gastroenterologists who spent at least half their time performing endoscopy more likely to choose EVL.

### A prognostic strategy based on stage of cirrhosis and HVPG to improve risk stratification after variceal bleeding [^fb08ac5c]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

A hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) decrease of 20% or more (or ≤12 mm Hg) indicates a good prognosis during propranolol/nadolol treatment but requires two HVPG measurements. We aimed to simplify the risk stratification after variceal bleeding using clinical data and HVPG.

Methods

A total of 193 patients with cirrhosis (62% with ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy [HE]) who were within 7 days of bleeding had their HVPG measured before and at 1-3 months of treatment with propranolol/nadolol plus endoscopic band ligation. The endpoints were rebleeding and rebleeding/transplantation-free survival for 4 years. Another cohort (n = 231) served as the validation set.

Results

During follow-up, 45 patients had variceal bleeding and 61 died. The HVPG responders (n = 71) had lower rebleeding risk (10% vs. 34%, P = 0.001) and better survival than the 122 nonresponders (61% vs. 39%, P = 0.001). Patients with HE (n = 120) had lower survival than patients without HE (40% vs. 63%, P = 0.005). Among the patients with ascites/HE, those with baseline HVPG ≤ 16 mm Hg (n = 16) had a low rebleeding risk (13%). In contrast, among patients with ascites/HE and baseline HVPG > 16 mm Hg, only the HVPG responders (n = 32) had a good prognosis, with lower rebleeding risk and better survival than the nonresponders (n = 72) (respective proportions: 7% vs. 39%, P = 0.018; 56% vs. 30% P = 0.010). These findings allowed us to develop a strategy for risk stratification in which HVPG response was measured only in patients with ascites and/or HE and baseline HVPG > 16 mm Hg. This method reduced the "gray zone" (i.e., high-risk patients who had not died on follow-up) from 46% to 35% and decreased the HVPG measurements required by 42%. The validation cohort confirmed these results.

Conclusions

Restricting HVPG measurements to patients with ascites/HE and measuring HVPG response only if the patient's baseline HVPG is over 16 mm Hg improves detection of high-risk patients while markedly reducing the number of HVPG measurements required.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^4892d1da]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Secondary prophylaxis after variceal bleeding—NSBB plus EVL and the role of TIPS are summarized as follows: When compared with endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) alone, the combination of EVL and nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB) reduced rebleeding in all categories of patients and improved survival in patients with CTP class B and C. Propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol may be used for secondary prophylaxis; carvedilol has greater effects on hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) reduction but a higher potential to cause systemic hypotension. TIPS when used as first-line therapy for secondary prophylaxis is associated with lower rebleeding rates compared with EVL + NSBB but has no impact on survival and is associated with higher rates of hepatic encephalopathy (HE); therefore, TIPS placement as first-line approach for secondary prophylaxis should be reserved for patients with other indications for TIPS, such as recurrent/refractory ascites, where it may improve survival. TIPS is recommended for patients who rebleed despite adequate secondary prophylaxis, especially those with rebleeding within the first 6 weeks. Guidance statements specify that patients with variceal bleeding who do not fulfill the criteria for a preemptive TIPS and/or do not undergo TIPS during admission should undergo secondary prophylaxis with NSBB and endoscopic ligation, and that use of TIPS for secondary prophylaxis can be considered in patients with additional indications for TIPS (e.g., refractory ascites).

### Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^a36f75a6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. Forty-six trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The follow-up ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), beta-blockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the follow-up period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very low-certainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on low-certainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. Beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. Beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^fb12d0b0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative management of cirrhosis-related decompensations—elective surgery planning should maintain routine cirrhosis care and continue key therapies. The guideline states: “Remaining current with routine cirrhosis-related management prior to elective surgery, including hepatocellular carcinoma screening, optimization of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, variceal screening and/or bleeding prophylaxis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis when indicated, may mitigate operative risk.” It further specifies that “Patients with hepatic encephalopathy should have lactulose and/or rifaximin continued through the perioperative period, with close attention to serum sodium and minimization of medications that may exacerbate encephalopathy,” and that “Patients taking nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs, e.g., carvedilol) for CSPH or secondary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding should continue these medications in the peri-operative period, provided that the systolic blood pressure is over 90 mm Hg.” For unclear variceal status, “upper endoscopy should be performed and NSBBs or band ligation should be pursued for large varices or medium varices with high-risk stigmata,” and “Hepatocellular carcinoma screening should be up-to-date, especially as diagnosis of liver cancer may affect surgical decision-making and transplant consideration in selected patients.”

### Number of endoscopic sessions to eradicate varices identifies high risk of rebleeding in cirrhotic patients [^49727014]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal varices (GOV) bleeding, one of the complications of portal hypertension, is a severe and life-threatening disease with a 6-week mortality up to 15–25% in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. A combination of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and endoscopic treatment is recommended as the first-line therapy for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding, while Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) is recommended when the combination therapy fails. Patients with variceal bleeding are often very dangerous, especially those who fail standard therapy, some of them do not even have a chance to switch to salvage TIPS. Therefore, risk stratification to identify patients with high risk of variceal rebleeding is particularly important in decompensated cirrhosis.

Portal pressure is closely related to the prognosis of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Previous studies showed that hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) reflected the severity of portal hypertension, and is still the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of portal hypertension and predicting prognosis. However, HVPG measurement is an invasive procedure with less compliance in both physicians and patients, and has certain requirements for the operator's technique and medical equipment with expensive cost as well. Above all, adverse events such as transient arrhythmia and vagus nerve reaction may occur during the process of operation. These deficiencies largely limit the clinical application and promotion of HVPG.

Nonselective beta-blockers in refractory ascites with circulatory dysfunction—In patients with refractory ascites and severe circulatory dysfunction (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, serum sodium <130 meq/L, or hepatorenal syndrome), the dose of nonselective beta-blockers should be decreased or the drug temporarily held, and nonselective beta-blockers might be reintroduced if circulatory dysfunction improves.

### Nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate alone or associated with band ligation in the prevention of recurrent bleeding: a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^a444b0f6]. Gut (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Previous clinical trials suggest that adding non-selective beta-blockers improves the efficacy of endoscopic band ligation (EBL) in the prevention of recurrent bleeding, but no study has evaluated whether EBL improves the efficacy of beta-blockers + isosorbide-5-mononitrate. The present study was aimed at evaluating this issue in a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) and to correlate changes in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) during treatment with clinical outcomes

Methods

158 patients with cirrhosis, admitted because of variceal bleeding, were randomised to receive nadolol+isosorbide-5-mononitrate alone (Drug: n = 78) or combined with EBL (Drug+EBL; n = 80). HVPG measurements were performed at randomisation and after 4-6 weeks on medical therapy.

Results

Median follow-up was 15 months. One-year probability of recurrent bleeding was similar in both groups (33% vs 26%: p = 0.3). There were no significant differences in survival or need of rescue shunts. Overall adverse events or those requiring hospital admission were significantly more frequent in the Drug+EBL group. Recurrent bleeding was significantly more frequent in HVPG non-responders than in responders (HVPG reduction >or=20% or <or=12 mm Hg). Among non-responders recurrent bleeding was similar in patients treated with Drugs or Drugs+EBL.

Conclusions

Adding EBL to pharmacological treatment did not reduce recurrent bleeding, the need for rescue therapy, or mortality, and was associated with more adverse events. Furthermore, associating EBL to drug therapy did not reduce the high rebleeding risk of HVPG non-responders. ISRCTN26221020.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications (...) [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The presence of cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of complications such as liver cancer and decompensation including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. It is important to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis in people with risk factors or any diagnosed chronic liver disease. While physical examination findings may be suggestive, it is recommended to stratify risk for all using the FIB-4 followed by elastography for at-risk patients. After identifying patients with cirrhosis, optimal care may involve referral to a hepatologist, liver cancer screening, and consideration of endoscopy for varices screening and/or initiation of nonselective β-blockers. BMI indicates body mass index. Prevention of bleeding: carvedilol, 12.

5 mg, daily; propranolol, 40 mg, twice a day increased up to 160 mg twice a day with goal heart rate of 55 beats/min Active bleeding: Intravenous octreotide/terlipressin ceftriaxone. Band ligation or sclerotherapy of varices Primary prophylaxis with carvedilol or propranolol in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 201 patients with CSPH, carvedilol or propranolol reduced risk of decompensation or death by 3 y. Treatment of hemorrhage: vasoactive medications Octreotide: associated with hemostasis at 5 d in 77% compared with 58% with placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized trials Terlipressin: associated with hemostasis at 5 d in 65% compared with 46% with placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Prophylactic antibiotics: associated with reduced mortality to 18. 5% vs
22.

2% with placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized trials Secondary prophylaxis with preemptive TIPS: in a randomized trial of 63 patients with acute variceal bleeding, preemptive TIPS within 72 h improved 1-y survival to 86% vs 61% for the control group. If nosocomial SBP: in a randomized trial of 32 patients, compared with ceftazidime, meropenem and daptomycin increased SBP resolution but not 90-d survival Terlipressin, 0. 85 mg, IV every 6 h. Observational study of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: compared with no treatment, antiviral therapy was associated with a lower risk of HCC, decompensation, and death in people with cirrhosis from Hong Kong, South Korea, and California. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma each year, which is associated with a 5-year survival of approximately 20%.

In a 3-year randomized clinical trial of 201 patients with portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers reduced the risk of decompensation or death compared with placebo. Compared with sequential initiation, combination aldosterone antagonist and loop diuretics were more likely to resolve ascites with lower rates of hyperkalemia. In meta-analyses of randomized trials, lactulose was associated with reduced mortality relative to placebo in randomized trials involving 705 patients and reduced risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy in randomized trials involving 1415 patients. Outcomes for patients with cirrhosis can be improved with evidence-based therapies directed toward both the etiology of cirrhosis6-12 and its complications.

Sclerotherapy

Nineteen trials have compared endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with no treatment.Owing to the marked heterogeneity between these studies a meta-analysis is clinically inappropriate.Sclerotherapy does not offer any benefit in combination with NSBB or VBL compared with VBL or NSBB alone, and increases iatrogenic complications such as strictures.At this time sclerotherapy cannot be recommended for prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis.

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (figure 2)
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend NSBB or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of <50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by a clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or TIPSS is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of NSBB in patients without varices, with focus on carvedilol. Role of NSBB in patients with small varices, with focus on carvedilol. Comparison of carvedilol versus propranolol in primary prophylaxis. Identification of, and trials assessing, new drugs for primary prophylaxis such as statins.
Quality indicator: Percentage of patients at diagnosis of cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy to screen for varices (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy either before or after diagnosis within 6 months. Denominator; patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis. Percentage of patients receiving primary prophylaxis among those newly diagnosed with grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices. Numerator; patients who have grade 1 varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices receiving primary prophylaxis. Denominator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have grade I varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices.

### Risk of complications with... [^52ccf76e]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis, potential complications include variceal gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma. Strategies have been established to prevent some of these complications or to detect them at an early stage. Preventive strategies can maximize the time to transplantation or death by slowing further liver damage and alleviating comorbid conditions. This article discusses preventive care strategies that have been shown to be effective or to have a scientific rationale in patients with cirrhosis. On endoscopic examination, varices are found in 60 percent of patients with cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding as a result of portal hypertension is a serious complication of cirrhosis. In patients with large varices, the risk of bleeding is about 40 to 45 percent each year. With each incidence of bleeding, the risk of death can be as high as 50 percent.

5 recommended endoscopic screening to detect varices in patients with cirrhosis and no previous variceal hemorrhage. The ACG further recommended beta-blocker therapy for patients found to have large varices. Endoscopic criteria have been defined to predict which patients are at high risk for variceal bleeding. These criteria include large varices and varices with red wale markings. A high Child score also indicates an increased risk for variceal bleeding.
6. Nonselective beta blockers are recommended for primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding. Several randomized trials have shown that beta blockers such as propranolol and nadolol can reduce the risk of initial variceal bleeding from about 45 percent to 22 percent. 7 In four randomized trials, endoscopically proven esophageal varices were treated with propranolol or nadolol in dosages designed to reduce the heart rate by 20 to 25 percent from the basal rate. 8 The usual starting dosage for propranolol is 10 mg three times daily.

Nadolol is generally initiated in a dosage of 20 mg once daily. Isosorbide mononitrate has been shown to be effective as second-line therapy in patients who have side effects from beta blockers or in whom beta blocker therapy is contraindicated. 9 Isosorbide mononitrate is given in a dosage of 20 mg twice daily. Medication prophylaxis is unnecessary in patients with no varices or only small varices that do not have red wale markings. If initial endoscopy shows no varices, the examination should be repeated in one to two years to assess the risk of bleeding. Patients who have had one episode of bleeding should receive secondary prophylaxis with esophageal banding or sclerotherapy to obliterate the varices. They should also be treated with beta blockers and undergo surveillance endoscopy at regular intervals. SCREENING FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA Most patients with cirrhosis are at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with one study showing a cumulative 22.

9-fold increased risk after three and one-half years. 10 In the United States, hepatitis C is the most common cause of cirrhosis and, once cirrhosis has developed, hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. 10 Patients with advanced-stage cancer have a three-year survival rate of 17 percent. 11 When hepatocellular carcinoma is not diagnosed until patients have symptoms, mean survival is often less than four months. 12 However, tumor resection or liver transplantation has been found to prolong survival in patients with asymptomatic small tumors. 12 An 85 percent five-year survival has been reported in patients with liver tumors smaller than 2 cm in size.
13. All patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma on a regular basis. Two screening techniques have been suggested: serum alpha-fetoprotein testing and liver ultrasonography.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^735cf546]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage

Perioperative volume overload can increase portal pressure and precipitate bleeding from esophageal varices. Other possible contributing factors include postoperative hepatic dysfunction and portal venous thrombosis. Variceal hemorrhage represents a medical emergency to be managed in the intensive care unit.

Resuscitative measures to preserve the respiratory and circulatory systems should be promptly initiated. A restrictive transfusion strategy aiming at hemoglobin levels of 7–9 g/dl has been associated with decreased re-bleeding and mortality rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone for up to 7 days is indicated to address the increased risk of bacterial infections and also to decrease the risk of re-bleeding and mortality. Infusion of vasoactive agents (somatostatin, terlipressin, and octreotide) for 2 to 5 days has been associated with lower mortality and transfusion requirements.

An urgent endoscopy should be completed no longer than 12 h from presentation. Elastic band ligation represents the first-line endoscopic intervention for esophageal varices, but sclerotherapy is an excellent alternative for difficult cases. Elastic band ligation has proven more effective than sclerotherapy in terms of the number of required sessions, as well as re-bleeding and mortality rates. A non-specific beta-blocker (propranolol or nadolol) is indicated after the vasoactive infusion is discontinued.

Balloon tamponade is reserved for temporary control of ongoing variceal bleeding while definitive therapy is being arranged. TIPS should be considered pre-emptively in high-risk patients, or in refractory or recurrent hemorrhage, as improved mortality rates have been observed.

Table 3 summarizes current recommendations for the management of hemorrhage from esophageal varices.

Table 3 
Management of variceal hemorrhage

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

Coagulation disorders of cirrhosis confer an increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage. As previously indicated, conventional coagulation tests do not reflect these risks, and an increased INR is not necessarily protective for thromboembolic events. Although detailed guidelines remain unavailable, thromboprophylaxis is recommended in most patients, and certainly in high-risk situations.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^d25724d8]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance—purpose and scope articulates that this guidance 'intends to coalesce best practice recommendations for the identification of portal hypertension (PH), for prevention of initial hepatic decompensation, for the management of acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH), and for reduction of the risk of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in chronic liver disease.' The most significant changes 'relate to (1) recognition of the concept of compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD), a shift away from the requirement of a histological or radiological diagnosis of cirrhosis for initial patient risk stratification; (2) codification of methodology to use noninvasive assessments to identify clinically significant PH (CSPH); and (3) endorsement of a change in paradigm with the recommendation of early utilization of nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB) therapy when CSPH is identified in order to decrease the risk of cirrhosis decompensation.' The guidance also 'addresses new topics such as portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) as well as endoscopy prior to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)' and states that 'The present guidance does not focus on ascites as a complication of PH because this was recently covered in the AASLD Practice Guidance on ascites and related'.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^df38002d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic portal vein thrombosis without cirrhosis—primary variceal bleeding prophylaxis during anticoagulation and indications for anticoagulation are addressed: Retrospective studies have demonstrated a lower risk of variceal bleeding in patients with chronic PVT who receive anticoagulation and are maintained on beta-blockers, but data are scanty comparing band ligation vs beta-blockers. Based on randomized data in cirrhosis, beta-blockers are considered first choice for primary prevention of variceal bleeding and band ligation considered if patients have any contraindication to beta-blockers or do not tolerate these drugs. Accordingly, we recommend nonselective beta-blockers or repeated endoscopic variceal band ligation in patients with high-risk varices and portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation, and endoscopic variceal band ligation may be interrupted in the periprocedural period (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). For chronic PVT, we suggest anticoagulation if there is evidence of inherited or acquired thrombophilia, progression of thrombus into the mesenteric veins, or current or previous evidence of bowel ischemia (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

Chronic hepatitis C after sustained virologic response (SVR)—esophageal varices risk and proposed variceal bleeding management: A cohort of 444 patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis was divided into 218 with stage 1 and 226 with stage 2, with a median follow-up of 7.6 years (range, 1–12.6 years); in stage 1, SVR was associated with fewer new varices (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11–0.48; P < .001), whereas in stage 2, SVR was not associated with fewer further varices (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.03). Based on the available literature, a proposed practical approach is: no varices—follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years and no further screening if negative; small varices, no treatment—follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years with further actions as stated; prior primary prophylaxis with β-blockers and/or band ligation—repeat after 6–12 months and repeat after 1–2 years once low risk; decompensated or prior bleeding—close surveillance and/or treatment as already instituted. Although updated Baveno VI guidance supports risk stratification using a TE cutoff of <20 kPa and platelet count >150,000/μL to identify patients at low risk who may not require screening endoscopy, in post-SVR populations such data are not yet available and application of these cutoffs should be approached with caution and on an individual-patient basis.

### Sequential endoscopic treatment for esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding significantly reduces patient mortality and rebleeding rates [^a867d1ff]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding (EGVB) is one of the most common and serious complications of liver cirrhosis. Despite advances in diagnostic and treatment methods, the mortality rate of this condition remains high ranging from 15 to 20%. – In addition, recurrent bleeding is highly likely after management of EGVB, with a rebleeding rate of up to 17% within six weeks. Therefore, appropriate treatment of acute EGVB and prevention of variceal rebleeding are crucial for patients with liver cirrhosis.In the past few decades, significant progress has been made in regard to treatment strategies for EGVB. Traditional treatment methods include drug therapy, endoscopic hemostasis, interventional radiology, and surgical treatment. The current first-line treatment modalities for acute variceal bleeding include nonselective beta-blockers, vasoactive agents, antibiotics, and endoscopic therapies. – In particular, endoscopic treatment is currently the preferred approach for EGVB and is widely favored by patients owing to its minimally invasive nature. For persistent esophageal variceal bleeding that continues despite medical or endoscopic therapy, urgent rescue treatment with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be considered.Although studies have demonstrated that TIPS is effective in preventing rebleeding, it has a higher incidence of postoperative hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, and stent stenosis than that of other treatment methods, with no significant benefit in improving patient survival. – Many studies have compared different treatment methods for acute variceal bleeding. For example, in a randomized controlled study (RCT) by Garg et al. endoscopic band ligation plus low-dose sclerotherapy significantly reduced complications and rebleeding rates compared with endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy alone (3% vs 20% and 3% vs 16%, respectively).In another RCT conducted by Liu et al. emergency endoscopic ligation combined with octreotide had lower costs, higher efficacy, and higher safety than the use of octreotide alone for treating acute esophageal variceal bleeding.These studies aimed to investigate emergency hemostasis treatment after EGVB; however, owing to the persistent presence of portal hypertension, varicose veins can recur, leading to a high risk of rebleeding and compromising long-term treatment effectiveness.Consequently, sequential endoscopic therapy has attracted much attention in the search for more effective treatment options.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^0bcb41e0]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis—variceal screening and timing of anticoagulation: Best Practice Advice 8 states, “Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization.” Observational data show that initiation of anticoagulation within 6 months correlated with recanalization (relative risk, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2–9.4; P = .004), and initiation within 2 weeks was associated with improved recanalization vs beyond 2 weeks. Meta-analyses including more than 800 patients suggest anticoagulation does not increase the risk of portal hypertensive bleeding, and a retrospective series reported a post-ligation bleeding rate of 9% on anticoagulation, comparable to rates without anticoagulation.

Acute variceal hemorrhage—preemptive and rescue TIPS, adjunctive measures: In patients with Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) class B score > 7 with active bleeding on endoscopy or CTP class C score 10–13, preemptive TIPS creation (within 72 hours and ideally within 24 hours of initial upper endoscopy) should be recommended in absence of absolute contraindications to TIPS, and if TIPS is not locally available, transfer to a center with the capacity to intervene should be considered. In patients presenting with AVH who do not undergo TIPS, nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB) should be initiated at discontinuation of vasoactive therapy. Covered expandable esophageal stents (where available) or balloon tamponade should be considered in patients with uncontrolled AVH as a bridge to TIPS. TIPS should be considered in patients with uncontrolled AVH (“salvage” TIPS) or who rebleed despite vasoactive therapy and EVL (“rescue” TIPS). Enteral feeding should be started once AVH episode has been controlled, and the presence of variceal bands does not contraindicate placement of a feeding tube if indicated. Proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued once AVH has been confirmed as the bleeding source in the absence of other specific indications.

### Sequential endoscopic treatment for esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding significantly reduces patient mortality and rebleeding rates [^1b262693]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic therapy can be implemented early after bleeding begins by quickly identifying the bleeding sites and employing various hemostatic techniques. These techniques may include endoscopic ligation, injection of tissue glue and sclerosing agents, or a combination of these methods to enhance the hemostatic effect. Timely hemostasis can prevent dangerous conditions such as massive blood loss and hypotensive shock. In addition, by decreasing the recurrence of acute bleeding events, the risk of additional bleeding and associated complications—such as infection, organ failure, and hepatic encephalopathy—can be reduced, thereby lowering mortality. However, because of persistent portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis, the risk of recurrent varices remains very high, necessitating further treatment. The standard of care for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding involves a combination of nonselective beta-blockers and repeated EVL. The advantage of repeated endoscopic treatment is that, in addition to providing emergency hemostasis, it allows for the assessment of variceal severity through multiple follow-up endoscopic visits. For large and high-risk EGV, preventive treatment strategies can also be adopted, and individual treatment strategies can be formulated according to the specific conditions and characteristics of each patient. For different types of EGV, the most appropriate treatment methods can be selected to improve the treatment effect and reduce the mortality rate. The European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines and the Baveno VII workshop recommended EVL for acute esophageal variceal bleeding, and endoscopic sclerotherapy injection for acute gastric variceal bleeding. However, some studies indicated that the combination of EVL with other treatments showed significant advantages in rapidly eradicating bleeding lesions, reducing the number of required treatments and lowering mortality and rebleeding rates. This made it an effective combined treatment strategy for gastrointestinal bleeding. –

### Measuring the hemodynamic response to primary pharmacoprophylaxis of variceal bleeding: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^879d67ec]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The hemodynamic response to ss-blockers alone or with nitrates is highly predictive of efficacy in prevention of variceal bleeding. Hemodynamic monitoring (HDM) requires catheterization of the hepatic vein and measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient, the difference between wedged and free hepatic venous pressure. The aim of this study was to compare HDM with no HDM in patients considered for primary pharmacoprophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding.

Methods

A decision model was constructed to compare HDM with no HDM in cirrhotic patients with moderate to large esophageal varices. Patients intolerant to beta-blocker therapy would undergo endoscopic variceal ligation; those with an inadequate hemodynamic response (HDR) to beta-blocker therapy could have nitrates added before ligation was considered. Variceal bleeding was treated with ligation, with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reserved for refractory bleeding. Probabilities of treatment responses as well as risks of bleeding and mortality were based on published literature. Only direct costs were considered during the 5-yr time horizon. Outcomes were cost in United States dollars, survival length in life-years, and proportions of patients who experienced variceal bleeding, TIPS insertion, and mortality from any cause.

Results

In the base case analysis, HDM was either cost-saving ($2,523 US dollars /life-year gained) or cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5,200 US dollars/life-year saved) compared with no HDM, depending on whether nitrates were added to beta-blocker therapy. HDM reduced variceal bleeding by nearly 60% and had a small effect on all-cause mortality. In the sensitivity analysis, HDM was sensitive to the time horizon, as it was not cost-effective for a time horizon of <22 months and was not cost-saving before 49 months. The cost-effectiveness of HDM was not sensitive to reasonable variation in the probability of HDR to beta-blocker therapy, risk of bleeding, risk reduction with pharmacotherapy, or to the costs of HDM, bleeding, ligation, or TIPS. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that HDM was more effective and less costly 100% and 57% of the time, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the current standard of no HDM, measuring the hemodynamic response of primary pharmacoprophylaxis substantially reduces the number of bleeding episodes and is cost-effective or cost-saving over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. A randomized trial of HDM is needed to verify its efficacy in clinical practice.

Compensated cirrhosis with gastroesophageal varices (GEV) has, by definition, CSPH because “the lowest HVPG in these patients is 10-12 mm Hg,” and in this setting “a reduction in HVPG to ≤12 mm Hg or ≥ 20% from baseline was shown to be protective of development of VH and constitutes an ‘optimal response’ to NSBBs.” Monitoring surrogates is limited because “changes in heart rate do not correlate with changes in HVPG, and … NITs are not useful in assessing changes in HVPG,” and “monitoring changes in HVPG should not be performed routinely.” Clinical aims prioritize decompensation since “ascites, not variceal bleeding, is the most common decompensating event, … and patients with varices, compared to those without varices, are more likely to decompensate.” Therapeutically, “local therapies, such as EVL … would only play a role in patients intolerant to pathophysiologically targeted therapies,” and “reductions in HVPG >10% induced by use of NSBBs in the prevention of first hemorrhage are associated not only with a lower incidence of first VH.”
