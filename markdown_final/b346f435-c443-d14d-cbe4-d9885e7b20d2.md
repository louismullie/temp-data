## Question

double htn medication for diabetic patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use "double" (combination) antihypertensive therapy in patients with diabetes, including thresholds, preferred combinations, safety, and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why combination therapy is often necessary in diabetes. Then, I should verify the blood pressure thresholds that trigger dual therapy. Next, I will review which drug classes to choose and which to avoid. After that, I need to check the evidence supporting combination therapy and single-pill combinations. Finally, I should confirm safety monitoring, special populations, and a practical implementation plan with timelines and follow-up labs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale for combination therapy in diabetes. Hypertension is highly prevalent in diabetes and markedly increases cardiovascular and renal risk; most patients with diabetes and hypertension require more than one agent to reach contemporary targets, and diabetes confers a steeper BP–risk relationship, so faster, more reliable control matters for outcomes [^112nNNRK] [^115dXkdu] [^111z1s4t].

> I need to verify the thresholds that warrant starting two drugs. The ADA 2025 Standards recommend initiating two antihypertensives or a single-pill combination when office BP is ≥ 150/90 mmHg, while for 130–149/80–89 mmHg, monotherapy may be reasonable initially but should be escalated promptly if not at goal; ESH 2023 advises initiating drug therapy at ≥ 140/90 mmHg in type 2 diabetes and emphasizes that combination strategies are often needed to reach < 130/80 mmHg [^116Q1srx] [^1171XHPT] [^114eRPKy] [^115dXkdu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about targets. I should confirm the on-treatment goal. ADA 2025 and ESH 2023 align on a primary target of < 130/80 mmHg if safely achievable, with individualization via shared decision-making; ESC 2023 supports < 130 mmHg SBP in most patients with diabetes, cautioning not to go below 120 mmHg, and ACC/AHA 2019 recommends < 130/80 mmHg for adults with diabetes and ASCVD risk ≥ 10% [^115E6VAW] [^117BUsva] [^111PRUs9] [^113NYm9m].

> Next, I should review which classes to choose for combination therapy. I need to ensure I anchor on classes with proven cardiovascular benefit in diabetes: ACE inhibitors or ARBs, thiazide-like diuretics, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers; beta-blockers are reserved for compelling indications such as CAD or heart failure, and direct renin inhibitors are not recommended [^116PegFF] [^112nNNRK].

> Wait, let me verify the preferred first-line backbone in diabetes. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line in most patients with diabetes, with particular emphasis in the presence of albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g), where they reduce progression of kidney disease; if one is not tolerated, the other should be substituted rather than combined [^116PegFF] [^11236uZW] [^114JoSkz].

> I will now examine combination choices. Pairing a RAS blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) with a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-like diuretic is standard; ACCOMPLISH showed benazepril plus amlodipine reduced cardiovascular events more than benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes, supporting an ACE inhibitor/CCB strategy when feasible; single-pill combinations can improve adherence and time to control, which is clinically meaningful in diabetes [^111xXEmh] [^112fewAA] [^112fR7qf].

> But wait, what if I consider triple therapy or resistant hypertension. I should confirm that when BP remains uncontrolled on three classes including a diuretic, adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as low-dose spironolactone is reasonable; in a randomized trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and resistant hypertension, spironolactone 25–50 mg reduced ambulatory BP by about 9/4 mmHg and lowered albuminuria without worsening glycemia, albeit with hyperkalemia risk that mandates monitoring [^116AQrFP] [^113gWo32].

> I need to ensure I avoid harmful combinations. Dual RAS blockade with ACE inhibitor plus ARB or with direct renin inhibitors increases risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury without outcome benefit and should be avoided; similarly, combining ACE inhibitors or ARBs with neprilysin inhibitors is not recommended in this context [^113MAQye] [^116kNRG5].

> Let me consider the role of SGLT2 inhibitors, since they can lower BP and improve cardio-renal outcomes. ESH 2023 and ESC 2023 recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce heart failure and kidney events, noting their modest BP-lowering effect; in patients already on combination therapy, dapagliflozin produced an additional ~4 mmHg SBP reduction versus placebo, which can be leveraged when BP is close but not at goal [^116j7K8D] [^112KQArv] [^112c2R16].

> Next, I should review the evidence supporting initial combination therapy. Although large outcome trials directly comparing initial monotherapy versus combination therapy are limited, guideline bodies endorse combination strategies in diabetes because most patients require multiple agents and faster control translates to risk reduction; observational and pragmatic data show higher control rates with single-pill combinations and simplified algorithms, and ADVANCE operationalized a perindopril/indapamide single-pill approach with favorable outcomes, reinforcing feasibility and effectiveness in diabetes [^116Q1srx] [^115dXkdu] [^111QrvYz].

> I should double-check safety monitoring. When initiating or uptitrating ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs, I need to check serum creatinine and potassium within 7–14 days and again after subsequent changes, watching for a creatinine rise up to 30% which is acceptable if asymptomatic, and for hyperkalemia; with thiazide or loop diuretics, I should monitor for hypokalemia and volume depletion, adjusting as needed [^114wMtzq] [^112sJh4P].

> Let me think about special populations and individualization. In older adults, I should individualize targets and often accept 130–139 mmHg SBP if tolerated, avoiding excessive polypharmacy; in chronic kidney disease with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², loop diuretics may be preferred over thiazides; in symptomatic orthostasis or frailty, I should titrate more slowly and consider lower targets only if safe [^111PRUs9] [^115v8d8z].

> I will now translate this into a practical plan. If office BP is ≥ 150/90 mmHg, I should start two agents or a single-pill combination, typically an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-like diuretic, at moderate doses, and reassess in 4–6 weeks; if BP is 130–149/80–89 mmHg, I may start with one agent but plan to add a second within 4 weeks if not at goal; if BP is ≥ 160/100 mmHg, starting two agents is especially compelling to mitigate early risk [^116Q1srx] [^1171XHPT] [^1164RGzr].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up cadence and labs. Reassess BP within 4–6 weeks of initiation or dose change, check creatinine and potassium 7–14 days after starting or changing ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs, and intensify therapy every 4–6 weeks until at goal; if still not at goal on three classes including a diuretic, add spironolactone and monitor closely for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^114wMtzq] [^116AQrFP].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: in patients with diabetes and hypertension, initiate dual antihypertensive therapy when BP is ≥ 150/90 mmHg, prioritize ACE inhibitor or ARB-based combinations with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-like diuretic, avoid dual RAS blockade, monitor renal function and potassium closely, and escalate thoughtfully to triple therapy including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist if needed, all while individualizing targets and leveraging single-pill combinations to improve adherence and speed to control [^116Q1srx] [^116PegFF] [^113MAQye] [^116AQrFP].

In patients with diabetes and hypertension, **initiate dual antihypertensive therapy** when blood pressure is ≥ 150/90 mmHg [^116Q1srx], using a **renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-like diuretic** [^116PegFF] [^111xXEmh]. This strategy achieves faster BP control, improves adherence, and reduces cardiovascular and renal events [^111h1Drs] [^112fR7qf] [^111xXEmh]. Avoid **dual RAS blockade** (ACE inhibitor plus ARB) [^113MAQye] and monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function with RAS blockers [^114wMtzq]. Individualize BP targets to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^115E6VAW], and consider SGLT2 inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for additional cardio-renal benefit [^116j7K8D] [^116AQrFP].

---

## Rationale for dual antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients

- **High prevalence and risk**: Hypertension affects ~70% of patients with diabetes and markedly increases cardiovascular and renal risk [^116PfbJR].

- **Limited monotherapy efficacy**: Most patients with diabetes require ≥ 2 agents to reach BP targets due to disease severity and comorbidities [^115dXkdu] [^116ET2nc].

- **Faster control**: Dual therapy achieves BP goals more rapidly than monotherapy, reducing early cardiovascular risk [^111h1Drs] [^1179g7rJ].

- **Adherence benefit**: Single-pill combinations improve adherence and persistence compared with free combinations [^112fR7qf] [^1179g7rJ].

## Recommended combinations for dual antihypertensive therapy

| **Combination** | **Rationale** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| RAS blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) + calcium channel blocker (CCB) | - Complementary mechanisms <br/> - Reduced peripheral edema vs CCB alone <br/> - Superior cardiovascular outcomes in ACCOMPLISH | - ACCOMPLISH trial [^111xXEmh] [^112fewAA] <br/> - ESH/ESC guidelines [^notfound] |
| RAS blocker + thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone or indapamide) | - Synergistic BP lowering <br/> - Reduced fluid retention <br/> - Proven renal protection in diabetes | - ADVANCE trial [^111QrvYz] <br/> - ADA 2025 guidelines [^116PegFF] |
| ARB + CCB (single-pill combination) | - Simplified regimen <br/> - Improved adherence <br/> - Effective BP control | - Telmisartan/amlodipine trials [^111h1Drs] <br/> - Observational adherence data [^112fR7qf] |

---

Avoid **dual RAS blockade** (ACE inhibitor plus ARB) because of increased risks of hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and hypotension without added benefit [^113MAQye] [^116kNRG5].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dual therapy

- **ACCOMPLISH trial**: Benazepril + amlodipine reduced cardiovascular events more than benazepril + hydrochlorothiazide in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes [^111xXEmh] [^112fewAA].

- **ADVANCE trial**: Perindopril + indapamide reduced major vascular events and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes [^notfound].

- **Meta-analyses**: Dual therapy achieves BP control faster and more reliably than monotherapy, with improved adherence and outcomes [^112fR7qf] [^1179g7rJ].

---

## Blood pressure targets and individualization

- **General target**: < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, individualized via shared decision-making [^115E6VAW] [^112yZ4af].

- **Older adults**: 130–139 mmHg SBP if tolerated, balancing risks and benefits [^111PRUs9].

- **High-risk patients**: Consider < 120 mmHg only in selected cases with close monitoring due to potential harms [^116BqgWM].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium and renal function 1–2 weeks after starting or changing RAS blockers [^114wMtzq].

- **Hypokalemia**: Monitor with thiazide diuretics and correct as needed [^114wMtzq].

- **Renal function**: Monitor creatinine; acceptable rises up to 30% are tolerated if asymptomatic [^112sJh4P].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid dual RAS blockade and adjust doses in CKD or hepatic impairment [^113MAQye].

---

## Role of newer antihypertensive agents

SGLT2 inhibitors provide modest BP lowering and substantial cardio-renal benefits; consider them when **BP remains above goal** or when additional cardio-renal risk reduction is desired [^116j7K8D] [^112KQArv]. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone) are appropriate for **resistant hypertension** or when **albuminuria persists** despite dual therapy [^116AQrFP] [^113gWo32].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Initiate dual therapy**: Start at ≥ 150/90 mmHg; consider at 140/90 mmHg if high risk or with albuminuria [^116Q1srx] [^114eRPKy].

- **Preferred combinations**: RAS blocker + CCB or RAS blocker + thiazide-like diuretic; consider single-pill combinations to enhance adherence [^116PegFF] [^112fR7qf].

- **Monitor**: Check BP, potassium, and creatinine within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose change [^114wMtzq].

- **Escalate**: If not at goal after 4–6 weeks, add a third agent or SGLT2 inhibitor/MRA as appropriate [^116AQrFP] [^116j7K8D].

---

Dual antihypertensive therapy is **essential** for many patients with diabetes and hypertension, with RAS blockade plus a CCB or thiazide-like diuretic as preferred combinations. This approach achieves faster BP control, improves adherence, and reduces cardiovascular and renal events, while safety monitoring and individualized targets optimize outcomes.

Introduction

Between 2007 and 2010, the age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension in US adults with diabetes was 59%, more than double the prevalence in those without diabetes. Major cardiac events occur in approximately 5% of people with diabetes and untreated hypertension each year, and the risk is higher in those with other risk factors, such as diabetic nephropathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of different blood pressure targets in people with diabetes and hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following intervention: more intensive (lower) blood pressure targets versus less intensive (higher) targets in people with diabetes and hypertension.

### Single-pill combination of telmisartan / amlodipine versus amlodipine monotherapy in diabetic hypertensive patients: an 8-week randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial [^111h1Drs]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive patients with diabetes often require combination therapy to achieve a blood pressure (BP) goal, and evidence suggests that time to BP goal is crucial to decrease cardiovascular risk.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate whether the single-pill combination of telmisartan and amlodipine was superior to amlodipine alone as initial antihypertensive therapy in patients with diabetes and hypertension.

Methods

An 8-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind international trial comparing the once-daily single-pill combination of telmisartan 80 mg and amlodipine 10 mg (T/A; n = 352) with once-daily amlodipine 10 mg (A; n = 354) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 or 2 hypertension (systolic BP [SBP] > 150 mm Hg).

Results

Patient demographics were similar between treatment groups, with an mean (SD) age of 60.5 (10.1) years; 51.7% were male, the mean (SD) body mass index was 32.0 (6.1) and the mean (SD) duration of hypertension was 8.8 (7.9) years. After 8 weeks (primary end point) as well as after 1, 2, and 4 weeks (key secondary end points), significantly greater decreases in the in-clinic mean seated trough cuff SBP with T/A versus A were achieved (-29.0 mm Hg vs -22.9 mm Hg at 8 weeks; P < 0.0001). After 8 weeks, 71.4% versus 53.8% of patients achieved the BP goal (< 140/90 mm Hg) with T/A versus A, with mean SBPs of 131.9 and 137.9 mm Hg, respectively. Similar results were observed in the obese (metabolic syndrome) subpopulation. The more stringent goal (< 130/80 mm Hg) was achieved by 36.4% and 17.9% patients in the T/A and A groups, respectively. The most common adverse events were peripheral edema, headache, and dizziness.

Conclusions

In this selected population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, T/A provided prompt and greater BP decreases compared with A monotherapy, with the majority of patients achieving the BP goal (< 140/90 mm Hg).

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^113t9QDi]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

BP management for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease

The anti-hypertensive strategies most appropriate to type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease have been widely studied.

General considerations

It becomes increasingly important to individualize BP treatment to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits. Non-pharmacological modalities include weight loss, increased potassium-based diet, reduced total intake of sodium and fat (especially saturated fat), and regular physical activity and exercise. Although the cardiovascular benefits of lifestyle changes were not evaluated in type 2 diabetic patients, their implementation seems reasonable as these measures could favorably affect glycemia, lipid profile and BP level. Certainly, pharmacological therapy is effective to decrease mortality, prevent major adverse cardiovascular events including non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure, and slow the progression of pre-existing kidney disease in patients with T2DM. Based on available evidence, type 2 diabetic patients with persistent BP > 140/90 mmHg should be started on anti-hypertensive drug therapy. Notably, the anti-hypertensive strategy (including the choice of BP lowering agents) for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease should be individualized according to the clinical conditions of the patients. It is important to keep in mind that the degree of BP reduction per se is the major determinant of reduction in cardiovascular risk, superseding the choice of anti-hypertensive drugs; a dictum that is valid in patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease. Monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can attain BP target in certain type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, especially when BP is only modestly elevated. However, combination therapy is eventually required in many individuals with T2DM and coronary artery disease, and most guidelines recommend adding a calcium antagonist or diuretic to RAAS inhibitors as add-on therapy. The superiority of a calcium channel blocker over a thiazide as an addition to ACEI or ARB was shown in terms of reduction of cardiovascular events, renal protection and improvement in insulin resistance. In obese patients or when volume overload is present, diuretics may be used as well, and sometimes the escalation of double-drug treatment to triple-drug therapy is required to improve BP control in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension. Fixed-dose combinations in a single pill may increase compliance compared with corresponding free-drug components given separately, as it simplifies treatment and thereby can improve adherence on the part of the patients.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112DUdbm]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate prompt and timely titrated two drugs or a single-pill combination of drugs demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes, in addition to lifestyle modifications, in patients with confirmed office-based BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg.

### Is it time to move to multidrug combinations? [^115b7nia]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical benefit of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control in reducing adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes is well documented. However, a majority of patients with hypertension remain poorly controlled with monotherapy and require two or more agents to achieve their target BP levels. Patients with hypertension who also have diabetes or renal disease benefit from even lower BP targets, but may be more difficult to treat and require three or more drugs to achieve control. Using two or more drugs, each at lower doses, is usually more effective and less commonly associated with adverse effects than higher doses of a single drug. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes and renal disease, the treatment of hypertensive patients with multidrug combinations will become even more common. Knowing how specific combinations can be used effectively will be an important component of the treatment strategy for hypertension.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### Blood pressure and glycaemic effects of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes on combination antihypertensive therapy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study [^112c2R16]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for microvascular and macrovascular disease. Although the blood pressure-lowering effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are already established, guidance is needed on how to use these drugs in patients already receiving antihypertensive therapy. We aimed to compare blood pressure and glycaemic effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with placebo in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study we enrolled patients from 311 centres in 16 countries across five continents. Patients had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0%-10.5%; 53–91 mmol/mol) and hypertension (systolic 140–165 mm Hg and diastolic 85–105 mm Hg at both enrolment and randomisation, and a mean 24 h blood pressure of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg by ambulatory monitoring within 1 week of randomisation) and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, insulin, or both, plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker and an additional antihypertensive drug. Using an interactive voice-response system, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients to dapagliflozin 10 mg once a day or to placebo, with randomisation stratified by additional antihypertensive drug use and insulin use at baseline, in a block size of two. The co-primary endpoints were changes in seated systolic blood pressure and HbA1c measured in the full analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement of efficacy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01195662.

Findings

Between Oct 29, 2010, and Oct 4, 2012, we randomly assigned 225 patients to dapagliflozin and 224 to placebo. Seated systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the group assigned to dapagliflozin (adjusted mean change from baseline -11.90 mm Hg [95% CI -13.97 to -9.82]) compared with those assigned to placebo (-7.62 mm Hg [-9.72 to -5.51]; placebo-adjusted difference for dapagliflozin -4.28 mm Hg [-6.54 to -2.02]; p = 0.0002). Reductions in HbA1c concentrations were also significantly greater in patients assigned to dapagliflozin (adjusted mean change from baseline -0.63% [95% CI -0.76 to -0.50]) than in those assigned to placebo (-0.02% [-0.15 to 0.12]; placebo-adjusted difference -0.61% [-0.76 to -0.46,]; p < 0.0001). In a post-hoc analysis, we found difference in blood pressure versus placebo was greater in patients receiving a β blocker (-5.76 mm Hg [95% CI -10.28 to -1.23]) or a calcium-channel blocker (-5.13 mm Hg, [-9.47 to -0.79]) as their additional antihypertensive drug than in those receiving a thiazide diuretic (-2.38 mm Hg [-6.16 to 1.40]). Adverse events were similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (98 [44%] patients vs 93 [42%], respectively, had at least one adverse event), with few adverse events related to renal function (1% vs < 1%) or volume depletion (< 1% vs 0%).

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin 10 mg significantly improved blood pressure and HbA1c and was tolerated similarly to placebo. Its blood pressure-lowering properties were particularly favourable in patients already receiving a β blocker or calcium-channel blocker. Dapagliflozin could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes who need a diuretic-like effect to optimise control of blood pressure, adding meaningful efficacy to antihypertensive drug regimens.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, pharmacotherapy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate prompt and timely titrated two drugs or a single-pill combination of drugs demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes, in addition to lifestyle modifications, in patients with confirmed office-based BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg.

### Crucial role of kidney function in resistance to antihypertensive therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus [^116m2m16]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Effective blood pressure (BP) control is difficult to achieve in diabetic patients. This study investigated factors that exacerbate resistance to antihypertensive medication in patients with diabetes.

Methods

Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 108, 67 ± 9 years) were subjected to a step-wise upward titration of medication (step 1, routine dose of angiotensin receptor blocker; step 2, routine doses of angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker; step 3, step 1 + double dose of calcium channel blocker; step 4, double doses of angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker; step 5, step 4 + routine dose of diuretic; step 6, step 5 + routine dose of β-blocker; step 7, step 6 + routine dose of α-blocker; step 8, step 6 + double dose of α-blocker) implemented with a target home BP of below 130/80 mmHg. The step number at which target BP was achieved was considered the amount of antihypertensive medications needed for BP control.

Results

All patients reached the target BP at step 4.0 ± 1.5. Multivariate regression analysis identified estimated glomerular filtration rate, but not measures of glycemic control, as an independent predictor of the number of drugs needed for BP control (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The number of antihypertensive medications needed for BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus is largely dependent on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Impaired kidney function could produce resistance to antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112UvZU5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.

Combination therapy

More than two-thirds of hypertensive individuals are inadequately controlled on mono therapy. Most diabetic individuals are treated with RAAS inhibitors and most guidelines recommend adding a calcium antagonist or diuretic as add-on therapy. In a sub-analysis of 6946 diabetic patients, in the Avoiding cardiovascular Events through combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial, a combination of benazepril plus amlodipine was significantly more effective in reducing the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization, compared to therapy with benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The superiority of amlodipine over hydrochlorothiazide as an addition to benazepril disappeared in obese individuals. Combining a RAAS blocker with a CCB provides better renoprotection and leads to less ankle edema compared with a CCB alone. In addition, combining an ARB with a CCB was associated with improved insulin sensitivity compared with an ARB and a diuretic. Based on these studies, it seems that CCBs are appropriate as second-line agents in diabetic patients already treated with RAAS blockers. In obese individuals or when volume overload is present, diuretics may be used as well. In a large group of patients with stage I hypertension a combination of chlorthalidone and amiloride yielded a greater reduction in BP than the ARB losartan. In patients requiring triple therapy, RAAS blockers should be combined with diuretics and CCBs, unless there is compelling indication for the use for a different anti-hypertensive class (heart failure or ischemic heart disease for beta blockers or benign prostate hyperplasia for alpha blockers). Patients with resistant hypertension, particularly in the presence of low potassium levels, may benefit from aldosterone antagonists. These should be used cautiously, particularly in patients already on RAAS blockers. Once BP goal has been achieved antihypertensive treatment should be continued. In the ADVANCE trial discontinuation of antihypertensive medications was associated with increased risk of combined macro and microvascular events.

Diabetic treatment effective for the control of hypertension

In the last decade there is a surge of new anti-diabetic medications working on different pathways in insulin production and glucose disposal. Some of these agents have beneficial effects on BP and may prove as important agents for the control of hypertension in diabetic individuals. In this paragraph we will discuss these classes of agents and the evidence for their effect on elevated BP in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

Hypertension in Patients with CKD or Diabetes For persons 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, the treatment threshold and target blood pressures are the same as those for the general population younger than 60 years. Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker.

If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moderate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients.

### Olmesartan / amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: a subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^112r3dV3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current subgroup analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of triple-combination treatment in difficult-to-treat participants with hypertension and diabetes, CKD, or chronic CVD. BP reductions with triple-combination treatment in these subgroups at week 12 were comparable to those for the overall study cohort (−37/22 mm Hg). Long-term treatment with varying doses of OM/AML/HCTZ in these subgroups resulted in similar BP-lowering effects for those receiving triple-combination treatment during the double-blind period of the study. Triple-combination treatment also enabled these high-risk subgroups to achieve BP goal (< 130/80 mm Hg) at week 12 and at week 52. Triple-combination treatment was well tolerated in these subgroups, with a low percentage of participants discontinuing treatment across treatment groups and no clinically meaningful differences in AEs. The presence of diabetes, CKD, or chronic CVD did not change the AE profile of the drugs used in this analysis from that observed in the total TRINITY study cohort.

It has been estimated that at least 75% of patients with hypertension require combination therapy to maintain BP control, and large clinical trials have reported that 23–54% of participants require 3 or more antihypertensive agents. Thus, there is a growing emphasis on the need for practical strategies to consistently achieve and maintain BP goals with the use of multiple antihypertensive agents in clinical practice.

Single-pill combination therapy may improve BP control through regimen simplification, which may lead to an improvement in patient adherence, reduction in physician visits, and attainment of BP goals. Single-pill combinations have the potential to increase adherence to therapy compared with free-dose combinations, particularly in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities. Such patients are at increased risk of nonadherence due to the need for multiple medications for a variety of comorbidities (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes) in addition to antihypertensive medications.

### Anti-hypertensive medication combinations in the United States [^113jvyyB]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Examining the anti-hypertensive regimens of individuals with different comorbidities may offer insights into how we can improve hypertension management.

Methods

The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2013–2015) was used to describe the most common single-, two-, three-, and four-drug hypertension regimens among hypertensive adults in four different comorbidity groups: 1. Hypertension only; 2. Hypertension and diabetes; 3. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke history); and 4. Hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Results

15,901 adults with hypertension taking anti-hypertensive medications were included in the study. 58.6% (95% CI: 57.3–59.8) took multiple anti-hypertensive medications, but the proportion of adults taking multiple anti-hypertensives varied by comorbidity group. Regimens including an ACE-inhibitor/ARB were the most prevalent regimens among individuals taking ≥ 2 anti-hypertensive medications. The most common two-drug regimen for both the hypertension-only and hypertension-diabetes groups was an ACE-inhibitor/ARB with thiazide. The most prevalent regimen for the two cardiovascular disease groups was an ACE-inhibitor/ARB with beta-blocker.

Conclusions

Most individuals with hypertension use between 2–5 medications and the medications comprising these regimens vary by comorbidity. The ACCOMPLISH trial suggested that certain combinations may lead to superior cardiovascular outcomes. Research comparing the efficacy of different hypertension medication combinations among individuals with different comorbidities could lead to better patient hypertensionrelated outcomes.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Should we treat prehypertension in diabetes? What are the cons? [^116YWSS1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The coexistence of diabetes and hypertension results in more severe cardiomyopathy than would be expected with either hypertension or diabetes alone. Clinical studies with echocardiography also showed an increased left ventricular mass in diabetic hypertensive patients increased septal and posterior wall thickness in patients with hypertension and diabetes, compared with nondiabetic hypertensive patients. Prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 72% in diabetic hypertensive patients and only 32% in the nondiabetic hypertensive patients who had a similar degree of hypertension. Because left ventricular hypertrophy is known to predispose patients with hypertension to CV morbid and fatal events, the finding of a high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in diabetic hypertensive patients may partially explain their increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiomyopathy of diabetes and hypertension is associated with impaired ventricular function and a high prevalence of congestive heart failure.

Diabetes is one of the leading causes for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hypertension is a well-defined risk factor for end-stage renal disease and accounts for 27% of all end-stage renal disease cases in the U.S. and 33.4% of end-stage renal disease cases among African Americans.

When hypertension is superimposed on diabetes, it accelerates the decrease in renal function. Blood pressure control can slow the progression of renal disease in diabetic patients.

Diabetes adversely affects cerebrovascular arterial circulation. The risk of stroke is increased by 150–400% for patients with diabetes. In the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, subjects taking medications for diabetes were three times as likely to suffer a stroke. In particular, diabetes increases the risk of stroke among younger patients. The prevalence of diabetes increases the risk of stroke-related dementia more than threefold, doubles the risk of recurrence, and increases total and stroke-related mortality.

Hypertension, mainly systolic, is strongly and directly related to stroke in all age-groups, and lowering BP reduces the rate of stroke remarkably. The occurrence of diabetes more than doubles the risk of stroke in hypertensive patients, and lowering BP in these patients reduces the risk of stroke by 44%.

Diabetes may cause diabetic retinopathy that is characterized by neovascularization and formation of microaneurysms. Hypertension accelerates the development of diabetic retinopathy. Knowler et al. found that in diabetic subjects not taking insulin, the incidence of exudates in those with systolic BP of > 145 mmHg was more than twice that of those with pressures of < 125 mmHg. The combination of hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy is often devastating and remains one of the leading causes of blindness.

### Long-term dual blockade with candesartan and lisinopril in hypertensive patients with diabetes: the CALM II study [^117Bdefn]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess and compare the long-term effects of the combination of candesartan and lisinopril with high-dose lisinopril on systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study with a 12-month follow-up. Drug therapy was either lisinopril 40 mg once daily or dual-blockade treatment with candesartan 16 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg once daily. The study comprised 75 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients aged 35–74 years. The main outcome measures were seated and 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure.

Results

Reduction in systolic blood pressure (24-h systolic blood pressure) reduction was obtained in both treatment arms (mean reduction at final follow-up: dual blockade 6 mmHg vs. lisinopril 2 mmHg), but no significant difference was found between dual-blockade and lisinopril 40 mg once daily (P = 0.10). Both treatments were generally well tolerated, and similar low rates of side effects were found in the two groups.

Conclusions

There was no statistically significant difference between lisinopril 40 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with candesartan 16 mg once daily in reducing systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetes.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^116ET2nc]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 70% of adults treated for primary hypertension will eventually require at least two antihypertensive agents, either initially as combination therapy or as add-on therapy if monotherapy and lifestyle modifications do not achieve adequate blood pressure control. Four main classes of medications are used in combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs and ARBs should not be used simultaneously. In black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be treated initially with a beta blocker and an ACEI or ARB (or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), followed by add-on therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a diuretic based on volume status. Treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria should include an ACEI or ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated similarly to those without diabetes unless proteinuria is present, in which case combination therapy should include an ACEI or ARB.

INTRODUCTION

According to the WHO, the worldwide prevalence of hypertension is estimated at 1.3 billion. Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major modifiable risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease and recurrent cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and cardiovascular death. The relationship between BP and the risk of cardiovascular events is known to be continuous, extending to SBP level 115 mmHg or less. For noncommunicable diseases, the WHO has set a target to reduce the prevalence of elevated BP by 33% between 2010 and 2030. A recent study from the Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) based on 1201 population-representative studies with 104 million participants estimated that between 1990 and 2019, the worldwide rates of treatment and control were approximately 43 and 21%, respectively, in individuals with hypertension. A similar study from the NCD-RisC summarizing data from 12 high-income countries from 2008 to 2017 reported the rates of treatment and control as 45–75% and 22–60%, respectively. In the United Kingdom (UK), in 2016, the rates of treatment and control of BP were estimated at approximately 57 and 37%, respectively.

In hypertensive patients, diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) lead to a substantial risk of cardiovascular events. Approximately, 74% of patients with diabetes have SBP at least 140 mmHg or DBP at least 90 mmHg or receive antihypertensive medication. According to the American Heart Association, 68% of diabetic individuals aged at least 65 years are suffering from cardiac issues and 16% had stroke. Clinical practice guidelines recommend considering both BP and the risk of ASCVD while determining antihypertensive treatment for patients with diabetes. A recent study demonstrated that in individuals with type 2 diabetes who did not have significant cardiovascular comorbidities, the inclusion of ASCVD risk scores along with monitoring of SBP levels improved the ability to predict cardiovascular events. The coexistence of hypertension, diabetes, and ASCVD increases cardiovascular risks, necessitating therapeutic management in this population. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrates that each 5 mmHg decrease in SBP reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 10%, establishing pharmacological BP-lowering to be a cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112z3Wzy]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with renal impairment, there are limited data on the efficacy of telmisartan/HCTZ compared with placebo, telmisartan monotherapy or other ARB-based combinations. The Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan And enalaprIL (DETAIL ®) study, in which more than 80% of enrolled patients had microalbuminuria, confirmed the efficacy of telmisartan in combination with a diuretic. Switching patients with poorly controlled hypertension and mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease from high-dose ARBs to telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg provided additional BP reductions and reduced urinary protein excretion, suggesting the combination is effective in this patient population. Telmisartan/HCTZ has also demonstrated excellent tolerability. A retrospective safety analysis of 50 studies that evaluated telmisartan either as monotherapy or combined with HCTZ confirmed that the addition of HCTZ did not have a negative impact on the excellent tolerability profile of telmisartan, which is comparable with placebo. Similar tolerability profiles have been reported for other ARB/HCTZ combinations.

### Is resistant hypertension an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes? A prospective cohort study [^1114G2aq]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is associated with excess mortality mainly, though not exclusively attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased risk for CVD morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes requires a prompt recognition and management of the other comorbidities clustering with hyperglycemia and contributing to this high-risk profile, as demonstrated by the efficacy of multifactorial intervention in the Steno-2 study. In particular, control of hypertension represents a major issue, even though blood pressure (BP) targets are still a matter of debate, with recommended values ranging from < 130 to < 140 mmHg for systolic BP and from < 80 to < 90 mmHg for diastolic BP. Unfortunately, though awareness and control of hypertension have improved in the last decades, a high percentage of diabetic hypertensive patients does not reach target BP levels.

According to the 2008 Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled BP despite the use of ≥ 3 anti-hypertensive medication classes or controlled BP while treated with ≥ 4 anti-hypertensive medication classes, with all agents prescribed at optimal dose amounts; ideally, one of these classes should be a diuretic. A recent revision of the AHA Scientific Statement has established that, in addition to a diuretic, the anti-hypertensive regimen should include also a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Pooled data from North America and Europe indicated that 14.8% of treated hypertensive patients and 12.5% of all hypertensive individuals have resistant hypertension. However, these prevalence estimates refer to "apparent resistant hypertension", as population-based studies are unable to distinguish cases of "true resistant hypertension" from those of "pseudo-resistant hypertension", i.e. individuals with "white coat" hypertension, non-adherence to medications, inappropriately prescribed anti-hypertensive regimen, and incorrect BP measurement due to cuff-related artifacts. It has been estimated that individuals with pseudo-resistant hypertension are as many as those with true resistant hypertension, who however should include also patients with BP uncontrolled with < 2 drugs who would fail to achieve BP goal if treated with three drugs. Subjects with resistant hypertension are usually older, more frequently obese and diabetic, and those with a higher prevalence of target organ damage, including CVD and chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas data on gender and ethnicity are contrasting.

### Olmesartan / amlodipine / hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: a subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^115hQ9Dg]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to previous estimates, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005–2008) showed that 98 million (21%) Americans have hypertension (defined as blood pressure [BP] > 140/90 mm Hg). According to new estimates, an additional 52 million (11%) of American adults (for a total of 150 million adults [32%]) have uncontrolled BP requiring treatment (as defined by the American Heart Association Task Force as BP > 140/90 mm Hg for low-risk individuals; > 130/80 mm Hg for Framingham risk score > 10%, CKD, diabetes, and CVD; and > 120/80 for congestive heart failure). Adults with diabetes (50.6 million), CKD (43.7 million), and CVD (43.3 million) have the greatest prevalence of uncontrolled BP. Hypertension is present in nearly 75% of patients with CVD, including coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, CKD, and peripheral artery disease; however, it is estimated that only 53% of patients receiving antihypertensive treatment achieve BP control. By 2030, it is estimated that 40.5% of the US population will have CVD.

The prevalence of hypertension is disproportionately high in patients who have diabetes, and individuals who have hypertension are nearly 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes within 6 years than those without hypertension. Elevated BP is an important modifiable risk factor in patients with CKD, and BP reduction has the potential to both reduce cardiovascular death and attenuate progression of kidney disease. It is estimated that triple-combination therapy is needed in at least 25% of all patients with hypertension in order to control BP. Individuals who have hypertension and diabetes, CKD, or CVD are likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve the lower BP goals recommended in these high-risk populations. Furthermore, single-pill combination therapy may result in increased adherence through reduction in pill burden and simplification of the therapeutic regimen. A study including ~85,000 patients from Kaiser Permanente found that adherence decreased when the number of medications prescribed increased. In this study, antihypertensive medication adherence levels were 77.2%, 69.7%, 62.9%, and 55.5% in patients who received 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-drug regimens, respectively.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA recommends chlortha lidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic and recommends that central-acting alpha agonists be avoided. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. 4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria. Direct renin inhibitors were not considered by the JNC8 because there were no studies showing their benefits on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes. The ESC notes that aliskiren combined with an ACEI or ARB led to adverse events in patients with diabetes.

5 Although newer direct renin inhibitors are being developed, they are not yet widely used. DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 45 ACEIs or ARBs should be used in patients with proteinuria, including those with diabetes. In patients with diabetes who do not have proteinuria, there is no benefit in using an ACEI or ARB compared with a CCB or thiazide diuretic. 5, 6 A meta-analysis showed that ACEIs — but not ARBs — reduce the incidence of doubling of the serum creatinine level in patients with diabetes, but they do not affect progression to end-stage renal disease.

46 Another meta-analysis showed that ACEIs are superior to ARBs in reducing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 47 The ACCOMPLISH trial showed that patients with diabetes who are treated with a combined ACEI/CCB have a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events compared with those treated with a combined ACEI/thiazide diuretic. 48.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^112bdiHL]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The Simplified Treatment Intervention to Control Hypertension Study was a cluster-randomized trial, involving 45 family practices in Ontario, Canada and compared control rates of hypertension as achieved by a simplified treatment algorithm (experimental group) or following the Canadian Hypertension Program guideline (control group). The systolic/diastolic target BP was < 140/ < 90 mm Hg and < 130/ < 90 mm Hg in diabetic patients. The simplified treatment algorithm consisted of the following: (1) initial therapy with a low-dose ACE inhibitor/TD or ARB/TD SPC; (2) uptitration of the combination therapy to the highest dose; (3) addition and subsequent uptitration of a CCB; and (4) addition of a βB, α-blocker, or spironolactone. The proportion of patients achieving target BP at 6 months was higher in the experimental (N = 802) than the control (N = 1246) group (64.7% versus 52.7%; P = 0.026). At 6 months, 82.8% of patients in the experimental group were on SPCs and 16.4% in the control group. However, no information on BP control beyond 6 months was provided.

A third randomized double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of triple therapy with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide for moderate or severe hypertension (systolic/diastolic BP, 145/100 mm Hg or higher). After a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 320/10/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320/25 mg, valsartan/amlodipine 320/10 mg, or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 10/25 mg with uptitration of these once daily SPCs from week 1 to week 3. Of the 4285 patients screened, 2271 (53.0%) were randomized (women, 44.7%; mean age, 53.2 years; mean entry BP, 169.9/106.5 mm Hg) and 2060 (90.7%) completed the 8-week trial. Triple therapy was significantly superior to all of the dual therapies in reducing BP (P < 0.0001). Results were similar across sex, age, and ethnicity strata. The limitations of this study were like those of the COACH trial.

### Are SGLT2 inhibitors joining the mainstream therapy for diabetes type 2? [^114EsuAW]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Conventional therapies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications are only partially effective. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches leading to additional risk reduction are required. While many anti-diabetic medications have been prescribed world-wide for controlling T2DM over the past half-century, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are relatively new. In addition to their plasma glucose lowering effect, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce considerably cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with T2DM.

Aim

Since, a risk and benefit analysis of co-administration of SGLT2 inhibitors and other anti-diabetic agents in patients who suffer from hypertension, heart failure or renal deficiency is currently lacking, the main objective of this article is to review the recent literature and provide the health care professionals with evidence-based opinions on the subject.

Conclusion

SGLT2 inhibitors have relatively safe profiles and can efficiently decrease HbA1c as well as fasting and postprandial glucose levels. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors administrations are not associated with significant hypoglycemic episodes or weight gain. Thus, combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and other less harmful anti-diabetic medicines could be considered if there is no any contraindication.

### WITHDRAWN: antihypertensive therapy for preventing cardiovascular complications in people with diabetes mellitus [^116z1B56]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are closely associated diseases which are both strongly related to the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the effect of intervention, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce blood pressure in people with diabetes mellitus on all cause mortality, specific causes of death, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, ischaemic heart disease and renal disease, morbidity associated with macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus and also side effects of the interventions and their influence on quality of life and well being.

Search Strategy

The search strategy employed was to searching electronic databases such as Embase and Medline for all trials of anti-hypertensive treatment in diabetes mellitus. As well as searching specialist journals in the fields of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension and renal diease.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered independently and then discussed by 2 reviewers to determine there eligibility for inclusion in the review. Their methodological quality was also assessed from details of the randomisation methods, blinding and whether the intention-to-treat method of analysis was used. Trials included in the review were all randomised controlled trials of the treatment for anti-hypertensive therapy for the specified endpoints which included subjects with diabetes mellitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was sought on the number of patients with diabetes with each outcome measure by allocated treatment group, either from previous publications or, if this was not possible, the raw data was obtained and analysed using the intention-to-treat method. If these data were not available the results from the 'Per Protocol' analysis were used. To compare the treatment effect of the intervention with that of placebo on all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each trial and a meta analysis performed using Peto's ORs as the summary measure.

Main Results

The initial search yielded 760 references, from which 23 appropriate trials were identified (3 for primary prevention and 20 for secondary prevention), and 15 of these trials had data available for analysis. For the primary prevention trials the summary ORs (95% CIs) for all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease were 0.85 (0.62,1.17) and 0.64 (0.50,0.82) respectively. Of the seven trials for long-term secondary prevention (i.e. follow-up greater than one year), the summary OR (95% CI) for all cause mortality was 0.82 (0.69,0.99). Data on cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity was only available for 2 of these trials and the summary OR (95% CI) was 0.82 (0.60,1.13). There were five trials for short term secondary prevention trials (i.e. follow-up of less than 1 year) with data available for analysis. The summary ORs (95% CIs) for all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease were 0.64 (0.50,0.83) and 0.68 (0.43,1.05) respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

Primary intervention trials indicated a treatment benefit for cardiovascular disease, but not for total mortality in people with diabetes. For both short- and long-term secondary prevention, the present meta-analysis indicated a benefit for total mortality in diabetic subjects. However lack of information on cardiovascular disease outcomes probably reduced the power of the meta-analysis to detect any corresponding benefit for this end-point. This, along with the fact that all published data of randomised control trials of anti-hypertensive therapy in diabetes for all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes are taken from the hypertension trials not specific to diabetes, underlines the need for further high quality trials examining the effects of blood pressure lowering interventions in people with diabetes.

Diabetes and intensive hypertension treatment — evidence scope and gaps: The Work Group determined the confidence in the quality of the evidence was high in support of intensive treatment of hypertension (HTN) in a general population of patients with diabetes, and stated that benefits clearly outweigh harms though acceptance and willingness to take multiple medications vary. The evidence base is primarily from patients with diabetes type 2 already on pharmacologic antihypertensive treatment, typically middle-aged or elderly (but under the age of 80 years), with little evidence for pharmacologic treatment to a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with type 1 diabetes, adults under the age of 50, or the very old (over 80 years).

In the United States, approximately 16 million people have diabetes; 90–95% have type 2 diabetes. They are at increased risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The benefits of treating hypertension in diabetic patients and the potential to delay complications and reduce mortality have been demonstrated in clinical trials. Increasing evidence shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) may be equally effective in delaying progressive renal disease in diabetic patients. Large, multicentre trials are ongoing to confirm the efficacy and superior safety profile of ARBs in this population.

### Dual inhibition with losartan and aliskiren: a promising therapeutic option for type 2 diabetic nephropathy? [^112EjdiB]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the findings and limitations of a randomized, double-blind study conducted by Parving and colleagues. The study evaluated the renoprotective effects of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by adding aliskiren (an oral, direct renin inhibitor) or placebo to treatment with 100 mg daily losartan in patients who had hypertension and type 2 diabetes with nephropathy. Addition of daily aliskiren for 6 months (150 mg/day for 3 months and 300 mg/day for 3 months) reduced the mean urinary albumin:creatinine ratio by 20% (P < 0.001), with a reduction of 50% or more in 24.7% of the patients who received aliskiren versus only 12.5% of those who received placebo (P < 0.001). At study end, mean blood pressure levels were only slightly lower in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group (2/1 mmHg lower). The authors concluded that aliskiren might have renoprotective effects that are independent of its blood-pressure-lowering effect in patients who have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and nephropathy and are receiving the recommended renoprotective treatment.

### How information about the time requirements and legacy effects of treatments influence decision-making in patients with diabetes and hypertension [^111T7r1D]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Objective

When deciding about diabetes treatments, patients are typically uninformed about how much time is required before (time requirements), or for how long treatments change outcomes (legacy effects). However, patients may be motivated to adopt treatments with time-related treatment information. We explored whether this information alters a patients' likelihood of starting medications.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted semistructured interviews with 60 adults with type 2 diabetes for < 10years and hypertension on oral medications. We measured change in likelihood of starting medications after receiving time requirement (diabetes, 10years; hypertension, 3years) and legacy effect (diabetes, 10 additional years; hypertension, none) information. Responses were analyzed for themes about time-related treatment information.

Results

At baseline, 70% of participants reported being very likely to start a recommended medication. Nearly half (40%) were less likely to start a diabetes medication after being informed of time requirements; but after being informed of legacy effects, 32% reported being more likely. Fewer participants changed likelihoods of starting antihypertensives with time-related information. Many participants expressed that medications' benefits were important to them regardless of time-related information. Participants considered time requirements for diabetes medications too long and compared them to their life expectancy. Many participants were interested in legacy effects of diabetes medications because they looked forward to discontinuing medications, although some expressed doubt that benefits could persist after stopping medications.

Conclusions

While prolonged time requirements may dissuade patients from adopting treatments, the promise of legacy effects may motivate patients to commit to diabetes treatments.

### The optimal blood pressure target in diabetes mellitus: a quest coming to an end? [^1112xULC]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially increases cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure (BP) decrease in these individuals is associated with large reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the optimal BP levels in DM still remain a matter of important controversy. For almost 20 years, guidelines recommended an office BP target of < 130/80mmHg in diabetic individuals, following evidence from trials randomizing patients to diastolic BP levels. When the action-to-control-cardiovascular-risk-in-diabetes-blood-pressure (ACCORD-BP) study showed that systolic BP (SBP) < 120mmHg was associated with similar risk to SBP < 140mmHg in type 2 DM, all guidelines stepped back to recommend a SBP < 140mmHg, despite the obvious limitations of ACCORD-BP, including the surprisingly low event rate and the actual average BP of 133.5/70.5mmHg in the "standard-target" arm. In contrast, the systolic-blood-pressure-intervention-trial (SPRINT) showed cardiovascular benefits in hypertensive patients without DM randomized to SBP < 120 versus < 140mmHg and many believed that absence of between-group differences in ACCORD-BP was rather a matter of power and not of dissimilar cardiovascular profile of diabetic patients. In this regard, the American-College-of-Cardiology/American-Heart-Association 2017 BP guidelines advocated a BP target of < 130/80 in all hypertensives, including those with DM. However, the 2018 American-Diabetes-Association recommendations were not in the same direction, suggesting BP goal < 140/90 for most patients, with the exception of those with "high cardiovascular risk", where a < 130/80mmHg target may apply. This review presents the evidence from old and recent trials relevant to optimal BP levels in DM, aiming to shed light in this major clinical question.

The pharmaceutical industry is an important motor in creating therapeutic innovation. To remain profitable, there is nothing wrong in SPC manufacturers highlighting the potential benefits of their products. However, a problem arises when retrospective observational studies – (Table S2) or systematicor narrative – reviews of such studies become the source of information in evidence-based recommendations. Guidelines should be incremental over time, meaning that evidence published between successive versions should lead to removing or adjusting previous recommendation or introducing new ones. The British guidelines – are exemplary in this respect, giving great weight to new evidence as justification for any change in treatment advice (Table S1). The 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendationstated that there was some limited evidence from a single studythat initial dual therapy, compared with placebo, might reduce cardiovascular complications in people with hypertension and type-2 diabetes, but the Committee Members were disappointed that more comprehensive data were unavailable. The Committee discussed the benefits of optimizing treatment for hypertension early and agreed that this could substantially improve quality of life. However, they found that there was not enough evidence to determine confidently the benefits or harms of starting antihypertensive treatment with dual therapy.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety profiles of two fixed-dose combinations of antihypertensive agents, amlodipine / benazepril versus valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension: a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study [^116SVj9B]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prevalent condition that is closely associated with chronic complications in patients with diabetes. Fixed-dose combination therapy is currently recommended for the treatment of hypertension due to the advantage of reducing the pill burden. However, the effects of combination therapy may be diverse because of the different components.

Objectives

We examined blood pressure reduction and metabolic alterations after amlodipine/benazepril and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and microalbuminuria.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison, noninferiority clinical trial included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and microalbuminuria detected within the past year. After a 2-week, placebo run-in period, patients were assigned to treatment with amlodipine/benazepril or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide for 16 weeks. The primary end point was mean change in diastolic blood pressure. The prespecified boundary for noninferiority was 3.5 mm Hg of the mean change in diastolic blood pressure between treatments (amlodipine/benazepril minus valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide). If the upper limit of the 95% CI fell within 3.5 mm Hg, amlodipine/benazepril would be considered noninferior to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide.

Results

Of the 226 patients assessed for eligibility, 169 satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were assigned to a treatment group; 83 patients (54.2% male, mean age of 60.5 [10.0] years) in the amlodipine/benazepril group and 84 patients (64.3% male, mean age of 59.0 [10.6] years) in the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide group received at least 1 dose of study medication and were included in the intention-to-treat population. In the per-protocol population, amlodipine/benazepril (n = 74) was noninferior to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (n = 78) with regard to the mean change in diastolic blood pressure (difference, -0.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.5 to 1.6). The mean change in systolic blood pressure was not significantly different (2.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.2 to 6.0) between study groups (P = 0.195) in the per-protocol population. However, data from the intention-to-treat population suggest that patients in the amlodipine/benazepril group may have better metabolic outcomes than those in the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide group; specifically, a preservation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (5.7 mL/min/1.73 m² [95% CI, 1.9 to 9.6]; P = 0.004) and improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin (-0.5% [95% CI, -0.7 to -0.2]; P < 0.001), fasting triglycerides (-0.4 mmol/L [95% CI, -0.7 to -0.2]; P = 0.002), HDL-C (0.07 mmol/L [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.12]; P = 0.022), and uric acid (-57.5 μmol/L [95% CI, -74.8 to -40.3]; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in adverse effects between groups, with the exception of more respiratory disorders in the amlodipine/benazepril group than in the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide group (17 vs 5; P = 0.006).

Conclusions

The study results suggest that amlodipine/benazepril is noninferior to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide with regard to blood pressure reduction and that this combination exerts beneficial effects on renal function, glucose control, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels compared with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide. However, respiratory adverse events (particularly coughing) were more frequently reported in the amlodipine/benazepril group. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01375322.

### Pharmacologic management of hypertension in patients with diabetes [^115dwMNa]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with diabetes, and adequate control of blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Patients with diabetes should achieve a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slow progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality; these agents are the preferred therapy for managing coexisting diabetes and hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers can prevent progression of diabetic kidney disease and are a first-line alternative for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics provide additional antihypertensive effects when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. With lower doses of these drugs, the risk of clinically significant metabolic alterations is minimal. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also have beneficial effects in managing hypertension in patients with diabetes. Beta blockers reduce cardiovascular events and are useful in a multidrug regimen. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be reserved for patients intolerant of preferred agents or those who need additional therapy to achieve target blood pressure. Many patients with diabetes require combination therapy with multiple antihypertensive agents.

Results

Patient disposition

From a total of 1413 patients screened for the study, 652 patients were enrolled in the double-blind phase and randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: V-low (n = 218), V-high (n = 221) and V/HCTZ (n = 213). Most patients who participated in the double-blind treatment phase were Caucasian (67%), with a mean age of 53 years and almost 88% of the patients < 65 years of age. Most of the patients were not diabetic (87%), but a majority had the metabolic syndrome (57%). At least half of all patients enrolled were on previous antihypertensive therapy. Overall, demographic characteristics were similar between the treatment groups (Table 1).

Of the 652 patients randomized into the study, 51 withdrew prior to completing their participation: V-low, n = 17; V-high, n = 17 and V/HCTZ, n = 17. The most common reasons for patient withdrawal were AEs, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect and patient withdrawal of consent. A total of four patients (1 patient in the V-high group and 3 patients in the V/HCTZ group) were excluded from the intent-to-treat population due to missing baseline or post-baseline assessments. Patient disposition throughout the study is illustrated in Figure 2. Most of the patients followed the treatment regimen as prescribed, with the exception of 37 patients (10 patients in the V-low group, 15 patients in the V-high group and 12 patients in the V/HCTZ group) with reported missed doses, titration errors or intake of prohibited medications. During the study 87% of patients in the V-low group and 86% of patients in the V-high group required titration to the next dose level (level 2 or level 3) as compared with 63% of patients for V/HCTZ.

### Implications of recently published trials of blood pressure-lowering drugs in hypertensive or high-risk patients [^114Wt8bH]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We reviewed 6 recent outcome trials of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs in 74,524 randomized hypertensive or high-risk patients. Over interpretation of nonsignificant or marginal probability values in large trials with overlapping end points, exclusion of patients not tolerating or not adhering to experimental treatments, labeling nonsignificant treatment effects as modest, and insufficient information on the quality of the BP measurements or on the BP changes early after randomization raise concern. From a clinical viewpoint, results should not be extrapolated to patients with characteristics dissimilar from those randomized. The benefit beyond BP lowering in cardiovascular prevention is tiny. Dual inhibition of the renin system should only be used in patients at high risk, in whom all drug combinations have been tried and who cannot be controlled by a single renin system inhibitor. Current evidence does not support BP lowering in normotensive patients or the use of renin system inhibitors for prevention of stroke recurrence. Because angiotensin-receptor blockers might offer less protection against myocardial infarction than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the latter should remain the preferred renin system inhibitor for cardiovascular prevention in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-tolerant patients. In 2 trials, in which new-onset diabetes was a predefined end point, 1000 patients had to be treated for 1 year with an angiotensin-receptor blocker instead of placebo to prevent just 2 cases. From a design viewpoint, the time has come to revise the concept of large simple trials and to pursue research questions that serve patient interests more than showing noninferiority or highlight the ancillary qualities of marketable antihypertensive drugs.

ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in diabetes with CKD — preferred indications and dosing emphasize albuminuria thresholds and use of maximum tolerated doses: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the preferred first-line agents for blood pressure treatment among people with diabetes, hypertension, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and UACR ≥ 300 mg/g [creatinine], and in the setting of lower levels of albuminuria (30–299 mg/g [creatinine]) therapy at maximum tolerated doses reduced progression to more advanced albuminuria (≥ 300 mg/g creatinine), slowed CKD progression, and reduced cardiovascular events but has not reduced progression to ESKD; while ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed for moderately increased albuminuria (30–299 mg/g [creatinine]) without hypertension, outcome trials have not been performed, and two long-term, double-blind studies demonstrated no renoprotective effect when initiated in people with normal albuminuria or hypertension alone without albuminuria; it is also noted that not maximizing these therapies due to creatinine rise concerns would not be considered optimal care and that trials used maximum tolerated doses, there are no studies demonstrating outcome benefits on both mortality and slowed CKD progression in people with diabetes who have an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and when increases in serum creatinine reach 30% without associated hyperkalemia, RAS blockade should be continued.

Discussion

The global prevalence of diabetes has risen sharply. According to statistics, in the past 40 years, 34.2 million people in the United States have diabetes, 95% of whom are type 2 diabetes. The risk of cardiovascular disease in adults with diabetes accounts for 10–12% of all vascular deaths compared with adults without diabetes. Hypertension is a common disease coexisting with diabetes mellitus and a definite risk factor for Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Two-thirds of patients with diabetes have hypertension, and the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes with hypertension is four times higher than that in normotensive patients with diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension have a significantly higher risk of complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic renal failure (CKD). A substantial benefit is seen when multiple cardiovascular risk factors are resolved simultaneously. Therefore, active control of blood pressure is essential for people with type 2 diabetes.

WHO recommends that antihypertensive drugs be started when systolic blood pressure is 130–139 mmHg in patients diagnosed with hypertension, concomitant cardiovascular disease, or high cardiovascular risk (such as diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease). In the initial treatment, any two of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics (thiazide or thiazide-like) and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be selected for combination therapy. Compared with CCBs and β-blockers, ACEIs/ARBs can better reduce the risks of MACE, heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death and are the first drugs of choice for treating hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. For patients with diabetes and hypertension, blood pressure targets should be individualized through a shared decision-making process that addresses cardiovascular risk, potential adverse effects of antihypertensive medications, and patient preferences. Maintaining blood pressure and blood glucose at an ideal level is complicated, and multi-drug combination therapy is required. Therefore, excessive treatment should be avoided when formulating a treatment regimen to reduce the occurrence of adverse drug events. Currently, the choice of therapeutic drugs for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with hypertension still lacks extensive data support at home and abroad.

### Management of diabetes and hypertension within the gulf region: updates on treatment practices and therapies [^1179g7rJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

While lifestyle changes are important for the management of hypertension, considerable improvements in BP can be seen with medication. However, physicians can be reluctant to add another class of medication to a patient's regimen if they are not reaching their target owing to the perceived risk of hypotension. According to the 2015 guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology and the Taiwan Hypertension Society for the management of hypertension, the 'Rule of 10' demonstrates that doubling the dose of any one medication will generally result in only a 2 mmHg decrease in SBP, whereas the addition of a second medication can result in a 10 mmHg reduction in BP. In clinical practice, physicians can apply the 'Rule of 10' to determine the number of medications needed to reach target BP, i.e. by calculating the difference between the current and target BP and dividing this difference by 10 to determine the approximate number of medications needed to achieve the patient's target BP.

Single-pill combinations (SPCs) of anti-hypertensive medications could improve patient outcomes. When compared with free pill combinations, SPCs reduce the 1-year risk of any cardiovascular event by 21% and can reduce the risk of ischaemic heart disease by 39%, as determined by a population-based cohort study of > 5 million individuals. Initial treatment with an SPC also provides better, more rapid BP control than free pill combinations, taking patients 28% less time to achieve the targeted BP within the first year of treatment. In an open-label RCT conducted over 6 months, a higher proportion of patients on an SPC containing perindopril, indapamide and amlodipine achieved the BP target compared with those who received the same therapy as individual pills (85% versus 53%, P < 0.05), and adherence rates were higher in the patients taking the SPC (87% versus 61%, P < 0.05).

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in diabetic nephropathy [^114Qqx1s]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of inadequately controlled hypertension in a diabetic patient with clinical signs of renal involvement portends a poor prognosis. Initial assessment should include ruling out factors which may exacerbate the hypertension and careful assessment of the stage of hypertension, renal function and amount of proteinuria. Intensive treatment requires finding a combination of medications which will reduce not only blood pressure but also proteinuria. It is suggested that treatment should be started with an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker often in a fixed combination with a low-dose thiazide diuretic. Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers may be added if required as second or third-line agents. In patients not responding to this combination, the dosages of the ACE inhibitor or AT1 blocker should be titrated upwards in order to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect. However, if this is still insufficient, dual blockade of the RAS should be considered and even an aldosterone receptor blocker may need to be added to the therapeutic regimen. It should be remembered that such a patient requires close monitoring in order to be sure that he is compliant with respect to the prescribed treatment and that there are no side-effects such as hyperkalaemia.

### Targeting mechanisms of hypertensive vascular disease with dual calcium channel and renin-angiotensin system blockade [^114YBmR4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with hypertension, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, are at heightened risk for cardiovascular and renal disease. Accumulated evidence indicates that the majority of hypertensive patients at high risk will require more than one antihypertensive agent to reach their blood pressure (BP) target. A reasonable strategy is to use agents with complementary mechanisms of action to enhance BP-lowering efficacy and prevent target organ damage. In experimental models, the combination of a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, improves measures of endothelial function, inflammation, ventricular remodelling and renal function to a greater degree than these classes given as monotherapy. In clinical trials, calcium channel/RAS blockade combination therapy has been shown to provide greater BP reductions and improve renal function in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease earlier and to a greater extent than monotherapy. In addition, dual calcium channel/RAS blockade increases arterial compliance, arterial distensibility and flow-mediated vasodilation. Expanding upon extensive research on the benefits of calcium channel blockade and RAS blockade for the prevention of vascular events and preclinical and clinical trial evidence suggests added effects of combination therapy by targeting the underlying mechanisms of hypertensive vascular disease.

### Hypertension and diabetes… [^115haakk]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

However, there are physiologic and clinical rationale for renin angiotensin system blockade, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition as the preferential therapy in these patients. In this regard, preliminary data with the new class of angiotensin II receptor blockers suggest that these agents may offer benefits equivalent to those observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors while offering better tolerance. This review will detail the evidence for blood pressure reduction in high-risk hypertensive patients with diabetes, provide recommendations for the levels to which blood pressure should be reduced, review the evidence for the preferred classes of antihypertensive agents in these patients, and discuss preliminary results and ongoing clinical trials in these patients with the newly developed angiotensin II receptor blockers.

For the observed similarity between β blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in this population, a few points are notable. Titration of multiple medications was performed for most of the patients in UKPDS, which may explain the lack of difference between the 2 primary therapies on the rate of progression of renal disease. Furthermore, it can be argued that the short-acting ACE inhibitor captopril was ineffectively administered as only 25 to 50 mg was given twice daily. Despite these arguments, lower blood pressure remains the critical factor in delaying renal disease progression. This point can be appreciated from the HOT study results, 9 in which a calcium channel blocker –based therapeutic approach significantly reduced events in hypertensive patients with diabetes.

Despite the observations in the HOT study and UKPDS, there are physiologic and clinical rationale for the preferential use of renin angiotensin system blockade with ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients with diabetes. Recently, reviews of the literature57-59 have coalesced findings demonstrating the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to slow the development of end-stage renal failure, 60 and a meta-analysis61 of published studies of diabetic patients with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria concluded that ACE inhibitors exert specific antiproteinuric effects even without a change in blood pressure. The observation that RAS blockade may be superior to other forms of antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients with diabetes is not without physiologic rationale.

Increased efferent glomerular arteriolar tone is often present in diabetic patients, possibly due to the excessive vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II.

### Recent understandings about hypertension management in type 2 diabetes: what are the roles of SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and finerenone? [^116PfbJR]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and hypertension often coexist, with about half of patients with diabetes also having hypertension. The risk of cardiovascular disease increases by three to six-fold with the coexistence of diabetes and hypertension; therefore, the management of blood pressure to prevent cardiovascular disease is a particularly important issue in patients with diabetes. Clinical trial findings have resulted in recommendations to control blood pressure to < 130/80mmHg in Japanese patients with diabetes. However, the target blood pressure and selection of anti-hypertensive medications should vary depending on the duration of diabetes and comorbidities, and guidelines and clinical trial results should be interpreted flexibly to provide anti-hypertensive treatment tailored to individual patients. In recent years, a number of drugs have emerged that have significant cardio-renal protective effects in patients with diabetes, and a typical example is sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone. They have also shown modest but significant blood pressure-lowering effects. In the future, beyond considering the thresholds for how far to lower blood pressure, blood pressure management in patients with diabetes will require understanding the additive cardioprotective value of drugs aimed at lowering blood pressure and the quality of blood pressure lowering. Clinical questions of blood pressure lowering in patients with diabetes GLP-1RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor.

### Manidipine versus enalapril monotherapy in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 24-week study [^116KCcAm]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure reduction is associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular events and death, particularly in patients with both hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability, and effect on metabolic risk factors of manidipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, and enalapril, a widely used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This multicenter, double-blind trial compared manidipine and enalapril in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90–104 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≤ 190 mm Hg). Following a 3-week, single-blind placebo run-in period, eligible patients were randomized to receive either manidipine 10 mg or enalapril 10 mg once daily for 24 weeks. The dose was doubled after 3 weeks in patients who had not responded to treatment (DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). The primary efficacy end point was change in DBP from baseline to the end of the study. Secondary outcomes were the responder rate (DBP < 90 mm Hg and/or a DBP reduction of ≥ 10 mm Hg) at the end of the study. Other secondary measures were changes from baseline to the end of the study in heart rate and in the following measures obtained by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime mean DBP and SBP, and the trough:peak ratio. Blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, and creatinine were measured at the end of the placebo run-in period and the end of treatment. The study had 80% power to detect a between-treatment difference in mean sitting DBP of > 3 mm Hg.

Results

One hundred twenty-four patients were enrolled in the study. After the placebo run-in period, 13 patients were excluded from the study: 4 for DBP values outside the specified limits, 7 at their request, and 2 for adverse events. Thus, 111 patients met the eligibility criteria and were randomized to treatment (53 manidipine, 58 enalapril). The population consisted of 61 men and 50 women with a mean (SD) age of 62 (11) years and a body mass index of 28.2 (2.4) kg/m². Among patients who completed the study, drug doses were doubled in 67.6% (25/37) of patients in the manidipine group and 60.0% (24/40) of patients in the enalapril group (P = NS). Similar reductions in blood pressure were observed in both groups, from a mean (SD) of 164 (12)/97.5 (5) mm Hg at baseline to 141 (12)/84.5 (6) mm Hg at the end of the study in the manidipine group (P < 0.01), and from 159 (12)/98 (4) mm Hg to 139 (12)/86 (8) mm Hg in the enalapril group (P < 0.01). The proportion of responders was 66.7% (32/48) in the manidipine group and 60.0% (30/50) in the enalapril group; the difference between groups was not significant. Twenty-four-hour ABPM revealed significant (P < 0.01) and similar reductions in blood pressure in both groups, with a trough:peak ratio of approximately -50%. Neither drug affected heart rate. Among the statistically significant changes in metabolic parameters, significant reductions in HbA(1c) (from 6.7% [1.4%] to 6.2% [1.1%]) and blood glucose concentrations (from 152 [44] to 143 [44] mg/dL) were observed only in the manidipine group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups.

Conclusions

In the present study, manidipine was as metabolically neutral and as effective as enalapril in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, providing a sustained 24-hour antihypertensive effect.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115v8d8z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension management in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes and hypertension, we recommend that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be the first-line therapy, and Technical remark: If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be the first-line therapy used for the treatment of hypertension in older patients with diabetes and should be included when more than one medication is needed, and these two drug classes should not be used together, especially in patients with CKD, due to increased risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Two drugs should be started together if the initial BP is ≥ 160/100 mm Hg. Because hypertension involves a volume component in many patients with diabetes, a thiazide diuretic is commonly recommended as the third drug unless the eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², in which case a loop diuretic might be more appropriate. If coronary artery disease is significant, a beta-blocker may be appropriate and can be added as a fourth drug to a prior three-drug regimen; if a beta-blocker is used, carvedilol has been shown to have fewer metabolic effects than metoprolol. Notably, when BP is not controlled with three or more medications, referral to a hypertension specialist is indicated.

### A clinical trial in type 2 diabetic nephropathy [^114JByww]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A prospective, randomized, three-armed, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has been completed in 210 sites worldwide to determine whether the angiotensin II receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium channel blocker amlodipine has a renoprotective effect in patients with overt type 2 diabetic nephropathy. A total of 1,715 subjects randomized during a 3-year period were followed a minimum of 2 years. The goal for all treatment groups was to achieve equivalent blood pressure control, with the blinded study drug (irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo) as primary therapy with additional antihypertensive drugs, excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, to achieve seated systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 85 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the combined endpoint of time to doubling of entry serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary outcomes included fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. A Clinical Management Committee monitored the conduct of the study. An Outcome Confirmation Committee classified all study outcome events in blinded fashion. An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee monitored unblinded data for interim safety and efficacy analyses of the study. Eligibility criteria included informed consent, age 30 to 70 years, adult-onset diabetes, hypertension, urine protein excretion greater than 900 mg/24 hours, and serum creatinine values of 90 to 265 micromol/L in women and 110 to 265 micromol/L in men. Baseline characteristics were age, 59 ± 8 years; body mass index, 31 ± 7 kg/m²; 67% male; 73% white, 14% black, and 13% other; duration of diabetes, 15 ± 9 years; retinopathy, 66%; neuropathy, 48%; congestive heart failure, 7.5%; screening seated systolic blood pressure, 156 ± 18 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure, 85 ± 11 mm Hg; urine protein excretion, 4.0 ± 3.5 g/24 hours; serum creatinine, 150 ± 53 micromol/L; serum potassium, 4.6 ± 0.5 mEq/L; total cholesterol, 229 ± 58 mg/dL; and hemoglobin A(1c), 8.1 ± 1.7%. This large-scale international trial should help define the clinical course and standards of care for hypertensive adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Results available on May 19, 2001, will help in defining the current controversy of the risks and benefits of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system versus calcium channel blockade versus standard antihypertensive therapy in this large patient population.

### Low dose spironolactone reduces blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a double blind randomized clinical trial [^113gWo32]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with arterial hypertension is particularly pronounced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure control is, therefore, decisively important but often not sufficiently achieved.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of low dose spironolactone added to triple therapy for resistant hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes measured by ambulatory monitoring. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects on glycaemic control and urinary albumin excretion as well as adverse effects.

Methods

In a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 119 patients with blood pressure at or above 130/80 mmHg despite triple antihypertensive therapy were included. One tablet of 25 mg spironolactone or placebo was added to previous treatment and increased to two if blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg was not achieved after 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory monitoring at baseline and after 16 weeks.

Results

The study was completed by 112 patients, 57 randomized to spironolactone and 55 to placebo. Average daytime placebo-corrected blood pressure was reduced by 8.9 (4.7–13.2)/3.7 (1.5–5.8) mmHg. Also office blood pressure, night-time, 24-h and pulse pressures were reduced significantly. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly reduced in the spironolactone group. Glycaemic control remained unchanged. Hyperkalemia was the most frequent adverse event leading to dose reduction in three cases and discontinuation in one, whereas gynaecomastia was not reported.

Conclusion

Low dose spironolactone exerts significant BP and urinary albumin creatinine ratio lowering effects in high-risk patients with resistant hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^112fewAA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure (BP). 1 The overall evidence supports that the degree of BP lowering is the major determinant of the health benefits. 1 Guidelines, therefore, emphasize the importance of controlling BP as the preeminent goal. 2, 3 In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that most hypertensive patients (eg, 75%) require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP targets. 4 As such, the most germane issue to explore in guiding present‐day clinical practice is which combination of medications (rather than what single agent) provides optimal cardiovascular protection. 5 Although most patients in clinical trials were taking > 1 antihypertensive medication, 1 only the ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial was designed to investigate the comparative cardiovascular risk reductions derived from 2 prespecified combination regimens prescribed as initial therapy. 6 The study was terminated early (mean follow‐up, 36 months) because of the superiority of benazepril+amlodipine compared with benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide for preventing the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.90; P < 0.001). Subsequent analyses showed that this benefit occurred among patients with coronary artery disease 7 and diabetes mellitus, 8 was superior for preventing adverse renal outcomes, 9 and was not likely a consequence of subtle BP differences between groups (ambulatory BP monitoring). 10

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^113ipxvw]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The central role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) has been recognized for many years. The discovery of tissue-based angiotensin II production has resulted in the concept of a local RAS that is independent of the circulating RAS.

RAS activation following the release of renin by the kidney results in a cascade of physiological events (Figure 1). Renin catalyzes the formation of angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), resulting in activation of the angiotensin II receptors and its deleterious effect on renal vasculature, resulting in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The progressive development of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) resulting from pathophysiological changes mediated by angiotensin II in the presence of risk factors is well established and local activation of RAS in the vascular walls is thought to contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, intrarenal RAS is often inappropriately activated in diabetes and is thought to predispose these patients to nephropathy. RAS inhibition (both circulatory and intrarenal) is therefore a key therapeutic approach to slow progression of CKD and to reduce CV risk through both BP-dependent and independent mechanisms.

### Blood pressure control with amlodipine add-on therapy in patients with hypertension and diabetes: results of the amlodipine diabetic hypertension efficacy response evaluation trial [^111UpNKt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Attainment of blood pressure (BP) goals in patients with diabetes is critical both to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and to delay the progression of renal disease. While therapeutic guidelines advise initial therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, monotherapy with these agents may not be sufficient to attain target BP.

Objective

The ADHT (Amlodipine Diabetic Hypertension Efficacy Response Evaluation Trial) evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding amlodipine to the treatment regimen of patients with hypertension and diabetes who were already receiving either quinapril or losartan as monotherapy.

Methods

ADHT was a double-blind, double-dummy, 22-week trial conducted in the US. After a washout period of 7–13 days, patients (aged 30–75 y) with hypertension and diabetes were randomized to receive quinapril 20 mg/day plus placebo or losartan 50 mg/day plus placebo for 4 weeks, titrated to 40 mg or 100 mg (if required), respectively, for an additional 4 weeks to achieve their BP goals (< 130/80 mm Hg). At week 8, either amlodipine 5 mg/day or placebo was added for an additional 12 weeks, with titration to 10 mg at week 14 if the BP goal was not achieved.

Results

Efficacy of add-on therapy was evaluated in 411 patients (amlodipine 211, placebo 200). BP goal was reached by 27.5% of patients when amlodipine was added to quinapril or losartan monotherapy, compared with 12.5% when placebo was added (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.61 to 4.64; p < 0.001). When added to quinapril or losartan monotherapy, amlodipine reduced BP by 8.1/5.4 mm Hg, compared with a 1.6/0.7 mm Hg decrease with add-on placebo (p < 0.001). Amlodipine, quinapril, and losartan were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Amlodipine is safe and effective when added to quinapril or losartan monotherapy to help lower BP toward therapeutic targets in patients with hypertension and diabetes.

### Combination blood pressure lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: messages from the ADVANCE trial [^111QrvYz]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The ADVANCE trial and subsequent publications have significantly advanced our understanding of BP control in T2D. BP lowering has shown consistent benefits in reducing cardiovascular, renal, and mortality events, regardless of baseline BP levels, leading to international guidelines recommending a target BP of < 130/80 mmHg for all T2D patients. Additionally, ADVANCE was pioneering in demonstrating the effectiveness of a single pill dual combination therapy as a first-line approach for hypertension management, which is now the recommended option. Several publications have contributed to the development of important risk markers, including physical signs and biomarkers like troponin and NT-proBNP, as well as cardiovascular risk prediction scores and innovative metrics such as the cumulative BP load. Furthermore, ADVANCE sheds light on practical aspects of hypertension management, including the limitations of early changes in office BP measurements for guiding therapy and the safety and efficacy of dual combination therapy in patients with T2D.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1164RGzr]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Recent trends suggest to target treatment when BP is greater than 140/90. When achieved without undue treatment burden, BP targets of less than 130/80 mmHg may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, like the young, with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one or more additional atherosclerotic CV disease risk factors. Tighter targets of less than 140/90 mmHg in patients 70–80 years old and of less than 150/90 in the elderly (more than 80 years old) seem appropriate. Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100.

ACEI/ARBs are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are probably appropriate as second-line agents. Newer antidiabetes medications such as SGLT2i have antihypertensive properties and may help in treatment decision-making and choices. Once the BP target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued in order to promote CV risk reduction. Future trials are needed to determine the appropriate BP targets for patients with diabetes.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^113Gbqwm]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

In the Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes (AVOID) study, 599 patients with T2DM, hypertension and nephropathy were randomized to losartan or losartan plus aliskiren. After 6 months' treatment, the dual RAS inhibition treatment was associated with a 20% reduction in the mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio compared with single RAS inhibition treatment (p < 0.001). The mean rate of decline in eGFR was lower with dual RAS inhibition treatment, but not significantly different from single RAS inhibition treatment. In a small, randomized, crossover trial study in 26 patients with T2DM, hypertension and albuminuria, dual RAS inhibition with aliskiren plus irbesartan was associated with a significantly greater reduction in albuminuria than either of the single RAS inhibition treatments (dual RAS inhibition, –71% reduction; aliskiren, –48%; irbesartan, –58%; p < 0.001 versus aliskiren; p = 0.028 versus irbesartan).

In a recent post-hoc subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes, with or without nephropathy, from the ONTARGET ® trial, it was observed that combination therapy with telmisartan plus ramipril did not increase the risk of stroke, other major CV or renal (dialysis or doubling of serum creatinine) outcomes compared with monotherapy, but the AEs of acute dialysis, hyperkalaemia and hypotension occurred more frequently with combination therapy. In the Valsartan Aliskiren Hypertension Diabetes (VIvID) study, 1,143 hypertensive participants with T2DM and stage 1 or 2 CKD were randomized to receive combination aliskiren ⁄ valsartan 150 ⁄ 160 mg or valsartan 160 mg monotherapy for 2 weeks, with force-titration to 300 ⁄ 320 mg and 320 mg, respectively, for another 6 weeks. Combination treatment had additive effects on BP reduction, and tolerability was similar to valsartan.
