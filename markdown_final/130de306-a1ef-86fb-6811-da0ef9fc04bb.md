## Question

What are the risk factors for malignancy in a 4 cm ovarian cyst?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors for malignancy in a 4 cm ovarian cyst. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how cyst size itself influences risk. Then, I should verify how menopausal status modifies baseline risk. Next, I will examine ultrasound morphology and Doppler features that raise suspicion. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of CA-125 and other tumor markers. I will then consider family history and genetic risk. Finally, I should integrate these into a practical risk framework and outline management implications, including when to observe versus when to refer or operate, with explicit thresholds and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the size question, because I initially thought a 4 cm cyst might be inherently higher risk, but wait, let me verify the evidence. Size alone is not a strong independent predictor of malignancy in the 4 cm range; risk rises more meaningfully with larger diameters, particularly beyond 10 cm, and even large simple cysts are often benign and may regress, so a 4 cm cyst is not automatically high risk by size alone [^3176bd84] [^aa084e5e] [^14d5e878].

> Next, I should review menopausal status, since this is the most important clinical modifier. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I quantify this. In premenopausal patients, most 4 cm cysts are functional and resolve spontaneously, so malignancy risk is very low, whereas in postmenopausal patients the baseline risk is higher and warrants closer follow-up even for simple cysts, though a 4 cm simple cyst still carries a low absolute risk if otherwise uncomplicated [^32c33bd2] [^95cf5ac2] [^7cf7d495].

> I will now examine ultrasound morphology, because this is where the real risk stratification happens. Let me think about the key features: solid components, papillary projections, irregular or thick septations, irregular walls, and increased color Doppler flow all increase malignancy risk, whereas a purely unilocular, anechoic cyst with smooth walls is reassuring; I should double-check that these are guideline-endorsed discriminators, and yes, ACOG and SOGC emphasize these features and recommend validated systems like O-RADS or IOTA-based approaches to standardize risk assignment [^3176bd84] [^a64d8d58] [^573dafb1].

> Wait, let me verify the performance of these systems so I don't overstate certainty. O-RADS and ADNEX have been prospectively validated and show strong discrimination; for example, O-RADS 2 lesions have very low malignancy rates, while O-RADS 4–5 lesions have substantially higher risks, and ADNEX integrates clinical and ultrasound variables with excellent AUCs for benign versus malignant differentiation, supporting their use in triage decisions [^564385d2] [^2e465d18] [^aeddd111].

> Now, I need to check the role of CA-125, and I should confirm its limitations. CA-125 can be elevated in benign conditions and is less specific in premenopausal patients, so a normal value does not exclude malignancy and an isolated mild elevation does not confirm it; in postmenopausal patients, markedly elevated CA-125 plus a pelvic mass is suspicious and should prompt oncology referral, but I should avoid using CA-125 in isolation to decide on surgery [^5053ab6a] [^c5b67c44] [^043faacd].

> Let me consider family history and genetics, because these shift baseline risk substantially. A strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or known BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants, markedly increases lifetime ovarian cancer risk; I should confirm that guidelines recommend eliciting this history and considering genetic counseling and testing when appropriate, which they do across ACOG and RCOG documents [^16c3aadd] [^27013183] [^1f151e2c].

> I should now integrate these into a practical risk framework. For a 4 cm cyst, if it is a simple, unilocular, anechoic cyst with smooth walls and no Doppler flow, the malignancy risk is very low regardless of size in this range, and observation with repeat ultrasound is reasonable; if it is complex with solid components, papillary projections, irregular septations, or rich vascularity, the risk is higher and warrants referral or surgical evaluation; if the patient is postmenopausal, I should have a lower threshold for closer follow-up or referral even for simple cysts, whereas in premenopausal patients, many 4 cm cysts resolve and can be observed with interval imaging [^aa084e5e] [^a64d8d58] [^95cf5ac2].

> But wait, what if the cyst is an endometrioma or a mature teratoma; do these 4 cm lesions behave differently. Endometriomas and mature teratomas are typically benign but can be associated with symptoms or, in the case of endometriomas, a small but real malignant transformation risk over time; management should balance symptom control, fertility goals, and surveillance, with surgery considered for large, symptomatic, or growing lesions and for definitive diagnosis when malignancy is a concern [^1833ae85] [^7a1c1755].

> Next, I should review concrete management thresholds to ensure clinical clarity. Referral to gynecologic oncology is indicated for postmenopausal patients with elevated CA-125 and a pelvic mass, for any patient with ultrasound features suggestive of malignancy such as solid components or papillary projections, for fixed or nodular masses, for ascites or metastatic signs, or for elevated scores on validated risk models like RMI, ROMA, or ADNEX; conversely, simple cysts under 10 cm, including 4 cm cysts, can often be observed with repeat imaging even in postmenopausal patients if otherwise uncomplicated [^0bf28094] [^a64d8d58] [^14d5e878].

> Hold on, I should verify surveillance cadence so I don't overpromise. For a 4 cm simple cyst in a premenopausal patient, repeating ultrasound in 6–12 weeks to confirm resolution is reasonable; in a postmenopausal patient with a simple cyst, repeating ultrasound in 4–6 months with CA-125 is prudent, and if stable or resolving with normal CA-125, surveillance can be discontinued after a year; if any complexity emerges or the cyst grows, escalate evaluation [^95cf5ac2] [^7cf7d495].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: for a 4 cm ovarian cyst, size alone is not the dominant risk factor; menopausal status, ultrasound morphology, and family or genetic risk are the principal determinants of malignancy risk, and most 4 cm simple cysts are benign and manageable with observation, whereas complex features or high-risk clinical contexts warrant expedited referral and surgical consideration [^aa084e5e] [^2e465d18] [^1f151e2c].

---

A 4 cm ovarian cyst has a **low overall malignancy risk**, but risk increases with **postmenopausal status**, **complex morphology** (solid components, papillary projections, irregular septations, or multilocularity), and **elevated CA-125** [^3176bd84] [^5a34edb2]. Simple, unilocular cysts in premenopausal women are usually benign and often resolve spontaneously [^32c33bd2]; in postmenopausal women, even simple cysts warrant cautious surveillance with ultrasound and CA-125 [^95cf5ac2]. Family history of ovarian or breast cancer, BRCA mutations, and symptoms (bloating, pelvic pain, early satiety) further elevate risk and should prompt gynecologic oncology referral [^0bf28094] [^1f151e2c]. Management should be individualized, with observation for low-risk features and surgical evaluation for high-risk features or persistent cysts [^0bf28094].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

### Age and menopausal status

Age is the **strongest independent risk factor** for ovarian malignancy, with incidence rising sharply after menopause; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years, and 69.4% of cases occur in women aged 55 or older [^1f151e2c]. Postmenopausal women have a **higher baseline risk** than premenopausal women, so even simple cysts warrant closer surveillance [^95cf5ac2].

---

### Family history and genetic predisposition

A strong family history of ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer increases risk, particularly with **BRCA1/2 mutations** or Lynch syndrome [^1f151e2c]. Women with BRCA1 mutations have a 41–46% lifetime risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer by age 70 [^1f151e2c].

---

### Personal medical history

Nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause, and endometriosis are associated with increased ovarian cancer risk [^58777fb4]. Endometriomas carry a **small but real malignant potential**, particularly for endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas [^notfound].

---

## Cyst-specific risk factors

### Cyst size

Size alone is a weak predictor; **cysts > 10 cm** carry higher malignancy risk, whereas 4 cm cysts are generally low risk unless other features are present [^3176bd84] [^aa084e5e].

---

### Cyst morphology

Morphology is the **most important predictor** of malignancy:

- **Simple cysts**: Unilocular, anechoic, smooth walls; very low malignancy risk (< 1%) [^aa084e5e] [^5a34edb2].
- **Complex cysts**: Solid components, papillary projections, irregular septations, or multilocularity increase risk [^3176bd84] [^a64d8d58].
- **Solid masses**: High malignancy risk and warrant surgical evaluation [^3176bd84] [^a64d8d58].

---

### Cyst growth rate

Rapid growth (> 3.5 cm/year) is concerning and increases **malignancy risk**, particularly in pregnancy-associated masses [^9515819b].

---

## Tumor markers

CA-125 is nonspecific and can be elevated in benign conditions; **elevated CA-125 in postmenopausal women with a pelvic mass** is suspicious and warrants gynecologic oncology referral [^043faacd] [^5053ab6a]. In premenopausal women, CA-125 is less specific due to menstrual and benign gynecologic causes, so **interpretation must be cautious** [^5053ab6a].

---

## Clinical symptoms

Persistent symptoms such as **bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, early satiety, urinary urgency, or changes in bowel habits** increase suspicion for malignancy and should prompt further evaluation [^de7da045].

---

## Summary of risk factors

| **Risk factor** | **Impact on malignancy risk** |
|-|-|
| Postmenopausal status | Significantly increases risk |
| Complex morphology (solid components, papillary projections, irregular septations) | Strongly increases risk |
| Elevated CA-125 (especially postmenopausal) | Increases risk |
| Family history (BRCA, Lynch) | Significantly increases risk |
| Rapid growth (> 3.5 cm/year) | Increases risk |
| Persistent symptoms (bloating, pelvic pain, early satiety) | Increases suspicion |

---

## Management implications

- **Low-risk cysts**: Simple, unilocular, 4 cm cysts in premenopausal women can be observed with repeat ultrasound; most resolve spontaneously [^32c33bd2] [^5a34edb2].
- **Intermediate-risk cysts**: Complex features or postmenopausal status warrant closer surveillance with ultrasound and CA-125 [^95cf5ac2].
- **High-risk cysts**: Solid components, papillary projections, elevated CA-125, or persistent symptoms require surgical evaluation and referral to gynecologic oncology [^0bf28094] [^a64d8d58].

---

A 4 cm ovarian cyst has a **low baseline malignancy risk**, but risk rises with **postmenopausal status**, **complex morphology**, **elevated CA-125**, **family history**, or **persistent symptoms**. Management should be tailored to these features, with observation for low-risk cysts and surgical evaluation for high-risk features.

### Can we preoperatively risk stratify ovarian masses for malignancy? [^66391c97]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Given a 10% malignancy rate in pediatric ovarian masses, what preoperative factors are helpful in distinguishing those at higher risk to risk stratify accordingly?

Methods

After institutional review board approval (IRB#022008–095), a 15(1/2)-year retrospective review of operative ovarian cases was performed.

Results

A total of 424 patients were identified, with a mean age 12.5 years (range, 1 day to 19 years), without an age disparity between benign (12.54 years, 89%) and malignant (11.8 years, 11%) cases. The 1- to 8-year age group had the highest percentage of malignancies (22%; odds ratio [OR], 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–6.86). A chief complaint of mass or precocious puberty versus one of pain had an OR for malignancy of 4.84 and 5.67, respectively (95% CI, 2.48–9.45 and 1.60–20.30). Imaging of benign neoplasms had a mean size of 8 cm (range, 0.9–36 cm) compared with malignancies at 17.3 cm (6.2–50 cm, P < .001). An ovarian mass size of 8 cm or longer on preoperative imaging had an OR of 19.0 for malignancy (95% CI, 4.42–81.69). Ultrasound or computed tomographic findings of a solid mass, although infrequent, were most commonly associated with malignancy (33%-60%), compared with reads of heterogeneous (15%-21%) or cystic (4%-5%) lesions. The malignancies (n = 46) included germ cell (50%, n = 23), stromal (28%, n = 13), epithelial (17%, n = 8), and other (4%, n = 2). Tumor markers obtained in 71% of malignancies were elevated in only 54%, whereas 6.5% of those sent in benign cases were similarly elevated. Elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), alpha fetoprotein (alphaFP), and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) were significantly associated with malignancy (P < .02) and an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was not (P = 0.1880).

Conclusion

This reported series of pediatric ovarian masses demonstrates that preoperative indicators that best predict an ovarian malignancy are a complaint of a mass or precocious puberty, a mass exceeding 8 cm or a mass with solid imaging characteristics. Those patients aged 1 to 8 years have the greatest incidence of malignancy. Tumor markers, positive or negative, were not conclusive in all cases but useful for postoperative surveillance.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is currently the eighth most common cancer among women across the world, with over 300,000 cases and 200,000 deaths per year, and an estimated global incidence of 6.6 per 100,000 women per year. Detection of the cancer is usually late with less than one-third of cases discovered in stage I or II, resulting in poor prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 30–50%. The overall 5-year survival rate varies greatly depending on tumor stage at diagnosis, and it is close to 90% when the tumor is detected in stage I, but only 20% for stage IV. The precursor states of ovarian cancers have proven difficult to identify. Precise knowledge of the etiology of the cancer could help determine an optimized screening interval in relation to cancer development. However, it has been suggested that serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), the presumed precursor to ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas, develop slowly with up to two decades from the first occurrence of genetic predisposing mutations. Recent molecular evidence from patient material suggests that the developing of ovarian cancer from STIC can occur in a much shorter time, across an estimated timespan of 6–7 years. Additional estimates based on tumor size and growthindicate that ovarian cancer can spend over 4 years in situ, or as stage I and II, before progressing to stages III and IV. Today discovery is mainly symptom-driven and women who experience pelvic symptoms are typically examined with transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) or computer tomography, and when these indicate an adnexal ovarian mass, surgery provides the final diagnosis. However, a majority of patients undergoing surgery actually have benign cysts, and more effective and targeted preoperative tools to predict malignancy would reduce unnecessary operations and minimize potential complications and induced premature menopause.

### Clinical decision making using ovarian cancer risk assessment [^5de4ed5d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although any adnexal abnormality found at imaging can be concerning for an ovarian malignancy, the clinician must perform an evaluation to decide if the actual likelihood of malignancy justifies the risk of surgery. When determining the likelihood of an asymptomatic, incidental adnexal mass being malignant, the provider must answer one important question: Do the clinical findings warrant the potential morbidity of surgery? This article will focus on the decision making that goes into such an evaluation.

Conclusion

A patient's medical history, physical examination, CA-125 level, and imaging characteristics are all factors that impact the ultimate decision of whether a patient can be observed with repeat imaging or should proceed to surgical evaluation.

### Practice bulletin no. 174: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^14d5e878]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that simple cysts < 10 cm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound obtained by an experienced specialist are likely benign. Consider monitoring these cysts with repeat imaging without surgical intervention, even in postmenopausal patients.

---

### Benign disorders of the ovary [^f6ea0ce8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Most ovarian disorders are benign, with the majority being functional ovarian cysts and benign neoplasms. Imaging can often aid in diagnosis and risk assessment. Benign ovarian disorders are frequently incidental findings, but they may cause symptoms from hormonal overproduction, mass effects, or torsion. In addition to symptoms, any ovarian abnormality can raise the specter of malignancy. Knowledge of the cause, presentation, and natural history of these benign ovarian disorders helps providers counsel and treat patients appropriately.

- ≥ 4 papillary projections (defined as > 3 mm in height)

- thick multiple irregular septations

### Multicenter pre-operative assessment of pediatric ovarian malignancy [^804889ab]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to develop a pre-operative risk assessment tool for childhood and adolescent ovarian malignancy, in order to guide operative management of pediatric ovarian masses.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients < 18 years old who underwent ovarian surgery at two quaternary care pediatric centers over 4 years (1/1/13–12/31/16). Probability of malignancy was estimated based on imaging characteristics (simple cyst, heterogeneous, or solid), maximal diameter, and tumor markers (α-fetoprotein, β-human chorionic gonadotropin).

Results

Among 188 children with ovarian masses, 11% had malignancies. For simple cysts, there were no malignancies (0/24, 95% CI = 0–17%). Among solid lesions, 44% (15/34, 95% CI = 28–62%) were malignant. Among marker-elevated heterogeneous masses, 40% (2/5, 95% CI = 12–77%) were malignant. Conversely, small (≤ 10 cm) and large (> 10 cm) marker-negative heterogeneous lesions had malignancy proportions of 0% (0/39, 95% CI = 0–11%) and 5% (2/40, 95% CI = 1–18%), respectively.

Conclusions

Given the malignancy estimates identified from these multi-institutional data, we recommend an attempt at ovarian-sparing resection for simple cysts or tumor marker-negative heterogeneous lesions ≤ 10 cm. Oophorectomy is recommended for solid masses or heterogeneous lesions with elevated markers. Finally, large (> 10 cm) heterogeneous masses with non-elevated markers warrant a careful discussion of ovarian-sparing techniques. Complete surgical staging is mandatory regardless of operative procedure.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^2e76e985]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Methods for the evidence review and educational material development closely followed the process for the early-onset breast cancer and uterine cancer projects. The ACOG convened an expert panel to identify the best evidence and practices from the literature and existing relevant guidelines. The panel was recruited from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology to review and summarize the evidence. The panel was supplemented by representatives from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. Panel members were selected on the basis of expertise in evidence review and synthesis. The panel developed research questions and used the PICO criteria (P = patient, problem, or population; I = intervention; C = comparison, control, or comparator; O = outcome[s]) to frame the literature review (Box 1).

### Assessing the risk of ovarian malignancy in asymptomatic women with abnormal CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound scans in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian screening trial [^7762ebb2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the risk of ovarian malignancy among asymptomatic women with abnormal transvaginal ultrasound scans or CA 125 and to provide guidance to physicians managing these women.

Methods

A cohort of women from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with abnormal ovarian results at the initial (T0) and subsequent (T1+) screens were analyzed to estimate which findings were associated with high risk of ovarian cancer. Cancer risks more than 10% were designated as high and risks of 3% or less were designated as low.

Results

For the T0 screen, two high-risk categories were identified: CA 125 of 70 or more with negative transvaginal ultrasound scan (positive predictive value [PPV] 15.9%, CI 14.7–17.7%); and positive for both CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound scan (PPV 25.0%, CI 23.3–27.3%). For T1+ screens, three high-risk categories were identified: negative transvaginal ultrasound scan with change in CA 125 of 45 or more (PPV 29.0%, CI 28.3–30.3%); increase in size of cyst 6 cm or more with negative CA 125 (PPV 13.3%, CI 10.5–18.0%); and positive for both tests (PPV 42.9%, CI 40.0–46.0%). High-risk criteria for T0 provide a sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 96.2%, PPV of 19.7%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.3%. T1+ criteria yielded a sensitivity of 85.3%, specificity of 95.6%, PPV of 29.6%, and NPV of 99.7%.

Conclusions

High-risk categories for predicting risk of cancer in women with abnormal CA 125, transvaginal ultrasound scan, or both at initial and subsequent screens have been identified. The large number of women in this study, the 4-year complete follow-up, and small number of invasive cancers in the low-risk categories provide guidance for clinical decisions regarding need for surgery in these women.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to refer patients with an adnexal mass meeting ≥ 1 of the following criteria to a gynecologic oncologist:

- postmenopausal with elevated levels of serum CA-125, ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy, ascites, a nodular or fixed pelvic mass, or evidence of abdominal or distant metastasis

- premenopausal with very elevated levels of serum CA-125 level, ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy, ascites, a nodular or fixed pelvic mass, or evidence of abdominal or distant metastasis

- premenopausal or postmenopausal with an elevated score on a formal risk assessment test, such as the MIA, the RMI, the ROMA, or one of the ultrasound-based scoring systems from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis group.

### Diagnostic performance of the ovarian-adnexal reporting and data system (O-RADS) ultrasound risk score in women in the United States [^564385d2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In the O-RADS US 3 category, the overall frequency of malignant neoplasm was 5 of 112 lesions (4.5%). The subcategory of unilocular cysts with irregular walls had the highest frequency of malignant neoplasm at 3 of 9 lesions (33%); however, the overall number of such lesions was low in our cohort. The most frequently encountered lesion with an O-RADS US 3 was a multilocular cyst without a solid component and smooth inner wall, and lesions in this subcategory were overwhelmingly benign with 1 of 78 lesions (1.3%) risk of malignant neoplasm.

In the O-RADS US 4 category, the overall frequency of malignant neoplasm was 18 of 155 (11.6%). Among lesions with an O-RADS US 4, unilocularcyst with solid component, 0 to 3 papillary projections, and any color score (CS) were most likely to be malignant (10 of 58 [17.2%]), followed by multilocular cyst with solid components, CS 1 to 2 (8 of 50 [16.0%]). In this cohort, multilocular cysts larger than 10 cm that were (1) any size with smooth inner wall and a CS of 4 (0 of 12 lesions) or (2) any size with irregular walls or septaes and any CS were never found to be malignant (0 of 33 lesions).

In the O-RADS 5 category, the overall frequency of malignant neoplasm was 59 of 90 (65.6%). Solid lesions with irregular outer contour were found to have the highest frequency of cancer at 27 of 33 (81.9%), followed by solid lesions with smooth outer contour at 7 of 9 (77.8%). The lowest rate of cancer (9 of 19 [47.4%]) was in the multilocular cyst with a solid component subcategory.

### Risk of malignant ovarian cancer based on ultrasonography findings in a large unselected population [^5a34edb2]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The risk of malignant ovarian cancer associated with simple cysts is unknown.

Objective

To quantify the risk of ovarian cancer based on ultrasonographic characteristics of ovarian masses, including simple cysts, in a large unselected population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a nested case-control study of patients enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Washington, a large integrated health care system in Washington State. Participants were 72 093 women who underwent pelvic ultrasonography between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2008. Analysis was completed in April 2017.

Exposures

Ultrasonographic characteristics of ovarian masses measured in 1043 women, and also, using weights derived from the sampling strategy, estimated frequencies for the entire cohort.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Malignant ovarian cancer, identified through December 31, 2011, by cancer registry linkage.

Results

Among 210 women who were diagnosed as having ovarian cancer, 49 were younger than 50 years, and 161 were 50 years or older. Ultrasonography findings were predictive of cancer (C statistic, 0.89). The risk of cancer was significantly elevated in women with complex cysts or solid masses, with likelihood ratios relative to women with normal ovaries ranging from 8 to 74 and the 3-year risk of cancer ranging from 9 to 430 cases per 1000 women based on patient age and ultrasonography findings. In contrast, the 23.8% of women younger than 50 years and the 13.4% of women 50 years or older with simple cysts were not at a significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer compared with women with normal ovaries. Likelihood ratios associated with the detection of a simple cyst were 0.00 in women younger than 50 years (no cancers were identified) and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.01–0.48) in women 50 years or older, and the absolute 3-year risk of cancer ranged from 0 to 0.5 cases per 1000 women.

Conclusions and Relevance

According to this study, the ultrasonographic appearance of ovarian masses is strongly associated with a woman's risk of ovarian cancer. Simple cysts are not associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, whereas complex cysts or solid masses are associated with a significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^7a1c1755]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Endometriomas affect up to 6% of patients with ovaries and carry risks of chronic pain, infertility, pregnancy complications, and potential for malignant transformation. Two pathways of endometrioma formation have been proposed, endometriotic invasion or metaplasia of preexisting functional ovarian cysts and bleeding of ovarian endometriotic implants directly into the ovarian cortex, that may account for the phenotypic variability observed among endometriomas. Future research evaluating the recapitulation of these mechanisms at a molecular level is anticipated to shed light on the genesis of endometriomas, with likely implications for the prevention of endometrioma formation. Whether endometriomas of different phenotypes have identifiably disparate effects on fertility or risk of malignancy is an important clinical question that has not been fully explored.

Medical management may shrink endometrioma size but rarely leads to cyst resolution and forgoes the opportunity for pathologic diagnosis; therefore, surgical management is often indicated for purposes of diagnosis and symptom management. Benefits of surgery for fertility optimization and cancer risk reduction have been suggested by retrospective studies. The precise role of surgery for these goals is yet to be defined, particularly with regard to a stratification of benefit by cyst phenotype or size. Moving forward, continued attention to cyst phenotype or size in the design of studies on the management and implications of endometriomas will continue to better inform ability to make evidence-based clinical recommendations tailored to patients' unique clinical presentations.

### Risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 centimeters in diameter [^c2174397]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the natural history and to estimate the risk of malignancy of unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter followed conservatively by transvaginal ultrasound.

Methods

From 1987 to 2002, 15,106 asymptomatic women at least 50 years old entered the University of Kentucky's Ovarian Cancer Screening Program and underwent initial transvaginal ultrasonography. If the screen revealed nothing abnormal, women were asked to repeat transvaginal ultrasonography yearly. If the screen revealed abnormalities, transvaginal ultrasonography was repeated in 4 to 6 weeks, along with Doppler flow ultrasonography and CA 125 testing.

Results

Of the 15,106 women at least 50 years old, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with 3259 unilocular ovarian cysts. A total of 2261 (69.4%) of these cysts resolved spontaneously, 537 (16.5%) developed a septum, 189 (5.8%) developed a solid area, and 220 (6.8%) persisted as a unilocular lesion. During this time, 27 women received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and ten had been previously diagnosed with simple ovarian cysts. All ten of these women, however, developed another morphologic abnormality, experienced resolution of the cyst before developing cancer, or developed cancer in the contralateral ovary. No woman with an isolated unilocular cystic ovarian tumor has developed ovarian cancer in this population.

Conclusion

The risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter in women 50 years old or older is extremely low. The majority will resolve spontaneously and can be followed conservatively with serial transvaginal ultrasonography.

### External validation of the ovarian-adnexal reporting and data system (O-RADS) lexicon and the international ovarian tumor analysis 2-step strategy to stratify ovarian tumors into O-RADS risk groups [^1081d1dc]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Two-Step Strategy

The modified IOTA BDs almost always indicate a benign tumor according to studies of patients who underwent surgery. This corresponds to O-RADS 2 (risk of malignancy < 1%). The BDs are BD1 (unilocular cyst, ground-glass echogenicity, largest diameter < 10 cm, and premenopausal patient), BD2 (unilocular cyst, mixed echogenicity, acoustic shadows, largest diameter < 10 cm, and premenopausal patient), BD3 (unilocular cyst, anechoic cyst fluid, smooth internal walls, and largest diameter < 10 cm), and BD4 (remaining unilocular cysts with smooth internal walls and largest diameter < 10 cm).

If the BDs do not apply, ADNEX is used, which calculates the risk of 5 tumor types: benign, borderline, stage I invasive cancer, stage II to IV invasive cancer, and secondary metastasis. The risk of malignancy is obtained by adding the risks of the 4 malignant tumor types. In this study, we used ADNEX without serum CA-125 because CA-125 results are usually not known when a patient presents with an adnexal mass. The risks of malignancy generated by ADNEX were divided into 4 categories corresponding to the malignancy probabilities of O-RADS 2 to 5.

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^1f151e2c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Adnexal masses — risk factors for malignancy — emphasize that age is the most important independent risk factor for ovarian cancer in the general population, with incidence increasing sharply after menopause; from 2009 to 2013 the median age at ovarian cancer diagnosis was 63 years and 69.4% of patients were 55 years or older; although most adnexal masses in postmenopausal women are benign neoplasms, the risk of malignancy is much greater than in premenopausal women; the most important personal risk factor is a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer; for a 35-year-old woman with one affected family member the lifetime probability of ovarian cancer increases from 1.6% to 5%; for a woman with a BRCA1 mutation the lifetime risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer is approximately 41–46% by age 70 years.

### Risk analysis of torsion and malignancy for adnexal masses during pregnancy [^9515819b]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To find the risk factors of torsion and malignancy for adnexal tumors during pregnancy.

Design

Retrospective, historical cohort study.

Setting

University hospital.

Patient(S)

Patients from 1990 to 2004 with adnexal tumors ≥ 4 cm during pregnancy.

Intervention(S)

Surgery undertaken antepartum, concurrently with cesarean delivery, or postpartum.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Tumor size, progression, pathology, incidence of malignancy, and torsion.

Result(S)

Almost all 213 managements analyzed had good surgical and obstetric outcomes. In 174 patients who were followed through pregnancy with known tumor existence, 14.84% ± 3.05% encountered tumor torsion. Adnexal masses with sizes between 6 and 8 cm had a significantly higher risk of torsion compared with other sizes (22.41% vs. 9.48%; odds ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.1, 6.6]). Sixty percent of the torsion happened between the 10th and 17th weeks of gestation, and only 5.9% happened after 20 weeks. The incidence of malignancy was 3.4%, while that of ovarian cancer was 2.3%. Tumor diameters ≥ 10 cm at initial diagnosis had a higher risk of malignancy versus smaller sizes (8.77% vs. 0.85%; odds ratio 11.2, 95% CI, [1.3, 97.9]), and tumor growth rates ≥ 3.5 cm/week also had a significantly higher risk of malignancy versus lower rates (8.33% vs. 0.88%; odds ratio 10.2, 95% CI, [1.0, 101.2]).

Conclusion(S)

Adnexal tumors bearing higher risks for torsion and malignancy should be strongly considered for an aggressive strategy of management during pregnancy.

### Diagnostic performance of the ovarian-adnexal reporting and data system (O-RADS) ultrasound risk score in women in the United States [^34bb79bb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

When an adnexal lesion is discovered on pelvic ultrasonography, the goal of imaging is to assess if the lesion is benign or potentially malignant. Most adnexal lesions found on ultrasonography imaging are benign and can be classified as simple cysts, hemorrhagic cysts, endometriomas, and dermoids. The risk of malignancy in these lesions is extremely low. Lesions not meeting the criteria for 1 of these 4 classic benign lesions carry an increased risk of cancer. Multiple ultrasonography-based systems have been developed that use imaging features, such as solid tissue and vascularity, to risk stratify these lesions. Most recently, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data Systems (O-RADS) Committee was formed under the American College of Radiology (ACR), and this international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the O-RADS ultrasound (US) Risk Stratification and Management System. This system is based on the published lexicon of the O-RADS US working group and from data collected in the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) study phase 1 to phase 3 prospective studies and other studies differentiating benign from potentially malignant lesions. The estimates for malignant neoplasm in the O-RADS US Risk Score table are based on the calculated frequency of malignant neoplasm from women undergoing surgery for known adnexal lesions in the IOTA study (Figure 1). The ACR O-RADS US committee acknowledges the limitations of applying a risk score stratification system founded on a database that includes only surgically resected lesions, which may overestimate the risk of malignant neoplasm in other populations.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^3b6b0118]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Appendix 6, summarizes studies and society guidelines for patients with an incidental finding of an ovarian cyst on imaging using various methods, including transvaginal ultrasonography, biomarkers, biomarker assays, and multimodal risk assessment, to exclude ovarian cancer. The studies had a number of limitations, including being conducted in patients who underwent surgery, limiting understanding of how the strategies perform in expectantly managed patients. The study populations also frequently had a higher ovarian cancer incidence than expected, which may overestimate diagnostic accuracy.CA 125 is the most frequently measured serum marker for the evaluation and early diagnosis of ovarian cancer despite variation in its measured sensitivity (61–90%) and specificity (71–93%). Sensitivity and specificity are poorer in premenopausal patients than postmenopausal patients, likely because benign conditions that can cause CA 125 elevation occur more frequently in premenopausal patients than postmenopausal patients and the ovarian cancer incidence is lower in premenopausal patients than in postmenopausal patients. The International Ovarian Tumour Analysis Phase 5 study was a prospective, multicenter cohort study with patients selected for surgery or conservative management on the basis of morphology and symptoms. In this study, 1,919 patients with a new diagnosis of a mass that was assessed as benign on ultrasonography had outcomes examined at 24 months after enrollment. Of these, 20.2% had spontaneous resolution of their mass during follow-up, and 16.1% had surgical intervention. The risk of a missed diagnosis at surgery was less than 0.5% when defined as a final diagnosis of invasive malignancy, borderline tumor, torsion, or cyst rupture. We found no prospective studies to guide the frequency or duration of ultrasound surveillance.

O-RADS US Category and Lesion Characteristics

Of the 1014 lesions, 657 (64.8%) were classified as O-RADS US 2 (Table 1). O-RADS US 3, 4, and 5 included 112 (11.0%), 155 (15.3%), and 90 (8.9%) of the lesions, respectively (eFigure in the Supplement). Frequency of lesion type distribution in each of the subcategories of O-RADS risk stratification scores 2 to 5 are presented in Table 2.

Frequency of Malignant Neoplasm in O-RADS US Risk Score 2, 3, 4, and 5 Category and Subcategories

Abbreviations: CS, color score; O-RADS, Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System; US, ultrasound.

Frequency of Malignant Neoplasm per O-RADS US Category and Subcategories

The overall frequency of malignant neoplasm in the O-RADS US 2 category was 3 of 657 (0.5%). Three adnexal lesions with an O-RADS US 2 were ultimately diagnosed as malignant; 2 were initially characterized as simple cysts, and 1 as endometrioma. One of the simple cysts was in a premenopausal woman, measuring 4.5 cm on initial examination, that enlarged on follow-up, and was a serous borderline tumor on pathology. The second was a 3.6 cm simple cyst in a postmenopausal woman, that enlarged and developed a small mural nodule on follow-up and was an endometrioid cancer on pathology. Third lesion was a 3.7 cm endometrioma in a premenopausal woman, which enlarged on follow-up and was an endometrioid cancer on pathology.

### Risk of malignancy in sonographically confirmed septated cystic ovarian tumors [^9cb39fe7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk of malignancy in septated cystic ovarian tumors.

Materials

1319 (4.4%) of 29,829 women were identified by transvaginal sonography (TVS) as having a complex cystic ovarian tumor with septations without solid areas or papillary projections and were placed on long-term ultrasound surveillance for ovarian malignancy.

Results

These 1319 patients had a total of 2870 septated cystic ovarian tumors. 2288 tumors (79.7%) had a septal width < 2 mm and 582 (20.3%) had a septal width ≥ 2 mm. 2286 tumors (79.6%) were < 5 cm in diameter and 584 (20.4%) were ≥ 5 cm in diameter. 1114 septated cystic tumors (38.8%) resolved spontaneously (mean duration to resolution-12 months) and 1756 (61.2%) tumors persisted. 128 patients underwent surgical tumor removal within 3 months of ultrasound. Most common histopathology was: serous cystadenoma (75), mucinous cystadenoma (13), and endometrioma (10). One patient had an ovarian tumor of borderline malignancy (Stage IB). There were no cases of ovarian cancer. Patients were followed from 4 to 252 months (mean-77 months). One patient developed papillary morphology in the contralateral ovary 3.2 years after detection of a septated ovarian cyst and had epithelial ovarian cancer in that ovary and in the omentum (Stage IIIC disease). The remaining patients are all free of ovarian neoplasia after a total of 7642 follow-up years.

Conclusions

Septated cystic ovarian tumors without solid areas or papillary projections have a low risk of malignancy and can be followed sonographically without surgery.

### Factors associated with torsion in pediatric patients with ovarian masses [^91d5fcc7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of ovarian torsion has evolved toward ovarian preservation regardless of ovarian appearance during surgery. However, patients with torsion and an ovarian neoplasm undergo a disproportionately high rate of oophorectomy. Our objectives were to identify factors associated with ovarian torsion among females with an ovarian mass and to determine if torsion is associated with malignancy.

Methods

A retrospective review of females aged 2–21 y who underwent an operation for an ovarian cyst or neoplasm between 2010 and 2016 at 10 children's hospitals was performed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with torsion. Imaging data were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in identifying ovarian torsion.

Results

Of 814 girls with an ovarian neoplasm, 180 (22%) had torsion. In risk-adjusted analyses, patients with a younger age, mass size > 5 cm, abdominal pain, and vomiting had an increased likelihood of torsion (P < 0.01 for all). Patients with a mass > 5 cm had two times the odds of torsion (odds ratio: 2.1; confidence interval: 1.2, 3.6). Imaging was not reliable at identifying torsion (sensitivity 34%, positive predictive value 49%) or excluding torsion (specificity 72%, negative predictive value 87%). The rates of malignancy were lower in those with an ovarian mass and torsion than those without torsion (10% versus 17%, P = 0.01). Among the 180 girls with torsion and a mass, 48% underwent oophorectomy of which 14% (n = 12) had a malignancy.

Conclusions

In females with an ovarian neoplasm, torsion is not associated with an increased risk of malignancy and ovarian preservation should be considered.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^3bc81f8f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ovarian endometriomas affect many patients with endometriosis and have significant effects on quality of life, fertility, and risk of malignancy. Endometriomas range from small (1–3 cm), densely fibrotic cysts to large (20 cm or greater) cysts with varying degrees of fibrosis. Endometriomas are hypothesized to form from endometriotic invasion or metaplasia of functional cysts or alternatively from ovarian surface endometriosis that bleeds into the ovarian cortex. Different mechanisms of endometrioma formation may help explain the phenotypic variability observed among endometriomas. Laparoscopic surgery is the preferred first-line modality of diagnosis and treatment of endometriomas. Ovarian cystectomy is preferred over cyst ablation or sclerotherapy for enabling pathologic diagnosis, improving symptoms, preventing recurrence, and optimizing fertility outcomes. Cystectomy for small, densely adherent endometriomas is made challenging by dense fibrosis of the cyst capsule obliterating the plane with normal ovarian cortex, whereas cystectomy for large endometriomas can carry unique challenges as a result of adhesions between the cyst and pelvic structures. Preoperative and postoperative hormonal suppression can improve operative outcomes and decrease the risk of endometrioma recurrence. Whether the optimal management, fertility consequences, and malignant potential of endometriomas vary on the basis of size and phenotype remains to be fully explored.

### Are borderline tumors of the ovary safely treated by laparoscopy? [^3c61710e]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the risk of the laparoscopic approach to patients with borderline ovarian tumors compared to the laparotomic management.

Methods

We treated or followed in our institution 479 women with borderline ovarian tumor. Sixty-two patients had fertility-sparing surgery followed by restaging or follow-up intervention: 30 operated by laparoscopy, 32 by laparotomy. Restaging surgery was performed in five cases and second-look surgery in 57.

Results

The diameter of the cyst is significantly lower in patients treated by laparoscopy, especially in women who underwent cystectomy (4.7 cm) compared to oophorectomy (10 cm, P = 0.008). Rupture of the cyst and stage IC were more frequent in the laparoscopic group. After a median follow-up of 61 months for the laparoscopic group and 77 months for the laparotomic group, we observed 11 patients (37%) with persistent disease after primary laparoscopy (adnexa, five cases; peritoneal implants, three cases; both patterns, three cases). After primary laparotomy, no patients showed early persistence of tumor, and ovarian relapses were diagnosed in seven women (22%) 33–138 months after laparotomy. The univariate analysis for the risk of neoplastic persistence after primary laparoscopy shows that patients with cysts greater than 5 cm have a higher risk (odds ratio 9.7, P = 0.02) compared to smaller cysts. No other factors proved significant, but the odds ratios for patients with serous tumor (5.8), stage IC (2.0), and those undergoing cystectomy (1.9) suggest a relationship to the probability of persistence.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic treatment in borderline ovarian tumors should be reserved to masses not greater than 5 cm. When conservative therapy is desired, the entire affected ovary should be removed. If the neoplasia is bilateral, cystectomy could be allowed in women who wish to preserve fertility, although they are at high risk of relapse.

### Ultrasound and assessment of ovarian cancer risk [^6b8a7fe7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the ultrasound characteristics of ovarian and adnexal masses and to discuss the prediction of the likelihood of ovarian cancer based on these characteristics and clinical parameters.

Conclusion

Ultrasound characteristics can be used to diagnose the classic-appearing nonneoplastic entities, benign neoplasms and malignancies. In cases in which the appearance of an ovarian mass is not classic, assignment of relative risk of malignancy using a multiparametric model is appropriate and beneficial for patient management.

### Ovarian malignancy in breast cancer patients with an adnexal mass [^b87720e4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to estimate ovarian malignancy rate in breast cancer patients with an adnexal mass and to identify variables predictive of malignancy.

Methods

This was a review from 1990–2002 including women with breast cancer diagnosed with an adnexal mass who subsequently underwent oophorectomy. Ovarian pathology was classified as benign, primary malignancy, or metastatic breast cancer. Women with preoperative evidence of malignancy were excluded.

Results

Of 129 cases reviewed, benign ovarian cysts were found in 113 cases (88%) and malignant ovarian neoplasms were found in 16 cases (12%). Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of malignancy. Complex masses were 29 times more likely to be malignant (P < .001). Women with estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer had an increased risk for malignant adnexal masses (44%; OR 12.4, 95% confidence interval 2.4–65.1; P = 0.003). Patients with an elevated CA 125 had a 6.3-fold increased risk of malignancy, P = 0.02. Adnexal mass size greater than 5 cm also increased the risk of malignancy (18.8%; OR 4.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2–17.3; P = 0.02). Malignant adnexal masses had a greater likelihood of being primary ovarian cancer than metastatic breast cancer by 7:1.

Conclusion

An isolated adnexal mass in the breast cancer patient is most commonly a benign ovarian cyst. Adnexal masses associated with an increased CA 125, complex architecture by ultrasonography, or size greater than 5 cm are significant predictors of malignancy and are indications for referral to a gynecologic oncologist.

### Risk factors for ovarian carcinoma [^8667c0cd]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the leading gynecologic killer of women in the United States. At diagnosis, most women present with advanced-stage disease. There are currently no effective screening strategies for average-risk women, thus understanding disease development and progression is important for developing risk-reduction strategies and identifying high-risk populations who can benefit from preventive surgery. Cancer epidemiology has greatly contributed to the understanding of this complex, heterogeneous disease by identifying various factors that may modify disease development. This article comprehensively reviews the current evidence regarding risk factors using the newest epidemiologic research for further insight into this lethal disease.

### Ovarian cancer: a review… [^de7da045]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Observations Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial malignancies, of which 70% to 80% are high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Less common epithelial subtypes include endometrioid, clear cell, low-grade serous, mucinous, and carcinosarcoma. The median age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer is 63 years. Risk factors include older age, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and nulliparity. Hereditary factors are associated with 25% of cases, predominantly linked to BRCA1/2 gene variants. At diagnosis, approximately 95% of patients experience nonspecific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and urinary urgency and frequency, and about 80% have advanced-stage disease, including extrapelvic disease, ascites, and abdominal masses.

Diagnostic and staging evaluation includes pelvic ultrasound; computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and serum tumor markers such as carbohydrate antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19–9, and carcinoembryonic antigen. First-line treatment for early-stage ovarian cancer, defined as limited to the ovary or fallopian tube or confined to the pelvis, is surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. With treatment, early-stage ovarian cancer has a 5-year overall survival of 70% to 95%. Advanced-stage ovarian cancer may be treated with primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.

Most patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer receive maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and/or poly–adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors. With treatment, the 5-year overall survival rate for advanced-stage ovarian cancer is 10% to 40%. However, individuals with BRCA-related gene variants have a 5-year overall survival rate of approximately 70% with PARP inhibitor treatment. Despite an initial remission rate of 80%, approximately 75% of patients with advanced-stage disease have ovarian cancer relapse within 2 years.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Pelvic ultrasonography imaging examinations were reviewed by radiologists and blinded to outcome. Patients with adnexal lesions were recorded. The following findings were excluded: follicles (defined as simple cysts < 3 cm in premenopausal women) and corpus luteal cysts and cystic lesions smaller than 1 cm (in postmenopausal women). Classic corpus luteal cysts and follicles were defined per the O-RADS US criteria.

Each investigator reviewed the EMR for the patients at their site and recorded age, menopausal status, and final pathologic diagnosis. For lesions without pathologic diagnosis, either imaging or clinical follow up was used to determine eligibility. Adequate follow-up was defined as pathologic diagnosis, resolution or decrease in size by 10% on follow up imaging, classic lesion on computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (eg, fat seen on CT or MRI to confirm mature cystic teratomas), stability on imaging for greater than 2 years or documented normal pelvic examination greater than 2 years after initial pelvic ultrasonography.

### Evaluating the risk of ovarian cancer before surgery using the ADNEX model to differentiate between benign, borderline, early and advanced stage invasive, and secondary metastatic tumours: prospective multicentre diagnostic study [^2e465d18]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To develop a risk prediction model to preoperatively discriminate between benign, borderline, stage I invasive, stage II-IV invasive, and secondary metastatic ovarian tumours.

Design

Observational diagnostic study using prospectively collected clinical and ultrasound data.

Setting

24 ultrasound centres in 10 countries.

Participants

Women with an ovarian (including para-ovarian and tubal) mass and who underwent a standardised ultrasound examination before surgery. The model was developed on 3506 patients recruited between 1999 and 2007, temporally validated on 2403 patients recruited between 2009 and 2012, and then updated on all 5909 patients.

Main Outcome Measures

Histological classification and surgical staging of the mass.

Results

The Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model contains three clinical and six ultrasound predictors: age, serum CA-125 level, type of centre (oncology centres v other hospitals), maximum diameter of lesion, proportion of solid tissue, more than 10 cyst locules, number of papillary projections, acoustic shadows, and ascites. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the classic discrimination between benign and malignant tumours was 0.94 (0.93 to 0.95) on temporal validation. The AUC was 0.85 for benign versus borderline, 0.92 for benign versus stage I cancer, 0.99 for benign versus stage II-IV cancer, and 0.95 for benign versus secondary metastatic. AUCs between malignant subtypes varied between 0.71 and 0.95, with an AUC of 0.75 for borderline versus stage I cancer and 0.82 for stage II-IV versus secondary metastatic. Calibration curves showed that the estimated risks were accurate.

Conclusions

The ADNEX model discriminates well between benign and malignant tumours and offers fair to excellent discrimination between four types of ovarian malignancy. The use of ADNEX has the potential to improve triage and management decisions and so reduce morbidity and mortality associated with adnexal pathology.

### Risk-prediction models in postmenopausal patients with symptoms of suspected ovarian cancer in the UK (ROCkeTS): a multicentre, prospective diagnostic accuracy study [^2c87a8ba]. The Lancet: Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Multiple risk-prediction models are used in clinical practice to triage patients as being at low risk or high risk of ovarian cancer. In the ROCkeTS study, we aimed to identify the best diagnostic test for ovarian cancer in symptomatic patients, through head-to-head comparisons of risk-prediction models, in a real-world setting. Here, we report the results for the postmenopausal cohort.

Methods

In this multicentre, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we recruited newly presenting female patients aged 16–90 years with non-specific symptoms and raised CA125 or abnormal ultrasound results (or both) who had been referred via rapid access, elective clinics, or emergency presentations from 23 hospitals in the UK. Patients with normal CA125 and simple ovarian cysts of smaller than 5 cm in diameter, active non-ovarian malignancy, or previous ovarian malignancy, or those who were pregnant or declined a transvaginal scan, were ineligible. In this analysis, only postmenopausal participants were included. Participants completed a symptom questionnaire, gave a blood sample, and had transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds performed by International Ovarian Tumour Analysis consortium (IOTA)-certified sonographers. Index tests were Risk of Malignancy 1 (RMI1) at a threshold of 200, Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) at multiple thresholds, IOTA Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) at thresholds of 3% and 10%, IOTA SRRisk model at thresholds of 3% and 10%, IOTA Simple Rules (malignant vs benign, or inconclusive), and CA125 at 35 IU/mL. In a post-hoc analysis, the Ovarian Adnexal and Reporting Data System (ORADS) at 10% was derived from IOTA ultrasound variables using established methods since ORADS was described after completion of recruitment. Index tests were conducted by study staff masked to the results of the reference standard. The comparator was RMI1 at the 250 threshold (the current UK National Health Service standard of care). The reference standard was surgical or biopsy tissue histology or cytology within 3 months, or a self-reported diagnosis of ovarian cancer at 12 month follow-up. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy at predicting primary invasive ovarian cancer versus benign or normal histology, assessed by analysing the sensitivity, specificity, C-index, area under receiver operating characteristic curve, positive and negative predictive values, and calibration plots in participants with conclusive reference standard results and available index test data. This study is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN17160843).

Findings

Between July 13, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 1242 postmenopausal patients were recruited, of whom 215 (17%) had primary ovarian cancer. 166 participants had missing, inconclusive, or other reference standard results; therefore, data from a maximum of 1076 participants were used to assess the index tests for the primary outcome. Compared with RMI1 at 250 (sensitivity 82·9% [95% CI 76·7 to 88·0], specificity 87·4% [84·9 to 89·6]), IOTA ADNEX at 10% was more sensitive (difference of -13·9% [-20·2 to -7·6], p < 0·0001) but less specific (difference of 28·5% [24·7 to 32·3], p < 0·0001). ROMA at 29·9 had similar sensitivity (difference of -3·6% [-9·1 to 1·9], p = 0·24) but lower specificity (difference of 5·2% [2·5 to 8·0], p = 0·0001). RMI1 at 200 had similar sensitivity (difference of -2·1% [-4·7 to 0·5], p = 0·13) but lower specificity (difference of 3·0% [1·7 to 4·3], p < 0·0001). IOTA SRRisk model at 10% had similar sensitivity (difference of -4·3% [-11·0 to -2·3], p = 0·23) but lower specificity (difference of 16·2% [12·6 to 19·8], p < 0·0001). IOTA Simple Rules had similar sensitivity (difference of -1·6% [-9·3 to 6·2], p = 0·82) and specificity (difference of -2·2% [-5·1 to 0·6], p = 0·14). CA125 at 35 IU/mL had similar sensitivity (difference of -2·1% [-6·6 to 2·3], p = 0·42) but higher specificity (difference of 6·7% [4·3 to 9·1], p < 0·0001). In a post-hoc analysis, when compared with RMI1 at 250, ORADS achieved similar sensitivity (difference of -2·1%, 95% CI -8·6 to 4·3, p = 0·60) and lower specificity (difference of 10·2%, 95% CI 6·8 to 13·6, p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

In view of its higher sensitivity than RMI1 at 250, despite some loss in specificity, we recommend that IOTA ADNEX at 10% should be considered as the new standard-of-care diagnostic in ovarian cancer for postmenopausal patients.

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^cdcd300b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Practice Bulletin No. 174 — Level B recommendations on cyst characterization and surgical approach indicate that the combination of an elevated CA 125 level and a pelvic mass in a postmenopausal woman is highly suspicious for malignancy, and patients with these findings should be referred to or treated in consultation with a gynecologic oncologist. Simple cysts up to 10 cm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasonography performed by experienced ultrasonographers are likely benign and may be safely monitored using repeat imaging without surgical intervention, even in postmenopausal patients. Minimally invasive procedures are the preferred route of surgery for presumed benign adnexal masses, and regardless of the approach employed, fertility preservation should be a priority when managing masses in adolescents and premenopausal women who have not completed childbearing.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^cb33d89f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT INDICATIONS

Goals of treatment for endometrioma include relieving symptoms, ruling out malignancy, treating or preventing ovarian torsion, improving fertility outcomes, preserving ovarian hormonal function, and minimizing recurrence. Because ovarian endometriomas are rarely isolated and more commonly occur concurrently with nonovarian endometriosis, surgical excision of both ovarian and nonovarian lesions is often indicated. In some circumstances, surveillance may be appropriate for asymptomatic patients who are evaluated to be at low risk for torsion or malignancy on the basis of mass size (generally less than 5 cm) and appearance and patient characteristics, including age and family history.

### Evaluation and management of ultrasonographically detected ovarian tumors in asymptomatic women [^f4ceecb3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Data from screening trials indicate that a significant percent of asymptomatic women older than 50 years of age will develop ovarian abnormalities that are detectable by ultrasonography. Most of these abnormalities are benign, and many will resolve spontaneously. However, the risk of ovarian cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, is of concern. The goal is to use a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that will reliably detect ovarian cancer at the earliest possible stage while limiting the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease. The combination of morphology indexing and serum biomarker analysis can accurately predict the risk of malignancy in most ovarian tumors. Ovarian tumors with cystic or septate morphology are at minimal risk of malignancy and can be followed with serial ultrasonography evaluations, thereby avoiding the morbidity and cost of surgery. Complex or solid ovarian tumors with a high morphology index score, or those with increasing biomarker production, are at a high risk of malignancy, and patients with these tumors should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation and treatment.

### Evaluating the risk of ovarian cancer before surgery using the ADNEX model to differentiate between benign, borderline, early and advanced stage invasive, and secondary metastatic tumours: prospective multicentre diagnostic study [^a903f32d]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Design and setting

We carried out an international multicentre prospective cohort study of women with at least one adnexal mass that required surgery, as judged by a clinician. The IOTA study group collected data between 1999 and 2012. IOTA was established to develop and validate diagnostic models for adnexal masses based on large multicentre datasets using a standardised ultrasound examination protocol, terms, and definitions. Patients were recruited from 24 centres in 10 countries. Twelve centres were labelled oncology centres, that is, tertiary referral centres with a specific gynaecology oncology unit. The remaining centres included general hospitals and gynaecology ultrasound units not linked to an oncology centre. Data collection was carried out in phases: phase 1 between 1999 and 2002, phase 1b between 2002 and 2005, phase 2 between 2005 and 2007, and phase 3 between 2009 and 2012.

Patients

Patients referred to one of the participating centres for an ultrasound examination because of a known or suspected adnexal mass were eligible for inclusion. We included consecutive patients with at least one adnexal mass judged not to be a physiological cyst, who were examined with transvaginal ultrasound by a principal investigator and later selected for surgical intervention. The decision to operate was made by the managing clinician on the basis of the full clinical picture, including the ultrasound report, the latter being based on the ultrasound examiner's subjective assessment of the ultrasound image. Following the requirements of the local ethics committees, we obtained oral or written informed consent from the women before their ultrasound scan and surgery. Exclusion criteria were refusal for transvaginal ultrasonography, pregnancy at the time of presentation, and surgical removal of the mass more than 120 days after the ultrasound examination. If more than one mass was detected, we used the mass with the most complex morphology on the ultrasound scan. When we observed masses with similar morphology, we used the largest or the one most easily accessible by ultrasound.

### Ovarian cancer: a review [^cfac215f]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ovarian cancer:

- **Definition**: OC is a gynecologic malignancy that originates in the ovaries.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of OC involves the unchecked growth of abnormal cells in the ovaries that can form tumors. Ovarian tumors may also contain distinct populations of cells, termed cancer stem cells, that are responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance, and growth.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of OC is estimated at 2 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for OC include advancing age; a family history of ovarian, breast, or CRC; certain genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2; and factors that affect ovulation, such as early menstruation, late menopause, and nulliparity.
- **Disease course**: OC is associated with non-specific symptoms which may include abdominal bloating, back and pelvic pain, increased abdominal girth, early satiety, constipation, fatigue, and urinary symptoms such as urgency or frequency.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for OC is generally poor, primarily due to late diagnosis and advanced stage at presentation.

General evaluation of adnexal masses — individual patient characteristics, physical examination findings, imaging results, and serum marker levels help separate masses into categories of probably benign, uncertain, and likely malignant to guide management. In risk assessment, the risk of ovarian cancer through age 70 years for women with Lynch syndrome is estimated to be 5–10%, and additional factors that increase ovarian cancer risk include nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause, white race, primary infertility, and endometriosis.

### Ultrasonographic clues to malignancy: a decade of adnexal mass evaluation in pregnant women [^b283fef2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The detection of adnexal masses during pregnancy has become increasingly common due to the widespread use of routine prenatal US. The phenomenon presents significant diagnostic This phenomenon presents significant diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians, particularly due to the potential risk of malignancy and its implications for continuing the pregnancy. The implications for continuing the pregnancy are central to determining management strategies.

The reported prevalence of adnexal masses in pregnancy varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0.19% to 8.8%. Studies based on ultrasonographic screening suggest an incidence between 1 and 2% and, in some series, up to 4.9%, with methodological differences (e.g. population-based discharge data vs. systematic screening) accounting for discrepancies. Malignancy in pregnancy-associated adnexal masses remains rare, with population-based studies reporting an incidence of approximately 0.93% (87 ovarian cancers in 9375 ovarian masses). When borderline tumors are included, the prevalence increases to about 2.15%. The majority of benign lesions regress spontaneously, most often functional cysts such as corpus luteum cysts. Dermoid cysts account for 28–37% of benign tumors, and cystadenomas are reported in 16–27.5% of cases.

Our study demonstrated that adnexal masses with a tumor diameter ≥ 10 cm and a solid component ≥ 7 mm are strongly associated with malignancy, with excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 100%, specificity 96.3% and 92.6%, respectively). These findings are consistent with previous reports, including those of Timor-Tritsch et al. and the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group, which emphasized that large tumor size and the presence of solid components significantly increase the risk of malignancy. Timor-Tritsch et al. (2017) specifically highlighted the diagnostic challenge of papillary masses during pregnancy, showing that qualitative US features (e.g. smooth vs. irregular papillae, ground-glass vs. anechoic fluid) can further refine risk stratification. Our results, although broader in scope, reinforce these observations by confirming that papillary projections and solid components are key predictors of malignancy in pregnant patients.

Ultrasound findings suggesting benign disease — simple appearance; thin, smooth walls; and absence of solid components, septations, or internal blood flow — are noted, with simple cysts highly likely to be benign across ages and malignancy rates in most series of 0–1% regardless of menopausal status or cyst size; in postmenopausal women with unilocular cysts no larger than 10 cm followed at 6-month intervals, spontaneous resolution occurred in more than two thirds with no cancers after a mean 6.3 years, while a separate series of 1,148 unilocular cysts found 11 (0.96% [95% CI, 0.48–1.71]) malignant, and in seven of the 11 malignancies ultrasound did not detect papillary projections or other solid components; although no definitive size cutoff for surgery has been established, cysts of 10 cm or larger are often considered for surgery, yet simple cysts, even those greater than 10 cm, often spontaneously regress with serial ultrasonography.

### Diagnosis and management of a giant ovarian cyst in the gravid-puerperium period: a case report [^82849e12]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Ovarian cysts occur to 4.9% of pregnant women. Ovarian cysts of the giant-type are extremely rare in the gravid-puerperium period. They represent less than 1‰ of the set of cysts associated with pregnancy and their symptoms are non-specific. Generally, such symptoms as abdomen discomfort, constipation, back or abdominal pain are attributed to regular manifestations of pregnancy. So, these symptoms may be neglected by both the patient and the physician. The following could help discover the cyst before it became large:

- a complication such as torsion. This torsion often occurs when the cyst has between 6 and 8 cm diameter, with almost 60% of instances happening during 10–17 weeks of gestation.

- a systematic ultrasound carried out for the monitoring of the pregnancy. However, the place where our patient resided, no ultrasound was available.

Imaging plays a big role in diagnosis. Compared to ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (which is better than CT) are the best means of analysis of the cyst. In the present case, CT was used because MRI was too expensive for our patient. The majority of the cysts are asymptomatic and regress spontaneously. When the cyst is large, it can compress the gravid uterus, slow the fetus intra-uterine growth, cause premature delivery or abnormal presentation of the fetus. In the postpartum, the giant cyst is a risk factor for haemorrage. In our case, vaginal delivery has been possible with no complications.

The differential diagnosis of an abdominal mass includes benign and malignant gynecologic and non-gynecologic etiologies. A giant ovarian cyst can provoke a differential diagnostic problem with another fluid abdominal mass. In the present case, imaging had evoked both a giant ovarian cyst and a huge mesenteric cyst. Correct preoperative diagnosis is quite difficult due to the rare occurrence or the lack of specific clinical presentation of the giant ovarian cyst. Common symptoms, due to compressive effect such as abdominal pain, distension, bloating, constipation and vomiting can arise. Before surgery, two main arguments made us to think of a giant ovarian cyst rather than a huge mesenteric cyst: the female sex of our patient, and the rarity of mesenteric cysts. In fact, mesenteric cysts are often found among the paediatric population with an annual incidence of 1 for 20,000 and are very rare in the adult population with an annual incidence of only 1 for 100,000.

### Adnexal torsion in adolescents: ACOG committee opinion No, 783 [^f1afd237]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Management of adnexal masses — malignancy risk and cyst care in adolescent torsion emphasizes ovarian preservation. Despite frequent masses, "Although more than one half of cases of pediatric and adolescent adnexal torsion occur in the setting of an adnexal mass, cancer in this age group rarely presents as adnexal torsion (8, 9)". Specifically, "The rate of malignancy among premenarchal adolescents with ovarian torsion ranges from 0.4 to 5% (9, 44, 37)". For cyst management, "Ultrasonography to reevaluate the cyst at 6–12 weeks is recommended (8, 33)", and "Simple cysts typically resolve within 6–8 weeks". Persistent cysts permit intervention: "In pediatric and adolescent patients with persistent cysts, a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy can be performed given the risk of recurrent torsion", and "Cysts measuring 5 cm or more after detorsion should be treated in accordance with published clinical practice guidelines (45)". Hormonal suppression "can be initiated to prevent recurrent physiologic cysts".

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^97e630bc]. RCOG (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to tumor markers, RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend to do not use CA-125 levels in isolation to determine if a cyst is malignant. Do not exclude OC based on a normal value due to the nonspecific nature of the test, while a very high value may assist in reaching the diagnosis.

### Improving risk stratification of indeterminate adnexal masses on MRI: what imaging features help predict malignancy in O-RADS MRI 4 lesions? [^5c5bc011]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) MRI uses a 5-point scale to establish malignancy risk in sonographically-indeterminate adnexal masses. The management of O-RADS MRI score 4 lesions is challenging, as the prevalence of malignancy is widely variable (5–90%). We assessed imaging features that may sub-stratify O-RADS MRI 4 lesions into malignant and benign subgroups.

Method

Retrospective single-institution study of women with O-RADS MRI score of 4 adnexal masses between April 2021-August 2022. Imaging findings were assessed independently by 2 radiologists according to the O-RADS lexicon white paper. MRI and clinical findingswere compared between malignant and benign adnexal masses, and inter-reader agreement was calculated.

Results

Seventy-four women (median age 52 years, IQR 36–61) were included. On pathology, 41 (55.4%) adnexal masses were malignant. Patients with malignant masses were younger (p = 0.02) with higher CA-125 levels (p = 0.03). Size of solid tissue was greater in malignant masses (p = 0.01–0.04). Papillary projections and larger solid portion were more common in malignant lesions; irregular septations and predominantly solid composition were more frequent in benign lesions (p < 0.01). Solid tissue of malignant lesions was more often hyperintense on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (p ≤ 0.03). Other imaging findings were not significantly different (p = 0.09–0.77). Inter-reader agreement was excellent-good for most features (ICC = 0. 662–0.950; k = 0. 650–0.860).

Conclusion

Various MRI and clinical features differed between malignant and benign O-RADS MRI score 4 adnexal masses. O-RADS MRI 4 lesions may be sub-stratified (high vs low risk) based on solid tissue characteristics and CA-125 levels.

### Incidentalomas: initial management [^cb5bace9]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Incidentalomas are increasingly common findings on radiologic studies, causing worry for physicians and patients. Physicians should consider the risk of discovering incidentalomas when contemplating imaging. Patients may assume that incidentalomas are cancer, and may not be aware of the radiation risks associated with repeat imaging. Once incidentalomas are detected, appropriate management is dependent on an informed patient's wishes and the clinical situation. Guidelines are provided for the initial management of eight incidentalomas (pituitary, thyroid, pulmonary, hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, and ovarian). Patients presenting with pituitary incidentalomas should undergo pituitary-specific magnetic resonance imaging if the lesion is 1 cm or larger, or if it abuts the optic chiasm. Thyroid incidentalomas are ubiquitous, but nodules larger than 1 to 2 cm are of greater concern. Worrisome pulmonary incidentalomas are those larger than 8 mm or those with irregular borders, eccentric calcifications, or low density. However, current guidelines recommend that even pulmonary incidentalomas as small as 4 mm be followed. Solid hepatic incidentalomas 5 mm or larger should be monitored closely, and multiphasic scanning is helpful. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms have malignant potential, and surgery is recommended for pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm with suspicious features. Adrenal lesions larger than 4 cm are usually biopsied. The Bosniak classification is a well-accepted means of triaging renal incidentalomas. Lesions at category IIF or greater require serial monitoring or surgery. Benign or probably benign ovarian cysts 3 cm or smaller in premenopausal women or 1 cm or smaller in postmenopausal women do not require follow-up. Ovarian cysts with thickened walls or septa, or solid components with blood flow, should be managed closely.

### ADNEX risk prediction model for diagnosis of ovarian cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of external validation studies [^d18c5c2a]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

ADNEX has been validated in many studies, with AUC values > 0.90 in differentiating between benign and malignant tumours in various settings, and with strong results for its clinical utility at the 10% risk of malignancy threshold. Because of the lack of assessment of calibration in most studies, evaluating the accuracy of the estimated risks in a substantial way was not possible in this study.

Adnexal masses — ultrasound findings suggesting malignancy include cyst size greater than 10 cm, papillary or solid components, irregularity, presence of ascites, and high color Doppler flow. There has been significant research on ultrasound scoring systems alone or in combination with serum markers or historical information for predicting malignancy, but although promising, these systems have been validated only in research settings with specific ultrasound training and their suitability for routine clinical use has not been fully clarified.

### Data-driven analysis of a validated risk score for ovarian cancer identifies clinically distinct patterns during follow-up and treatment [^ccf6b855]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer among women and due to late detection prognosis is poor with an overall 5-year survival of 30–50%. Novel biomarkers are needed to reduce diagnostic surgery and enable detection of early-stage cancer by population screening. We have previously developed a risk score based on an 11-biomarker plasma protein assay to distinguish benign tumors (cysts) from malignant ovarian cancer in women with adnexal ovarian mass.

Methods

Protein concentrations of 11 proteins were characterized in plasma from 1120 clinical samples with a custom version of the proximity extension assay. The performance of the assay was evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and multiple hypothesis adjusted Fisher's Exact tests on achieved sensitivity and specificity.

Results

The assay's performance is validated in two independent clinical cohorts with a sensitivity of 0.83/0.91 and specificity of 0.88/0.92. We also show that the risk score follows the clinical development and is reduced upon treatment, and increased with relapse and cancer progression. Data-driven modeling of the risk score patterns during a 2-year follow-up after diagnosis identifies four separate risk score trajectories linked to clinical development and survival. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis of 5-year survival shows that at time of diagnosis the risk score is the second-strongest predictive variable for survival after tumor stage, whereas MUCIN-16 (CA-125) alone is not significantly predictive.

Conclusion

The robust performance of the biomarker assay across clinical cohorts and the correlation with clinical development indicates its usefulness both in the diagnostic work-up of women with adnexal ovarian mass and for predicting their clinical course.

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^1833ae85]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Mature ovarian teratomas and endometriomas — Surgical intervention for suspected endometriomas or mature ovarian teratomas is warranted if the masses are large, symptomatic, or growing in size on serial imaging or if malignancy is suspected. If these masses are managed expectantly, follow-up surveillance is warranted, and in one series of 289 women who opted for expectant management of ultrasound-diagnosed mature teratomas, 26% eventually underwent surgical treatment, with failures more likely among those with larger or more rapidly enlarging cysts. Surgical excision of endometriomas may adversely affect ovarian reserve, and although endometriomas of 5 cm or more have been associated with lower ovarian follicle density, several studies have found similar fertility outcomes among women with or without endometriomas who underwent assisted reproduction. Thus, asymptomatic endometriomas do not require intervention for infertility, and if surgery is required, as much ovarian tissue as possible should be conserved to preserve ovarian function.

### Guideline no. 403: initial investigation and management of adnexal masses [^5053ab6a]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to tumor markers, SOGC 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that CA-125 is a nonspecific glycoprotein that can be elevated in benign and malignant gynecologic conditions and in non-gynecologic conditions. Recognize that only half of all patients with early-stage ovarian cancer and 80% of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer show elevated CA-125 levels.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^97126400]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recurrence of endometrioma after surgical management is on the order of 30–50%. – Risk factors for cyst recurrence include younger age, prior treatment of endometriosis, larger cyst size, bilateral ovarian involvement, ablation or sclerotherapy rather than cystectomy, and overall burden of endometriosis at surgery. Ovulation inhibition, through either postoperative hormonal treatment or pregnancy, has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence, and medical ovulation inhibition should be considered in patients who do not desire immediate pregnancy.–

Ovarian lesion risk stratification and measurement — All ovarian lesions should be documented according to a validated standardized risk stratification system, with a lesion defined as a finding judged to be inconsistent with normal physiologic function; the size of the ovary and the lesion are measured in mm as the largest 3 diameters in 2 perpendicular planes, and if using the Ovarian-Adnexal Imaging Reporting Data System (O-RADS), lesions are categorized as unilocular, unilocular-solid, multilocular, multilocular-solid, or solid. Internal cyst contents should be described as anechoic, low level internal echoes, ground glass internal echoes, or mixed internal echoes; papillary projections are solid projections at least 3 mm in height when measured from the cyst wall, and papillary projections and/or the largest solid portion should be measured in 3 planes. Color score is measured subjectively with 1 as no vascular flow, 2 minimal, 3 moderate, and 4 highly vascular, and if typical or suggestive features indicate a specific diagnosis (e.g., endometrioma, teratoma, hemorrhagic cyst, hydrosalpinx, peritoneal inclusion cyst, pedunculated fibroid), this information should be provided; spectral, color, and/or power Doppler ultrasound may be useful to evaluate the vascular characteristics of pelvic lesions.
