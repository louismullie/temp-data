## Question

AFP tumor marker

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the AFP tumor marker, including its biology, clinical applications, performance characteristics, limitations, and guideline-based recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular nature and physiology of AFP. Then, I should verify its principal clinical roles across cancers, especially HCC and testicular germ cell tumors. Next, I will examine diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, and cutoffs, and I should double-check how these vary by context. After that, I need to review prognostic and predictive value, including dynamic changes and treatment-specific surrogacy. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and outline practical, risk-stratified use, while noting pitfalls and alternatives where AFP underperforms.

> Let me first confirm the biology and normal physiology. AFP is a glycoprotein of the albuminoid family, synthesized by the fetal liver and yolk sac, with adult levels typically below about 15 ng/mL; physiologic elevation occurs in pregnancy and in infants, and the half-life in adults is roughly 5–7 days, which is important when interpreting serial changes after treatment or surgery [^113ZVJZN] [^117Nkdoj].

> I will now examine its clinical roles, and I need to ensure I separate screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. In hepatocellular carcinoma, AFP has been used for surveillance, as an adjunct to diagnosis, for prognostication, and to monitor treatment response; in testicular germ cell tumors, AFP is central to diagnosis, staging, risk stratification, and relapse surveillance, with the key principle that pure seminoma does not produce AFP, so any elevation implies nonseminomatous elements or an alternate diagnosis [^112vMVnn] [^117Nkdoj] [^115bz12h].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance in HCC, and I need to be careful with cutoffs. At a cutoff around 20 ng/mL, sensitivity is about 60% and specificity about 84–90%, meaning many HCCs are AFP-negative and false positives occur in cirrhosis and hepatitis; at 200–400 ng/mL, specificity rises toward 99% but sensitivity falls to roughly 30–40%, so a high value is concerning but a normal value does not exclude disease; combining AFP with ultrasound improves sensitivity to about 90–96% at the cost of more false positives, which is why many guidelines still pair AFP with ultrasound in surveillance rather than relying on AFP alone [^114UgRi7] [^116sjXJN] [^1161NAWA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using AFP to diagnose HCC. I should confirm guideline positions. Major societies advise against using AFP alone to diagnose HCC; imaging with arterial hyperenhancement and portal venous washout remains the noninvasive diagnostic standard in cirrhosis, and AFP is best used as an adjunct or for prognostic information once HCC is diagnosed, not as a standalone diagnostic test [^111MVGB7] [^113t7A52] [^117St7ZU].

> Let me consider prognostic and predictive value, because this is where AFP often adds real clinical meaning. Baseline AFP greater than 400 ng/mL consistently associates with worse survival and more aggressive biology, and this threshold has been used to enrich trials and guide therapy selection; for example, ramucirumab conferred an overall survival benefit specifically in patients with baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, and AFP changes during therapy correlate with outcomes across modalities, including TACE, sorafenib, and immune checkpoint inhibitors [^111zDehh] [^114BP1c5] [^111XWy8V].

> I should double-check the role of dynamic AFP changes as treatment-response surrogates. Early AFP declines of at least 50–75% from baseline, or failure to rise beyond about 10%, have been linked to improved progression-free and overall survival in several cohorts and trials, including with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and in meta-analyses of ICIs; however, heterogeneity in definitions and timing limits routine adoption, so I need to emphasize that these are promising but not yet standardized endpoints [^111XWy8V] [^114hrdw4] [^112Hfdny].

> But wait, what if AFP is normal and the patient still has HCC. AFP-negative HCC accounts for roughly 30–40% of cases and tends to present with smaller, earlier-stage disease and better outcomes after curative therapy; this means a normal AFP never excludes HCC, and reliance on AFP alone risks delayed diagnosis, reinforcing the primacy of imaging in diagnostic algorithms [^114D5XRV] [^115r7u75].

> Next, I should review testicular cancer specifics to avoid misclassification. AFP is produced by yolk sac elements and embryonal carcinoma, is not produced by pure seminoma, and has a 5–7 day half-life; thus, persistent elevation after orchiectomy suggests residual nonseminomatous disease, and rising AFP mandates staging and systemic therapy per IGCCCG risk, whereas mildly elevated, stable values under about 20 ng/mL should not trigger treatment decisions without corroborating imaging and histology [^117Nkdoj] [^115bz12h] [^117XZ4Wp].

> I need to ensure I cover nonmalignant causes of AFP elevation, because these drive false positives. In chronic liver disease, especially active hepatitis B or C and cirrhosis, AFP may be elevated due to regenerative activity and correlates with ALT and fibrosis stage; antiviral therapy can lower these background levels and potentially improve the specificity of AFP for HCC, which is why serial trends and clinical context matter when interpreting modest elevations [^113xEmy9] [^115Wd6E1] [^116D1Mpp].

> Let me synthesize guideline-based recommendations so I don't overstate any single use case. For HCC surveillance, combine ultrasound with AFP every 6 months in at-risk patients, escalate to cross-sectional imaging if AFP rises or if nodules are ≥ 10 mm; for diagnosis, do not rely on AFP alone and prioritize multiphasic CT or MRI with LI-RADS features; for prognosis, obtain AFP at diagnosis and consider it in transplant selection and systemic therapy planning; for testicular cancer, obtain AFP, hCG, and LDH at baseline, use markers for staging and risk assignment, and monitor AFP during treatment and surveillance with attention to half-life kinetics [^112vMVnn] [^111MVGB7] [^117Nkdoj] [^117XZ4Wp].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and future directions. AFP lacks the sensitivity and specificity needed for standalone early detection, particularly in nonviral etiologies and in the setting of modern antiviral therapy; emerging panels such as AFP-L3, PIVKA-II, and novel proteomic or glycomic biomarkers, as well as abbreviated MRI and risk scores like aMAP, may complement or partially replace AFP, but most require prospective validation before routine adoption; until then, AFP remains a pragmatic, low-cost adjunct that informs risk, prognosis, and treatment response when interpreted alongside imaging and clinical context [^114fMN62] [^115a3vKE] [^112CveWQ].

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a **glycoprotein tumor marker** most associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) [^112Qftag]. In adults, normal AFP is **< 15 ng/mL**; levels above this prompt evaluation for malignancy or nonmalignant causes [^117XZGar]. AFP has **limited sensitivity and specificity** for HCC diagnosis, especially early disease, and is not recommended alone for diagnosis or surveillance [^111MVGB7] [^114UgRi7]; it is best used with ultrasound or MRI and interpreted in clinical context [^112vMVnn] [^117St7ZU]. In NSGCTs, AFP is essential for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring response; in HCC, AFP trends can inform prognosis and treatment response, but imaging remains definitive [^117Nkdoj] [^111yY9sN].

---

## Clinical significance and normal levels

- **Normal adult levels**: < 15 ng/mL [^117XZGar].
- **Pregnancy**: Physiologic elevation occurs, especially in the second trimester [^1178opGj].
- **Infants**: Elevated at birth, declining to adult levels by 6–12 months [^1178opGj].

## Clinical applications

### Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

- **Diagnostic utility**: Limited sensitivity (~60–70%) and specificity; ~30% of HCCs are AFP-negative [^114D5XRV] [^114UgRi7].
- **Prognostic value**: Baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL indicates aggressive biology and worse outcomes [^111zDehh] [^111trfCe].
- **Surveillance**: Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months in at-risk patients; AFP alone is insufficient [^112vMVnn] [^1161NAWA].
- **Treatment monitoring**: AFP trends correlate with response and survival in some therapies (e.g. ramucirumab, atezolizumab/bevacizumab) [^114BP1c5] [^111XWy8V].

---

### Germ cell tumors

- **Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs)**: Elevated in 10–40% of low-stage disease; essential for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring [^117Nkdoj].
- **Seminomas**: Do not produce AFP; elevated AFP indicates mixed histology or nonseminomatous elements [^115bz12h].
- **Half-life**: 5–7 days; serial measurements guide treatment response and relapse surveillance [^117Nkdoj].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **False positives**: Chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, other cancers (e.g. gastric, pancreatic), and nonmalignant liver disease [^111HeuEm] [^114VjTCJ].
- **False negatives**: Up to 30% of HCCs, particularly early-stage or well-differentiated tumors [^114D5XRV] [^114GoPd4].
- **Variability**: Assay differences and lack of standardized cutoffs complicate interpretation [^115yvyc7].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical context** | **Guideline recommendations** |
|-|-|
| HCC diagnosis | - Do not use AFP alone to diagnose HCC [^111MVGB7] <br/> - Combine with imaging (ultrasound, CT/MRI) [^117St7ZU] |
| HCC surveillance | - Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months in at-risk patients [^112vMVnn] [^1161NAWA] |
| NSGCTs | - Measure AFP, hCG, LDH for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring [^117Nkdoj] [^117XZ4Wp] |
| Interpretation | - Consider clinical context, trends, and imaging [^117St7ZU] [^115jpbXN] |

## Emerging biomarkers and future directions

Emerging biomarkers such as **PIVKA-II, AFP-L3, and HSPs** may improve early HCC detection and complement AFP [^115ts4ze] [^112ynTm3]. Panels combining AFP with other markers or clinical factors (e.g. GALAD, aMAP) are under evaluation to enhance performance [^112CveWQ]. Liquid biopsy approaches, including circulating tumor DNA, are being explored for early detection and monitoring [^notfound].

---

Alpha-fetoprotein remains a **useful but imperfect tumor marker** for HCC and NSGCTs. Its best use is in combination with imaging and clinical context, with emerging biomarkers poised to improve early detection and monitoring.

### Dynamic changes in serum α-fetoprotein predict prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZqcB6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cancer is the sixth most common malignancy globally and represents the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Global cancer statistics from 2022 documented approximately 865,000 new cases and 757,948 deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), comprising over 80% of liver cancer cases, carries a dismal prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 10%, primarily attributed to high recurrence rates and limited therapeutic efficacy.

Systemic therapies have substantially transformed HCC management, with approximately 50%–60% of patients now receiving such treatments. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combination regimens in 2020 marked a paradigm shift in HCC therapy, demonstrating promising survival benefits in selected patient populations. However, variable response rates to ICIs highlight the critical need for reliable predictive biomarkers. Identifying such markers is essential for advancing precision medicine and optimizing patient outcomes.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a glycoprotein synthesized by the fetal liver and yolk sac, remains at low concentrations in healthy adults but frequently becomes elevated in HCC patients. This characteristic has established AFP as a cornerstone biomarker for HCC diagnosis and monitoring. Substantial evidence supports AFP's utility in early detection, and prognostication, with elevated levels correlating with adverse outcomes. High preoperative serum AFP concentrations predict poorer postoperative survival, while baseline levels exceeding 400 ng/ml are associated with significantly reduced survival compared to lower concentrations. Additionally, dynamic AFP changes during treatment demonstrate strong prognostic associations.

Despite these findings, consensus regarding AFP dynamics as a predictive marker in ICI-treated HCC patients remains elusive. Initial meta-analyses suggested correlations between early AFP response and clinical outcomes, though these studies were limited by small sample sizes. Subsequent investigations yielded conflicting results, potentially reflecting heterogeneity in AFP response definitions and treatment protocols.

To resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted this comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic significance of dynamic serum AFP changes in HCC patients receiving ICI therapy. Through systematic synthesis of available evidence, we aimed to clarify AFP's predictive utility and support the development of biomarker-guided treatment strategies to improve overall survival (OS) and quality of life in this patient population.

### Α-fetoprotein [^1178opGj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2011). Low credibility.

α-Fetoprotein (AFP) measurements have clinical implications in fetal medicine and, in infants and older children, in detection, differential diagnosis and monitoring of malignant disease. Maternal serum AFP levels constitute part of a multiple-marker test used in early second-trimester screening to predict risk of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Those individuals with increased risk are offered further definitive diagnostic investigation. Second-trimester screening is now increasingly being superseded by first-trimester screening with other serum markers and ultrasound. As AFP is only produced physiologically during fetal development, elevated serum levels after the first two post-natal years usually indicate the presence of a malignant disease process. Before this time, levels may be purely physiological and therefore serial values should be plotted on a logarithmic chart to ensure that they are falling appropriately, with a typical half-life of ∼5–6 days. If not, further investigation should be undertaken. Serum AFP is raised in a significant proportion of germ cell tumours (GCTs), hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In suspected cases of GCT, serum human choriogonadotropin (HCG) estimation should also be performed. For possible intracranial GCTs, both serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of AFP and HCG should be measured, ideally before neurosurgical biopsy. In malignant conditions, serum AFP may be used for diagnosis, treatment monitoring, surveillance for disease recurrence and prognostication. Immunohistochemistry for AFP using antibody staining is routinely used to assist pathological diagnosis on tissue sections where the differential includes GCT, hepatoblastoma and/or HCC. Elevations of serum AFP also occur in non-malignant conditions such as chronic liver disease.

### Role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of HCC [^113DJFuy]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

For many cancers, biomarkers have served as an important tool across the cancer care continuum from risk stratification and early detection to diagnosis and treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) remains one of the few validated biomarkers for patients with HCC. Although AFP has shown potential for each of these steps, its performance, when used alone, has often been suboptimal. There continue to be discordant recommendations about AFP's value when combined with ultrasound for surveillance, as well as its role in diagnostic algorithms. Conversely, high AFP levels are associated with aggressive tumor biology and survival, so it remains a key factor for the selection of candidates for liver transplant. There have been immense efforts to identify and validate additional biomarkers for each of these steps in the HCC care continuum. Indeed, biomarker panels have shown promising data for HCC risk stratification and surveillance among patients with cirrhosis, as well as prognostication and detection of minimal residual disease in patients undergoing HCC treatment. Several large prospective studies are currently ongoing to evaluate the role of these emerging biomarkers in clinical practice.

### Serum α-fetoprotein response as a surrogate for clinical outcome in patients receiving systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [^115CWkAb]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The role of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a marker for treatment response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving systemic therapy is poorly defined.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed on patients with advanced HCC enrolled in five phase II clinical trials. Serum AFP was prospectively collected at baseline and at different time points through treatment in parallel with radiologic response and clinical outcome. Patients were separated into three groups based on a 50% change in serum AFP from baseline. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and radiologic responses were compared between groups using log-rank and Wilcoxon tests.

Results

Of 144 patients, 107 met the eligibility criteria. Eighteen patients experienced a > 50% AFP decline, 57 patients had a > 50% AFP increase, and 32 patients had a < 50% change in serum AFP in either direction. Compared with patients with a < 50% change in serum AFP (median PFS, 5.6 months), patients with a > 50% AFP decrease had a longer PFS time (median, 16.9 months; p = .029), whereas those with a > 50% increase had a shorter PFS time (median, 2.3 months; p = .038). Patients with a > 50% rise in AFP had a shorter OS time than those with a < 50% change (median, 6.3 months versus 11.1 months, respectively; p = .004), whereas a > 50% AFP decrease was not associated with a significant difference in OS (median, 13.0 months; p = .87). AFP changes were significantly associated with radiologic response.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that serum AFP change during treatment may serve as a useful surrogate marker for clinical outcome in patients with advanced HCC receiving systemic therapy.

Serum α-fetoprotein (AFP), a well-established biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), increases the sensitivity of ultrasound-based surveillance programs for early stage HCC detection. 1, 2 Multiple factors, including tumor burden, can affect AFP levels in patients with HCC. 3 Nontumoral factors, such as race/ethnicity and liver disease etiology, are also known to be associated with elevated AFP. 3 With the increasing trend of earlier stage HCC detection and shift from viral to nonviral etiology, we hypothesized that AFP level at HCC diagnosis would decrease in the United States.

### Diagnostic value of serum STIP1 in HCC and AFP-negative HCC [^114D5XRV]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Alpha-fetoprotein was introduced in the 1960s as a serum marker for HCC. It remains the most commonly used biomarker for HCC worldwide. However, the sensitivity of AFP for diagnosing HCC is approximately 60% to 70%. Even with a low cutoff value (10–20 ng/mL), its specificity remains inadequate, resulting in many HCC patients being missed (30%-40%). In the case of AFP-negative HCC (ANHC), characterized by smaller tumor masses, imaging examinations are also prone to missing the diagnosis.

ANHC accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of HCC. Its early diagnosis mainly relies on imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI. However, ANHC mainly presents as a small HCC, often with mild clinical symptoms, lack of specificity, and inconspicuous imaging characteristics. This makes it more challenging to achieve early diagnosis and treatment in affected patients. ANHC currently lacks ideal biomarkers for early detection. However, the prognosis for patients in this group is generally favorable when treated promptly. Therefore, increasing emphasis on ANHC and actively exploring more effective diagnostic methods are crucial.

### Alpha-fetoprotein as a potential surrogate biomarker for atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^115UnNaY]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most widely tested serum biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and overexpression of AFP is considered reflective of more aggressive tumor biology and burden. Approximately 40% of patients with unresectable HCC have baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL. In patients with HCC, AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL is a negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) regardless of tumor stage and has become a stratification factor for most phase III clinical trials in unresectable HCC. Beyond the prognostic impact of baseline AFP levels, a variety of studies suggest that AFP changes on treatment or after treatment, across all disease stages, are surrogate biomarkers for response to both systemic treatment and locoregional treatment. Currently, there is no optimal surrogate endpoint for OS in HCC. Objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) have been shown to have low and moderate correlations to OS, respectively, and challenges exist in the interpretation of radiologic response. Thus, new early response surrogate biomarkers in HCC, such as on-treatment AFP response, are needed.

### Dynamic changes in serum α-fetoprotein predict prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Hfdny]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that among HCC patients receiving ICIs, dynamic changes in AFP show a significant association with OS and PFS, primarily driven by results from combination ICI therapy studies. This association was less clear or not statistically significant for ICI monotherapy in the case of OS and is subject to limitations stemming from inter-study heterogeneity in AFP definitions and assessment timing, as well as potential publication bias for one outcome. While these findings suggest AFP's potential as a prognostic marker in HCC patients receiving ICI-based therapies, particularly combination regimens, the heterogeneity of included studies and potential publication bias necessitate cautious interpretation. Further validation in prospective, standardized studies adopting uniform AFP response criteria and assessment timings is crucial before AFP can be unequivocally established as a reliable biomarker for routine clinical decision-making in this context.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111HeuEm]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) diagnostic characteristics and thresholds: Although serum AFP has long been used as a marker for HCC, it is not a sensitive or specific diagnostic test for HCC. Serum AFP levels greater than 400 ng/mL are observed only in a small percentage of patients with HCC; in a series of 1158 patients with HCC, only 18% of patients had values greater than 400 ng/mL and 46% of patients had normal serum AFP levels less than 20 ng/mL. In patients with chronic liver disease, an elevated AFP could be more indicative of HCC in patients who are not infected, and AFP can also be elevated in pregnancy and other cancers such as intrahepatic CCA, some metastases from colon cancer, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. AFP testing can be useful in conjunction with other test results to guide the management of disease in patients for whom a diagnosis of HCC is suspected, and an elevated AFP level in conjunction with imaging results showing the presence of a growing liver mass has been shown to have a high positive predictive value for HCC in two retrospective analyses involving small numbers of patients; however, the diagnostic accuracy of an absolute AFP cutoff value has not been validated in this setting, and such values may vary by institution and patient population.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^114GoPd4]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) diagnostic performance: Although serum AFP has long been used as a marker for HCC, it is not a sensitive or specific diagnostic test for HCC. Serum AFP levels greater than 400 ng/mL are observed only in a small percentage of patients with HCC, and in a series of 1158 patients with HCC, only 18% had values greater than 400 ng/mL and 46% had normal serum AFP levels less than 20 ng/mL. AFP testing can be useful in conjunction with other test results to guide management when HCC is suspected, and an elevated AFP with imaging evidence of a growing liver mass has been shown to have a high positive predictive value for HCC; however, the diagnostic accuracy of an absolute AFP cutoff value has not been validated in this setting.

### Alpha-fetoprotein and other tumour-associated antigens for immunotherapy of hepatocellular cancer [^114nZAGP]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death, with few treatment options for advanced disease.

Objectives

Here, we review the aetiology of HCC and focus on recent data on tumour-associated antigens (TAA) for HCC, their functions and potential use as immunological targets for immune-based therapy for HCC. In addition, we examine some aspects of antigen presentation within the liver.

Results/Conclusions

alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) has been investigated for many years as a TAA, and has been tested in recent clinical trials. More recently, additional TAA have been identified and new therapeutic approaches have been investigated which may be testable clinically in this difficult disease setting.

### Molecular portrait of high α-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma: implications for biomarker-driven clinical trials [^111trfCe]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The global disease burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide, with an estimated 50% of cases receiving systemic treatments for advanced stage. In the last 2 years, several compounds have shown clinical efficacy in the first- (lenvatinib) or second-line (regorafenib, cabozantinib) setting and joined the standard of care, sorafenib, ultimately leading to a median survival of 2 years with sequential therapies. Ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGFR2, is the first drug to demonstrate efficacy in a biomarker-driven phase III trial in HCC, showing a survival benefit as second-line treatment in those patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels higher than 400 ng/ml. Nevertheless, the rationale behind the use of AFP as a predictive biomarker is not fully understood.

AFP is a protein transcribed from the albuminoid genes located on chromosome 4, with a known multifunctionality (i.e. binding of hydrophobic ligands, regulation of proliferation and immunomodulation) provided by its multi-modular structure. AFP is considered an oncofoetal protein due to its presence during foetal development and its association with some tumour types, such as liver, testes and ovary. In HCC, AFP serum concentration may vary from normal (< 10 ng/ml) to extremely high (> 100000 ng/ml). For this reason, AFP has been extensively explored as a biomarker. For surveillance and diagnostic purposes, AFP sensitivity and specificity depend on the established cut-off, with a global accuracy that is suboptimal for routine clinical practice. As a prognostic factor, it has been clearly demonstrated that patients with AFP > 400 ng/ml have poor outcomes.

Considering the prognostic and predictive capabilities of AFP in HCC, our hypothesis is that the molecular profile of high AFP tumours differs from those with low AFP and might be associated with VEGF signalling. Herein, we describe the biological traits of HCC with high serum AFP levels through a comprehensive molecular analysis that may provide the rationale for the design of future biomarker-driven clinical trials.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma based on serum α-fetoprotein status [^1132AJMz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most commonly used and crucial tumor marker in clinical diagnosis and prognosis guidance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, approximately 30% of HCC patients do not exhibit abnormal serum AFP levels at the time of diagnosis. This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis differences between AFP-negative and AFP-positive patients with HCC.

Methods

Clinical data on patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were collected and analyzed. All patients with HCC were reported as AFP-negative or AFP-positive based on AFP test results. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared between the AFP-negative and AFP-positive patients. Logistic regression analysis and multivariable Cox regression analysis were performed to identify the association of AFP with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and CSS.

Results

Of 7090 patients, 2074 (29.3%) and 5016 (70.7%) were AFP-negative and AFP-positive patients, respectively. The 5-year OS and CSS rates in AFP-negative patients were significantly better than AFP-positive patients (36.4 vs. 20.7% and 46.7 vs. 27.2%, both P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the AFP level was an independent risk factor of tumor size [odds ratio (OR), 1.821; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.625–2.040; P < 0.001], N stage (OR, 1.922; 95% CI, 1.528–2.417; P < 0.001) and M stage (OR, 2.435; 95% CI, 1.980–2.995; P < 0.001). On multivariable Cox-regression analyses, AFP-positive was associated with decreased CSS (hazard ratio, 1.452; 95% CI, 1.355–1.557; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Abnormal serum AFP was significantly associated with worse prognosis, larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Patients with AFP-positive may need more individualized treatment decision and further optimization of HCC management strategies.

### A new approach to the use of α-fetoprotein as surveillance test for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis [^112WiNCA]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and in most cases it develops in a cirrhotic liver. Surveillance of patients at risk for developing HCC can detect tumours amenable to curative therapies, with positive impact on survival. The α -fetoprotein (AFP) is a serum marker still used for the diagnosis and surveillance of HCC. A value of 20 ng mL −1 is considered as best cutoff (BC) to suspect the development of HCC in the setting of chronic liver disease. However, about 32–59% of patients with HCC have normal AFP levels and, conversely, non-tumour-related AFP elevations may occur in patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, making AFP inadequate as a surveillance test. To detect HCC at an early stage, it has been proposed to lower the AFP cutoff to 10.9 ng mL −1, obtaining a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 82%. However, even with this cutoff, about 30% of HCC escape from an early diagnosis. Therefore, Western guidelines consider AFP as inadequate to survey patients at risk of HCC and recommend the use of ultrasound (US) alone. Nevertheless, being an operator-dependent imaging technique, US has been shown to suffer from a limited sensitivity (63%) for an early detection of HCC. Thus, some authors as well as Eastern guidelines suggest maintaining the use of AFP in HCC surveillance. Waiting for the new reliable biomarkers to complement US in detecting early HCC, our retrospective case–control study aimed at optimising the efficiency of AFP as a surveillance test in cirrhotic patients, considering both its value at the time of HCC diagnosis and its changes overtime before the diagnosis.

### Diagnostic and mechanistic implications of serum free light chains, albumin and α-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma [^114Qwup4]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is widely considered to be the key to effective therapy. Radical, potentially curative treatments, such as surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation and orthotopic liver transplantation are only applicable to that minority of patients who present with, or who are detected by screening to have, smaller tumours, typically < 5 cm in diameter. This observation has led to routine screening/surveillance of patients at high risk of HCC, namely those with advanced chronic liver disease and certain carriers of the hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV, HCV). Both in the screening situation and the clinical situation where it is required to determine if HCC has developed in a patient with symptoms, an imaging procedure, usually ultrasound, followed by a CT or MRI are the primary diagnostic modalities supplemented where necessary with histological confirmation by biopsy. Characteristic imaging features such as arterial enhancement and portal phase 'washout' have been recognised to be highly sensitive and specific features for the diagnosis of HCC. Nonetheless, such an approach is expensive and ultrasound examination is time-consuming and highly operator-dependent so, a simple serological diagnostic test would be invaluable. Estimation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been widely used in this respect and indeed it is well recognised to be highly specific and useful in the clinical setting when levels are elevated above a particular threshold typically set between 200 and 500 ng mL −1. However, the role of AFP in the screening setting remains controversial, some supporting its utility and others, because of its low sensitivity in the early stages of the disease, have suggested that AFP has no role in the screening setting.

### Alpha-fetoprotein level as a biomarker of liver fibrosis status: a cross-sectional study of 619 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B [^113MpNWZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

AFP is a fetal protein produced in the yolk sac and liver of the developing fetus. Its molecular weight is between that of albumin and α1-globulin, suggesting an early form of albumin. Serum AFP was reported to be a tumor marker for HCC as early as 1963. Although AFP is not specific for HCC, elevated AFP levels are seen in chronic liver disease, especially viral hepatitis, and non-hepatic malignancies such as pancreatic, gastric, biliary and germ cell tumors. Determination of AFP levels has been used to monitor HCC onset and progression, evaluate effectiveness of curative treatment, and predict outcomes. AFP is a useful screening tool for HCC in developing countries where HCC prevalence is high and CHB infection is its major risk factor. High levels of AFP (> 400 ng/ml) are strongly predictive for HCC. AFP can be used indirectly as an index to indicate fibrosis stage in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. However, it is not clear if AFP levels are correlated with ongoing liver damage and repair in chronic liver disease such as CHB.

Few studies have been conducted to evaluate liver cirrhosis by analyzing AFP levels or evaluating associations between AFP levels and fibrosis stages. We hypothesized that analyzing serum AFP levels at different stages of inflammation and fibrosis would clarify the diagnostic value of AFP in predicting the grade and stage of liver pathology. This study aimed to determine the subclinical significance of low serum AFP levels by investigating the relationship between serum AFP levels and different inflammation and fibrosis stages in CHB patients.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^112L1D2j]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in screening and diagnosis — Sensitivity for detection of HCC, compared to US alone, was 97% vs. 78% (relative risk [RR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93), and due to the low cost and ease of use, AFP may have utility for enhancing detection of HCC when used in combination with US for screening at-risk individuals; additionally, a progressive elevation rate of ≥ 7 ng/mL per month may be more useful as a diagnostic tool for HCC, relative to use of a fixed cut point such as 200 ng/mL.

### Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as tumor marker in a patient with urothelial cancer with exceptional response to anti-PD-1 therapy and an escape lesion mimic [^111KLvEp]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), including anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy, revolutionized the treatment landscape of several cancers, including urothelial cancer. While some patients experience deep and durable responses, the majority of patients have either intrinsic or acquired resistance. Progressive disease is most frequently discovered by enlarging or new lesions on cross-sectional imaging, however, there is a broad differential for nodules, particularly in the lung, including infection and inflammation. Determining the etiology of lung nodules is therefore important, as it may affect medical and potentially curative surgical management in the context of oligometastatic disease. Tumor markers are helpful in some cancers and can help guiding therapies, for example, CA125 in ovarian cancer. However, no such tumor markers are available in most cancers. Here, we describe a case of a patient with metastatic, chemotherapy-resistant urothelial carcinoma with a complete response to treatment with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The patient's tumor aberrantly expressed alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which served as a serum tumor marker that tracked very closely with disease burden. Following a complete resection, the patient developed an isolated, slowly growing lung nodule. Although there was no concomitant increase in AFP, the patient underwent resection of the lesion, which revealed a benign intraparenchymal lymph node, but no malignant disease.

### The significance of early α-fetoprotein level changes in predicting clinical and survival benefits in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving sorafenib [^111pK21Y]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Background

he role of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) changes in predicting the treatment outcomes of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients to sorafenib remains unknown.

Methods

Serum AFP was collected prospectively at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits in parallel with clinical and survival outcomes. AFP response was defined as a relative drop of AFP > 20% of the baseline level after 6 weeks of sorafenib. The relationship between AFP response and the treatment outcomes was first explored in patients who received sorafenib in a phase II study. Subsequently, an independent validation set of patients were obtained to validate the association of AFP response to clinical outcomes.

Results

Included in the exploration and validation sets for analysis were 41 and 53 patients, respectively, with baseline AFP level > 20 μg/L. In the exploration cohort, AFP response was significantly associated with clinical benefit (CB) rate (relative chance 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–11.1), and multivariate analysis indicated that AFP response was associated with significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13–0.76) and marginally better overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.09–1.02). When applying AFP changes in the validation set, significant associations were again found between AFP response with CB rate (relative chance, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.3–13.6) and PFS (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04–0.30) but not OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.27–1.26).

Conclusion

Drop in AFP level at 6 weeks is an exploratory early surrogate for both CB and PFS in advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib.

### Serum α-fetoprotein and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ramucirumab [^111zDehh]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Many clinical factors are important in the prognosis of patients with HCC, including disease stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), histopathology, liver function and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. –

Elevated AFP in patients with HCC is associated with worse prognosis compared with the general HCC population. – It has been shown that incremental changes in AFP levels (10– < 100, 100– < 1000 and ≥ 1000) at the time of HCC diagnosis are significantly associated with increased mortality independent of several demographic factors, clinical factors or treatment. High serum AFP levels have been shown to predict the risk of tumour recurrence after hepatic resection and liver transplantation, – and serum AFP concentrations ≥ 400 ng/ml have consistently been shown to indicate poorer prognosis in different clinical settings. Globally, patients with an AFP level > 400 ng/ml comprise approximately half of HCC patients on systemic therapy.

### A network map of intracellular alpha-fetoprotein signalling in hepatocellular carcinoma [^113ZVJZN]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein of foetal origin belonging to the albumin protein family. Serum AFP is a long-conceived early-diagnostic biomarker for HCC with its elevated expression in different liver pathologies ranging from hepatitis viral infections to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Beyond their utility as biomarkers, in support of its contribution to these clinical outcomes, the function of AFP as an immune suppressor and inducer of malignant transformation in HCC patients is well reported. Multiple reports show that AFP is secreted by hepatocytes, binds to its cognate receptor, AFP-receptor (AFPR), and exerts its actions. However, there is only limited information available in this context. There is an urgent need to gather more insight into the AFP signalling pathway and consider it a classical intracellular signalling pathway, among others. AFP is a highly potent intracellular molecule that has the potential to bind to many interactors like PTEN, Caspase, RAR, and so on. It has been shown that cellular AFP and secreted AFP have different roles in HCC pathophysiology, and a comprehensive map of the AFP signalling pathway is warranted for further theranostic applications.

### Circulating biomarkers for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114fMN62]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC patients face a dismal prognosis because symptoms usually appear in an advanced stage of disease. The detection of early stage HCC allows for curative surgical treatment and therefore saves lives. Specific non-invasive or diagnostic markers for HCC may represent a valuable tool for detecting these tumors at an early stage. The clinically most established serological biomarker alpha-fetoprotein shows only limited diagnostic performance, however novel candidate biomarkers and biomarker panels for detecting HCC at early stages of development are being studied. In this review we will discuss the findings of these studies.

### Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as tumor marker in a patient with urothelial cancer with exceptional response to anti-PD-1 therapy and an escape lesion mimic [^116h3ED2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The development of a new lesion in a patient with a complete remission to anti-PD-1 therapy is highly concerning for a drug resistant escape lesion. Here, we present a case of a 62-year-old patient with chemotherapy-resistant metastatic urothelial cancer who had a complete remission to pembrolizumab. The patient's disease burden tracked closely to serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expressed by the tumor and served as an accurate tumor marker. Surveillance imaging revealed a solitary growing pulmonary nodule mimicking an escape lesion in the absence of an increase in AFP levels. Biopsy of this lesion revealed a benign intraparenchymal lymph node with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. This case indicates that in some patients, biomarkers aberrantly expressed by their tumors, such as AFP in this patient, may be used as a tumor marker for response to anti-PD-1 therapy and emphasizes the importance of confirming potential escape lesions by pathologic examination.

### Issues in screening and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma [^115rrPBj]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Individuals with chronic viral hepatitis and other forms of liver disease are at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). When HCC presents with clinical symptoms, the tumor is typically very far advanced and the patient has few therapeutic options. Thus, screening and surveillance for HCC would appear to very appropriate. However, there is no definitive evidence that surveillance improves patient outcomes and current techniques lack sensitivity and specificity. Nonetheless, serial measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in serum and hepatic ultrasound have become routine practice, despite a lack of evidence of their overall benefit. Clearly, better methods are needed for early diagnosis of HCC. Improved technology will ultimately have to be tested for improved patient outcome before becoming widely recommended.

### Prediction of survival and analysis of prognostic factors for patients with AFP negative hepatocellular carcinoma: a population-based study [^116N1Lk3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major end-stage liver disease with the sixth highest incidence rate and third highest cause of cancer-related mortality. According to global cancer statistics for 2020, there were approximately 906,000 new cases and 830,000 HCC deaths. Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial for mitigating these threats.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is currently the most widely used biomarker for the diagnosis, monitoring, evaluation of prognosis, and treatment of HCC. The elevation of tumor markers, mainly AFP, is independently associated with poor prognostic features, such as shortened survival. However, in the HCC patient population, AFP-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (ANHC), i.e. AFP < 20 ng/mL at initial diagnosis, is an important type that causes many patients to lose early diagnosis and treatment and accounts for approximately 30–40% of patients. Therefore, the survival and prognosis of ANHC patients are still a matter of concern. Unfortunately, there are relatively few prognostic studies based on the ANHC cohort.

We analyzed the impact of the patient's general condition, tumor indications, and treatment methods on survival, identified relevant risk factors, and constructed a nomogram to guide prognostic evaluation and early diagnosis of ANHC.

### Serum α-fetoprotein and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ramucirumab [^111Lrbct]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Evaluation and validation of predictive biomarkers for selected patient subgroups in early clinical trial settings could avoid trial failure in later stages of clinical development. Our findings support the prognostic impact of baseline AFP as an important factor to consider in trial design. The current analyses also suggest that decreases in AFP may be predictive of ramucirumab OS benefit and confirm AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml as an appropriate selection criterion for ramucirumab OS benefit.

### Alpha-fetoprotein as a potential surrogate biomarker for atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^111XWy8V]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Clinicians face difficulty in predicting the efficacy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatments as there is no optimal surrogate endpoint for overall survival. Furthermore, challenges exist in the interpretation of radiologic response. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most widely tested serum biomarker in HCC and is considered reflective of more aggressive tumor biology and burden. With atezolizumab + bevacizumab being the standard of care for patients with unresectable HCC, we explored AFP response as a potential surrogate biomarker of prognosis for the combination therapy in those with elevated baseline AFP. AFP cutoffs of ≥ 75% decrease or ≤ 10% increase measured 6 weeks after starting treatment were associated with longer overall and progression-free survival and displayed potential as surrogate biomarkers of response. Results from this exploratory analysis may be clinically useful for predicting the efficacy of atezolizumab + bevacizumab in patients with systemic treatment-naïve unresectable HCC early in treatment, helping to inform patient care.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early stage testicular cancer: AUA guideline [^117No45q]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Serum tumor markers — alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by yolk sac and embryonal carcinoma and is elevated in 10–40% of low-stage non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT), while choriocarcinoma and seminoma do not produce AFP; patients with pure seminoma in the primary tumor with an elevated serum AFP are considered to have NSGCT, and the half-life of AFP is five to seven days; although many laboratories consider > 8 ng/mL abnormal, some healthy individuals have up to 15 or 25 ng/mL, so treatment decisions solely based on "elevated" AFP levels that are stable and < 25 ng/mL are discouraged.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117St7ZU]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis and follow-up with AFP — imaging guidance: Since the level of serum AFP may be elevated in those with certain nonmalignant conditions such as chronic HBV or HCV or be within normal limits in up to 30% of patients with HCC, the panel considers an imaging finding of classic enhancement to be more definitive in the diagnostic setting compared to AFP alone. Additional imaging studies (CT or MRI) are recommended for patients with a rising serum AFP level in the absence of a liver mass, and if no liver mass is detected following measurement of an elevated AFP level, the patient should be followed with AFP testing and liver imaging; further, assessment of AFP levels may be helpful in monitoring treatment response as appropriate.

### Evaluation of patients with hepatocellular carcinomas that Do not produce α-fetoprotein [^115r7u75]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) is a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and inferior outcomes after a liver transplant (LT). Data on the outcomes for patients with HCCs that do not produce AFP are limited.

Objective

To compare characteristics and outcomes among LT recipients with radiographically apparent HCC lesions with AFP-producing tumors or with tumors that do not produce AFP (hereafter referred to as non-AFP-producing tumors), and to identify factors influencing recurrence in LT recipients with non-AFP-producing tumors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective analysis at a university transplant center of 665 adults with HCC who underwent an LT during the period from 1989 to 2013. Of the 665 LT recipients, 457 (68.7%) had AFP-producing tumors, and 208 (31.3%) had non-AFP-producing tumors (the maximum AFP level before an LT was ≤ 10 ng/mL). Dates of study analysis were from August 2015 to June 2016.

Intervention

Liver transplant.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Recurrence-free survival and recurrence rates.

Results

Patients with non-AFP-producing tumors had radiographic tumor characteristics similar to those of patients with AFP-producing tumors, but, pathologically, they had fewer lesions (25% vs 35% with > 2 lesions; P = 0.03), smaller cumulative tumor diameters (4.2 vs 5.0 cm; P = 0.02), fewer microvascular (17% vs 22%) and macrovascular (2% vs 9%) invasions (P < .001), and fewer poorly differentiated tumors (15% vs 28%; P < .001). Patients with non-AFP-producing tumors also had significantly superior recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years (88%, 74%, and 67% vs 76%, 59%, and 51%, respectively; P = 0.002) and lower 5-year recurrence rates (8.8% vs 22%; P < .001) than patients with AFP-producing tumors. When stratified by radiologic Milan criteria, 5-year survival was better, and recurrence lowest, among patients with non-AFP-producing tumors within the Milan criteria (71% survival and 6% recurrence), and survival was worse, and recurrence highest, for patients with AFP-producing tumors outside the Milan criteria (40% survival and 42% recurrence; P < .001). Significant predictors of recurrence among patients with non-AFP-producing tumors include radiologic (> 2 tumors [HR, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.72–14.4; P = 0.003]; cumulative diameter [1.70 per log SD; 1.12–2.59; P < .001]; outside the Milan criteria [10.0; 3.7–33.3; P < .001) and pathologic factors (> 2 tumors [4.39; 1.32–14.6; P = 0.02]; cumulative diameter [2.32 per log SD; 1.43–3.77; P = 0.001]; microvascular [3.07; 1.02–9.24; P = 0.05] and macrovascular invasion [8.75; 2.15–35.6; P = 0.002]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Nearly one-third of patients with radiographically apparent HCC have non-AFP-producing tumors that have more favorable pathologic characteristics, lower posttransplant recurrence, and superior survival compared with patients with AFP-producing tumors. Posttransplant HCC recurrence for patients with non-AFP-producing tumors is predicted by important radiologic and pathologic factors, and is negligible for patients within the Milan criteria. Stratifying patients by AFP status in addition to radiological criteria may improve the selection process for and the prioritization of transplant candidates.

### Proteomic and metabonomic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma: a comprehensive review [^115q72Ez]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Currently the most widely used biomarker for HCC, particularly in the developing world where disease burden is greatest is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Alpha-fetoprotein ticks several of the boxes in relation to the points mentioned above but fails dramatically in its diagnostic performance and ability, thus significantly reducing its reliability in clinical settings.

The role of AFP in diagnosing HCC and monitoring those at high risk of its development is heavily constrained, with revised guidelines reflecting its significant limitations in this regard. A publication by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) summarises that AFP 'lacks adequate sensitivity and specificity for effective surveillance and for diagnosis' of HCC. Similarly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) does not recommend AFP within the panel of tests for HCC diagnosis. Not much has been reported on the independent diagnostic ability of AFP, but it is approximated at 0.70, with at least one publication showing area under the curve (AUC) values as low as < 0.60 when used at a cut-off of 100 ng mL −1. To circumvent this problem, advanced radiological methods are increasingly being relied on as the best non-invasive tools for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of CLD patients. However, as CLDs and their sequelae of conditions inflict their biggest burden in the developing world, this shift has meant that many of the patients mostly in need of monitoring and diagnosis are left to rely on the poor performance of AFP. The AASLD and EASL both recommend routine surveillance of patients with chronic hepatitis infections and fibrosis, to detect HCC at the early disease stage, when curative treatment options such as tumour resection, ablation, transarterial chemoembolisation, and liver transplant, recommended for patients with localised tumours on a background of advanced cirrhosis are still prospective. To make this a reality, there is an urgent need for the identification and conversion into clinical use of affordable, non-invasive, and high-performance diagnostic tools deployable in both the developing and developed worlds.

### New utility of an old marker: serial α-fetoprotein measurement in predicting radiologic response and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing systemic chemotherapy [^116mZFUb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

There are limitations in using radiologic evaluation to assess the treatment outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The use of serial alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in monitoring response has not been rigorously evaluated. We aimed to study the clinical value of AFP trend in an attempt to validate AFP as a surrogate serologic end point.

Patients and Methods

Participants from a phase III randomized trial of systemic chemotherapy in HCC were studied. Serum AFP was prospectively collected in parallel with clinical and radiologic outcome. AFP response was defined as a decrease in AFP of more than 20% after a minimum of two cycles of chemotherapy. We studied the relationship between AFP response and treatment outcome in terms of radiologic response and overall survival.

Results

Of 188 patients, 117 patients with elevated serum AFP (> 20 microg/L) and documented radiologic evaluation had received at least two cycles of chemotherapy. A total of 47 AFP responders were identified. AFP responders had better survival than nonresponders (13.5 v 5.6 months, respectively; P < .0001), and AFP response was strongly associated with radiologic response (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis suggested that AFP response was significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio, 0.413; 95% CI, 0.273 to 0.626; P < .0001). AFP responses were frequently observed in patients with radiologically stable disease (SD) and tended to identify a subgroup of SD patients with better survival.

Conclusion

Serial AFP measurement is useful in prognostication and monitoring treatment response in HCC patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy. Incorporation of AFP response into the criteria evaluating treatment outcome should be considered in clinical practice and clinical trials of novel agents in HCC.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline on uses of serum tumor markers in adult males with germ cell tumors [^113pPmSk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide recommendations on appropriate uses for serum markers of germ cell tumors (GCTs).

Methods

Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE identified relevant studies published in English. Primary outcomes included marker accuracy to predict the impact of decisions on outcomes. Secondary outcomes included proportions of patients with elevated markers and statistical tests of elevations as prognostic factors. An expert panel developed consensus guidelines based on data from 82 reports.

Results

No studies directly compared outcomes of decisions with versus without marker assays. The search identified few prospective studies and no randomized controlled trials; most were retrospective series. Lacking data on primary outcomes, most Panel recommendations are based on secondary outcomes (relapse rates and time to relapse).

Recommendations

The Panel recommended against using markers to screen for GCTs, to decide whether orchiectomy is indicated, or to select treatment for patients with cancer of unknown primary. To stage patients with testicular nonseminomas, the Panel recommended measuring three markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) before and after orchiectomy and before chemotherapy for those with extragonadal nonseminomas. They also recommended measuring AFP and hCG shortly before retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and at the start of each chemotherapy cycle for nonseminoma, and periodically to monitor for relapse. The Panel recommended measuring postorchiectomy hCG and LDH for patients with seminoma and preorchiectomy elevations. They recommended against using markers to guide or monitor treatment for seminoma or to detect relapse in those treated for stage I. However, they recommended measuring hCG and AFP to monitor for relapse in patients treated for advanced seminoma.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^115bz12h]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) — interpretation in testicular cancer: Seminomas do not produce AFP; thus, an elevated serum AFP can be diagnostic of a mixed GCT in patients whose histology has been read as pure seminoma, and the diagnosis of a seminoma is restricted to pure seminoma histology and normal serum AFP levels. However, mildly elevated, non-rising levels of AFP do not always indicate the presence of a GCT, and in general AFP levels < 20 ng/mL should not be assumed to be related to a GCT and should not be the sole basis for decisions about treatment. If an elevated serum AFP is due to a metastatic nonseminomatous GCT, then the AFP typically will be steadily rising, and other tumors such as hepatocellular carcinomas and gastric carcinomas can cause AFP elevation.

Low AFP identifies lower risk of rapid progression, as "Patients with T1 HCC whose AFP is < 20 ng/ml appear to have low risk", whereas " > 100 ng/ml" is linked to more rapid growth and progression; patients not eligible for or not needing liver transplantation (LT) "should undergo immediate treatment… in tumors < 2 cm".

### Clinical significance of elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C, but not hepatocellular carcinoma [^116D1Mpp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is often seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), its prevalence, risk factors, and clinical significance remain to be determined.

Aims

The present study assessed the frequency of, the risk factors for, and the clinical significance of elevated AFP in patients with CHC, but not hepatocellular carcinoma.

Methods

This retrospective study utilized systematic chart review and statistical analyses to investigate 357 U.S. patients with CHC from a university medical center and a regional veteran administration medical center.

Results

The prevalence of elevated serum AFP (i.e., ≥ 10.0 microg/L) was 23.0%, including 15.3% (28/183), 24.5% (25/102), and 42.0% (29/69) in patients with chronic hepatitis C and stage 0-II, III, and IV hepatic fibrosis, respectively. After adjusting for age, HCV load, and hepatic steatosis, stage III/IV fibrosis, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and prolonged prothrombin time as measured by international normalized ratio (INR) remained independently associated with elevated serum AFP in these patients. A serum AFP level of 15.0 microg/L was 22.8% sensitive and 94.5% specific for stage III/IV fibrosis.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic hepatitis C, 23.0% had elevated serum AFP that is independently associated with stage III/IV hepatic fibrosis, elevated level of AST, and prolonged INR.

### Alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonography screening for hepatocellular carcinoma [^116AAeKD]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although there is no definitive evidence that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening in high-risk groups improves survival, many physicians screen high-risk populations with various strategies. alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver ultrasonography (US) are the most widely used tools. AFP sensitivity and specificity depend on the cut-off value chosen. In cirrhotic patients, using a cut-off level of 20 ng/mL, sensitivity is only around 60% and positive predictive value ranges from 9% to 50%, depending on HCC prevalence. Sensitivity and specificity are much higher (94.1% and 99.9%, respectively) in hepatitis B carriers, but positive predictive value is only 5%. The performance of US as a screening tool varies widely depending on the experience of the examiner and the technology used. Recent studies generally indicate a 60% sensitivity or higher, a specificity greater than 90%, and a positive predictive value of 70%. The cost effectiveness of screening strategies using AFP, US, or both have been estimated retrospectively or using decision models. In general, HCC screening using both AFP and US appears to be of borderline cost effectiveness or not cost effective at all. Based on the estimated HCC doubling time, the recommended screening interval is 6 months, although a 1-year interval seems as effective. Currently, HCC screening with AFP only is not recommended except when US is either not available or of poor quality. US seems more efficient as a screening tool. Pathology assessment of liver explants in living-donor transplantation programs will provide more precise and reliable information regarding the value of AFP and US as HCC screening tools.

### Prognostic and predictive factors in patients with advanced HCC and elevated alpha-fetoprotein treated with ramucirumab in two randomized phase III trials [^114BP1c5]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a biomarker with proven prognostic and predictive value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). REACH-2 is the first positive phase III study demonstrating improved survival with ramucirumab in AFP high HCC. In this post hoc analysis, we examined prognostic and predictive factors of response to ramucirumab in patients with advanced HCC with AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL from REACH and REACH-2. Ramucirumab provided a survival benefit irrespective of baseline prognostic covariates, including aggressive HCC, and nonviral etiologies. While no baseline factors were found to be predictive of a differential overall survival benefit with ramucirumab in patients with AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, two treatment-emergent (TE) adverse events were associated with a higher ramucirumab survival benefit: TE hypertension and TE ascites. TE hypertension was associated with higher drug exposure, and higher drug exposure was associated with improved overall survival benefit. These results represent a useful tool for clinical decision-making and will help inform the prognosis of patients with advanced HCC and elevated AFP levels.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^117L2c2P]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Testicular cancer — alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) interpretation: AFP is most associated with yolk sac tumors and can be elevated in embryonal carcinoma or teratoma, whereas seminomas do not produce AFP; thus, an elevated serum AFP can be diagnostic of a mixed GCT (nonseminoma), and diagnosis of seminoma is restricted to pure seminoma histology with normal serum AFP levels. Mildly elevated, non-rising AFP does not always indicate a GCT and clinicians should be cautious in interpreting mildly elevated but stable AFP; in general, AFP levels < 20 ng/mL should not be assumed to be related to a GCT in a patient and should not be the sole basis for decisions about treatment. If AFP elevation is due to metastatic nonseminomatous GCT, the AFP typically will be steadily rising, and other tumors such as hepatocellular carcinomas and gastric carcinomas can cause AFP elevation.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^115jpbXN]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — diagnostic imaging and AFP-based follow-up: For a definitely benign observed lesion, patients should return to a screening program with US and AFP in 6 months; if a diagnostic imaging test is suspected to be a false negative, a different imaging method with or without AFP may be considered, and if the observation is inconclusive multidisciplinary discussion and individualized workup may be pursued. Since serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be elevated in nonmalignant conditions or be within normal limits in up to 30% of patients with HCC, the panel considers an imaging finding of classic enhancement to be more definitive in the diagnostic setting compared to AFP alone. Additional imaging studies (CT or MRI) are recommended for patients with a rising serum AFP level in the absence of a liver mass, and if no liver mass is detected after an elevated AFP the patient should be followed with AFP testing and liver imaging.

### Clinical significance of elevated α-fetoprotein in alaskan native patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111MPw2b]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not well defined. We analysed data from a population-based cohort of patients with HCV infection to assess the prevalence of elevated serum AFP, to determine its association with clinical and virologic parameters and with clinical outcomes. We defined a slightly elevated serum AFP level as 8 to < 15 and a high-AFP level as ≥ 15 microg/L. Among 541 HCV-RNA-positive persons, 61 (11%) had a slightly elevated or high AFP at the time of consent. AFP ≥ 8 microg/L was associated with the older age, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio > 1, and higher alkaline phosphatase levels, but not with heavy alcohol use, IV drug use, genotype, viral load or duration of HCV infection. Among 192 persons with an AFP at liver biopsy, 17% had an AFP ≥ 8 microg/L. The sensitivity/specificity of an AFP level ≥ 8 in detecting Ishak 3–6 fibrosis was 39%/95%. Among 372 persons with a minimum of four AFP measurements over 6 years, 5% had persistently elevated AFP > 8 microg/L, 19% had both elevated and normal AFP measurements, and 76% had persistently normal AFP. Elevated AFP at consent was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and end-stage liver disease. Over 6 years of follow-up, persistently elevated AFP was associated with the development of HCC; no person with AFP persistently < 8 microg/mL developed HCC. Serial AFP measurements appear to be useful in identifying persons with advanced fibrosis and help to determine who needs periodic screening with liver ultrasound to detect HCC.

### Mimics of hepatocellular carcinoma: a review and an approach to avoiding histopathological diagnostic missteps [^113J7QU2]. Human Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest carcinomas and leading causes of cancer-related death. Although, in patients with cirrhosis, radiologic diagnosis has improved significantly over the years, needle biopsy and histopathological assessment remains an important diagnostic modality. Most importantly, histopathological diagnosis is essential in patients with contending extrahepatic primaries, those with no known HCC risk factors, patients with ambiguous radiological features, and many other clinical contexts. Helpful features such as high serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serologies are known to be present in many other tumor (including but not only HCC) and nontumor contexts and therefore not only lack sufficient diagnostic specificity for HCC but also create the potential to overlook non-HCC AFP-producing tumors, of which there are many. Therefore, using clinical examples and other examples from the medical literature, this review discusses several clinical and histological mimics of HCC and proffers an approach for practicing pathologists geared toward avoiding missteps.

### Circulating biomarkers for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma [^115hDEk4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Early detection of HCC is critical for a curative approach as tumor cure is only feasible when detected at a small size. Thus, screening for HCC is recommended in those at risk in order to detect early, small tumors. Currently, individuals at risk are advised to undergo ultrasonography of the liver every 6 months with the optional addition of measuring alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in blood. Ultrasound has acceptable sensitivity of 65–80% for HCC detection and has an upper level of specificity of more than 90%. However, tumor size and body habit significantly affect the sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting HCC. Sensitivity ranges from 42% for lesions smaller than 1 cm to 90% for tumors of larger size such as those in advanced stage HCC. Early stage tumors are smaller and thus more difficult to detect, particularly in patients with nodular cirrhotic livers or obesity. Beyond its sensitivity for nodule detection, ultrasound screening represents a rather cumbersome process for patients. Despite the non-invasiveness of the test, patients need to be fasting for the procedure and it demands medical appointment times. In addition, ultrasound is dependent on operator expertise, not always yielding the same level of sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, routine HCC screening by ultrasound is often not implemented properly making patients with HCC more likely to be diagnosed at late stages. – Detection of early stage HCC has a more favorable disease prognosis, because patients are more likely to benefit from tumor resection, liver transplantation, or tumor ablation. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality from HCC there is a clear need for non-invasive, quantifiable biomarkers that identify the early stages of HCC, thereby allowing the implementation of more efficient and cost-effective surveillance strategies. An ideal biomarker for early HCC detection must fulfill certain criteria: it must be specific for HCC, minimally invasive to detect, simple to process, cost-effective, and superior to currently used HCC biomarkers. It must have good detection performance [sensitivity; specificity; area under the receiver operator curve (AUC)] and yield consistent results across genders, different ethnic groups, and underlying liver diseases. Numerous studies have been conducted that evaluate a broad range of novel biomarkers in blood for their ability to detect and predict the early stages of HCC. However, only a few have achieved enough accuracy to be recommended as optional by international societies. – In this review, we will discuss the findings of studies that we believe represent the most advanced biomarkers and report their performance for detecting early stage HCC.

### Heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma: from mechanisms to clinical implications [^112ynTm3]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity impacts the accurate diagnosis of HCC

Despite multiple advanced imaging techniques and blood serum markers have been introduced into clinical practice, accurately diagnosing HCC at an early stage has been a significant challenge. Imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, are commonly used tools for detecting liver lesions, but they often lack sensitivity, especially with small lesions or in the context of liver cirrhosis. Meanwhile, false-positive diagnosis may also occur, leading to unnecessary invasive procedures or undue anxiety for patients. Thus, molecular signatures such as serum and tumor biomarkers that can offer heightened sensitivity and specificity for early and accurate diagnosis of HCC are much desirable diagnostic tools.

A well-known diagnostic biomarker for HCC is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a crucial glycoprotein in fetal development. The serum level of AFP usually ranges around 0–40 ng/mL in healthy adults but can rise to > 400 ng/mL in HCC. AFP is so far the most widely used biomarker for HCC diagnosis. However, it is not the most recommended test for early detection of HCC because of its poor specificity (its elevation has also been reported in other conditions such as liver cirrhosis, gastric cancer, pancreatic and lung cancer) and poor sensitivity (a proportion of HCC patients do not have AFP secretion). The mosaic pattern of AFP expression in HCC stems from the heterogeneity of HCC tissues. Similarly, other markers such as Des-γ-Carboxy Prothrombin (DCP) (also known as prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II, PIVKA-II) cannot accurately diagnose the HCC in patients with vitamin K deficiency, poor nutrition with alcohol abuse, and those using oral anticoagulants. Furthermore, the combination of the commonly used serum markers (e.g. AFP, DCP, and AFP-L3) does not seem to significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of early HCC diagnosis. In a US-based study by Marrero et al. the combination of AFP, DCP, and AFP-L3 could identify 43% of HCC patients who had AFP levels below 10.9 ng/mL but showed a sensitivity of only 60%. Combination of AFP and DCP showed an improved sensitivity but the specificity decreased significantly. These data indicate tumor heterogeneity as a confounding factor for accurate diagnosis.

### Serum levels of preoperative α-fetoprotein and CA19-9 predict survival of hepatic carcinoma patients after liver transplantation [^117Wq4YL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Toward this, the serum level of AFP is the most commonly used biomarker to assist in HCC diagnosis and is used as a screening tool for HCC in patients with chronic liver disease. A previous study showed that a persistently elevated AFP level is a risk factor for HCC development and helps identify high-risk populations. However, AFP lacks specificity in HCC diagnosis because its levels may also be high in patients with liver cirrhosis. A higher cut-off value of AFP may increase its specificity, whereas the sensitivity drops remarkably. Thus, use of the serum AFP level alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of HCC, whereas the AFP level has been demonstrated to have a predictive value for prognosis in patients with liver cancer. In the prognostic scoring system proposed by the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program group (CLIP) on the basis of retrospective evaluation of 435 Italian HCC patients, AFP was used as an important prognostic factor for HCC patients and was included in the CLIP scoring system. It was advised by the recent EASL–EORTC clinical practice guidelines to test the level of AFP for poor prognosis of HCC patients using greater than 400 ng/ml as a predictor. Thus, in the current study, we used the cut-off value of 400 ng/ml and our data further confirm the prognostic value of AFP.

### Alpha-fetoprotein as a potential surrogate biomarker for atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^116dPRMn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

We explored the use of AFP response as a potential surrogate biomarker for the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab + bevacizumab and to inform patient care. After considering the constraints of earlier studies (i.e. limited rationale for the choices of AFP cutoff and timepoint at which AFP response was determined), we chose a two-step approach for this exploratory analysis. First, we analyzed data obtained from atezolizumab + bevacizumab–treated patients in Group A of the phase I GO30140 study to provide supportive rationale for an appropriate AFP response cutoff and timepoint for determining AFP response. We then validated the prognostic value of AFP response in patients receiving atezolizumab + bevacizumab in the phase III IMbrave150 study using the derived, optimized parameters from GO30140.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early-stage testicular cancer: AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^117Nkdoj]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Serum tumor markers — alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) — are emphasized for diagnosis, staging, and management; AFP is elevated in 10–40% of low-stage non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT), choriocarcinoma and seminoma do not produce AFP, patients with pure seminoma and elevated AFP are considered to have NSGCT, and the half-life of AFP is five to seven days; although many laboratories flag AFP > 8 ng/mL as abnormal, some individuals without pathology have levels up to 15 or 25 ng/mL, so treatment decisions based solely on elevated AFP that are stable and < 25 ng/mL are discouraged; hCG is elevated in 10–30% of low-stage NSGCT and 10–15% of seminomas, syncytiotrophoblastic cells are found in 10–15% of seminomas, and the half-life of hCG is 24–36 hours; LDH is the least relevant marker with elevation in approximately 20% of low-stage germ cell tumors, LDH-1 is the most frequently elevated isoenzyme in GCT, and treatment decisions based solely on LDH elevation with normal AFP and hCG should be discouraged.

Physical exam and health history: A physical exam of the body will be done to check a person's health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Alpha-fetoprotein tumor marker test: Tumor markers are released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. An increased level of AFP in the blood may be a sign of liver cancer. Other cancers and certain noncancerous conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, may also increase AFP levels. Sometimes the AFP level is normal even when there is liver cancer. Liver function tests: These blood tests measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher-than-normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver cancer.

CT scan: This procedure uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. Magnetic resonance imaging: This procedure uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the liver. To create detailed pictures of blood vessels in and near the liver, dye is injected into a vein. This procedure is called magnetic resonance angiography. Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase MRI. Ultrasound exam: This procedure uses high-energy sound waves that are bounced off the liver and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of the liver called a sonogram.

Some of the tests and procedures used to diagnose liver cancer, such as CT scan and MRI, may be used in the staging process. A positron emission tomography scan may also be used: PET scan: This procedure is used to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.

Serum tumor marker cautions emphasize interpretation limits for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) in seminoma. Mildly elevated, non-rising AFP levels may not indicate presence of germ cell tumor, and decisions to treat should not be based solely on AFP values < 20 ng/mL; more highly elevated AFP levels generally indicate the presence of nonseminomatous tumor elements. Further workup should be considered before initiating treatment for mildly elevated beta-hCG (generally < 20 IU/L) since other factors, including hypogonadism and cannabis use, can cause false-positive results.

For patients with elevated AFP or hCG post-orchiectomy, clinicians should monitor serum tumor markers to establish nadir levels before treatment only if marker nadir levels would influence treatment (Clinical Principle). For patients with metastatic GCT (Stage IIC or III) requiring chemotherapy, clinicians must base chemotherapy regimen and number of cycles on the IGCCCG risk stratification, with IGCCCG risk stratification based on nadir serum tumor marker (hCG, AFP and LDH) levels obtained prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, staging imaging studies, and tumor histology following radical orchiectomy (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Any post-pubertal male, regardless of age, should be treated according to adult treatment guidelines (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For patients in whom serum tumor marker (AFP and hCG) levels are borderline elevated (within 3x upper limit of normal) post-orchiectomy, a rising trend should be confirmed before management decisions are made as false-positive elevations may occur (Clinical Principle).

### Determinants of serum α-fetoprotein levels in hepatitis C-infected patients [^113xEmy9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Little information is available about what factors determine serum levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (eg, demographic, virologic, or clinical features) among individuals who do not develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This information might improve AFP-based algorithms for HCC detection.

Methods

We examined data from patients in the national Veterans' Affairs Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Clinical Case Registry who received at least 1 AFP test (258,275 AFP tests in 76,357 patients; 1.9% developed HCC). We constructed hierarchical multivariate models of AFP levels. Potential predictors of AFP values included patients' sex, race, cirrhosis status, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, HCV genotype, level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) within 30 days before the AFP test, time to diagnosis of HCC, and time elapsed from the HCV index date.

Results

Significant determinants for increased levels of AFP included presence of cirrhosis, higher MELD scores, and increased levels of ALT. AFP levels were also affected by the interaction between ALT levels and the presence and time to development of HCC. Among patients who did not have HCC, the AFP level increased with the level of ALT; the AFP values in the presence of ALT 37–56 U/L, ALT 57–92 U/L, or ALT > 92 U/L were 16%, 35%, and 68% higher, respectively, than AFP values at ALT 0–36 U/L. However, patients who developed HCC within 30 days of receiving the AFP test had a lower rate of increase in AFP with each higher category of ALT level, with increases of 31%, 39%, and 37% for the same respective ALT categories.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic HCV infection, AFP and ALT values correlate; however, among patients with HCC, levels of AFP increase disproportionately to or unaccompanied by increases in levels of ALT. The prognostic and diagnostic value of AFP levels might be increased by adjusting for ALT values.

### Serum tumor markers [^115u7mf9]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies are used to detect serum antigens associated with specific malignancies. These tumor markers are most useful for monitoring response to therapy and detecting early relapse. With the exception of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor markers do not have sufficient sensitivity or specificity for use in screening. Cancer antigen (CA) 27.29 most frequently is used to follow response to therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen is used to detect relapse of colorectal cancer, and CA 19–9 may be helpful in establishing the nature of pancreatic masses. CA 125 is useful for evaluating pelvic masses in postmenopausal women, monitoring response to therapy in women with ovarian cancer, and detecting recurrence of this malignancy. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, sometimes is used to screen highly selected populations and to assess hepatic masses in patients at particular risk for developing hepatic malignancy. Testing for the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) is an integral part of the diagnosis and management of gestational trophoblastic disease. Combined AFP and beta-hCG testing is an essential adjunct in the evaluation and treatment of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, and in monitoring the response to therapy. AFP and beta-hCG also may be useful in evaluating potential origins of poorly differentiated metastatic cancer. PSA is used to screen for prostate cancer, detect recurrence of the malignancy, and evaluate specific syndromes of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.

### Reappraisal of the diagnostic value of α-fetoprotein for surveillance of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in the era of antiviral therapy [^115Wd6E1]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. 1, 2 Though some advances in therapeutic interventions for HCC have been made in the past decade, the 5‐year overall survival of patients with HCC remains as low as 15%‐17%, largely because more than two thirds of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of disease and lose the opportunity for curative therapies. 3, 4, 5 Hence, the diagnosis of HCC at an early stage through HCC surveillance is crucial in patients who are at high‐risk and deemed to be an effective way to obtain a reduction in HCC‐related mortality. 2, 6, 7

Serum AFP has been the most widely used biomarker for the diagnosis and surveillance of HCC. However, the clinical application of AFP has been challenged in recent years, due to its low sensitivity and non‐specificity. 8, 9, 10 Serum AFP levels might not be elevated in at least one third of HCC patients but could be elevated in patients with active chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis but free of HCC. 8, 11 Such elevation in chronic liver disease is found to be associated with hepatic regeneration induced by massive liver damage including severe inflammation, fibrosis and bridging hepatic necrosis. 12, 13, 14 In addition, our previous work revealed that HBV viral transcription co‐regulator HBx could transcriptionally upregulate AFP gene expression. 15 Several reports have suggested that such 'falsely' increased serum levels of AFP in patients with active viral hepatitis were dramatically decreased after initiation of antiviral therapy, 13, 16, 17 and antiviral treatment could improve the diagnostic accuracy of AFP for HCC among patients with chronic HBV infection. 13, 18 Though all these studies indicate the potential influence of antiviral therapy on AFP's performance for the detection of HCC among the high‐risk chronic HBV‐infected patients, the relatively small number of HCC patients in these studies might have limited the precise assessment for AFP.

In this multi‐centre, cross‐sectional real‐world study, the performance of AFP for the surveillance/diagnosis of HCC among patients with CHB and liver cirrhosis (LC) who underwent antiviral treatment was reexamined, in comparison with treatment‐naïve patients. Finally, better cut‐off values of AFP as surveillance and confirmatory tests for HCC among patients with antiviral treatment were investigated and validated.

2.3 Laboratory testing of AFP and other variables

Alpha‐fetoprotein levels were measured in local laboratories at each of the four clinical centres by using an automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics). The upper limit of normal (ULN) ranges for AFP values among these centres varied between 8.1 and 13.4 ng/mL. The lower limit was all the same at 0 ng/mL, and the upper limit of detection was 1210 ng/mL. The cut‐off values of 20 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL were analysed to elucidate the clinical utility of AFP. The investigations for HCC are currently recommended with a value of AFP above 20 ng/mL. The values 200 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL are frequently used as confirmatory tests for HCC diagnosis, which are a necessary supplement to imaging to determine the presence of focal solid lesions in the liver. 21, 24, 25, 26

Liver‐related biochemical testing, routine blood testing and other tests were determined in local laboratories of each centre using commercially available kits.

All clinical and laboratory data from patients were collected following the same criteria above. Individual unusual values were reviewed to verify the accuracy of data.

This study was approved by the ethics committee of Peking University Health Science Center. All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Gastric cancers that secrete alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) are a rare but well defined entity. These tumours tend to be aggressive with a poor prognosis. Recognition and identification of this group of patients is important in influencing prognosis, treatment options and further clinical research into this entity. We report three cases of gastric cancers associated with elevated AFP. This entity should be considered in patients with hepatic lesions and an elevated AFP without risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma or in patients with associated gastric symptoms.

### Abdominal ultrasound and α-foetoprotein for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease [^114UgRi7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease and ranks sixth in terms of global instances of cancer, and fourth in terms of cancer deaths for men. Despite that abdominal ultrasound (US) is used as an initial test to exclude the presence of focal liver lesions and serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) measurement may raise suspicion of HCC occurrence, further testing to confirm diagnosis as well as staging of HCC is required. Current guidelines recommend surveillance programme using US, with or without AFP, to detect HCC in high-risk populations despite the lack of clear benefits on overall survival. Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of US and AFP may clarify whether the absence of benefit in surveillance programmes could be related to under-diagnosis. Therefore, assessment of the accuracy of these two tests for diagnosing HCC in people with chronic liver disease, not included in surveillance programmes, is needed.

Objectives

Primary: the diagnostic accuracy of US and AFP, alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of HCC of any size and at any stage in adults with chronic liver disease, either in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. Secondary: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal US and AFP, alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of resectable HCC; to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the individual tests versus the combination of both tests; to investigate sources of heterogeneity in the results.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Diagnostic-Test-Accuracy Studies Register, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, until 5 June 2020. We applied no language or document-type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of US and AFP, independently or in combination, for the diagnosis of HCC in adults with chronic liver disease, with cross-sectional and case-control designs, using one of the acceptable reference standards, such as pathology of the explanted liver, histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion, or typical characteristics on computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, all with a six-months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns, using the QUADAS-2 checklist. We presented the results of sensitivity and specificity, using paired forest-plots, and tabulated the results. We used a hierarchical meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We double-checked all data extractions and analyses.

Main Results

We included 373 studies. The index-test was AFP (326 studies, 144,570 participants); US (39 studies, 18,792 participants); and a combination of AFP and US (eight studies, 5454 participants). We judged at high-risk of bias all but one study. Most studies used different reference standards, often inappropriate to exclude the presence of the target condition, and the time-interval between the index test and the reference standard was rarely defined. Most studies with AFP had a case-control design. We also had major concerns for the applicability due to the characteristics of the participants. As the primary studies with AFP used different cut-offs, we performed a meta-analysis using the hierarchical-summary-receiver-operating-characteristic model, then we carried out two meta-analyses including only studies reporting the most used cut-offs: around 20 ng/mL or 200 ng/mL. AFP cut-off 20 ng/mL: for HCC (147 studies) sensitivity 60% (95% CI 58% to 62%), specificity 84% (95% CI 82% to 86%); for resectable HCC (six studies) sensitivity 65% (95% CI 62% to 68%), specificity 80% (95% CI 59% to 91%). AFP cut-off 200 ng/mL: for HCC (56 studies) sensitivity 36% (95% CI 31% to 41%), specificity 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%); for resectable HCC (two studies) one with sensitivity 4% (95% CI 0% to 19%), specificity 100% (95% CI 96% to 100%), and one with sensitivity 8% (95% CI 3% to 18%), specificity 100% (95% CI 97% to 100%). US: for HCC (39 studies) sensitivity 72% (95% CI 63% to 79%), specificity 94% (95% CI 91% to 96%); for resectable HCC (seven studies) sensitivity 53% (95% CI 38% to 67%), specificity 96% (95% CI 94% to 97%). Combination of AFP (cut-off of 20 ng/mL) and US: for HCC (six studies) sensitivity 96% (95% CI 88% to 98%), specificity 85% (95% CI 73% to 93%); for resectable HCC (two studies) one with sensitivity 89% (95% CI 73% to 97%), specificity of 83% (95% CI 76% to 88%), and one with sensitivity 79% (95% CI 54% to 94%), specificity 87% (95% CI 79% to 94%). The observed heterogeneity in the results remains mostly unexplained, and only in part referable to different cut-offs or settings (surveillance programme compared to clinical series). The sensitivity analyses, excluding studies published as abstracts, or with case-control design, showed no variation in the results. We compared the accuracy obtained from studies with AFP (cut-off around 20 ng/mL) and US: a direct comparison in 11 studies (6674 participants) showed a higher sensitivity of US (81%, 95% CI 66% to 90%) versus AFP (64%, 95% CI 56% to 71%) with similar specificity: US 92% (95% CI 83% to 97%) versus AFP 89% (95% CI 79% to 94%). A direct comparison of six studies (5044 participants) showed a higher sensitivity (96%, 95% CI 88% to 98%) of the combination of AFP and US versus US (76%, 95% CI 56% to 89%) with similar specificity: AFP and US 85% (95% CI 73% to 92%) versus US 93% (95% CI 80% to 98%).

Authors' Conclusions

In the clinical pathway for the diagnosis of HCC in adults, AFP and US, singularly or in combination, have the role of triage-tests. We found that using AFP, with 20 ng/mL as a cut-off, about 40% of HCC occurrences would be missed, and with US alone, more than a quarter. The combination of the two tests showed the highest sensitivity and less than 5% of HCC occurrences would be missed with about 15% of false-positive results. The uncertainty resulting from the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies limit our ability to confidently draw conclusions based on our results.

### Test characteristics of α-fetoprotein for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis C. A systematic review and critical analysis [^111Ht6jG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Although serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is often used to detect hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV-infected individuals, its utility is unclear.

Purpose

To define the test characteristics of AFP for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with HCV.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search from 1966 to December 2002 for English- and non-English-language articles examining the test characteristics of AFP for identifying hepatocellular carcinoma.

Study Selection

Articles were included if they reported the sensitivity and specificity of AFP for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with HCV. Articles were excluded if the cause of hepatitis was ambiguous or if 50% or more of the study patients did not have HCV.

Data Extraction

Relevant articles were evaluated for quality of evidence; test characteristics were abstracted and calculated.

Data Synthesis

Five studies met all inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The overall quality of evidence was limited; only one study universally applied an acceptable gold standard test, and three of five studies used a case-control design that potentially overestimates diagnostic accuracy. By using the most commonly reported cutoff value of a positive test result for hepatocellular carcinoma (AFP level > 20 microg/L), the ranges of test characteristics were as follows: sensitivity, 41% to 65%; specificity, 80% to 94%; positive likelihood ratios, 3.1 to 6.8; and negative likelihood ratios, 0.4 to 0.6.

Conclusions

The paucity of high-quality data calls for more rigorous study of AFP and other diagnostic tests for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV-infected patients with an accepted gold standard applied to the entire cohort. Even if the "best-case" estimates of AFP sensitivity and specificity are accurate, AFP has limited utility for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma.

### A comparison of clinical pathologic characteristics between α-fetoprotein negative and positive hepatocellular carcinoma patients from Eastern and Southern China [^114Fn3rU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AFP is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal life. AFP expression in adults is often associated with hepatoma or teratoma.

The underlying mechanism of AFP expression status in HCC and its role in the development and prognosis is still unclear; promoter polymorphism or silencing of AFP gene is believed to be the major reason. Understanding the clinical pathologic characteristics of liver cancer patients with low and high serum AFP could be helpful for clinical management and prognostication of this deadly disease.

Serum AFP status among patient groups

In this observation, we found that serum AFP levels in HCC patients were significantly higher than in chronic hepatitis B, decompensated hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatitis B virus asymptomatic carrier patients. This further indicates that tumor cells secret AFP into the serum, the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Cellular membrane damage and/or eruption of tumor cells are believed to involved in the pathogenesis. One study mentioned that HCC patients with negative AFP tended to be older males with less HBV infection, more non-viral etiology, and less cirrhosis. Table 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S2 A indicate a trend from high to low in median AFP levels of different patient groups, consistent with this report.

High serum AFP level was associated with unfavorable prognostic factors

We also found that patients with larger tumors, hepatic cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, metastasis, and massive hepatocellular carcinomas had higher serum AFP levels. These suggest that patients with higher serum AFP levels tend to have poor clinical outcome. It is also possible that higher burden of disease exists in these patients accounting for the increased AFP levels.

Association of serum AFP levels between Child–Pugh score, BCLC stage, and clinical stage

Serum AFP levels were significantly higher in patients with high Child–Pugh score, high BCLC stage, and advanced clinical stage. Lim et al. reported that AFP levels and Child–Pugh scores were associated with brain metastasis in HCC patients. Liu et al. reported that based on BCLC staging, serum AFP response was correlated with the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization in HCC patients. Incorporation of serum AFP into the BCLC staging system was helpful in predicting the outcome of HCC patients, and AFP positive was an independent poor prognostic factor. Gomaa et al. found that the addition of AFP and ascites to the BCLC staging system improved the prognostic prediction for early and intermediate stages of liver cancer patients.

### Alpha-fetoprotein level as a biomarker of liver fibrosis status: a cross-sectional study of 619 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B [^115rx37C]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we showed the subclinical significance of serum AFP levels by analyzing the association between serum AFP and different stages of inflammation and fibrosis. We showed that increasing levels of inflammation and fibrosis in CHB patients were associated with increased serum AFP levels. However, there is no single laboratory parameter that can currently independently predict the prognosis of liver pathology accurately, and an important future goal will be to develop a predictive mathematical model using a combination of different biomarkers.

### Deciphering the role of KLRB1: a novel prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma [^1158fLKV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma poses a grave health concern in contemporary society, exhibiting notably high incidence and mortality rates worldwide. Despite ranking sixth among the most prevalent malignancies globally, it claims the third position in terms of mortality rates, trailing only behind lung and gastric cancers, highlighting its lethal nature. While therapeutic approaches and medications for hepatocellular carcinoma have shown gradual progress and development in recent years, the recurrence rate remains stubbornly high. Even accepting proper treatment, approximately 20% of patients experience either local recurrence or distant metastasis. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a classic hepatocellular carcinoma-specific diagnostic and prognostic marker, still presents limitations. Some patients face recurrence and metastasis despite having negative AFP levels. Consequently, identifying suitable prognostic markers for early HCC screening remains the most pressing clinical challenge.

The tumor microenvironment is a crucial factor influencing the onset and progression of tumors. It consists of various infiltrating cells, including immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and a diverse array of extracellular matrix components such as cytokines and chemokines, collectively shaping a complex tumor microecological environment. Studies have highlighted the significance of T cells and NK cells within tumor tissues as pivotal in inhibiting tumor growth. CD8 + T cells and NK cells are capable of directly identifying and eliminating tumors, while CD4 + T cells contribute indirectly by producing cytokines like interferon-gamma(IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-a), thus participating in anti-tumor immune responses. However, in the context of HCC, tumor cells can employ various strategies to evade immune attacks, including suppressing T cell activity, diminishing NK cell function, and inducing an increase in immunosuppressive cells. Consequently, this promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Hence, investigating the roles and interplay of T cells and NK cells within the HCC tumor microenvironment holds promise in developing novel molecular markers and immunotherapy strategies aimed at enhancing treatment outcomes for patients with HCC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — assessment and supportive care recommendations specify that for advanced stages of HCC treated with systemic therapies, the panel recommends periodic response assessment with cross-sectional imaging of sites at risk for metastatic progression, including chest, multiphase abdomen, and pelvis. In patients with an elevated AFP tumor marker at start of therapy, AFP changes on treatment have shown association with treatment response and survival. The panel recommends that best supportive care measures be administered to patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, alongside cancer-directed therapies.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance: evidence-based tailored approach [^115a3vKE]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is recommended by professional society guidelines given a consistent association with reduced HCC-related mortality. HCC surveillance should be performed using semiannual abdominal ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein, although this combination has suboptimal sensitivity and can miss more than one-third of HCC at an early stage. There are promising emerging blood-based and imaging-based strategies, including abbreviated MRI and biomarker panels; however, these require further validation before routine use in clinical practice. HCC surveillance is underused in clinical practice due to patient-related and provider-related barriers, highlighting a need for interventions to improve surveillance utilization in clinical practice.

### Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of heat shock proteins and their combination with alpha-fetoprotein in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis [^115ts4ze]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our meta-analysis indicates that HSPs serve as accurate biomarkers suitable for clinical use in the diagnosis of HCC, and the combination of HSPs and AFP significantly enhances diagnostic value compared to HSPs or AFP alone. However, further research studies characterized by rigorous methodology, substantial sample sizes, and collaboration across multiple centers are imperative to gather more conclusive evidence regarding the diagnostic utility of HSPs and the combined use of HSPs and AFP in the early detection of HCC.

### New frontiers in biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma [^115kAUdR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma represents the fifth most frequent cancer in the world; it commonly occurs on cirrhotic liver. Prognosis and survival are still poor, mainly because of diagnosis at a late stage and/or recurrence of the disease. For this reason, surveillance strategies are widely used to screen for early occurrence of cancer in populations at risk. Alpha-foetoprotein is so far the only serological marker available, but its diagnostic accuracy is unsatisfactory because of low sensitivity despite reliable specificity. For this reason, new biomarkers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma are in strong demand by clinicians. In this review, we will focus on new biomarkers currently under investigation, but also on still newer, very promising biomarkers that seem to significantly improve diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early-stage testicular cancer: AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^113y1r4K]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Testicular cancer — post-orchiectomy tumor marker monitoring states that for patients with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) post-orchiectomy, clinicians should monitor serum tumor markers to establish nadir levels before treatment only if marker nadir levels would influence treatment (Clinical Principle). Elevated post-orchiectomy serum tumor markers generally indicate systemic disease and the need for subsequent treatment, and in patients with declining serum tumor markers post-orchiectomy, staging and treatment decisions are made after adequate time has elapsed to allow for markers to normalize according to their half-life (hCG: 24–36 hours; AFP: 5–7 days).

### Prognostic significance of α-fetoprotein status in the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment of transarterial chemoembolization [^112SyLiQ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been used as a diagnostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its prognostic significance is not well defined. This study was performed to classify the prognostic significance of AFP status in HCC patients after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

Methods

Four hundred forty-one HCC patients from a prospective maintained database with pathologic confirmation including 139 with normal AFP levels and 302 with elevated AFP levels were retrospectively studied for prognostic significance of AFP in treatment response and survival after TACE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic factors.

Results

There were significant differences in overall survival (OS) after TACE between AFP-negative and AFP-positive HCC patients when the AFP cutoff value was defined as 20 ng/ml (P < 0.0001). Among the AFP-positive patients, different AFP levels had no significantly prognostic effects on OS after TACE (P = 0.093). Multivariate analysis revealed that AFP status for AFP-negative or positive was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients after TACE (P = 0.001), along with γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level (P = 0.004) and tumor diameter (P < 0.0001). In addition, there were significant differences in clinicopathologic features between AFP-positive and AFP-negative patients with regard to age, gender, alanine transferase level, GGT level, tumor diameter, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage.

Conclusions

Compared with AFP-positive HCC patients, patients with AFP-negative status have a better treatment response and prognosis after TACE.

### Emphasis on the clinical relationship between α-fetoprotein and hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach: a retrospective study [^116P7yuR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with HAS have elevated serum AFP, and the higher the serum AFP, the more likely liver metastasis will occur. However, the prognosis of HAS is not necessarily poor. High-AFP (> 300 ng/ml) was significantly associated with poorer OS in HAS, so physicians should monitor serum AFP in clinical practice. Early pTNM staging and surgical resection can improve the prognosis of patients with HAS.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1139HxXb]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

HCC screening modalities — alpha‑fetoprotein (AFP) thresholds and ultrasound (US) performance: A review reported that an AFP cut‑off value of 100 ng/mL had high specificity (99%) but low sensitivity (31%); in a Chinese screening study using an AFP cut‑off of > 20 ng/mL, detection rate/false‑positive rate/positive predictive value were 69%/5.0%/3.3% for AFP alone, 84%/2.9%/6.6% for US alone, and 92%/7.5%/3.0% for the combination, and these results demonstrate that US combined with AFP is a better modality for HCC screening than AFP testing alone; a study of 333 patients with HCC and HBV/HCV found that diagnosis after surveillance with US and AFP was associated with significantly longer overall survival (OS) and disease‑free survival (DFS) compared with no surveillance, and because US is highly operator dependent the addition of AFP may increase HCC detection, although AFP is frequently normal in early‑stage disease and its utility as a screening biomarker is limited.

### A new approach to the use of α-fetoprotein as surveillance test for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis [^116jcNZm]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, HCC surveillance with US performed by properly trained operators remains the ideal solution, having a high sensitivity and an excellent specificity. Moreover, US has an unavoidable advantage over AFP: as the cancer grows, US sensitivity improves so that a false negative result may be corrected by the subsequent examination, a paradigm not so pertinent to AFP. However, for many national health-care systems it is impossible to realise the ideal solution because of the saturation of resources that it would require.

We therefore proposed a method to optimise the sensitivity of AFP in stable cirrhotic patients and limiting the access to US performed in specialised institutions, without paying an unacceptable price in terms of both missed tumour and cancer stage at diagnosis. In fact, CAI was obtained and validated in a population where more than 80% of patients had a very early/early stage HCC. Future studies should prospectively evaluate the use of AFP monitoring in combination with US performed by experts to make HCC surveillance more cost-effective and sustainable by many national health systems, until better tools become available.

### When is a seminoma not a seminoma? The incidence, risk factors and management of patients with testicular seminoma with discordant elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein [^113fruh5]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the incidence, clinical and demographic factors, and treatment patterns associated with discordant elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) findings in patients with pure seminomatous histology.

Methods

We queried the National Cancer Database to identify patients with testicular germ cell tumors (GCT) diagnosed in 2011–2015. Patients were grouped based on histologic diagnosis and pre-operative serum AFP level.

Results

Of 18,616 patients diagnosed with testicular GCT, 53% (N = 9,849) had pure seminomatous histology, of whom 8.3% (N = 821) had an elevated serum AFP pre-operatively. Non-white patients with seminoma were more likely to have a pre-op elevated AFP (OR 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10–1.83); patients treated at higher volume centers were less likely to have a pre-op elevated AFP (0.66, 95% CI: 0.53–0.83). Patients with seminoma with elevated AFP received adjuvant radiation more frequently than those with NSGCT (Stage I: 15% vs 0.2%, P < .01; Stage II: 21.9% vs 0.1%, P < .01) and less frequently underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) (Stage 1: 1.9% vs 11.1% P < .01; Stage II: 8.8% vs 17.4%, P < .01).

Conclusion

The detection of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with pure seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (GCT) is a discordant finding that implies the presence of occult non-seminomatous GCT (NSGCT) elements. 8% of patients with pure seminomatous GCTs had diagnostically discordant elevated pre-operative AFP levels. Despite recommendations to manage these patients as NSGCT, patients with seminoma and elevated AFP were managed in a fashion comparable to those with seminoma and normal AFP levels.

### Serum α-fetoprotein for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic liver disease: influence of HBsAg and anti-HCV status [^112Qe6m3]. Journal of Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

It is not established whether virological status affects the efficiency of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) marker among patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).

Methods

We enrolled in a case-control study 170 HCC and 170 CLD patients, matched for age, sex, CLD and HBsAg/anti-HCV status. The AFP sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. PPV and NPV were evaluated for three additional HCC prevalences (5, 10, and 20%).

Results

The best discriminating AFP value was 16 ng/ml. A value of 20 ng/ml (above which investigations for HCC are recommended) had equivalent sensitivity (60.0 vs. 62.4%) and specificity (90.6 vs. 89.4%). PPV of 20 ng/ml was 84.6% but decreased to 25.1% at 5% tumor prevalence. NPV was 69.4% and rose to 97.7% at 5% prevalence. In the different groups of infected patients PPV ranged from 80.0 to 90.9%, falling to 17.4–34.5% at 5% prevalence. In noninfected patients PPV was 100% at any HCC prevalence. NPV ranged from 59.0 to 73.0%, reaching 96.5–98.1% at 5% prevalence.

Conclusions

In CLD patients, AFP monitoring misses many HCCs and inappropriately arouses suspicion of malignancy in many patients. Its usefulness is barely affected by the infection responsible for CLD. An AFP elevation could be more indicative of HCC in non-infected patients.

### A new approach to the use of α-fetoprotein as surveillance test for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis [^114PuSWZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

It should be pointed out that in our study about three-quarters of the HCC cases in which US was not diagnostic showed a positive CAI. Monitoring of serum AFP has several advantages, being an easy and cheap test for which well-standardised methods with an intra-assay variability < 4% are available, as that utilised in our study. Therefore, in patients with 'normal' AFP levels (≤ 10 ng mL −1), even small increases during monitoring deserve attention, because they may reflect a biological rather than a methodological variation and this new concept could change the general opinion that many HCCs 'do not produce' AFP. In fact, despite a 'normal' AFP value, increasing levels over the previous 6 months should raise the suspicion of HCC occurrence. Thus, CAI overcame the drawback of a poor sensitivity of AFP measurement alone, reaching a figure of 80%. Moreover, its NPV approached 100% at the 3–5% cancer prevalence observable in clinical practice.

Another disadvantage of AFP monitoring relies on the fact that several extra-tumoral factors can affect its levels, reducing the specificity and remarkably increasing the cost of surveillance. In this respect, we did not observe any significant correlation between alanine aminotransferase and AFP values either in HCC cases or controls. This finding is not surprising in HCC patients in whom the AFP levels primarily depend on the tumour, but conflicts with what was reported by a case registry analysis regarding HCV patients. A possible explanation lies in the differences in stage of liver disease, degree of necroinflammation and etiology of the two cohorts. Nonetheless, in our study, the specificity of AFP was only 62%, and its use as an initial test could increase the cost of surveillance due to false positive results. Having this in mind, using a simulation model we compared the cost of standard US surveillance (with US performed at primary health-care institutions) vs CAI followed by US performed in specialised liver centers. The comparison indicated that the second strategy led to a 43% reduction of total direct costs for each HCC detected, paying the clinical price of one HCC per year lost for every 1000 surveyed patients. The sparing effect of the CAI strategy suggests that the over-cost produced by false positive results of AFP was overcompensated by the reduced use of US.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^112PrsNv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 testicular cancer — tumor marker interpretation updates: Mildly elevated, non-rising alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels may not indicate the presence of germ cell tumor, and decisions to treat should not be based solely on AFP values < 20 ng/mL. More highly elevated AFP levels generally indicate the presence of nonseminomatous tumor elements. Further workup should be considered before initiating treatment for mildly elevated beta-hCG (generally < 20 IU/L) since other factors, including hypogonadism and marijuana cannabis use, can cause false-positive results. CT/MRI recommendations updated throughout the guidelines as appropriate.

### Alpha-fetoprotein as a potential surrogate biomarker for atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114hrdw4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose:

Atezolizumab + bevacizumab is the new standard of care for systemic treatment-naïve, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This exploratory study investigated on-treatment alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response as a potential surrogate biomarker of prognosis for the combination therapy.

Experimental Design:

Data from Group A of the phase Ib GO30140 study were used to identify the optimal time for AFP measurement and AFP cutoffs to differentiate patients by their best confirmed response per independent review facility–assessed RECIST (IRF-RECIST) version 1.1: responders from nonresponders and patients with disease control from primary progressors. We applied these cutoffs to independent data from the atezolizumab + bevacizumab arm of the phase III IMbrave150 trial to distinguish patients based on (i) overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per IRF-RECIST 1.1 and (ii) best confirmed response per IRF-RECIST 1.1.

Results:

We derived AFP cutoffs of ≥ 75% decrease and ≤ 10% increase from baseline at 6 weeks to identify responders and those who had disease control, respectively. These cutoffs had high sensitivity and specificity in GO30140. In IMbrave150 patients, sensitivity was 0.59 and specificity was 0.86 for the ≥ 75% decrease AFP cutoff; the sensitivity was 0.77 and specificity was 0.44 for the ≤ 10% increase AFP cutoff. Both AFP cutoffs were associated with longer OS and PFS, particularly in patients with hepatitis B virus etiology (HR < 0.5; P < 0.01).

Conclusions:

AFP response at 6 weeks after initiating treatment is a potential surrogate biomarker of prognosis for patients with HCC receiving atezolizumab + bevacizumab.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1161NAWA]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma screening and surveillance — at-risk populations and testing intervals are defined as follows: the panel recommends screening with US and AFP testing (every 6 months) for patients with established risk factors for HCC, and additional imaging (abdominal multiphasic CT or MRI) is recommended in the setting of a rising serum AFP or following identification of a liver mass nodule ≥ 10 mm on US, based on AASLD and LI-RADS guidelines. Reported sensitivity for detection of HCC, compared to US alone, is 97% vs. 78%; respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93. A progressive elevation rate of ≥ 7 ng/mL per month may be more useful as a diagnostic tool for HCC, relative to use of a fixed cut point such as 200 ng/mL. Liver masses < 10 mm are difficult to definitively characterize through imaging, and if nodules of this size are found, then US and AFP testing should be repeated in 3 to 6 months. At-risk populations include patients with liver cirrhosis induced by viral (hepatitis B and C) as well as non-viral causes of cirrhosis, and hepatitis B carriers without cirrhosis; patients with viral hepatitis who have had a complete or sustained viral response should continue with screening despite that response.

### Undulant course of AFP: a sign of tumor activation or not? [^116JFWgD]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the predictive value of undulant alpha fetoprotein (AFP) course in recurrence of germ cell tumors (GCT).

Patients/Method

A retrospective file search of 491 patients with GCT was performed and 18 patients who had an undulant course of AFP levels (increased and spontaneously decreased) without any demonstrable tumor on radiological images were selected for the study.

Results

The median age of the 10 boys and 8 girls was 2 years (1.1–16 years). All the patients were disease-free for a median of 16.2 months (8.4–132 months). At follow-up, radiologically proven tumor recurrences were diagnosed in 8 patients in median 12.2 ± 3.2 months from the initial diagnosis (8.4–18.2 months) and 7.4 ± 2.2 months from the last normal level of AFP (5.0–11.2 months). The mean peak AFP values within the first 90 days were 24 ± 38.1 ng/mL and 11.1 ± 10.9 ng/mL in patients who did and did not have recurrent disease, respectively (p = .0051). The patients whose AFP levels were higher than 10 ng/mL were likely to have recurrent disease (p = .02).

Conclusion

Without a demonstrable tumor, the small amplitude undulations may only require careful follow-up. However, it should be kept in mind that despite the decrease in AFP levels, there still might be a risk of recurrence, especially in patients who have greater amplitude undulations.

### A comparison of clinical pathologic characteristics between α-fetoprotein negative and positive hepatocellular carcinoma patients from Eastern and Southern China [^112P4vW1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a biomarker used in clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, approximately 40% of HCC patients do not present with elevated serum AFP levels. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and pathologic characteristics between AFP positive and negative HCC patients to allow for improved clinical management and prognostication of the disease.

Methods

This study observed a cohort of HCC patients from Eastern and Southern China with comparisons of the clinical and pathologic features between serum AFP positive and negative patient groups; patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis, those with chronic hepatitis B, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) asymptomatic carrier patients were used as controls. Data included the laboratory results, pathology diagnosis, clinical staging and scores were obtained from routine clinical diagnostic methods.

Results

Patients with HCC, larger tumor sizes, liver cancer with hepatic cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, metastasis, high Child–Pugh score, high Barcelona-Clínic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, and advanced clinical stage had significantly higher serum AFP levels. Also, patients with HBsAg and HBeAg positive, high HBV DNA levels had significantly higher serum AFP levels. Patients with high serum AFP levels had higher protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alpha-l-fucosidase (AFU), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), γ-GT /ALT, direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IDBIL), fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels. Patients with AFP positive had higher white blood cells (WBC), neutrophil, monocyte, and platelet count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

Conclusions

The are significant differences in clinical pathologic characteristics between AFP positive and negative HCC patients which may be helpful for the management and prognostication of the disease.

### Improving screening for hepatocellular carcinoma by incorporating data on levels of α-fetoprotein, over time [^113tPyUm]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Current screening algorithms for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) view each testing interval independently, without considering prior test results. We investigated whether measurements of α-fetoprotein (AFP), over time, can be used to identify patients most likely to develop HCC.

Methods

We performed a nested case-control study using data from subjects in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis trial; 82 patients with HCC were matched 1:3 to individuals without HCC (controls), using bootstrap methods to ensure similar follow-up times between groups. We assessed the independent association between development of HCC and the following: (1) most recent level of AFP, (2) standard deviation in level of AFP, and (3) rate of increase in AFP using a multiple logistic regression that included patient-specific risk factors such as age, platelet count, and smoking status.

Results

In bivariable analysis, all 3 AFP metrics were associated with HCC development; the most strongly associated was the standard deviation of AFP (odds ratio, 1.03 per unit increase in standard deviation; P < .001). Incorporating the standard deviation of AFP and rate of AFP increase, along with patient-specific risk factors, improved the prognostic accuracy to an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.81, compared with 0.76 when only the most recent AFP level was used.

Conclusions

Patterns of AFP test results can more accurately identify patients with hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis most likely to develop HCC, compared with most recent AFP test results.

### Tumour markers and their utility in imaging of abdominal and pelvic malignancies [^114eiw7p]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The utility of tumour biomarkers has increased considerably in the era of personalised medicine and individualised therapy in oncology. Biomarkers may be prognostic or predictive, and only a handful of markers are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for clinical use. Tumour markers have a wide array of uses such as screening, establishing a differential diagnosis, assessing risk, prognosis, and treatment response, as well as monitoring disease status. Major overlap exists between biomarkers and their associated pathologies; therefore, despite suggestive imaging features, establishing a differential diagnosis may be challenging for the radiologist. We review common biomarkers that are of interest to radiologists such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and carbohydrate or cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), as well as their associated malignant and non-malignant pathologies. We also present relevant case examples from our practice.

### Evaluation of the aMAP score for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance: a realistic opportunity to risk stratify [^112CveWQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Potentially curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rely on early diagnosis. To achieve this outcome regular, typically six-monthly, ultrasound (US) examinations of patients with hepatic cirrhosis is recommended, with or without the tumour marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). However, uptake into surveillance programmes has been poor particularly across the western world where only 20–40% of patients developing HCC have been detected within a surveillance programme and early diagnosis remains uncommon. The barriers to effective implementation have been clearly identified and one of these is that not all clinical or funding agencies have been convinced of the value of surveillance since there has been no acceptable controlled study. Harms have been identified, not least of which has been the anxiety engendered by regular scans, each of which may reveal a potentially lethal cancer and 'false-positive' results.

In Japan, a government-funded and well-designed surveillance programme which was started in the 1980s, probably represents the upper limit of what can be expected from current surveillance strategies. Median survival of those detected with HCC has increased, decade on decade, from < 4 months in the 1980s (as it was then in other countries) to > 4 years currently. Since 2000 such advances seem to reflect improving underlying liver function as well as earlier detection and better treatment. The recently developed aMAP score, based on age, gender, platelet count and the ALBI score, appears to accurately predict the likelihood of HCC development in populations under surveillance, paving the way for practical risk stratification strategies. Notably, recognising the difficulty of accurate and consistent diagnosis of 'cirrhosis', the model was developed in patients with chronic hepatitis without specific reference to the presence or absence of cirrhosis. However, clinical application of such scores conventionally requires long-term validation studies in a setting similar to that in which the test would be applied.

### Alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotrophin-beta as prognostic markers in neuroendocrine tumour patients [^113dLVBa]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Most NET patients have extensive metastases at the time of diagnosis. The indolent nature of these tumours means that even in the presence of liver metastases, the 5-year survival rates are surprisingly good. However, a proportion of patients have rapidly progressive disease, at diagnosis, which requires aggressive management with cytoreductive therapies, hopefully resulting in better symptom control and improved survival. Predicting the behaviour of NETs in individual cases has to date relied on tumour histology, serum CgA levels, and serial radiology imaging. This data clearly demonstrate the utility of AFP, hCG β, CgA, and possibly Ki-67 index in highlighting those patients with WHO stage IV disease who are going to require intensive monitoring and possibly early and aggressive therapy. Conversely, patients with favourable results can be re-assured about their medium- to long-term survival and monitored less intensely with confidence, perhaps six monthly as opposed to three to four monthly for those patients with, for example, elevated AFP and hCG β.

This is a retrospective study and the results highlight the worth of performing a prospective study to assess these markers.

In conclusion, this study has identified AFP and hCG β to be capable of providing significant prognostic information relevant to the management of NET patients.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^116sjXJN]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Version 1.2025) — Screening test performance indicates limits of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) alone and the value of combining with ultrasound (US). AFP and liver US are the most widely used methods of screening for HCC, and a review showed that an AFP cut-off value of 100 ng/mL was associated with high specificity (99%) but low sensitivity (31%). In a large Chinese screening study using an AFP cut-off of > 20 ng/mL, the detection rate, false-positive rate, and positive predictive value were 69%, 5.0%, and 3.3% with AFP alone; 84%, 2.9%, and 6.6% with US alone; and 92%, 7.5%, and 3.0% with the combination of AFP and US; these results demonstrate that US combined with AFP is a better modality for HCC screening than AFP testing alone. In a study of 333 patients with HCC and HBV/HCV, diagnosis after surveillance with US and AFP was associated with significantly longer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than in those with no surveillance, and since US is highly operator dependent, the addition of AFP may increase the likelihood of detecting HCC, although AFP is frequently normal in patients with early-stage disease and its utility as a screening biomarker is limited.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) workup for benign or indeterminate lesions and multidisciplinary management: For a definitely benign observed lesion, the patients should return to a screening program (ie, US and AFP in 6 months); if there is suspicion that the diagnostic imaging test yielded a false negative, then a different imaging method with or without AFP may be considered. If the observation is inconclusive (ie, not definitely HCC but not definitely benign), then multidisciplinary discussion and individualized workup may be pursued, including additional imaging or biopsy, and multidisciplinary team management has been associated with improved outcomes in HCC, including higher rates of treatment, higher rates of curative treatments in early stages, and prolonged survival in advanced disease.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^117XZ4Wp]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Testicular cancer — serum tumor markers overview: The serum tumor markers lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta‑hCG) are used to aid in determining stage and prognosis, and AFP and beta‑hCG are also used for assessing treatment outcomes. For risk stratification in metastatic disease, levels of AFP, beta‑hCG, and LDH should all be measured on Day 1 of cycle one of first-line chemotherapy, and AFP and beta‑hCG should be determined before and after treatment and throughout the follow-up period. Elevated markers after orchiectomy may indicate occult metastatic disease (stage IS) and are often the earliest sign of relapse during surveillance. LDH is not generally used to monitor for relapse or response because false positives are common, but it is useful for risk stratification when starting first-line chemotherapy. Caution should be taken when only one marker is mildly elevated due to the occurrence of false positives.

### Diagnostic value of alpha 1-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin in infancy and childhood [^115RBVip]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

This article provides a comprehensive review of the current literature and summarizes the experience of the German cooperative protocols for nontesticular germ cell tumors (MAKEI) on the use of alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) for diagnostic evaluation in pediatric oncology. Based on this evaluation, this review proposes guidelines for the initial diagnostic work-up for children with clinically suspected secreting tumors. AFP and beta-hCG represent the characteristic tumor markers of malignant epithelial liver tumors and malignant germ cell tumors (GCT). They play an important role in the initial diagnostic evaluation as well as in the follow-up examination during therapy. Current therapeutic strategies for both tumor types include preoperative chemotherapy followed by delayed tumor resection. Therefore, it is essential for the pediatrician in charge to be aware of the broad differential diagnosis of elevated AFP and beta-hCG. In a well-defined clinical setting, these tumor markers allow clinical diagnosis without histological confirmation, but the physiologically elevated AFP serum levels in infancy or unrecognized benign conditions, such as hepatic diseases or hereditary disorders, must also be considered as differential diagnoses. Therefore, the laboratory investigations should include liver parameters in all patients to exclude hepatic disease. In addition, pregnancy must be excluded in adolescents. Careful history taking and clinical examination will further help to rule out metabolic disorders or ataxia teleangiectasia that are associated with elevated AFP levels. Having excluded these conditions, elevated AFP levels above the age-related normal range (with or without high beta-hCG), indicate malignant epithelial liver tumors in primary liver lesions. At virtually all other sites, the diagnosis of a malignant GCT with a substantial yolk sac tumor and/or choriocarcinoma component can be established. Pancreaticoblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumors of the upper abdomen, and biopsy must be performed. Other childhood tumors are rarely associated with AFP or beta-hCG production, usually at only moderately elevated serum levels, and in most patients these tumors can be excluded by clinical and radiological examination.

### Serum levels of α-fetoprotein increased more than 10 years before detection of hepatocellular carcinoma [^113Z2QEe]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Ultrasound (US)-based screening has been recommended for patients with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). US analysis, however, is limited in patients who are obese or have small tumors. The addition of serum level of α-fetoprotein (AFP) measurements to US analysis can increase detection of HCC. We analyzed data from patients with chronic liver disease, collected over 15 years in an HCC surveillance program, to develop a model to assess risk of HCC.

Methods

We collected data from 3450 patients with chronic liver disease undergoing US surveillance in Japan from March 1998 through April 2014, and followed them up for a median of 8.83 years. We performed longitudinal discriminant analysis of serial AFP measurements (median number of observations/patient, 56; approximately every 3 months) to develop a model to determine the risk of HCC. We validated the model using data from 2 cohorts of patients with chronic liver disease in Japan (404 and 2754 patients) and 1 cohort in Scotland (1596 patients).

Results

HCC was detected in 413 patients (median tumor diameter, 1.8 cm), during a median follow-up time of 6.60 years. In the development data set, the model identified patients who developed HCC with an area under the curve of 0.78; it correctly identified 74.3% of patients who did develop HCC, and 72.9% of patients who did not. Overall, 73.1% of patients were classified correctly. The model could be used to assign patients to a high-risk group (27.5 HCCs/1000 patient-years) vs a low-risk group (4.9 HCCs/1000 patient-years). A similar performance was observed when the model was used to assess patients with cirrhosis. Analysis of the validation cohorts produced similar results.

Conclusions

We developed and validated a model to identify patients with chronic liver disease who are at risk for HCC based on change in serum AFP level over time. The model could be used to assign patients to high-risk vs low-risk groups, and might be used to select patients for surveillance.

### Clinical, virologic, and pathologic significance of elevated serum α-fetoprotein levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111Bm1xr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C is not uncommonly seen, but the pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains unclear. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of elevated serum AFP in patients with chronic hepatitis C and to evaluate the clinical, virologic, and histopathologic significance of this phenomenon. One hundred and fifteen Chinese patients with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C were enrolled. None had evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma by image study at enrollment and for at least 2 years' follow-up. Of the 115 patients, 33 (29%) had elevated serum AFP (more than 12 ng/mL). There was a significantly lower mean serum albumin (4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 4.3 ± 0.1 gm/dL, p < 0.001) and higher mean scores for periportal necroinflammation (3.3 ± 0.3 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2, p = 0.007) and fibrosis (2.3 ± 0.2 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1, p < 0.001) in patients with elevated serum AFP when compared with patients without elevated serum AFP. Patients with elevated serum AFP had significantly more incidences of genotype 1b infection when compared with patients without elevated serum AFP (77% vs. 51%, p = 0.021). Mean serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA titer showed no significant difference between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that as serum albumin of less than 4.2 gm/dL, a histology fibrotic score of more than 3, and HCV genotype 1b infection were significantly independent predictors associated with elevated serum AFP. In conclusion, elevated serum AFP levels were significantly correlated with lower serum albumin levels, advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and genotype 1b infection in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Patients with an elevation in AFP

In the absence of an abnormality on US, the magnitude of elevation in AFP or the rate of increase in this biomarker that should trigger further investigation for HCC has not been defined. An elevation of AFP to > 200 ng/mL has a specificity approaching 100% but sensitivity less than 40%. The specificity for AFP values < 100 ng/mL is significantly lower, even if in clinical practice this level of elevation commonly triggers further imaging studies, as does a persistent increase. No firm recommendation can be made on the basis of published data.

Radiological diagnosis of HCC

HCC, in the right clinical context, can be diagnosed by imaging characteristics alone. Imaging or non-invasive criteria are restricted to patients with underlying cirrhosis. On contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, either CT or MRI, the characteristic features of HCC are hyperenhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase of contrast enhancement, with washout or hypoattenuation within the lesion in the portal venous and/or delayed-phase postcontrast enhancement. In addition, there may also be enhancement of a capsule involving the lesion. Thoracic and pelvic CT complete staging when the diagnosis of HCC has been made.

While the classic imaging characteristics of HCC have been well reported, these characteristics occur less frequently in HCC that are < 2 cm in diameter. A definitive diagnosis of HCC cannot be made by non-invasive criteria in lesions < 1 cm in size. If non-invasive criteria for diagnosis are not fulfilled, lesional biopsy is required.

### Changes in the serum proteome associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C-related cirrhosis [^112MjfYM]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth commonest cancer in the world today and the overall 5-year survival rate remains less than 5%. Although the incidence rate is likely to fall with the institution of mass vaccination against the hepatitis B virus, initiated in the 1980s, this will not have a major impact for many years as the age of presentation is over 50 years in most areas of the world. Furthermore, there is no prospect of a vaccine against the hepatitis C virus, the major aetiological factor for HCC in the US, Japan and Southern Europe. Despite the absence of randomised clinical trials, there is strong evidence that surgical resection, liver transplantation or ablative therapies significantly improve survival. Such approaches are, however, only applicable to those in whom the tumour is detected at an early stage, typically less than 3 cm in diameter without vascular involvement and tumours only rarely present with symptoms at this stage. Early diagnosis has, therefore, become a priority. Surveillance of high-risk groups, such as those with cirrhosis, has been shown to permit detection of small tumours and there is emerging evidence that this is associated with improved survival. Currently, surveillance involves both serological testing with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) estimation and ultrasound scanning, typically at 6 monthly intervals. However, while AFP may be a useful diagnostic serum marker in patients with advanced symptomatic disease, it is much less useful in patients with earlier/small tumours where its sensitivity is low.

### Serum α-fetoprotein level independently predicts posttransplant survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [^116d2r7M]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine whether combining serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor burden would allow better stratification of posttransplant survival for patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation. Adjusting for donor and recipient characteristics, we calculated the risk of posttransplant mortality associated with serum AFP level or HCC tumor burden for all first-time adult liver transplants performed in the United States between 2002 and 2011 (n = 45,267). Serum AFP level, rather than tumor burden, was the tumor characteristic most strongly associated with posttransplant survival. Although recipients with HCC and a serum AFP level ≤ 15 ng/mL at the time of transplantation had no excess posttransplant mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93–1.12], patients with a serum AFP level of 16 to 65 ng/mL (AHR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.23–1.54), patients with a serum AFP level of 66 to 320 ng/mL (AHR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.45–1.88), and patients with a serum AFP level > 320 ng/mL (AHR = 2.37, 95% CI = 2.06–2.73) had progressively worse posttransplant mortality in comparison with recipients without HCC. Patients with a tumor burden exceeding the Milan criteria (who are usually excluded from transplantation) had excellent posttransplant survival if their serum AFP level was 0 to 15 ng/mL (AHR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.66–1.43). In contrast, patients within the Milan criteria (who are routinely considered to be transplant candidates) had poor survival if their serum AFP level was substantially elevated (for a serum AFP level ≥ 66 ng/mL, AHR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.74–2.15). Changes in serum AFP level while patients were on the waiting list corresponded closely to changes in posttransplant mortality. In conclusion, the absolute serum AFP level and changes in the serum AFP level strongly predict posttransplant survival independently of the tumor burden. We hope that these data, in combination with other factors, can be used to inform future studies and ongoing discussions aimed at improving the eligibility criteria for liver transplantation for patients with HCC.
