## Question

Can you define a Fibroadenoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a breast fibroadenoma is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and classification of fibroadenoma. Then, I should verify the histopathology and cellular composition. Next, I will review epidemiology and demographics, followed by clinical presentation and hormonal influences. After that, I should examine multimodality imaging features, integrate molecular and genetic insights, and delineate recognized variants and their differentials, especially vis-à-vis phyllodes tumors. Finally, I need to synthesize practical management, including observation versus intervention, and highlight pitfalls that warrant re-biopsy or excision, ensuring radiologic–pathologic concordance throughout.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition and classification so I don't gloss over fundamentals; fibroadenoma is a benign fibroepithelial tumor composed of both epithelial and stromal elements and is the most common benign breast tumor in women of reproductive age, collectively accounting for a substantial proportion of breast biopsies, often cited around 30–50 percent, although figures vary by cohort and practice pattern [^notfound] [^114dxN8p] [^1172A6PX] [^113jYS85] [^113yPapb].

> I will now examine the histopathologic and cellular architecture; wait, let me verify the biphasic nature before proceeding to transcriptomic details, because that frames the rest of the reasoning — the lesion indeed shows stromal and epithelial proliferation, and single-cell atlases identify diverse epithelial, stromal, and immune populations, with stromal fibroblast enrichment that appears to reflect recruitment rather than proliferation given low Ki-67 indices, reinforcing the epithelial–stromal crosstalk central to pathogenesis [^116b58Jx] [^11782oX7].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and demographics to contextualize risk; fibroadenomas cluster in reproductive years yet can occur at any age, dominate the differential of solid pediatric breast masses — comprising roughly 91 percent of pathologically proven solid masses in girls — and carry historical incidence estimates near 32.8 per 100,000 person-years in the U.S., with rare reports even in elderly men, reminding me not to prematurely exclude this diagnosis in atypical demographics [^114SC1ag] [^114VqJXd] [^112AbcgB] [^114dxN8p] [^1172A6PX].

> Let me consider clinical presentation before jumping to imaging; the classic finding is a painless, firm, mobile, rubbery, well-circumscribed nodule that is usually solitary but may be multiple or bilateral, tends to grow slowly, can enlarge rapidly in adolescents, and occasionally infarcts when outgrowing its blood supply during pregnancy or lactation, producing focal tenderness and pain [^113jYS85] [^114dxN8p] [^115YqfjP].

> I need to ensure I address hormonal responsiveness and natural history carefully; fibroadenomas are hormone sensitive, often enlarge during pregnancy and lactation and sometimes regress after lactation ceases, and while systemic medical therapy is not standard of care, randomized data suggest metformin may modestly attenuate growth — particularly in smaller or multiple lesions — so I should frame such approaches as investigational adjuncts rather than routine therapy [^1172A6PX] [^115YqfjP] [^112EUKbj] [^111mXAUR] [^111tUDgN].

> Next, I should review imaging across modalities but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without aligning features to BI-RADS; on ultrasound, typical fibroadenomas are oval, circumscribed, parallel, and homogeneous with a pseudocapsule and usually without posterior shadowing, with elastography often classifying them as probably benign; on mammography, they are round or oval and circumscribed and can develop coarse "popcorn" calcifications over time; MRI usually shows benign morphology with sharp margins and persistent-type kinetic curves; PET/CT typically shows no or mild FDG uptake, though rarely uptake is higher and may mimic malignancy, which means imaging features must be integrated with clinical context to avoid over-calling [^113jYS85] [^115YqfjP] [^112Mp9dm] [^114dxN8p].

> I should double-check molecular and genetic insights because they increasingly inform our differential; fibroadenomas frequently harbor recurrent MED12 mutations, and single-cell and organoid studies demonstrate coexisting estrogen signaling and endocrine resistance programs, with preliminary functional data showing that combining endocrine agents such as tamoxifen with targeted inhibitors like lapatinib can suppress viability in tamoxifen-resistant fibroadenoma organoids, though translation to routine clinical care remains early-stage [^111tfMKy].

> Let me think about established variants because management often hinges on recognizing them; simple fibroadenomas are most common, juvenile lesions can grow rapidly in adolescents, giant fibroadenomas exceed 5 cm and are generally excised to exclude phyllodes tumor and to prevent deformity, myxomatous fibroadenomas show characteristic myxoid change with higher depth-to-width ratios and posterior enhancement on ultrasound that can mimic mucinous carcinoma, and complex or cellular variants may blur boundaries with phyllodes lesions, requiring meticulous radiologic–pathologic correlation [^1172A6PX] [^117C43jj] [^114oiEsJ] [^113jYS85].

> Hold on, I should verify the differential with phyllodes tumor and other fibroepithelial lesions before discussing management; features favoring fibroadenoma include small size, oval shape, circumscribed margins, homogeneous echotexture, and limited growth, whereas larger size, rapid enlargement, irregular or noncircumscribed margins, and heterogeneous echotexture raise concern for phyllodes, and when core shows a nonspecific fibroepithelial lesion, selective rather than routine excision is safe, especially when the pathologist notes no specific concern for phyllodes, with WHO guidance endorsing a conservative "fibroadenoma or benign fibroepithelial neoplasm" designation when distinction is uncertain and emphasizing standardized criteria to improve consistency [^114KAevX] [^111dBZmq] [^113XHwar] [^111FD1Rc] [^11661my7].

> I should confirm imaging–age algorithms and follow-up thresholds to avoid unnecessary biopsies; for a palpable mass, ultrasound is first-line in women under 30 and in pregnancy or lactation, while diagnostic mammography is initial in women 40 and older with adjunct ultrasound as needed, MRI is rarely indicated for a clinically detected mass, and short-interval follow-up is reasonable for probably benign solid masses suggesting fibroadenoma; in strictly selected women aged 25–29 with sonographically typical fibroadenomas, a non-biopsy protocol can be safe with rigorous criteria and surveillance, especially as pediatric data already show benign dominance [^114st56g] [^1174g4DS] [^1174XZ4J] [^114SC1ag].

> Let me reconsider when to actively intervene versus observe to avoid overtreatment; indications for excision include giant size, rapid growth, symptomatic deformity, imaging–pathology discordance, atypia or cellularity raising concern for phyllodes, and patient preference, whereas enlarging but biopsy-proven uncomplicated fibroadenomas have shown extremely low upgrade rates to malignancy on excision, supporting individualized decisions; minimally invasive options such as ultrasound-guided cryoablation and vacuum-assisted excision can achieve high patient satisfaction and excellent cosmesis when tissue removal or debulking is desired, while surgery during lactation is feasible with counseling on complications like milk fistula [^114gekPy] [^113yPapb] [^1125huec] [^1124jG7A] [^116MQpRY].

> I should double-check rare pitfalls so I don't undercall concerning evolution; carcinoma in situ arising within a fibroadenoma is rare but reported and is more likely in older patients or enlarging lesions, arguing for re-biopsy if a previously stable fibroadenoma enlarges in the 40s despite otherwise benign imaging, and while PET/CT typically shows minimal uptake, atypical avidity has been reported, as has unexpected radioiodine accumulation on post-therapy scans, reinforcing that discordant or evolving features warrant reassessment, particularly when myxoid change or mucinous carcinoma enters the differential on MRI or ultrasound [^115kePEZ] [^114dxN8p] [^113FDtw3] [^11592AzH] [^114oiEsJ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the definition, imaging, and pathology remain aligned at every step; fibroadenoma is a benign fibroepithelial tumor with characteristic clinical and imaging features, hormonally responsive behavior, and distinctive yet overlapping variants, and optimal care hinges on age-tailored imaging, selective biopsy, meticulous radiologic–pathologic concordance, and judicious intervention for lesions that are large, symptomatic, discordant, or pathologically concerning, all while remaining alert to rare malignant transformations or mimics that necessitate re-biopsy or excision [^114dxN8p] [^114st56g] [^113XHwar].

A fibroadenoma is a **benign breast tumor** with stromal and epithelial components, most common in women aged 15–35 [^114dxN8p]. It typically presents as a **firm, mobile, painless mass** that is well-circumscribed and slow-growing, often enlarging with pregnancy or hormone therapy and sometimes regressing after menopause [^113jYS85] [^115YqfjP]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and ultrasound [^114st56g], with core needle biopsy for atypical features or in older patients; management is usually observation, with excision or minimally invasive options (cryoablation, vacuum-assisted excision) for large, symptomatic, or growing lesions [^1174g4DS] [^113yPapb] [^1125huec]. Malignant transformation is rare, and prognosis is excellent [^117K9dYk] [^115kePEZ].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Fibroadenoma is the **most common benign breast tumor** in women of reproductive age, particularly ages 15–35 [^114dxN8p] [^114SC1ag]. Historical U.S. incidence was 32.8 per 100,000 person-years in 1968–1969 [^114VqJXd]. Risk is linked to **hormonal influences**, including estrogen and progesterone [^116s9RT5], and to pregnancy, lactation, oral contraceptives, and hormone therapy [^113jYS85] [^115YqfjP].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typically presents as a firm, mobile, painless, well-circumscribed [^114dxN8p], **slow-growing mass**. Lesions may enlarge during pregnancy, lactation, or with hormone therapy and may regress after menopause [^113jYS85] [^115YqfjP]. They can be multiple or bilateral, especially in adolescents and young women [^114dxN8p] [^114SC1ag].

---

## Histological features

Fibroadenomas are **biphasic**, showing proliferation of stromal and epithelial components [^116kwSAn] [^116b58Jx]. Variants include simple, complex, juvenile, giant, myxoid, cellular, and hyalinized fibroadenomas [^1172A6PX] [^114oiEsJ]. MED12 mutations are common in the stromal component [^116kwSAn].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Clinical examination**: Palpable, firm, mobile, well-circumscribed mass [^114dxN8p].
- **Ultrasound**: Oval, well-circumscribed, homogeneous, hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement [^114dxN8p] [^112Mp9dm].
- **Mammography**: Well-circumscribed, round or oval mass; coarse "popcorn" calcifications in older lesions [^114dxN8p] [^115YqfjP].
- **MRI**: Benign morphology with persistent kinetic curve and high extracellular volume fraction [^113jYS85].
- **Biopsy**: Core needle biopsy for atypical features or older patients [^114st56g] [^1174g4DS].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Phyllodes tumor**: Larger, faster-growing, irregular margins, heterogeneous echotexture [^114KAevX] [^113XHwar].
- **Breast carcinoma**: Irregular, spiculated, suspicious imaging features [^114st56g].
- **Other benign lesions**: Hamartoma, tubular adenoma, lactating adenoma, fibromatosis [^113gwjiz] [^112uB61C] [^112RE4mV] [^115ngiGy].

---

## Management strategies

- **Observation**: For small, asymptomatic, stable lesions with benign features [^114st56g] [^1174XZ4J].
- **Surgical excision**: For large (> 3 cm), symptomatic, rapidly growing, or patient-preferred lesions [^114st56g] [^114gekPy] [^111dBZmq].
- **Minimally invasive procedures**: Cryoablation or vacuum-assisted excision for suitable lesions [^113yPapb] [^1125huec].
- **Medical management**: Metformin may reduce size in small or multiple lesions [^111mXAUR] [^112EUKbj].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent** because fibroadenomas are benign with minimal malignant potential [^116s9RT5]. Recurrence is **uncommon** after complete excision and higher with incomplete removal or multiple lesions.

---

## Potential complications

Complications are uncommon. Malignant transformation is **rare** (0.002%–0.125%) and usually to carcinoma in situ [^117K9dYk] [^116MQpRY] [^115kePEZ]. Large or multiple lesions may cause cosmetic deformity, and palpable masses can lead to anxiety or distress.

---

## Special considerations

During pregnancy and lactation, fibroadenomas may enlarge or infarct; management should be individualized [^113jYS85] [^115YqfjP] [^1124jG7A]. In adolescents, **conservative management is often preferred** because spontaneous regression is common [^116G7cjs] [^114SC1ag]. In men, fibroadenomas are rare and usually occur with gynecomastia or hormonal imbalance [^112AbcgB] [^115zxW8t].

A fibroadenoma is a **benign breast tumor** with a biphasic stromal–epithelial composition, most common in young women. It is typically managed conservatively unless symptomatic or growing; prognosis is excellent and complications are rare.

### Breast MRI during pregnancy and lactation: Clinical challenges and technical advances [^113jYS85]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Fibroadenomas are composed of epithelium and stroma and account for the most common benign tumor detected in young females. Interestingly, before pregnancy, fibroadenomas may remain latent and asymptomatic until they become clinically apparent as a new-onset palpable mass after hormonally stimulated growth. Clinically, fibroadenomas, which are often multiple and bilateral, usually present as a painless, firm, mobile, and rubbery mass. Less frequently, fibroadenomas may experience a tremendous growth spurt, resulting in central infarction, and then become tender.

On mammography, fibroadenomas often appear as a well-defined round or oval mass, which may also exhibit pathognomonic benign calcifications, making further imaging work-up unnecessary. On ultrasound (US), fibroadenomas among pregnant or lactating women appear the same as among the general population, exhibiting a circumscribed, wider-than-taller oval or round mass. Infarcted or complex fibroadenomas may show suspicious features such as irregular margins and internal cystic changes that warrant biopsy. On MRI, fibroadenomas usually exhibit a benign morphology on unenhanced sequences, including a sharp contour without signs of infiltration. Additionally, they exhibit benign dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) patterns such as a persistent kinetic curve and a high extracellular volume fraction with low to moderate microvascular permeability. A representative case of a growing fibroadenoma is shown in Fig. 6.

### Office-based cryoablation of breast fibroadenomas: 12-month followup [^113yPapb]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Fibroadenomas comprise between 30% and 50% of all breast biopsies. Despite their benign nature, many women have their fibroadenomas surgically removed. We previously reported on a minimally invasive therapy using cryoablation to treat fibroadenomas. We now report on 12-month follow-up using this technique.

- **Study design**: A prospective, nonrandomized trial was initiated in June 2000 with IRB approval. The Visica Treatment System was used to cryoablate 70 biopsy-proved fibroadenomas in 57 patients using a freeze-thaw-freeze cycle lasting 6 to 30 minutes. Each patient was serially evaluated for safety, efficacy, and satisfaction.

- **Results**: Fifty-seven fibroadenomas (mean 2.1 cm, range 0.8 to 4.2 cm) in 47 patients were followed for 12 months. At 1 year, with 89% median tumor volume reduction measured by ultrasonography, 75% of fibroadenomas were nonpalpable. There were no adverse events and only minor complications. Two patients (4%) had their lesions excised after 12 months; pathology revealed no viable fibroadenoma. Serial mammograms showed resorption of the fibroadenoma leaving minimal residual density without calcifications. Cosmesis was excellent with no volume deficit, as no tissue is removed. Ninety-one percent of patients were satisfied at 12 months.

Cryoablation is safe and effective in treating breast fibroadenomas. It offers a nonsurgical, office-based treatment that is well tolerated by patients and accurately monitored with ultrasonographic guidance. At 12 months, we found progressive tumor volume reduction and reduced palpability, with no adverse outcomes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^114st56g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound.

Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

### Spectrum of the breast lesions with increased 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT [^114dxN8p]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Fibroadenoma is the most common benign breast tumor with an admixture of stromal and epithelial proliferation, occurring most frequently in women of child-bearing age. Fibroadenoma usually presents as a painless, solitary, firm, slowly growing, mobile, well-defined nodule. It can be multiple in the same or in both breasts and may grow very large, mainly when it occurs in adolescents.

At CT, fibroadenomas appear as well-circumscribed, round, or oval masses that may demonstrate coarse popcorn-like calcifications. FDG PET provides a high accuracy in the differentiation of fibroadenomas from malignant tumors because fibroadenomas usually show no or mild FDG uptake. Rarely, fibroadenomas may show significantly higher FDG uptake than the normal breast tissue and mimic malignancies.

A 42-year-old woman with a 30-day history of left breast pain. Transverse T2-weighted MR image (A) showed a well-circumscribed round nodule with hyperintensity in the right breast (arrow). Enhanced T1-weighted MR image (B) showed remarkable enhancement of this nodule. Transverse CT (C), corresponding fused (D), and MIP PET (E) images showed increased FDG uptake of this nodule with SUV max of 2.5 (arrows). One year later, a follow-up right mediolateral mammogram (F) revealed a well-circumscribed, round-shaped hyperdense nodule (arrow) in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. The patient underwent resection of the nodule. Photomicrograph revealed fibroadenoma.

### Appearance of breast masses on sonoelastography with special focus on the diagnosis of fibroadenomas [^112Mp9dm]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to show and correlate the imaging features of breast masses, especially fibroadenomas, using sonoelastography. Two hundred thirty-five patients with 302 breast lesions referred for core needle biopsy participated in the study. All lesions appearing as solid masses on conventional US were included. Of the included lesions (270), 115 (42.6%) corresponded to histologically confirmed fibroadenomas, and 155 (57.4%) to lesions with histologically confirmed diagnoses other than fibroadenomas. These were further subdivided into fibrocystic changes, lesions with low malignancy potential, and malignant lesions.

Fibroadenomas were also divided according to histological presentation into three subgroups to allow comparative study based on elastographic scores. All lesions were classified using a four-point scoring system based on ultrasound elastography imaging characteristics. Different presentations were observed for elastographic scores according to the histological presentation of fibroadenomas, whereby fibroadenomas with benign characteristics tended to have elastographic classification similar to fibrocystic changes, and complex and hypercellular fibroadenomas had classifications similar to harder lesions.

Fibroadenomas are generally classified as category 3 in the BI-RADS lexicon and are the most commonly found lesions in breast biopsies. Sonoelastography can provide additional information to conventional studies and be used as an auxiliary tool in assessing these masses in clinical practice.

### Single cell profiling of female breast fibroadenoma reveals distinct epithelial cell compositions and therapeutic targets [^116b58Jx]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Single-cell transcriptome atlas of human breast fibroadenomas and adjacent normal tissues:

- **Study overview**: Human breast fibroadenoma tissues (FA) and adjacent normal tissues (N) were collected from patients diagnosed with FA via ultrasound after the operation, verified by a pathologist, and subjected to the single-cell assays shown.

- **t-SNE analysis**: Analysis of 28,101 single-cell transcriptomes (17,776 from fibroadenoma and 10,325 from adjacent normal tissues) revealed 10 cell clusters: mature luminal cells (ML), luminal progenitor cells (LP), basal cells (BC), fibroblasts (FB), endothelial cells (EC), pericytes (PT), T cells (T), B cells (B), myeloid cells (M), and unknown cells (Un).

- **Cell composition**: Each sample's composition showed top cell counts of different subsets and the relative abundance of these subsets.

- **t-SNE map**: A t-SNE map of 6,346 single-cell transcriptomes of mature luminal cells (ML), luminal progenitor cells (LP), and basal cells (BC) includes 3,173 from fibroadenoma and 3,173 from normal tissues.

- **Cell counts and percentages**: Cell counts of different cell subsets in each sample, and the cell percentage in total cells of the fibroadenomas (n = 4) and normal tissues (n = 6), are presented.

### Evidence for avoiding the biopsy of typical fibroadenomas in women aged 25–29 years [^1174XZ4J]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine if any malignancies would have been missed in women aged 25–29 years in the absence of needle biopsy of sonographically typical fibroadenomas, and to present a non-biopsy protocol for fibroadenomas in this age group using strict criteria.

- **Materials and methods**: Women aged 25–29 years undergoing needle biopsies in three centers over a collective 16-year period were identified. Imaging, clinical information, needle biopsy, and surgical histopathology results were obtained from hospital medical records at each center.

- **Results**: Between January 2001 and December 2016, 885 women aged 25–29 years underwent core biopsy. Of 595 sonographically typical fibroadenomas, 549 were histologically confirmed fibroadenomas and 46 were other benign entities, while none were cancers. All cancers were scored as indeterminate or suspicious on ultrasound. With a non-biopsy protocol in clinical practice in Centre A, between 2009 and 2018, 259 sonographically typical fibroadenomas met criteria for non-biopsy, and at the time of writing, no cancers have been missed.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides evidence for safe non-biopsy of typical fibroadenomas in women aged 25–29 years when the clinical and sonographic presentations meet strict criteria. A protocol for non-biopsy to include this age group is suggested for incorporation of these results into existing guidance for managing younger women.

### Breast fibroadenomas in the pediatric population: common and uncommon sonographic findings [^114SC1ag]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Sonography is usually requested to evaluate palpable pediatric breast lumps, and solid masses are almost always fibroadenomas. Lack of familiarity with the findings of fibroadenomas can lead to diagnostic uncertainty and sometimes unnecessary biopsy and excision. We sought to review the spectrum of sonographic findings in our cases of pathology-proven pediatric fibroadenomas.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the sonographic appearances of pathologically proven pediatric breast fibroadenomas.

- **Materials and methods**: A query of the Department of Radiology database at our institution was performed for all patients younger than 19 years who underwent breast ultrasound (US) from January 2001 to June 2009. A total of 332 patients were identified: 282 girls (85%) and 50 boys (15%). Ninety-one girls, and no boys, had a solid breast mass based on US findings. Forty-three children had a total of 49 pathologically proven breast masses with the diagnoses of fibroadenoma (44), hamartoma (1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1), tubular adenoma (1), pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (1), and lactation changes (1). Reviews of medical records, histological results, and sonographic examinations of all pathology-proven fibroadenomas were performed. US findings were characterized according to location, multiplicity, size, shape, echogenicity and homogeneity, definition of margins, posterior acoustic features, and Doppler vascularity.

- **Results**: The vast majority of solid breast masses in girls are histologically benign. Fibroadenomas accounted for 91% of the pathologically proven cases.

### Single cell profiling of female breast fibroadenoma reveals distinct epithelial cell compositions and therapeutic targets [^116s9RT5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

- **Coexistence of hormone-sensitive and -resistant pathways**:

	- The study includes KEGG analysis of differentially expressed genes in epithelial cells between fibroadenoma and normal tissue. Pathway analysis was determined by a hypergeometric test, where a one-sided test with an adjusted p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The GSEA of the estrogen signaling pathway and endocrine resistance pathway in epithelial cells between fibroadenoma and normal tissue was subsequently performed.

	- A heatmap displays the average expression of endocrine resistance genes in epithelial cells. Furthermore, the expression of endocrine resistance genes (ERBB2, BCL2, and CCND1) was assessed in relapsed and non-relapsed fibroadenoma patients using immunohistochemical staining. Data are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m., with each dot representing one patient:

	- p = 0.01306 for ERBB2 (non-relapse: n = 9; relapse: n = 15), two-sided, Fisher's test.
	- p = 0.0006 for BCL2 (non-relapse: n = 9; relapse: n = 15).
	- p = 0.0142 for CCND1 (non-relapse: n = 7; relapse: n = 15), unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.

	- The expression of these genes (ERBB2, BCL2, and CCND1) was also measured in breast cancer patients, pathologically confirmed to originate from fibroadenoma, using immunohistochemical staining. Data, expressed as mean ± s.e.m., indicate statistical significance with the following values:

	- p = 0.00699 for ERBB2 (breast cancer: n = 8; fibroadenoma: n = 8), two-sided Fisher's test.
	- p = 0.0054 for BCL2 (breast cancer: n = 8; fibroadenoma: n = 8).
	- p = 0.0027 for CCND1 (breast cancer: n = 8; fibroadenoma: n = 8), paired two-tailed t test.

### Myxomatous fibroadenoma of the breast: Correlation with clinicopathologic and radiologic features [^114oiEsJ]. Human Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Fibroadenoma is a frequently encountered benign tumor that must be differentiated from carcinoma. Fibroadenomas often exhibit myxedematous changes, known as myxomatous fibroadenoma. We focused on myxomatous fibroadenomas and evaluated their diagnostic imaging and clinicopathologic findings.

We examined the clinicopathologic findings of myxomatous fibroadenomas among 113 fibroadenomas out of 592 needle biopsy cases and clinical findings of 27 patients with fibroadenoma who underwent surgical resection. Of the 592 cases, 113 (19%) were fibroadenomas, of which 45 cases (40%) were myxomatous fibroadenoma.

Based on ultrasonography findings, the depth-to-width ratio was significantly higher in the myxomatous fibroadenoma group (0.79 ± 0.26) compared to the non-myxomatous fibroadenoma group (0.64 ± 0.26) (P < .01). Forty-two patients were subjected to needle biopsy to differentiate fibroadenoma from carcinomas based on ultrasonography and clinical findings, among which 13 cases (31%) were myxomatous fibroadenoma. These lesions showed a relatively round shape and increased posterior echo enhancement with internal hyperechogenicity on ultrasonography.

Among 17 resected cases suspected of malignancy that showed rapid growth and/or size greater than 3 cm, 16 cases were myxomatous fibroadenoma. Tumors exhibiting rapid growth, relatively large size, a high depth-to-width ratio, a relatively round shape, and posterior echo enhancement with internal hyperechogenicity on ultrasonography require differentiation from mucinous carcinoma but are histologically more likely to be myxomatous fibroadenomas.

### Metformin as a new option in the medical management of breast fibroadenoma; a randomized clinical trial [^112EUKbj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). High credibility.

Fibroadenoma (FA) is the most common benign solid breast mass in women, with no definite method of management. Because fibroadenoma is dependent on female sex hormones and comprises hypertrophic changes at the cellular level, we investigated the effects of metformin (MF), a safe hypoglycemic agent with anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative properties, in the management of fibroadenoma.

- **Methods**: In this randomized clinical trial study, eligible women with fibroadenomas were assigned randomly to the metformin (1000 mg daily for six months) or the placebo group. Breast physical and ultrasound examinations were performed before and after the intervention, and the changes in the size of fibroadenomas were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: Overall, 83 patients in the treatment group and 92 in the placebo group completed the study. A statistically significant difference in changing size between the two groups was observed only in the smallest mass. In the largest FAs, the rate of size reduction was higher in the treatment group (60.2% vs. 43.5%), while a higher rate of enlargement was observed in the placebo group (38% vs. 20.5%). In the smallest FAs, the rate of the masses that got smaller or remained stable was about 90% in the treatment group and 50% in the placebo group. We categorized size changes of FAs into < 20% enlargement and ≥ 20% enlargement. The odds ratio (OR) for an enlargement less than 20% was 1.48 (95% CI = 1.10–1.99) in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. The odds for an enlargement less than 20% was higher in women with multiple fibroadenomas.

### Myoepithelial and epithelial-myoepithelial, mesenchymal and fibroepithelial breast lesions: updates from the who classification of tumours of the breast 2012 [^113XHwar]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

In the 4th edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Breast, myoepithelial lesions are retitled myoepithelial and epithelial-myoepithelial lesions to better reflect the dual participation of luminal and myoepithelial compartments in some key entities. Malignant myoepithelioma, described as a section within the chapter on myoepithelial lesions in the 3rd edition, is recognized in the 4th edition as part of metaplastic carcinoma. Adenomyoepithelioma with malignancy is categorized in terms of the cellular component undergoing malignant transformation. The list of antibodies used for identifying myoepithelial cells is updated.

Among mesenchymal lesions, there are new additions, such as nodular fasciitis and atypical vascular lesions, while haemangiopericytoma is removed. The 3rd edition stated that pathological prediction of the behavior of phyllodes tumours is difficult in individual cases. In the 4th edition, progress has been made in the prioritization and weighting of histological parameters that can potentially estimate the probability of recurrence.

The WHO Working Group advocates leaning towards a diagnosis of fibroadenoma in cases where there is histological uncertainty in distinguishing it from a benign phyllodes tumour or adopting the neutral term 'benign fibroepithelial neoplasm', as the clinical behavior of fibroadenoma overlaps with that of benign phyllodes tumour. The 3rd edition terminology of 'periductal stromal sarcoma' is revised to 'periductal stromal tumour', in line with the widespread consensus to avoid the use of the term 'cystosarcoma'.

### Imaging findings and classification of the common and uncommon male breast diseases [^115zxW8t]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The majority of male breast lumps are benign, and the most common reason is gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is formed by the proliferation of ductal and stromal elements, mostly seen during the pubertal period or senescence, either presented as unilateral or bilateral breast mass along with breast enlargement and/or focal pain. The etiology of gynecomastia includes a wide-ranging spectrum, including physiologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, neoplastic, and drug-induced causes. There are three characteristic patterns related to gynecomastia: nodular, dendritic, and diffuse glandular forms.

- **Nodular form**: Characterized by prominent ductal hyperplasia and cellular/proliferative stroma. Generally, it is a sign of the early (florid) phase, corresponding to a duration of less than 1 year. Nodular gynecomastia is considered a reversible pathology if the underlying cause(s) is eliminated. It appears as nodular or fan-shaped subareolar opacity in mammography and disk-shaped, hypervascular, hypoechoic subareolar tissue in ultrasound.

- **Dendritic form**: Corresponds to periductal stromal fibrosis and minimal ductal hyperplasia. It is known as the late phase. Incomplete text detected, truncation avoided to preserve content integrity.

### Metformin as a new option in the medical management of breast fibroadenoma; a randomized clinical trial [^111mXAUR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). High credibility.

Fibroadenoma (FA) is the most common benign solid breast mass in women, with no definite method of management. Because fibroadenoma is dependent on female sex hormones and comprises hypertrophic changes at cellular levels, we investigated the effects of metformin (MF), a safe hypoglycemic agent with anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative properties, in the management of fibroadenoma.

- **Methods**: In this randomized clinical trial study, eligible women with fibroadenomas were assigned randomly to the metformin (1000 mg daily for six months) or the placebo group. Breast physical and ultrasound exams were performed before and after the intervention, and the changes in the size of fibroadenomas were compared in the two groups.

- **Results**: Overall, 83 patients in the treatment and 92 in the placebo group completed the study. A statistically significant difference in changing size between the two groups was observed only in the smallest mass. In the largest FAs, the rate of size reduction was higher in the treatment group (60.2% vs. 43.5%), while a higher rate of enlargement was observed in the placebo group (38% vs. 20.5%). In the smallest FAs, the rate of the masses that got smaller or remained stable was about 90% in the treatment group and 50% in the placebo group. We categorized size changes of FAs into < 20% enlargement and ≥ 20% enlargement. The odds ratio (OR) for an enlargement less than 20% was 1.48 (95% CI = 1.10–1.99) in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo group; the odds for an enlargement less than 20% was higher in women with multiple fibroadenomas.

### Enlarging biopsy-proven fibroadenoma: Is surgical excision necessary [^114gekPy]. Clinical Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The core biopsy-proven fibroadenomas that enlarge on clinical or imaging follow-up are often surgically excised to exclude an associated malignancy. The purpose of this study was to assess how often malignancy is detected upon excision and to determine whether excision of enlarging, biopsy-proven, uncomplicated fibroadenomas is still warranted.

- **Materials and methods**: A review of our institutional pathology database from 2000 to 2010 identified 1,117 cases of fibroadenoma. A retrospective chart review, including a review of pathology and imaging findings of all these records, was performed.

- **Results**: A total of 1,117 cases of fibroadenoma were identified in a population of women ranging from ages 17 to 78. Of these, 378 (33.8%) were diagnosed by ultrasound core needle biopsy and formed the study population. In the 378 cases, 24 (6.3%) had co-existent atypia and were immediately excised; these cases were excluded. Additionally, 107 (28%) cases were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 247 cases, 201 (81%) showed stability on follow-up imaging (average of 31.5 months), and 46 (18.6%) enlarged on follow-up. Of the 46 biopsy-proven fibroadenomas that enlarged, 19 had a biopsy at initial presentation, and 27 underwent biopsy after they enlarged. Seventeen of the 19 were excised after enlargement, and pathology confirmed fibroadenoma in all cases (100%); two enlarged on initial follow-up imaging but remained stable for at least three years on continued follow-up. Of the 27 cases which were biopsied after enlargement, 23 revealed fibroadenoma on core biopsy, and 3 had fibroadenoma with associated atypia.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: Radiological-pathological correlation [^115YqfjP]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Fibroadenoma is the most common benign breast tumor in young women. Typically, women present with a firm, mobile mass. These tumors are hormone-sensitive; hence, they often enlarge during pregnancy and/or lactation in response to elevated circulating hormones. If, during pregnancy, the fibroadenoma outgrows its blood supply, it may undergo infarction, potentially presenting as a painful mass.

On mammography, fibroadenomas appear well-circumscribed, have a round or oval shape, and may be smoothly lobulated (see Fig. 11). Coarse popcorn-like calcifications may be observed if the tumor underwent infarction; otherwise, calcifications are quite rare as patients tend to be young. On ultrasound, typical features of a fibroadenoma include a round or oval shape, homogeneous internal echoes, well-circumscribed margins, a pseudo-capsule, absence of posterior acoustic shadowing, and normal adjacent breast tissue. However, during pregnancy, the appearance can be somewhat atypical, exhibiting cystic changes, increased vascularity, and/or prominent ducts. The presence of atypical features, such as microlobulations, irregular margins, heterogeneous echotexture, posterior acoustic shadowing, and extensive hypoechogenicity, should prompt a percutaneous core biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

### Breast fibromatosis: Radiologic-pathologic correlation [^115ngiGy]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare, benign, locally infiltrative tumor without metastatic potential. Patients typically present with a painless, palpable, firm breast mass, which may be mobile or fixed to the pectoralis muscle. While some cases are related to familial mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the majority are sporadic due to somatic mutations or prior injury to the breast tissue.

On mammography, fibromatosis is typically seen as an irregular, dense, spiculated mass. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic, irregular mass with indistinct margins. Fibromatosis is indistinguishable from breast cancer on imaging, and a core biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Wide local excision is the historical standard for treatment; however, recurrence rates are high, and other emerging therapies are being explored. This article reviews the clinical features, imaging, and histopathologic findings, along with a brief overview of management.

### Surgical management of a giant fibroadenoma during lactation [^1124jG7A]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Fibroadenomas are the most common breast lesion in women of reproductive age. During pregnancy and lactation, fibroadenomas can undergo rapid growth in response to hormonal stimulus. These changes may prompt further investigation and/or intervention due to the risk of an underlying phyllodes tumour. We present a case of a female patient who underwent surgical excision of a giant fibroepithelial lesion at 4 months postpartum while continuing to breastfeed. The lesion was successfully excised while maintaining lactation. A postoperative milk fistula resolved with non-operative management.

There is limited literature on the surgical management of breast lesions in lactating women. This case illuminates the surgical management of breast lesions in an often well-informed group of patients who may choose to have surgery while lactating, in spite of the increased risk of complications. This case also highlights the need for a holistic approach to maintain the overall health of mother and child.

### Determining whether excision of all fibroepithelial lesions of the breast is needed to exclude phyllodes tumor: Upgrade rate of fibroepithelial lesions of the breast to phyllodes tumor [^111dBZmq]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fibroepithelial lesions (FELs) are a common histological finding on core needle biopsy (CNB) of the breast. These lesions include fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors, which can be challenging to differentiate with an initial CNB. An institutional experience was reviewed from February 12, 2001, to January 4, 2007, to determine the safety of selective rather than routine excision of FELs. Additionally, factors associated with upgrading the diagnosis of FELs to phyllodes tumors, without a definitive phyllodes tumor diagnosis by CNB, were examined.

Of the 313 patients, 261 (83%) with FELs diagnosed by CNB were monitored with long-term follow-up (mean, 8 years). Of the observed patients, 3 (1%) were diagnosed with phyllodes tumor upon follow-up. Eighteen of the 52 patients (35%) who underwent excision experienced an upgrade in their diagnosis to phyllodes tumor. The sensitivity and specificity of the pathologist's comment expressing concern for phyllodes tumor on a CNB demonstrating FELs, without a definitive phyllodes tumor diagnosis, were 82% and 93%, respectively. Our policy of selective excision of FELs, in the absence of a definitive phyllodes tumor diagnosis, safely avoided many surgical procedures.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^1174g4DS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential.

- **Evidence-based guidelines**: The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

### Ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ arising within an enlarging biopsy proven fibroadenoma [^115kePEZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnosis via core needle biopsy of ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ within an enlarging previously biopsied benign fibroadenoma in women in their 40s is rare. Several case reports have described the occurrence of malignant changes within fibroadenomas, usually as an incidental finding following excision, and few reports have documented the transition of a fibroadenoma to malignancy. This case report emphasizes the importance of re-biopsying enlarging fibroadenomas, even with otherwise maintained benign-appearing features on imaging, in women in their 40s to exclude the possibility of malignancy.

### Mimickers of breast malignancy: Imaging findings, pathologic concordance and clinical management [^113gwjiz]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Tubular adenoma is a rare benign tumor of the breast, representing 0.13%-2.9% of all benign breast neoplasms. It is more frequently seen in younger women of childbearing age. Although tubular adenoma and fibroadenoma are both epithelial tumors, a tubular adenoma is histologically distinguished from a fibroadenoma by its tightly packed tubular or acinar epithelium and sparse connective tissue. Conversely, a fibroadenoma has an extensive connective tissue component. Despite this, the cytologic features of tubular adenoma may still resemble those of a fibroadenoma. Therefore, histopathology remains key for confirmation of this diagnosis. Like fibroadenomas, tubular adenomas are not known to increase the risk of cancer and, in contrast to fibroadenomas, are not associated with pregnancy or oral contraceptive use.

Both fibroadenomas and tubular adenomas present as circumscribed masses and are occasionally palpable. Mammographically, tubular adenomas have been associated with tightly grouped microcalcifications, which can be suspicious in morphology and may warrant biopsy. Sonographically, tubular adenomas usually present as oval parallel masses with circumscribed margins, similar to fibroadenomas; however, tubular adenomas can also present as irregular hypoechoic masses. Management should be determined by the clinical examination, imaging studies, and core biopsy results. In many cases, as with a growing breast mass, surgical excision should be considered to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

### Analysis of the progression of fibroepithelial tumours of the breast by PCR-based clonality assay [^117K9dYk]. The Journal of Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumour of the breast are both fibroepithelial tumours. Although progression to epithelial malignancy has been described, the behavior of most fibroadenomas is benign. Phyllodes tumours, on the other hand, can display locally destructive growth and can even metastasize. A relationship between the two tumours has been suggested in the literature.

This study investigated the clonality of both the stroma and the epithelium of these fibroepithelial tumours and attempted to construct a model in which fibroadenoma can progress in both an epithelial and a stromal direction. Fibroadenomas (n = 25) and phyllodes tumours (n = 12) were selected for analysis. Tissue was microdissected and analyzed for clonality using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay targeted at an X-linked polymorphic marker, the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA).

Nineteen fibroadenomas and nine phyllodes tumours could be analyzed. Normal-appearing epithelium, hyperplastic epithelium, and stroma removed from fibroadenomas were polyclonal. As expected, carcinoma in situ (CIS) removed from four fibroadenomas was monoclonal. Three areas of apparent stromal expansion within fibroadenoma were monoclonal, suggesting stromal progression. Mostly, the stroma of phyllodes tumours was monoclonal and the epithelium polyclonal. In two cases, however, the epithelium seemed to be monoclonal, whereas in three other cases the stromal component was polyclonal. These findings indicate that fibroadenoma can progress in an epithelial direction to CIS and in a stromal direction to phyllodes tumour.

### Genetics and genomics of breast fibroadenomas [^116kwSAn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Fibroadenomas of the breast are benign fibroepithelial tumors most frequently encountered in women of reproductive age, although they may be diagnosed at any age. The fibroadenoma comprises a proliferation of both stromal and epithelial components. The mechanisms underlying fibroadenoma pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. In the clinical setting, distinguishing cellular fibroadenomas from benign phyllodes tumors is a common diagnostic challenge due to subjective histopathological criteria and interobserver differences. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated the presence of highly recurrent mutations in fibroadenomas and have delineated the genomic landscapes of fibroadenomas and the closely related phyllodes tumors, revealing differences at the gene level, which may be of potential adjunctive diagnostic use. This article provides an overview of key studies uncovering genetic and genomic abnormalities in fibroadenomas, from initial karyotype reports revealing myriad cytogenetic aberrations to next-generation sequencing-based approaches that led to the discovery of highly recurrent MED12 mutations. A thorough understanding of these abnormalities is important to further elucidate the mechanisms by which fibroadenomas arise and to refine diagnostic assessment of this very common tumor.

### I saw the "breast within a breast" SIGN [^112RE4mV]. Clinical Imaging (2024). High credibility.

The "breast within a breast" sign is used to describe the appearance of a breast hamartoma, also known as a fibroadenolipoma. A breast hamartoma is a benign mass made up of the same tissues found in a normal breast, giving the appearance of a breast within a breast on mammography. The "breast within a breast" sign is pathognomonic for a breast hamartoma and can help confidently diagnose these masses as benign without the need for further imaging or biopsy.

### Fibroadenomas: A multidisciplinary review of the variants [^1172A6PX]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast lesions in women. Hormonal activities, particularly an increase in oestrogenic activity, play a significant role in their aetiology. These lesions are commonly detected incidentally. Most fibroadenomas present similar imaging findings and can be classified as simple fibroadenomas (SFAs). However, due to varied histopathologic characteristics and components, several variants of fibroadenomas have been described, including juvenile, giant, complex, myxoid, cellular, and hyalinised fibroadenomas.

The diagnoses of these variants are crucial as they have different clinical behaviours, potentials for malignant transformation, and treatment strategies. We present imaging findings of SFAs and other variants of fibroadenomas. To our knowledge, there is no review in which imaging findings of all fibroadenoma variants are presented together.

### Indications for diagnostic open biopsy of mammographic screen-detected lesions preoperatively diagnosed as fibroadenomas by needle biopsy and their outcomes [^116MQpRY]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to identify the clinical, radiological, and histopathological factors that led to a diagnostic open biopsy of mammographic screen-detected lesions, which were preoperatively diagnosed as fibroadenomas by needle biopsy.

Materials and methods: BreastScreen WA data over a ten-year period, from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2008, was reviewed.

Among the 760,027 women screened in Western Australia between 1999 and 2008, 31 had either a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or a core biopsy (CB) diagnosing a fibroadenoma and subsequently underwent a diagnostic open biopsy (DOB). Three cases were initially diagnosed as fibroadenoma by FNA, but subsequent CB revealed they were not fibroadenomas; thus, these were excluded from the present series.

- **Results**: Of the 28 cases, DOB identified 21 fibroadenomas, 2 cellular fibroadenomas, 2 benign phyllodes tumors, 1 malignant phyllodes tumor, 1 fibroadenoma containing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 1 case of a 40mm adenosis tumor with a small 5mm fibroadenoma. The lesions ranged from 5–100mm in size, with an average size of 28mm. DOB and CB results were concordant in 25 (89%) of the cases.

- **Indications**: The primary clinical indications for undergoing DOB included indeterminate histopathological findings of cellular fibroadenomas versus phyllodes tumor (n = 10), enlarging size (n = 4), large size (n = 5), fibroadenomas with atypia (n = 1), discordant radiological and pathological findings (n = 3), patient preference (n = 1), association with a second screen-detected lesion requiring excision (n = 2), and an unknown indication (n = 1).

### Idiopathic fibroadenoma in an elderly man [^112AbcgB]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A fibroadenoma within the male breast remains a rarely diagnosed entity. Though it was once believed that a fibroadenoma could not exist within a male breast, this has now been demonstrated as incorrect by several reported cases. Most have been in individuals with gynecomastia. There are only a handful of reported cases of men with a diagnosed fibroadenoma in the absence of gynecomastia.

We describe a man in his 80s with a left breast fibroadenoma and no features of gynecomastia or hormonal alterations. Based on our findings, we suggest that for men of all ages presenting with a breast lesion, a fibroadenoma remains a possible diagnosis.

### Breast MRI during pregnancy and lactation: Clinical challenges and technical advances [^112uB61C]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Lactating adenoma represents a benign stromal alteration with a tendency to regress upon breastfeeding cessation. It is the most prevalent breast lesion occurring during pregnancy, usually appearing during the third trimester or during lactation, as a painless, palpable, and mobile breast lump.

Typical ultrasound features of lactating adenoma favor a benign mass, including a solid, ovoid, well-defined, and wider-than-tall lesion with a homogeneous and hypoechoic appearance, alongside posterior acoustic enhancement. On MRI, lactating adenoma has been described as fibroadenoma-like: a well-circumscribed mass containing hypointense septa, causing mass effect by displacing the adjacent normal breast parenchyma and the main galactiferous ducts of the nipple-areolar complex.

Herein, we present another representative MRI case of a biopsy-confirmed lactating adenoma. Our findings suggest that lactating adenoma may exhibit benign features in enhancement kinetics on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.

- **Figure 5**: MRI of lactating adenoma. MR images of a patient presented with a palpable mass on the left breast 2 months after breastfeeding cessation are shown. The T2-weighted image depicts a hypo-intense mass (a), exhibiting gradual enhancement and early and late DCE (b, c), below the signal intensity threshold for suspicious findings on CAD (d). Despite these benign features, a vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed, revealing lactating adenoma.

### Radiologic-pathologic correlation of fibroepithelial lesions: A pictorial review [^114KAevX]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Fibroepithelial lesions (FEL) of the breast encompass a spectrum of masses ranging from benign to malignant. Although these lesions are on the same biologic spectrum, differences in their clinical behavior necessitate different management approaches. Small size (less than 3 cm), oval shape, circumscribed margins, growth in diameter of less than 20% in six months, and homogeneous echotexture on ultrasound (US) favor fibroadenoma (FA). Conversely, a larger size (3 cm or larger), rapid growth, irregular shape, noncircumscribed margins, and heterogeneous echotexture suggest a possible phyllodes tumor (PT). Histopathologically, increased stromal cellularity, stromal atypia, and mitotic activity characterize PT, while FA typically lack these features.

In this review, we summarize the imaging and pathology characteristics of nonmalignant FEL, including simple, juvenile, and complex FA, as well as benign and borderline PT. We highlight the collaborative role of radiologists and pathologists in informing diagnosis and clinical management.

### Ultrasound diagnosis of fibroadenoma - is biopsy always necessary [^116G7cjs]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

To review the ultrasound characteristics of fibroadenoma and the necessity to biopsy all fibroadenomas in the under 25 years age group, the study details the examination of patients who attended a large district general hospital in the UK between 1995 and 2005. These patients had a clinical diagnosis of fibroadenoma and subsequently underwent a breast biopsy. The reports of the targeted ultrasound for these patients were reviewed and correlated with the histopathology report (n = 447). If there was a significant discrepancy between the ultrasound and the pathology report, the ultrasound images were reviewed.

Out of 447 patients, 357 had an ultrasound diagnosis of fibroadenoma. This was histologically proven in 281 (78.8%) cases. In 75 (21.5%) of these patients, the final histology revealed either another benign pathology or normal tissue. One patient (0.3%) was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that the majority of patients in the 25 years and under age group have benign breast pathology, most commonly fibroadenoma. Modern ultrasound is a reliable technique for diagnosing fibroadenoma when conducted by experienced breast radiologists. Therefore, it is proposed that in this age group, a palpable lump with ultrasound characteristics entirely consistent with a fibroadenoma need not be biopsied unless there is an overriding clinical concern. Patients should be reassured, discharged, and advised to return for further evaluation only if they detect a change in the palpable abnormality.

### Imaging findings and classification of the common and uncommon male breast diseases [^1111RJd5]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

It is a benign neoplasm of the intraductal epithelium with a fibrovascular core. It may present with nipple discharge or a palpable, painless, mobile, subareolar mass on physical examination. Intraductal papilloma is also one of the benign conditions associated with gynecomastia. Imaging findings include a discrete, dense mass in the subareolar region with or without gynecomastia on mammography, and a subareolar, eccentric, elongated, well-defined, hypoechoic mass within dilated cystic ducts on ultrasound. A "stalk" of internal vascularity can be seen in Doppler ultrasound imaging. The differentiation of intraductal papilloma from papillary carcinoma is not possible with imaging alone; therefore, pathological correlation is needed.

- **Benign neoplastic breast lesions**:
	a, b - Intraductal papilloma: Retroareolar well-defined solid nodule (red arrows) within a dilated duct is demonstrated in a 40-year-old patient with nipple discharge (a). Doppler ultrasound shows a stalk of internal vascularity within the solid nodule (b).
	c, d - Myofibroblastoma: Non-contrast CT scan displays a well-defined round incidental mass (blue arrows) in the right breast (c). Ultrasound image shows a circumscribed mass with mixed echogenicity and posterior acoustic shadowing due to internal fat content (d).
	e, f - Pilomatricoma: Well-defined, lobulated complex mass with solid and cystic areas, hyperechoic spots, posterior acoustic shadowing (yellow arrows), and internal vascularity.

Myofibroblastoma is an uncommon benign mesenchymal neoplastic lesion of the breast. It is more frequent in males.

Tamoxifen combined with endocrine resistance gene inhibitors suppresses the viability of tamoxifen-resistant fibroadenoma organoids.

- **Patient-derived fibroadenoma organoid experimental setup**: Experimentation involved patient-derived fibroadenoma organoids.

- **Histological examination**: HE staining was performed on fibroadenoma tissue and organoids with scale bars of 100 μm and 25 μm to illustrate structural differences. The experiment was conducted with three independent replicates.

- **Genomic analysis**: Whole-exome sequencing was carried out on organoids and patient samples.

- **Gene expression analysis**: A heatmap displayed hormone-sensitive and hormone resistance gene signatures in fibroadenoma tissues, organoids, and normal organoids through limited RNA sequencing.

- **Gene set enrichment analysis**: GSEA was performed to compare the estrogen signaling pathway and endocrine resistance in fibroadenoma versus normal organoids.

- **Cell type analysis**: A FACS plot indicated epithelial cell subtypes in fibroadenoma tissue and organoids. The quantification of these subtypes was also carried out on Tt and CD45-CD31- cells.

- **Drug response analysis**: Drug response curves demonstrated tamoxifen's effects on various fibroadenoma organoid lines. The CellTiter-Glo® 3D Cell Viability Assay measured cell viability with n = 3/group from three independent experiments. Data are shown as mean +/− s.e.m.

- **Drug sensitivity heatmap**: A heatmap illustrated the drug sensitivity of tamoxifen in fibroadenoma organoid lines (F111T, F70T).

- **Immunohistochemistry**: IHC was performed for resistance pathway markers in F111T tissues, with a scale bar of 50 μm. A drug combination test showed that F111T organoids with high ERBB2 expression were more sensitive to tamoxifen combined with lapatinib treatment. For this, n = 3/group from three independent experiments. Data are expressed as the mean +/− s.e.m. ∗∗∗∗ p		 = 0.0000034 for DMSO versus Tam (10 μM) + Lap (10 nM).

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^112ZrHew]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The PS 2025 guidelines recommend individualizing the timing of the first imaging procedure after diagnosis for follow-up and surveillance of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, particularly regarding imaging surveillance. Imaging should be obtained at intervals of 2–3 years for microadenomas, 1 year for macroadenomas that are ≥ 5 mm away from the optic chiasm, and 6–12 months for macroadenomas that are < 5 mm from the optic chiasm, in the absence of new or worsening signs or symptoms and assuming surgical resection is not undertaken.

### Management of the clinically inapparent adrenal mass ("incidentaloma") [^114i5Y73]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program convened surgeons, endocrinologists, pathologists, biostatisticians, radiologists, oncologists, and other health care professionals, as well as members of the general public, to address the causes, prevalence, and natural history of clinically inapparent adrenal masses, or "incidentalomas"; the appropriate evaluation and treatment of such masses; and directions for future research. Improvements in abdominal imaging techniques have increased detection of adrenal incidentalomas, and because the prevalence of these masses increases with age, appropriate management of adrenal tumors will be a growing challenge in our aging society.

To address six predetermined questions, the 12-member nonfederal, nonadvocate state-of-the-science panel heard presentations from 21 experts in adrenal incidentalomas and consulted a systematic review of medical literature on the topic provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, along with an extensive bibliography developed by the National Library of Medicine. The panel recommended a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test and measurement of plasma-free metanephrines for all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma; additional measurement of serum potassium and plasma aldosterone concentration-plasma renin activity ratio for patients with hypertension; and surgery for patients with biochemical evidence of pheochromocytoma, patients with tumors greater than 6 cm, and patients with tumors greater than 4 cm who also meet other criteria. The panel also advocated a multidisciplinary approach.

### Giant fibroadenoma of the breast in adolescents: Report of 2 cases [^117C43jj]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Giant fibroadenoma (GF) is an uncommon variant of fibroadenomas that represents the most frequent breast lesion in adolescents and young women. This paper presents two cases of GF in girls aged 12 and 14 years, detailing the diagnostic workup and conservative surgical treatment. Giant fibroadenomas are benign tumors; however, their rapid growth and large size, along with their rarity, may pose challenges in clinical management. Moreover, GF must be excised in all cases to exclude a phyllodes tumor and to prevent later deformity.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: Concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^11661my7]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Phyllodes tumor of the breast is a rare tumor accounting for fewer than 1% of all breast tumors and 2–3% of fibroepithelial neoplasms. Although often characterized by a large size and/or rapid growth, it can exhibit a slow-growth pattern. This tumor commonly occurs in women aged 40–51 years; however, in Asian countries, the average age of occurrence is about 25–30 years.

- **Histopathology**: Phyllodes tumors are rare breast fibroepithelial lesions similar to fibroadenomas and hamartomas. They can range from benign to borderline or clearly malignant forms from the histological point of view. In some cases, distinguishing between typical fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor can be challenging. WHO recommends the diagnosis of fibroepithelial tumors (BI-RADS 3 category) for unclear cases. Both benign and borderline phyllodes tumors are considered B3 lesions of the breast under histological classification, whereas malignant phyllodes tumors are included in the B5b category. B3 lesions, especially benign phyllodes tumors, are the most frequently detected, while only 20% are borderline or malignant.

- **Prognosis**: The majority of phyllodes tumors display benign behavior, with a risk of recurrence of approximately 10–20% for benign lesions, and up to 30% for borderline or malignant lesions. Metastatic capacity depends on histology, with 15–20% for malignant phyllodes tumors. Several studies have also confirmed that involved margins are a strong predictor for recurrence.

### Extrathyroidal radioiodine accumulation in a fibroadenoma of the breast [^113FDtw3]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old woman with differentiated thyroid carcinoma received adjuvant radioiodine therapy following total thyroidectomy and left modified radical neck dissection. A post-therapy planar radioiodine scan showed multifocal uptake in the thyroid bed and left chest. SPECT/CT revealed a fibroadenoma in the left breast. Six months later, an I scan showed no iodine avidity in the breast fibroadenoma, whereas ultrasonography showed no significant change in the size of the fibroadenoma. Altered radioiodine uptake of a breast fibroadenoma can be observed on follow-up scans after cytotoxic radioiodide treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

### Use of BI-RADS-MRI descriptors for differentiation between mucinous carcinoma and fibroadenoma [^11592AzH]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

We evaluated the latest breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (5th edition) descriptors and non-BI-RADS MRI factors that contribute to differentiation between mucinous carcinomas (MCs) and fibroadenomas (FAs).

This retrospective study included 27 patients with P-MCs or M-MCs similar to P-MCs and 22 patients with FAs who underwent breast MRI between October 2008 and July 2014 at our institution. Definitive histopathological diagnoses were made for all of the MCs and FAs.

The latest BI-RADS MRI descriptors for abnormal enhancement, including maximum diameter, shape (irregular or round/oval), margin (irregular or circumscribed), rim enhancement (present or absent), dark internal septation (absent or present), delayed internal enhancement (heterogeneous or homogeneous), and the time-intensity curve pattern (not persistent or persistent), were evaluated.

Additional non-BI-RADS MRI factors related to differentiation between MC and FA, such as age, signal intensity in the T2-weighted image (high or not high), extent of lobulation (strong or weak), enhancing internal septation (present or absent), and the apparent diffusion coefficient value, were also evaluated. One radiologist retrospectively evaluated and interpreted MR findings and analyzed the findings.

Statistically significant findings were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses. Then, three blinded radiologists reviewed the MR images where MR findings had shown a significant association with outcomes during univariate analyses.

### Selection of diagnostic features on breast MRI to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions using computer-aided diagnosis: Differences in lesions presenting as mass and non-mass-like enhancement [^1144pAKX]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Masses typically represent invasive ductal cancers and solid benign tumors, such as fibroadenoma and adenosis. Lesions presenting as non-mass-like enhancement have long been recognized as an important manifestation of certain breast cancers, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Diagnosis of these lesions is challenging because the enhancement of normal tissues and some benign processes, such as fibrocystic change, might show similar appearances.

Radiological diagnosis of these non-mass-like enhancement lesions relies on the common descriptors defined in the BI-RADS lexicon. The distribution patterns are diverse and can be described as focal, linear, ductal, segmental, regional, multiple regions, and diffuse. These lesions usually have fat or normal glandular tissues interspersed between the enhancing malignant tissues, making the definition of boundaries difficult.

A literature review of breast MRI diagnosis for non-mass lesions based on the BI-RADS lexicon shows a wide variation. For example, ductal enhancement is considered suspicious for cancer with a positive predictive value (PPV) ranging from 26% to 58.5%. Segmental enhancement has a PPV ranging from 67% to 100% for carcinoma. While these distribution patterns may be easily assessed by visual examination, they are difficult to evaluate quantitatively. Furthermore, when the boundary cannot be well defined, although some mathematical formulae could be used to calculate the shape parameters (as used for masses), they might not be reliable. Therefore, we chose not to analyze the shape features.

### Trends in the diagnosis of phyllodes tumors and fibroadenomas before and after release of who classification standards [^111FD1Rc]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) released diagnostic criteria for grading phyllodes tumors based on histologic features. This study sought to examine the application of the WHO criteria and the changing epidemiology of fibroepithelial tumors.

A retrospective review of surgically excised fibroepithelial lesions from 2007 to 2017 at a single tertiary care institution was conducted. Data regarding the WHO criteria (tumor border, stromal cellularity, stromal cell atypia, stromal overgrowth, mitotic activity) and traditional descriptors (leaf-like architecture, periductal stromal condensation) were collected. Clinical and pathologic characteristics of cases with diagnoses determined before and after 2012 were compared.

During the study period, 305 fibroepithelial tumors were identified. No significant differences were observed in terms of mean age, race/ethnicity, presenting symptoms, or method of diagnosis between cases diagnosed before and after 2012. After 2012, findings showed statistically significant increases in reporting of WHO and traditional histologic features, a decrease in diagnoses of fibroadenomas (85.9% [116/135] before vs. 70.0% [119/170] after 2012), and an increase in benign phyllodes tumors (0% [0/135] before vs. 12.9% [22/170] after 2012). Patients with a diagnosis of benign phyllodes tumors were significantly younger than those with a diagnosis of borderline, malignant, or non-graded phyllodes tumors (mean age, 25.7 ± 10.6 vs. 52.8 ± 9.9, 40.7 ± 24, 46.3 ± 1.5 years, respectively; p = 0.006).

The expanding use of these criteria impacts the classification of fibroepithelial tumors, underlining the importance of standardized diagnostic practices.

### Malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast: The case for revising who's 'full house' diagnostic criteria [^113r5gb4]. Histopathology (2025). Low credibility.

Recent reports have suggested that the strict requirement of the WHO Breast Tumour Classification — that all histological features of malignancy need to be present to categorize a phyllodes tumour (PT) as malignant — has led to some tumours with the potential for metastasis being assigned to the borderline group. The concern is that the WHO criteria may be too rigid, resulting in underdiagnosis of malignancy in tumours that have higher metastatic potential, with attendant prognostic and management implications.

It is also evident that some pathologists apply these criteria more stringently than others, influenced by individual cases and personal practice experiences, leading to varying approaches in classifying PTs that exhibit some, but not all, histological features of malignancy. Consequently, some pathologists diagnose malignant PTs even when they do not fulfill all the WHO criteria for malignancy. For example, in the recent study by Turashvili et al. of 65 PTs classified as malignant, 89% showed at least focally permeative borders, 61.5% displayed marked stromal cellularity, 58.5% revealed marked atypia, 77% harboured ≥ 10 mitoses per 10 high‐power fields, and 86% demonstrated stromal overgrowth. This implies that not all cases met the 'full house' WHO malignant criteria. A previous survey of 213 pathologists (not all of whom were subspecialised breast pathologists) from 29 countries also indicated that 49% of respondents would diagnose malignant PTs when some, but not all, of the WHO histological criteria for malignancy were present, with varying importance given to various parameters used.

### An atypical growth of a giant fibroadenoma after trauma [^111hyHvM]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast lesion in female adolescents. However, it is important to recognize that a small percentage have been shown to progress to giant fibroadenomas. Giant fibroadenomas can spontaneously infarct, leading to significant morbidity, and are also difficult to distinguish from the more aggressive phyllodes tumors.

- **Case**: We describe the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of a 12-year-old girl who presented with a giant fibroadenoma complicated by a central infarct and an intra-lesional hemorrhage due to trauma to the breast.

- **Summary and Conclusion**: The complicated giant fibroadenoma with an intra-lesional hemorrhage has characteristics of both benign and malignant lesions and is difficult to distinguish by history and physical examination alone. Ultrasonography is a valuable tool, yet the core needle biopsy remains the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis.

### Metformin as a new option in the medical management of breast fibroadenoma; a randomized clinical trial [^111tUDgN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this is the first study that evaluates the effect of metformin (MF) as a management option in breast fibroadenoma (FA). The results suggest a favorable effect, especially in women with multiple FAs. Furthermore, the effect of MF was significantly noticeable, particularly in small masses. Larger studies using higher doses of MF and including a separate design for patients with single or multiple FAs are suggested to confirm this effect.

### Malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast: The case for revising who's 'full house' diagnostic criteria [^1177itMD]. Histopathology (2025). Low credibility.

Histological criteria associated with metastatic behaviour

Many studies assessing metastatic behaviour in phyllodes tumours (PTs) have focused on individual histological criteria predictive of metastasis, which include stromal overgrowth, severe nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic count, infiltrative margins, large tumor size, necrosis, and malignant heterologous elements. Age less than 35 years has also been associated with increased metastatic likelihood. A recent study reported that marked cellular atypia and heterologous differentiation significantly correlated with recurrent behaviour, with metastases observed in malignant tumours.

Subjectivity in interpreting histological criteria has compounded the difficulty in grading PTs, with terms such as 'mild', 'moderate', and 'marked/severe' used to quantify the degree of stromal hypercellularity, and 'atypia' also requiring clarity. Stromal overgrowth is another feature that may benefit from additional detail in its definition. This refers to a disproportionate proliferation of stroma, more frequently observed in stroma-rich borderline and malignant PTs. Assuming a microscope eyepiece field diameter of 22 mm, common in many contemporary microscopes, stromal overgrowth in excision specimens is defined as an area equal to or greater than 23 mm² (equivalent to that of a 40× magnification, using a 4× objective and a 10× eyepiece). Stromal expansion, which is not specifically defined, is a term used by some pathologists to describe increased stromal areas without epithelium but not fulfilling the definition of stromal overgrowth; that is, the stromal area is less than 23 mm².

### Malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast: The case for revising who's 'full house' diagnostic criteria [^116oQjEA]. Histopathology (2025). Low credibility.

A proposed revised approach to diagnosing malignant phyllodes tumours suggests that while an immediate major change to the WHO classification criteria for malignant phyllodes tumours may be premature, it is crucial to adopt a pragmatic approach. This approach aims to reduce the possibility of underdiagnosing phyllodes tumours with metastatic capability and improve the consistency of reporting among a broader community while preserving the framework of the WHO classification.

The WHO definition for malignant phyllodes tumours incorporates a rigorous set of histological criteria to ensure diagnostic concordance. However, it may undergrade some biologically aggressive tumours that do not demonstrate the complete set of malignant histological parameters, thus classifying them as borderline grade with the potential of undertreatment.

Considering reports of metastatic behaviour observed in some borderline phyllodes tumours, which are graded according to WHO criteria and associated with variable combinations of histological features (not 'full house'), a practical suggestion would be to consider a malignant diagnosis when four of the five WHO histological parameters of malignancy are fulfilled. This approach is supported by our survey findings, which indicate that a non-consensus majority of pathologists would designate a tumour as malignant when four out of the five histological criteria are adverse.

Descriptive reporting with an explanatory comment in such cases would ease the transition from the strict requirement of fulfilling all five WHO histological parameters.

### Thyroid nodules [^11267SRE]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on thyroid nodules:

- **Definition**: Thyroid nodules are solid growths in the thyroid gland that are radiologically distinct from surrounding thyroid parenchyma.

- **Pathophysiology**: Thyroid nodules may be benign, such as follicular adenoma, Hurthle cell adenoma, colloid cyst, simple or hemorrhagic cyst, lymphocytic thyroiditis, granulomatous thyroiditis, or infectious processes. Alternatively, they may be malignant, including malignancy of follicular or C-cell origin, papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, Hurthle cell carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, or metastatic malignancy to the thyroid.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is greater than 65%. The estimated incidence of thyroid nodules in the US is approximately 0.1% per year.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for thyroid nodules include advanced age, female sex, tobacco use, higher BMI, metabolic syndrome, iodine deficiency, history of radiation exposure, elevated levels of TSH, increased thyroid volume, and autoimmune thyroid diseases.

- **Disease course**: Large thyroid nodules can result in dysphagia, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Additionally, thyroid nodules may become malignant over time.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules is around 4–6.5%.

### A vulvar fibroadenoma: A rare presentation of ectopic breast tissue [^112BK9Be]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old woman presented with a 4×4 cm vulvar mass of insidious growth, which increased in size over 16 years in relation to her menstrual cycles. The lesion had a polypoid appearance with regular borders and firm consistency. It adhered to deeper planes without discoloration or collateral circulation and was painful upon palpation and movement.

Histopathological examination after surgical resection revealed a benign, biphasic neoplasm with an epithelial component showing ducts and papillae lined by cuboidal and cylindrical cells, without atypia. There was no evidence of necrosis or mitosis, leading to a diagnosis of vulvar fibroadenoma in ectopic mammary tissue.

- **Figure 1**:
	- (a) Pedunculated tumor (fibroadenoma) in the upper region of the right labia majora, of hard consistency and well-defined edges.
	- (b) Epidermis, papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and vulvar adnexal structures.
	- (c) Cuboidal epithelial cells in a monolayer with apocrine metaplasia, surrounded by a monolayer of myoepithelial cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and centrally located nuclei with homogeneous chromatin.
	- (d) Mesenchymal neoplastic proliferation compressing glandular spaces, characteristic of pericanalicular fibroadenoma.

Vulvar fibroadenoma is a rare benign tumor, with approximately 54 cases reported so far. The origin of these tumors has been the subject of debate, with two main theories. The first theory postulates that these tumors arise from ectopic breast tissue due to incomplete regression of the embryonic mammary line; the other theory suggests that…

### Fibroadenoma of the axilla [^112RVLoo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Ectopic axillary breast tissue can develop any disease that affects the normal breast, including fibroadenoma. The objective of this case report is to discuss a case of fibroadenoma of the axilla in a 23-year-old woman. The methods include a case report and a discussion of the rare entity of fibroadenoma of the axilla. The results showed that the histology was identical to the fibroadenomas seen in the breast and those observed along the milk line. In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of an axillary tumor should include ectopic breast tissue.

### Fibroadenoma of the vulva — simultaneous with breast fibroadenomas and uterine myoma [^111tWQeY]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2011). Low credibility.

To present a rare case of multiple fibroadenomas in the breast and vulva and myomas in the uterus, this study also demonstrates the usefulness of receptor detection as a basis for the indication of antiestrogens.

A 30-year-old patient presented with a history of mammary fibroadenomas since the age of 16 and uterine myomas since the age of 25. From age 26 to 29, she underwent surgery three times for fibroadenomas of the vulva. On the third occasion, she presented with eight vulvar fibroadenomas. At this time, diagnostic tests identified a low expression of estrogen receptors, along with a high expression of progesterone receptors (ER/PR pharmDx; Dako). As a treatment, tamoxifen was prescribed at 10 mg daily during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for 12 months. After 18 months from the initiation of treatment, the patient was evaluated and found to be free of tumors in the vulva, exhibited mammary tumor regression, and had a nonhomogeneous diffuse uterine myometrium.

The presence of solid benign-type tumors in the vulva associated with mammary fibroadenomas and uterine myomas suggests the presence of fibroadenomas. Histopathological diagnosis and the identification of hormonal receptors are crucial for control purposes and therapeutic indications.

### Single cell profiling of female breast fibroadenoma reveals distinct epithelial cell compositions and therapeutic targets [^11782oX7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We generated a single-cell transcriptome of human breast fibroadenomas (FAs) and normal tissues to reveal the epithelial cell composition and structural characteristics of FAs, which are distinct from those of the normal breast. Previous studies have suggested that fibroadenomas are biphasic neoplasms, but the cell composition of fibroadenomas is still unclear. Our scRNA sequencing analysis showed that there were nine cell types in fibroadenoma, including mature luminal cells, luminal progenitor cells, basal cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells. We demonstrated that fibroblasts were enriched in stromal cells of FAs, and further analysis verified that the increase in fibroblasts seems to be not induced by higher proliferation. This result was in line with a previous study showing low KI67 expression in stromal cells in fibroadenoma. To understand the relationship between epithelial cells and fibroblasts, we set up an epithelial and fibroblast coculture system and demonstrated that fibroblasts could be recruited by the epithelium of FAs. These data highlighted the important role of the epithelium in the formation of fibroadenoma.

### The diagnostic performance of ultrafast MRI to differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113modrw]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

We executed a study selection strategy that encompassed three distinct phases.

- **Phase 1**: The results of the literature search were imported into reference manager software (EPPI Reviewer 6, University of London, England) for independent title and abstract review by multiple investigators (Y. A. T.M. O.G., and R.K.). Prior to commencing the independent review of titles and abstracts, reviewers conducted a preliminary screening of 20 studies in duplicate, aimed at enhancing consistency among the reviewers.

- **Phase 2**: The full-text articles from potentially eligible sources were retrieved, and three investigators (Y. A. T.M. O.G., and R.K.) independently assessed them for inclusion. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

- **Phase 3**: Three reviewers (Y. A. T.M., and O.G.) independently assessed the risk of bias using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Any discrepancies were again resolved by consensus.

Data were extracted into a spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel 2021; Microsoft, Redmond, USA) independently by multiple investigators (Y. A. T.M. O.G., and R.K.). Prior to commencing the data extraction, reviewers extracted data from three studies in duplicate, aimed at enhancing consistency among the reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

For studies that used multiple readers, the readers' data were averaged for analysis. For the construction of the main contingency table, we used the model in each study that achieved the best results using only UF-DCE MRI criteria, either a single UF-MRI kinetic parameter or a…

### Tubular adenomas of the breast: a rare diagnosis [^114pWcL5]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tubular adenomas of the breast are rare benign tumors, with few cases having been reported. Most often, these tumors present as palpable, well-circumscribed masses in women of childbearing age and are commonly diagnosed as fibroadenomas both clinically and radiographically. Surgical excision is necessary for diagnosis and to prevent continued growth.

Here, we present two cases of these rare tumors, both with unusual presentations. The first case describes a very large specimen — 10 cm × 9.5 cm × 4 cm — with tubular adenoma pathology, one of the largest reported in medical literature. The second case illustrates another rare specimen, featuring a mixture of both tubular adenoma and fibroadenoma pathology. We elected to document these cases to assist in the management of these rare lesions, hoping to enable future physicians to better identify and treat this pathology, thereby improving outcomes for these patients.

### Guideline no. 437: Diagnosis and management of adenomyosis [^115anqpM]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on adenomyosis:

- **Definition**: Adenomyosis is a condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of adenomyosis involves the disruption of the endometrial-myometrial boundary, leading to the formation of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma in the myometrium.

- **Epidemiology**: Adenomyosis is a common condition, with prevalence estimated at 21.8% in patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, adenomyosis is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, infertility, miscarriage, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These symptoms can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. Adenomyosis often coexists with other gynecological conditions, such as endometriosis or fibroids, which can complicate the clinical presentation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of adenomyosis is generally benign, as it is not a malignant condition. However, it can significantly impact the quality of life due to the associated symptoms.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: Executive summary [^115gAJoF]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for adrenocortical carcinoma, specifically concerning the risk of malignancy, the AAES 2022 guidelines recommend considering the use of washout characteristics on an adrenal protocol CT to stratify the risk of malignancy for adrenal nodules when the non-contrast HU is greater than 10 and other clinical risk factors for malignancy are absent. Adrenal protocol CT does not improve diagnostic accuracy for nodules with non-contrast HU less than 10, nor does it enhance evaluation for pheochromocytoma.
