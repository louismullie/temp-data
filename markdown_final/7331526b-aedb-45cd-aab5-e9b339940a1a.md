## Question

how much prednisone for alcoholic hepatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prednisone/prednisolone dosing for severe alcoholic hepatitis, including when to use it, how to dose, how to monitor, and how to taper or stop therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining severe disease and confirming indications for corticosteroids. Then, I should verify the standard dose, formulation, and duration. Next, I will review contraindications and pre-treatment screening. After that, I need to check response assessment with the Lille score and decide continuation versus early discontinuation. I will then examine adjunctive therapies, especially N-acetylcysteine, and consider alternatives if steroids are contraindicated. Finally, I should confirm infection surveillance, nutrition, and transplant considerations, and close with a concise dosing summary and tapering strategy, making sure I reconcile any conflicting evidence along the way.

> Let me first confirm the severity thresholds that trigger consideration of corticosteroids, because I need to ensure we are treating the right patients. Severe alcoholic hepatitis is typically defined by Maddrey's discriminant function (MDF) ≥ 32 or MELD > 20, with MELD being the most commonly used score in contemporary practice and MDF historically foundational; both correlate with high short-term mortality and identify candidates for steroid therapy when no contraindications exist [^111MrgXR] [^115p8CV6] [^111Mj3q3].

> Wait, let me verify the standard steroid regimen before I commit to specifics. Across major guidelines and pivotal trials, the recommended dose is prednisolone 40 mg orally once daily for a total of 28 days, with methylprednisolone 32 mg IV daily reserved for patients unable to take oral medications; prednisolone is preferred over prednisone due to hepatic first-pass considerations in liver disease, even though both are used in practice [^111MrgXR] [^111Qtj3E] [^115mtypr] [^115sPX4J].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base for this dose and duration so I don't overstate certainty. The STOPAH trial used prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days and showed a non-significant trend toward improved 28-day mortality, yet pooled meta-analyses of randomized trials demonstrate a modest but significant 28-day survival benefit with corticosteroids, which underpins guideline endorsement despite the marginal effect size and lack of sustained benefit beyond 90 days [^115UuvRj] [^113BW6qo] [^117WZQci].

> I need to check contraindications and pre-treatment screening because initiating steroids in the wrong context can worsen outcomes. Active uncontrolled infection, active gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute kidney injury with creatinine above about 2.5 mg/dL are commonly cited relative or absolute contraindications; guidelines also advise systematic infection screening before and during steroid therapy, with chest radiograph and cultures of blood, urine, and ascites if present, and careful assessment for other causes of jaundice with abdominal imaging as indicated [^1128FW25] [^111bdFbx] [^116s7G9P].

> Let me consider timing, because delays can miss the therapeutic window. Although some centers initiate steroids within the first week, a recent systematic review suggests taking up to a week to thoroughly evaluate and stabilize, with a median time to initiation of about 6.5 days across trials; this balance between prompt therapy and infection control is reasonable, and I should align with institutional protocols while ensuring infection is treated or controlled before starting steroids [^116sPXwA] [^116s7G9P].

> Next, I should review how to assess response so we can limit steroid exposure in nonresponders. The Lille score, calculated at day 7 using baseline and day-7 variables, is the standard tool; a Lille score > 0.45 indicates nonresponse and should prompt immediate discontinuation of steroids, whereas a score < 0.45 supports continuation to complete 28 days; early day-4 Lille has been explored but requires further validation before routine use [^117D53qc] [^112nUZFc] [^1133fe5t].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "taper for 2 weeks after 28 days", but I should double-check that. The standard approach is to stop prednisolone at 28 days without a taper in responders, whereas a taper has been proposed to mitigate infection risk; a recent randomized STASH trial tested a tapered regimen over 4 weeks and showed fewer infections than fixed-dose therapy, suggesting a taper may reduce infectious complications, though this is not yet universal standard of care and should be individualized [^1133fe5t] [^113gLHDq].

> I will now examine adjunctive therapies, because I need to ensure I'm not missing a survival signal. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine for 5 days added to prednisolone has been associated with improved 30-day survival in a French RCT and supported by network meta-analysis; ACG 2024 recommends IV NAC as an adjunct to corticosteroids, whereas AASLD 2020 suggests considering it, reflecting evolving but generally favorable evidence and an excellent safety profile [^115YiGEU] [^116vu4FC] [^1132Uffp].

> But wait, what if steroids are contraindicated or the patient is a nonresponder; I should confirm alternatives. Pentoxifylline has fallen out of favor in recent guidelines due to lack of consistent benefit in STOPAH and subsequent guidance, so it is not recommended; in contrast, early liver transplant evaluation is strongly advised for severe disease, particularly MELD > 26, in carefully selected patients with insight into alcohol use disorder and social support, as this may be lifesaving for nonresponders [^115B8SRd] [^115UuvRj] [^114TmLX9].

> I need to ensure supportive care is not overlooked, because it materially affects outcomes. High-protein nutrition targeting roughly 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day and adequate caloric intake, thiamine and folate repletion, and aggressive infection surveillance with prompt antibiotics are foundational; infections occur frequently and are associated with worse outcomes, and SIRS on admission predicts multi-organ failure, so I should maintain a low threshold for cultures and early treatment while avoiding nephrotoxins and diuretic overuse [^113tTTo5] [^116EDNSw] [^116s7G9P].

> Let me reconsider the overall dosing strategy to synthesize a clear, actionable plan. For eligible patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and no contraindications, start prednisolone 40 mg orally once daily for 28 days, consider adding IV NAC for 5 days, reassess at day 7 with the Lille score, discontinue steroids if Lille > 0.45, and if Lille < 0.45, complete the 28-day course; if infection risk is high or infection occurs, consider a tapered regimen per STASH, recognizing this is an area of evolving practice and should be individualized [^111MrgXR] [^117D53qc] [^113gLHDq].

> Finally, I should confirm that I've reconciled conflicting evidence so the recommendation is balanced. While STOPAH did not show a statistically significant 28-day benefit, pooled meta-analyses and guideline syntheses support a modest short-term survival advantage with corticosteroids, especially in patients with MELD 25–39, and emphasize that benefits wane by 90 days; therefore, careful patient selection, early response assessment, and vigilant infection control are essential to realize net clinical benefit [^115UuvRj] [^113BW6qo] [^113q8d3e].

The standard prednisone dose for alcoholic hepatitis is **40 mg orally once daily for 28 days** [^115sPX4J] [^113s4LuD] in patients with severe disease (MDF ≥ 32 or MELD > 20) and no contraindications [^1128FW25]. Assess response at day 7 using the Lille score [^117D53qc]; stop steroids if Lille > 0.45 (nonresponse) [^112nUZFc] [^113hNE7y]. Tapering is not routinely required, but some centers taper over 2 weeks to reduce infection risk [^1133fe5t] [^116sPXwA] [^113gLHDq]. Prednisolone is preferred over prednisone due to superior bioavailability in liver disease [^notfound].

---

## Indications for corticosteroid therapy

Corticosteroids are indicated for patients with **severe alcoholic hepatitis**, defined by:

- **Maddrey's discriminant function (MDF) ≥ 32**: Indicates high short-term mortality and potential benefit from corticosteroids [^111MrgXR] [^114QfS3g].

- **Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > 20**: Used to identify patients with severe disease who may benefit from corticosteroids [^111daTEM] [^115p8CV6].

- **Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score (GAHS) ≥ 9**: Indicates severe disease and potential benefit from corticosteroids [^1133fe5t].

---

## Standard prednisone dosage and administration

The **standard regimen** is prednisone 40 mg orally once daily for 28 days [^115sPX4J]. Prednisolone is preferred over prednisone due to superior bioavailability in liver disease [^115mtypr]. If oral intake is not possible, methylprednisolone 32 mg intravenously once daily is an alternative [^115sPX4J].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the standard dosage

The 40 mg daily regimen is supported by multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrating improved **short-term survival** in severe alcoholic hepatitis [^115sPX4J]. The STOPAH trial showed a modest reduction in 28-day mortality with prednisolone, although the benefit was not sustained at 90 days or 1 year [^115UuvRj]. Meta-analyses have consistently shown a **survival benefit at 28 days** with corticosteroids compared to placebo or pentoxifylline [^113BW6qo].

---

## Monitoring and assessment of treatment response

Treatment response should be assessed using the **Lille score**, calculated at day 7 of therapy [^117D53qc]. A Lille score ≤ 0.45 indicates steroid responsiveness and supports continuation of therapy for the full 28 days [^111JKxrv]. A Lille score > 0.45 indicates steroid non-responsiveness, and corticosteroids should be discontinued to minimize adverse effects [^113hNE7y].

---

## Duration of therapy and tapering strategies

The **standard duration** is 28 days without routine tapering [^1133fe5t] [^115mtypr]. Some centers implement a 2-week taper to reduce infection risk, though evidence is limited [^116sPXwA] [^113gLHDq]. Tapering is not universally required and should be individualized based on clinical judgment and patient response [^1133fe5t].

---

## Potential side effects and contraindications

Corticosteroid therapy is associated with **significant adverse effects**, including:

- **Increased infection risk**: Particularly bacterial and fungal infections [^115UuvRj] [^117J8Vuw].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Especially in patients with underlying varices or peptic ulcer disease [^116sPXwA].

- **Hyperglycemia**: Common in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance [^notfound].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Including mood changes and insomnia [^notfound].

Contraindications include **active gastrointestinal bleeding, uncontrolled infection, acute kidney injury with creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, and severe psychiatric illness** [^1128FW25] [^116s7G9P].

---

## Alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments

- **Pentoxifylline**: Previously recommended as an alternative or adjunctive therapy, but recent evidence shows no significant benefit and current guidelines recommend against its use [^115B8SRd] [^115UuvRj].

- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**: Intravenous NAC may be considered as an adjunct to corticosteroids, particularly in patients with severe liver dysfunction, although evidence is limited [^1132Uffp] [^116HwqAA].

- **Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)**: Experimental therapy under investigation, with limited evidence supporting its use [^113JyGS8].

## Summary of prednisone dosage recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended prednisone dosage** | **Duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Severe alcoholic hepatitis (MDF ≥ 32 or MELD > 20) | 40 mg orally once daily | 28 days | - Prednisolone preferred <br/> - Assess response at day 7 using Lille score |
| Unable to take oral medication | Methylprednisolone 32 mg IV once daily | 28 days | Alternative to oral prednisone |
| Steroid non-responsiveness (Lille > 0.45) | Discontinue corticosteroids | Immediate | Avoid prolonged steroid exposure |
| Consider tapering | Gradual taper over 2 weeks | Individualized | Limited evidence, not routinely required |

---

The standard prednisone dosage for alcoholic hepatitis is **40 mg orally once daily for 28 days** [^115sPX4J], with prednisolone preferred due to superior bioavailability [^notfound]. Treatment response should be assessed at day 7 using the Lille score [^117D53qc], and corticosteroids should be discontinued in non-responders to minimize adverse effects [^1133fe5t].

### Controversies in clinical trials for alcoholic hepatitis [^115Zm7RH]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is the most severe form of alcoholic liver disease, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Yet, the only available therapies that improve survival are corticosteroids and liver transplantation, with no new drugs successfully developed for decades. This article briefly describes the current state of affairs in AH therapy and examines the practical and ethical challenges of conducting controlled trials in patients with severe AH. While prednisolone is considered standard of care in severe AH, this recommendation remains controversial given the marginal benefits and questionable long-term safety of steroids. Placebo-controlled trials without steroids may be necessary and ethically justified in certain populations with AH who have not been adequately investigated. Ultimately, we suggest that the field will advance with the development of a plausible animal model of true AH, a consensus on a composite clinical endpoint that does not rely solely on mortality, as well as the adoption of the NIAAA Alcoholic Hepatitis Consortia recommendations regarding standard definitions and when to request a liver biopsy prior to study entry.

### Corticosteroids in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis. not so fast: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^116sPXwA]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is rising in incidence with a high mortality burden. While corticosteroids are recommended for eligible patients with severe AH, no guidance exists for the timing of steroid initiation, tapering regimens, and surveillance of adverse events. We aim to systematically review these variables and provide evidence-based recommendations for the inpatient and outpatient management of severe AH.

Approach and Results

We performed a literature search from inception to May 30, 2024, to include clinical trials published in full form and assessed the quality of evidence using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were collected on the timing of initiation, rate, and complications following steroid therapy, and taper regimens in the setting of severe AH. Of 28 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, the median time from admission to steroid initiation was 6.5 days. The most common steroid dosing regimen was prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days. Twenty-five studies containing 3196 subjects reported adverse events, with exactly 50% in the steroid arm and the other half in the comparison arm. Infections, gastrointestinal bleeds, and renal impairment were the most frequently reported adverse events. Most infections occurred within the first month of the study. A 2-week steroid taper was the most frequently reported regimen.

Conclusions

We recommend taking up to a week to systematically and thoroughly evaluate patients before initiating steroids, and vigilant monitoring in the first month of treatment. We also recommend the lowest possible steroid exposure with a 2-week steroid taper and close outpatient follow-up.

Regarding medical management for alcohol-related liver disease, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering corticosteroids (prednisolone 40 mg/day or methylprednisolone 32 mg/day) to reduce short-term mortality in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of active infection.

### Prednisolone or pentoxifylline for alcoholic hepatitis [^115UuvRj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by jaundice and liver impairment that occurs in patients with a history of heavy and prolonged alcohol use. The short-term mortality among patients with severe disease exceeds 30%. Prednisolone and pentoxifylline are both recommended for the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis, but uncertainty about their benefit persists.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design to evaluate the effect of treatment with prednisolone or pentoxifylline. The primary end point was mortality at 28 days. Secondary end points included death or liver transplantation at 90 days and at 1 year. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis and severe disease were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a group that received a pentoxifylline-matched placebo and a prednisolone-matched placebo, a group that received prednisolone and a pentoxifylline-matched placebo, a group that received pentoxifylline and a prednisolone-matched placebo, or a group that received both prednisolone and pentoxifylline.

Results

A total of 1103 patients underwent randomization, and data from 1053 were available for the primary end-point analysis. Mortality at 28 days was 17% (45 of 269 patients) in the placebo-placebo group, 14% (38 of 266 patients) in the prednisolone-placebo group, 19% (50 of 258 patients) in the pentoxifylline-placebo group, and 13% (35 of 260 patients) in the prednisolone-pentoxifylline group. The odds ratio for 28-day mortality with pentoxifylline was 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.49; P = 0.69), and that with prednisolone was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.01; P = 0.06). At 90 days and at 1 year, there were no significant between-group differences. Serious infections occurred in 13% of the patients treated with prednisolone versus 7% of those who did not receive prednisolone (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Pentoxifylline did not improve survival in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Prednisolone was associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality that did not reach significance and with no improvement in outcomes at 90 days or 1 year.

### Glucocorticosteroids for people with alcoholic hepatitis [^113auAzs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic hepatitis is a form of alcoholic liver disease, characterised by steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis, and potential complications to the liver disease. Typically, alcoholic hepatitis presents in people between 40 and 50 years of age. Alcoholic hepatitis can be resolved if people abstain from drinking, but the risk of death will depend on the severity of the liver damage and abstinence from alcohol. Glucocorticosteroids are used as anti-inflammatory drugs for people with alcoholic hepatitis. Glucocorticosteroids have been studied extensively in randomised clinical trials in order to assess their benefits and harms. However, the results have been contradictory.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticosteroids in people with alcoholic hepatitis.

Search Methods

We identified trials through electronic searches in Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's (CHB) Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded. We looked for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trials registers and pharmaceutical company sources. We also scanned reference lists of the studies retrieved. The last search was 20 October 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials assessing glucocorticosteroids versus placebo or no intervention in people with alcoholic hepatitis, irrespective of year, language of publication, or format. We considered trials with adult participants diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, which could have been established through clinical or biochemical diagnostic criteria or both. We defined alcoholic hepatitis as mild (Maddrey's score less than 32) and severe (Maddrey's score 32 or more). We allowed co-interventions in the trial groups, provided they were similar.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed Cochrane and CHB methodology, performing the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5 and Trial Sequential Analysis. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and those of the continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD). We applied both the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses. Whenever there were significant discrepancies in the results, we reported the more conservative point estimate of the two. We considered a P value of 0.01 or less, two-tailed, as statistically significant if the required information size was reached due to our three primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events during treatment) and our post hoc decision to include analyses of mortality at more time points. We presented heterogeneity using the I² statistic. If trialists used intention-to-treat analysis to deal with missing data, we used these data in our primary analysis; otherwise, we used the available data. We assessed the bias risk of the trials using bias risk domains and the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Sixteen trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All trials were at high risk of bias. Fifteen trials provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention). The glucocorticosteroids were administered orally or parenterally for a median of 28 days (range 3 days to 12 weeks). The participants were between 25 and 70 years old, had different stages of alcoholic liver disease, and 65% were men. The follow-up of trial participants, when it was reported, was up to the moment of discharge from the hospital, until they died (a median of 63 days), or for at least a year. There was no evidence of effect of glucocorticosteroids on all-cause mortality up to three months following randomisation neither with traditional meta-analysis (random-effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; I² = 45% (moderate heterogeneity) nor with Trial Sequential Analysis. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of effect on health-related quality of life up to three months (MD -0.04 points; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.03; participants = 377; trial = 1; low-quality evidence), measured with the European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ- 5D-3L) scale. There was no evidence of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment, neither with traditional meta-analysis (random-effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 1861; trials = 15; I² = 36% (moderate heterogeneity), liver-related mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; trials = 15; I² = 46% (moderate heterogeneity), frequency of any complications up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; I² = 42% (moderate heterogeneity), and frequency of non-serious adverse events up to three months' follow-up after end of treatment (random-effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.48; participants = 160; trials = 4; I² = 0% (no heterogeneity) nor with Trial Sequential Analysis. Nine of the trials were industry-funded.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference between glucocorticosteroids and placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events during treatment. The risk of bias was high and the quality of evidence was very low or low. Therefore, we are very uncertain about this effect estimate. Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude increases in adverse events. As the confidence intervals were wide, we cannot rule out significant benefits and harms of glucocorticosteroids. Therefore, we need placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trials, designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Future trials ought to report depersonalised individual participant data, so that proper individual participant data meta-analyses of the effects of glucocorticosteroids in subgroups can be conducted.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^115mtypr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis — corticosteroid efficacy and dosing: In a pooled analysis using individual patient data from the five largest randomized controlled studies, corticosteroids provided survival benefit at 28 days (80% vs. 66%, P < 0.0001). In the United Kingdom STOPAH study of 1,103 severe AH patients, prednisolone showed only a trend for mortality benefit at 28 days compared with placebo (13.8% vs. 18%, P = 0.056). Prednisolone is preferred over prednisone, and prednisone did not improve patient survival in a randomized clinical trial. Prednisolone is used in a dose of 40 mg per day for a total duration of 4 weeks, and methylprednisolone 32 mg per day by intravenous route is used for patient unable to take oral medications.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^115sPX4J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) — corticosteroids efficacy, dosing, and patient selection — Pooled data show a 28-day survival benefit with corticosteroids (80% vs 66%, P < 0.0001), whereas the STOPAH trial showed only a trend (13.8% vs 18%, P = 0.056) and an updated meta-analysis reported a 36% short-term mortality reduction. Benefit is observed in MELD scores 21 to 39 with limited benefit below 21 and above 39, and early bilirubin decline identifies fast fallers (bilirubin < 0.8 × admission value at day 7) who had superior 90-day survival and in whom corticosteroids showed no benefit. Prednisolone/prednisone are dosed 40 mg per day for 4 weeks, and IV methylprednisolone 32 mg per day is an alternative for those unable to take medications orally.

Sixteen trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias. Fifteen trials (one of which was an abstract) provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention). Glucocorticosteroids were administered orally or parenterally for a median 28 days (range 3 days to 12 weeks).

Follow-up, when reported, was up to the moment of discharge from the hospital, until they died (median of 63 days), or for at least one year. There was no evidence of effect of glucocorticosteroids on all-cause mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence) or on health-related quality of life up to three months, measured with the European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions - 3 Levels scale (MD -0.04 points, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.03; participants = 377; trial = 1; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment (random-effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), liver-related mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), number of participants with any complications up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; very low-certainty evidence), and number of participants of non-serious adverse events up to three months' follow-up after end of treatment (random-effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.48; participants = 160; trials = 4; very low-certainty evidence). Based on the information that we collected from the published trial reports, only one of the trials seems not to be industry-funded, and the remaining 15 trials did not report clearly whether they were partly or completely funded by the industry.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effect estimate of no difference between glucocorticosteroids and placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality and serious adverse events during treatment because the certainty of evidence was very low, and low for health-related quality of life. Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude increases in adverse events. As the CIs were wide, we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of glucocorticosteroids. Therefore, we need placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Future trials ought to report depersonalised individual participant data, so that proper individual participant data meta-analyses of the effects of glucocorticosteroids in subgroups can be conducted.

### Alcoholic hepatitis: current trends in management [^116wLP98]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Alcohol consumption is increasing globally, as are complications of alcohol-related liver disease, including the most severe manifestation, alcoholic hepatitis. Despite the increased prevalence, many patients hospitalized with alcoholic hepatitis are either not diagnosed or inadequately treated leading to significant morbidity and high mortality rates. The purpose of this review is to discuss current challenges in the diagnosis and management of this frequently fatal condition.

Recent Findings

Recent studies and meta-analyses have improved our understanding of both the evaluation and treatment of alcoholic hepatitis including the diagnostic criteria, appropriate use of glucocorticoids and other therapeutic modalities including novel disease-specific therapeutic agents and indications for considering liver transplantation.

Summary

Glucocorticoid therapy and enteral nutrition represent the best options for reducing short-term mortality in patients with the severe form of acute alcoholic hepatitis. The efficacy of other medications such as pentoxifylline as currently used does not support a role for use outside clinical trials. While the current management options for alcoholic hepatitis remain insufficient, improvements in diagnosis, determining prognosis and severity and the potential role of novel treatments provides encouragement that outcomes from this devastating condition will improve.

Patients with severe AH and MELD scores ranging from 25 to 39 derive maximum benefit from the use of corticosteroids; careful consideration of risks and benefits is warranted if considering corticosteroids for those with MELD > 50. Response to corticosteroid treatment can be assessed based on the Lille score at day 7 or day 4. Among nonresponders (Lille score > 0.45), corticosteroids should be discontinued.

### The knowns and unknowns of treatment for alcoholic hepatitis [^114LC8sc]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis is an acute, inflammatory liver disease associated with high morbidity and mortality both in the short term and long term. Alcoholic hepatitis often arises in patients with a background of chronic liver disease and it is characterised by the rapid onset of jaundice and the development of myriad complications. Medical therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis relies on corticosteroids, which have modest effectiveness. Abstinence from alcohol is critically important in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, but recidivism is high. Because of the absence of effective medical treatments for alcoholic hepatitis and alcohol dependency, there is a pressing need to develop new and effective therapeutics. Supported by promising preliminary and preclinical studies, many ongoing clinical trials of new therapies for alcoholic hepatitis are currently underway and are discussed further in this Series paper.

Background

Corticosteroids are the only treatment proven to reduce mortality from severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), though the benefit is short-lived. Several potential therapies are currently under evaluation in human clinical trials (Table 1). These therapies target: i) malnutrition; ii) intestinal dysbiosis and its portal translocation; iii) bile acid production; iv) hepatocyte death; v) hepatocyte regeneration; and vi) life-threatening complications of the disease itself.

Severe alcoholic hepatitis — pharmacotherapy and referral: Patients with MDF > 32 or MELD score > 20 without a contraindication to glucocorticoid may be treated with methylprednisone 32 mg daily, but the appropriate duration of treatment remains a subject of controversy. Methylprednisone does not improve survival beyond 28 days, and the benefits for < 28 days are modest. Patients with a contraindication to glucocorticoids may be treated with pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily with meals, though data regarding the efficacy are conflicting. Patients with severe AH, particularly those with a MELD score > 26 with good insight into their alcohol use disorder and good social support should be referred for evaluation for liver transplantation, as the 90-day mortality rate is very high, while patients with mild to moderate AH defined by a MELD score < 20 and MDF < 32 should be referred for abstinence counseling and prescribed a high protein diet supplemented with B vitamins and folic acid.

### Improving survival in alcohol-related hepatitis: what's new? [^114GNhfw]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) is the most florid presentation of alcohol-related liver disease and carries a high short-term and long-term mortality rate. Specific treatment options remain inadequate. The current management approach for AH focuses on early identification, careful screening and treatment of infection, as well as identification of those patients who may benefit from corticosteroid therapy based on validated prognostic scoring systems. In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring novel therapies for AH, which may offer alternative treatment options beyond the traditional approaches. Additionally, early liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a promising option in selected cases with growing evidence supporting its role. In this review, we will discuss the current evidence base for the assessment and treatment of AH, and how these advances are shaping practice to improve outcomes in the UK.

### Treatment of alcoholic hepatitis: is this a "dead-end"? [^114bWvUT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

As already outlined, prednisolone treatment increased the rate of infectious complications in the STOPAH trial. This adverse effect paired with the absence of long-term benefit should make clinicians use prednisolone with vigilance. The Lille model, using common baseline variables and the evolution of bilirubin after one week of treatment, can identify patients at risk of death early in the course of prednisolone treatment thus providing a tool for adjusting treatment. In contrast, use of pentoxifylline can be completed uneventfully and without enhanced monitoring.

Overall, we believe that prednisolone did not show adequate effectiveness to be generally recommended and pentoxifylline may have been tested in a population that did not allow its beneficial effect on renal function to be exerted. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis showed that prednisolone is not the only effective pharmacological agent for AH. Pentoxifylline was also shown to be effective although its use is supported by weaker evidence than prednisolone. We propose that the use of each agent in clinical practice should be tailored to each individual patient's characteristics. Careful selection of drug, close monitoring and early assessment of response (when prednisolone is used) can increase success rates in the treatment of this dreadful condition.

### G-CSF therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis: targeting liver regeneration or neutrophil function? [^111oH6r2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Severe alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening liver disease. Although corticosteroid treatment is recommended and improves survival, mortality remains high and 35% of patients die within 6 months. There is no available medical treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroids. A new randomized pilot trial shows that the administration of the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) improves liver function and 3-month survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. These results suggest a new therapeutic approach for severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Alcohol-associated hepatitis — N-acetylcysteine (NAC) with corticosteroids: In an RCT in France, intravenous NAC co-administered with corticosteroids reduced early complications compared with corticosteroids alone, and the prednisolone plus NAC arm improved 1-month mortality versus prednisolone plus placebo (8% versus 24%; P = 0.006), although this benefit was not seen at 3 or 6 months; because 6-month mortality was the primary endpoint, the study was considered a negative trial. A network meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (2,621 patients) also supported adding NAC, showing survival benefit beyond corticosteroids alone (relative risk 0.28; 95% credible interval 0.10–0.69). In summary, prednisolone plus NAC should be considered as promising, but requires further validation.

### Prednisolone with vs without pentoxifylline and survival of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis: a randomized clinical trial [^111AEfE7]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prednisolone or pentoxifylline is recommended for severe alcoholic hepatitis, a life-threatening disease. The benefit of their combination is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether the addition of pentoxifylline to prednisolone is more effective than prednisolone alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted between December 2007 and March 2010 in 1 Belgian and 23 French hospitals of 270 patients aged 18 to 70 years who were heavy drinkers with severe biopsy-proven alcoholic hepatitis, as indicated by recent onset of jaundice in the prior 3 months and a Maddrey score of at least 32. Duration of follow-up was 6 months. The last included patient completed the study in October 2010. None of the patients were lost to follow-up for the main outcome.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of 40 mg of prednisolone once a day and 400 mg of pentoxifylline 3 times a day (n = 133) for 28 days, or 40 mg of prednisolone and matching placebo (n = 137) for 28 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Six-month survival, with secondary end points of development of hepatorenal syndrome and response to therapy based on the Lille model, which defines treatment nonresponders after 7 days of initiation of treatment.

Results

In intention-to-treat analysis, 6-month survival was not different in the pentoxifylline-prednisolone and placebo-prednisolone groups (69.9% [95% CI, 62.1%-77.7%] vs 69.2% [95% CI; 61.4%-76.9%], P = 0.91), corresponding to 40 vs 42 deaths, respectively. In multivariable analysis, only the Lille model and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score were independently associated with 6-month survival. At 7 days, response to therapy assessed by the Lille model was not significantly different between the 2 groups (Lille model score, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.36–0.46] vs 0.40 [95% CI, 0.35–0.45], P = 0.80). The probability of being a responder was not different in both groups (62.6% [95% CI, 53.9%-71.3%] vs 61.9% [95% CI, 53.7%-70.3%], P = 0.91). The cumulative incidence of hepatorenal syndrome at 6 months was not significantly different in the pentoxifylline-prednisolone and the placebo-prednisolone groups (8.4% [95% CI, 4.8%-14.8%] vs 15.3% [95% CI, 10.3%-22.7%], P = 0.07).

Conclusion and Relevance

In patients with alcoholic hepatitis, 4-week treatment with pentoxifylline and prednisolone, compared with prednisolone alone, did not result in improved 6-month survival. The study may have been underpowered to detect a significant difference in incidence of hepatorenal syndrome, which was less frequent in the group receiving pentoxifylline.

Alcoholic hepatitis — prognosis, current therapy, and research directions: AH is a potentially severe form of ALD with evidence of systemic inflammation that requires anti-inflammatory and supportive treatment to prevent progression and death, and the MDF, MELD, ABIC, and Glasgow scoring systems all predict prognosis accurately; current anti-inflammatory therapy with glucocorticoids modestly improves short-term mortality but is suboptimal, with the 1-year mortality rate 56% in the STOPAH trial and the 4-year mortality rate from the VA Cooperative Study for patients with AH superimposed on cirrhosis 50% worse than that of others with cirrhosis; new treatments need to be tested, with suggestions that very high, short-term bursts of glucocorticoids "should be considered", relatively safe drugs such as NAC or PTX could be used for a longer duration to treat ongoing hepatic inflammation, and VA Cooperative studies documented residual histologic AH after more than a year of abstinence, with continued support from the National Institutes of Health (NIAAA Alcoholic Hepatitis Consortium) noted as necessary.

### Alcoholic hepatitis: diagnosis and management [^117P8dVT]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute-onset jaundice and liver enzyme abnormalities in the setting of long-term heavy alcohol use. High rates of concomitant infections, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is primarily clinical, based on a consensus definition from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Initial workup should include chest radiography and cultures of peritoneal fluid, blood, and urine. Close monitoring for inflammation and organ failure is crucial throughout hospitalization. Laboratory-based prognostic scores, including Maddrey Discriminant Function and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, help determine disease severity and treatment options. Treatment for moderate disease primarily consists of supportive care, including alcohol cessation and nutritional support. Corticosteroids are recommended for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy should be evaluated using the Lille score on day 7 of treatment. Hospital physicians should involve a multidisciplinary team, including substance abuse specialists, gastroenterologists or hepatologists, nephrologists, dietitians, and intensivists, as appropriate. Long-term follow-up should focus on abstinence from alcohol, management of underlying cirrhosis, and evaluation for liver transplantation if indicated. Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder can aid patients in maintaining abstinence from alcohol. The presence of underlying cirrhosis and continued alcohol use negatively impact long-term prognosis.

The study STASH was published by Anand V Kulkarni and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Am J Gastroenterol. This study is related to the following diseases: Alcohol-related liver disease. In the STASH study, the trial question was: what is the role of a tapered prednisolone regimen in patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis? In the STASH study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STASH study, the population was: 254 patients (5 female, 249 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis. In the STASH study, the interventions were: n = 127 tapered-dose prednisolone (40 mg/day, tapered by 10 mg each week over 4 weeks) n = 127 fixed-dose prednisolone (40 mg/day for 4 weeks). In the STASH study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of infection on day 90 (19.7% vs. 33.1%; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.94). In the STASH study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in microbiologically proven infection (8.6% vs. 19%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.83). In the STASH study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the STASH study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis, tapered-dose prednisolone was superior to fixed-dose prednisolone with respect to the rate of infection on day 90.

### Treatment of alcoholic hepatitis: is this a "dead-end"? [^114yERg1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by jaundice and liver failure that develops in subjects with chronic and active alcohol abuse. The short-term mortality in patients with severe disease, as defined by the Maddrey's discriminant function, exceeds 30%. Up to now, only two drugs, prednisolone and pentoxifylline, have shown some efficacy for the treatment of this condition. In a Cochrane meta-analysis published in 2008, glucocorticoids showed a non-significant trend toward a benefit in mortality. However, a later reanalysis of the five largest studies that evaluated glucocorticoids indicated a significant benefit. On the other hand, pentoxifylline has been shown to significantly increase survival in patients with severe AH, without any serious adverse effects. This favorable outcome is mediated through a decrease in the rate of hepatorenal syndrome. Controversy over the treatment of choice for AH persists for many years as neither drug has convincingly shown superiority. This trial -the STOPAH trial- evaluating the effect of treatment of AH with prednisolone or pentoxifylline has long been awaited with eagerness as it was expected to answer the question which drug is more efficient.

STOPAH trial was a large (1103 patients), multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial using a 2-by-2 factorial design. Four arms (placebo, prednisolone, pentoxifylline and prednisolone plus pentoxifylline) were incorporated. All drugs were prescribed for 28 days at doses of 40 mg daily for prednisolone and 400 mg three times daily for pentoxifylline. Patients with renal failure (serum creatinine > 5.7 mg/dL or requiring renal replacement therapy) or other dismal characteristics such as untreated sepsis were excluded from the trial. All patients were followed for 12 months or until their death with the exception of patients enrolled at the end of the trial. The primary endpoint was mortality at 28 days and secondary endpoints included mortality or liver transplantation at 90 days and after 1 year.

Guidance statements for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) emphasize prognostic scoring, SIRS-based care intensity, a steroid consideration threshold, and alcohol abstinence. Lab-based prognostic scores should be used to determine prognosis in AH. The presence of SIRS should be used to assess the need for adequate care intensity and to modify clinical therapies. A MELD score greater than 20 also should prompt consideration of steroid treatment. Abstinence from alcohol should be promoted to improve long-term prognosis in AH.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^116HwqAA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an adjuvant to prednisolone in alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) — Two studies evaluating NAC as an adjuvant to prednisolone showed divergent results, with one showing improved survival at 1 month (but not at 3 and 6 months) and another without 30-day survival benefit; both studies were of modest sample size and had differences in MELD scores between treatment groups (29.2 ± 6.3 vs 25.5 ± 6.4, P = 0.03), limiting interpretation. Based on this evidence and considering its excellent safety profile, ACG has recommended that IV NAC may be used as an adjuvant to steroids; however, other society guidelines have not included such a recommendation, and additional clinical trials are ongoing.

### Infections in severe alcoholic hepatitis [^111pGh8v]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Although the treatment for AH continues to be debated, corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day), the most widely used treatment, showed a 14% reduction in 1-month mortality in sAH (defined by mDF ≥ 32) based on a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (RCT). On the other hand, pentoxifylline, compared with placebo in a small trial, has shown encouraging results in reducing mortality, mainly by preventing hepatorenal syndrome. Recently, a large-scale RCT (STOPAH) showed that corticosteroids significantly improved survival at 28 days when compared to placebo and after adjustment for different severity factors, whereas pentoxifylline had no significant effect. The survival benefit from corticosteroids was not maintained at 90 days or 1 year. Although discrepancies persist, current guidelines recommend the use of corticosteroids in sAH, in the absence of contraindications such as uncontrolled infection, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or hepatorenal syndrome. The Lille score (freely available calculator on), assessing the response after seven days of corticosteroid treatment, offers an additional prognostication tool by identifying the subgroup of patients who will benefit from a 28-day corticosteroid treatment. Responders to corticosteroids, defined by a Lille score < 0.45, have an excellent prognosis (85% survival at 6 months), while non-responders (Lille score ≥ 0.45), who represent nearly 40% of treated sAH patients, demonstrate substantially lower survival rates (25% at 6 months). The cessation of corticosteroids is recommended in these non-responders after one week of treatment. Currently, no alternative therapeutic intervention has been effective in reducing mortality in non-responders. A multicenter study showed that highly selected transplanted non-responders had significantly higher 6-month survival rates than non-responder controls (77% vs. 23%, P < 0.001) and similar ones to responders. Considering that, using stringent criteria for patient selection, alcohol relapse occurred rarely and the donor pool was minimally affected, this strategy seems to be gaining ground worldwide.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcoholic hepatitis [^114MeRu5]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is increasing in incidence in the UK. It is the commonest cause of liver-related deaths, predominantly in people below the age of 60. Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is an acute form of ALD with high mortality when severe. Jaundice and coagulopathy are clinical hallmarks of severe AH. Histology findings are characterised by parenchymal inflammation and hepatocellular damage although biopsy is only required when diagnostic uncertainty exists; clinical findings are usually sufficient for accurate diagnosis. Patients with AH should be stratified as non-severe or severe using non-invasive scoring systems such as the discriminant function or the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score. In patients with non-severe AH, abstinence is the mainstay of treatment, and it is important that steps are taken to help patients stop drinking. Severe AH requires specialist treatment. Consensus guidelines recommend the use of prednisolone although this remains subject to clinical trials. Pentoxifylline may have a survival benefit if corticosteroids are contraindicated. Nutritional support and N-acetylcysteine should be considered for use in conjunction with corticosteroids although evidence of benefit is not conclusive. Patients with severe disease who do not respond to therapy within a week have a very poor outcome. Recent data have shown a survival benefit of liver transplantation in this group although this remains experimental at present. Current and future research should focus on targeted therapies for severe AH and those who fail first-line treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116s7G9P]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated hepatitis — evaluation of corticosteroid contraindications and timing: Because infections are common and can mimic presentation, providers should obtain corresponding cultures and a chest radiograph on presentation, and abdominal imaging is important to evaluate for other causes of jaundice. Sufficient time should be allowed to assess infection or other contraindications, with trials initiating prednisolone within 6 days of presentation. If infection is present, appropriate antibiotics should be provided and, once controlled, corticosteroids should be started immediately. Although severe infections have been reported, the presence of infection alone has not been shown to be a driver of short-term mortality, and response to corticosteroids based on the Lille score is significantly associated with improved survival despite infection. Evidence for corticosteroids in acute kidney injury (AKI) is lacking; if AKI can be resolved, corticosteroid treatment should be reconsidered. Regarding gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), a retrospective cohort (n = 105) found 55% presented with GIB; prednisolone was started a mean of 5 days after bleeding, with no differences in survival at 1, 3, and 6 months versus those without GIB. The study suggests GIB is not an absolute contraindication and that after control of GIB, prednisolone can be given safely.

### Antioxidants versus corticosteroids in the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis – a randomised clinical trial [^113V53br]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Severe alcoholic hepatitis is associated with high morbidity and short-term mortality. Corticosteroids are the only widely used therapy but established contraindications to treatment or the risk of serious side-effects limit their use. The perceived need for alternative treatments together with the theoretical benefits of anti-oxidant therapy triggered the design of a randomised clinical trial comparing these treatment modalities.

Methods

One hundred and one patients were randomized into a clinical trial of corticosteroids or a novel antioxidant cocktail with a primary endpoint of 30-day mortality.

Results

At 30 days there were 16 deaths (30%) in the corticosteroid treated group compared with 22 deaths (46%) in the antioxidant treated group (P = 0.05). The odds of dying by 30 days were 2.4 greater for patients on antioxidants (95% confidence interval 1.0–5.6). A diagnosis of sepsis was made more frequently in the AO group (P = 0.05), although microbiologically proven episodes of infection occurred more often in the CS group (P < 0.01). The survival advantage for corticosteroid treated patients was lost at 1 year of follow-up (P = 0.43).

Conclusions

This study has shown that corticosteroids in the form of prednisolone 30 mg daily are superior to a broad antioxidant cocktail in the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and network evidence — In patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), prednisolone 40 mg daily plus NAC had a mortality rate of 8% compared with 24% for prednisolone alone, with fewer infections 19% vs 42% in 6 months (P = 0.001) and a lower incidence of hepatorenal syndrome 12% vs 25% (P = 0.02); these important findings remain to be confirmed by additional studies. Using network meta-analysis, various treatments from 22 recent trials involving 2621 patients with severe AH were compared, and on the basis of moderate-quality evidence glucocorticoids alone or in combination with PTX or NAC were shown to reduce 28-day, but not 90-day, mortality; on the basis of lower-quality evidence, PTX alone was also shown to reduce 28-day, but not 90-day, mortality.

### Identification of optimal therapeutic window for steroid use in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis: a worldwide study [^113q8d3e]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Corticosteroids are the only effective therapy for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), defined by a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > 20. However, there are patients who may be too sick to benefit from therapy. Herein, we aimed to identify the range of MELD scores within which steroids are effective for AH.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, international multicenter cohort study across 4 continents, including 3,380 adults with a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of AH. The main outcome was mortality at 30 days. We used a discrete-time survival analysis model, and MELD cut-offs were established using the transform-the-endpoints method.

Results

In our cohort, median age was 49 (40–56) years, 76.5% were male, and 79% had underlying cirrhosis. Median MELD at admission was 24 (19–29). Survival was 88% (87–89) at 30 days, 77% (76–78) at 90 days, and 72% (72–74) at 180 days. A total of 1,225 patients received corticosteroids. In an adjusted-survival-model, corticosteroid use decreased 30-day mortality by 41% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59; 0.47–0.74; p < 0.001). Steroids only improved survival in patients with MELD scores between 21 (HR 0.61; 0.39–0.95; p = 0.027) and 51 (HR 0.72; 0.52–0.99; p = 0.041). The maximum effect of corticosteroid treatment (21–30% survival benefit) was observed with MELD scores between 25 (HR 0.58; 0.42–0.77; p < 0.001) and 39 (HR 0.57; 0.41–0.79; p < 0.001). No corticosteroid benefit was seen in patients with MELD > 51. The type of corticosteroids used (prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone) was not associated with survival benefit (p = 0.247).

Conclusion

Corticosteroids improve 30-day survival only among patients with severe AH, especially with MELD scores between 25 and 39.

Lay Summary

Alcohol-associated hepatitis is a condition where the liver is severely inflamed as a result of excess alcohol use. It is associated with high mortality and it is not clear whether the most commonly used treatments (corticosteroids) are effective, particularly in patients with very severe liver disease. In this worldwide study, the use of corticosteroids was associated with increased 30-day, but not 90- or 180-day, survival. The maximal benefit was observed in patients with an MELD score (a marker of severity of liver disease; higher scores signify worse disease) between 25–39. However, this benefit was lost in patients with the most severe liver disease (MELD score higher than 51).

### Recent advances in alcoholic hepatitis [^116sdXgQ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is an acute deterioration in liver function seen in the context of prolonged excessive alcohol consumption and is characterised by the rapid onset of jaundice. The diagnosis of AH has been controversial for many years: it is now accepted that there are clear clinical criteria which can be used to diagnose AH without the need for a liver biopsy. Corticosteroids remain the only treatment proven to be effective in reducing short-term mortality in severe AH; abstinence from alcohol is the most important factor in determining long-term survival. It is recommended a trial of corticosteroid therapy is considered only in those patients with high baseline 'static' scores (Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis score and model for end-stage liver disease). Response to corticosteroid therapy should be assessed using a 'dynamic' score such as the Lille score at day 7, with corticosteroids continuing only in patients with a favourable score. Infection and acute kidney injury are associated with poorer outcomes in AH. Early screening for and treatment of infection is recommended with antibiotic therapy overlapping with any subsequent corticosteroid treatment. A biomarker which predicts benefit from corticosteroids at baseline would avoid a trial of therapy to determine response. More efficacious therapeutic options for AH patients are required with N-acetylcysteine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, faecal microbiota transplantation and routine antibiotics showing promise, but adequate controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy. Liver transplant has an emerging role for some patients with severe AH not responding to corticosteroids and is likely to become more acceptable with improved methods of patient selection.

### Recent updates on alcoholic hepatitis [^116pRHao]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a unique clinical syndrome that affects patients with chronic and active harmful alcohol consumption, and is associated with a high mortality of up to 40% at 1 month from presentation. It is important to assess disease severity and prognosis at time of presentation to identify patients at risk for high mortality and potential candidates for specific therapies. The cornerstone therapy for AH is enteral nutrition and abstinence. Steroids remain the only pharmacological option for severe AH however, adverse effects and lack of long-term benefit limit their routine use. Early liver transplantation is a potential salvage therapy for select severe AH patients. This review article comprehensively covers recent advances on the clinical unmet needs in the field including newer therapies and therapeutic targets, role of liver transplantation, and emerging biomarkers throughout the disease process from diagnosis, assessing prognosis and disease severity, and predicting responsiveness to medical therapies for severe AH.

### Quality standards for the management of alcohol-related liver disease: consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British society of gastroenterology ARLD special interest group [^1133fe5t]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroid treatment should be considered in patients with indicators of likely beneficial response (GAHS ≥ 9; MELD 21–51; NLR 5–8) and without infection

Corticosteroids are the only currently recommended pharmacological treatment. In the STOPAH trial, corticosteroids were associated with a modest improvement in mortality at 28 days, though the improvement did not reach conventional statistical significance (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.01, p = 0.06) and any benefit was not sustained at 90 days. Subsequent meta-analysis supports the use of corticosteroids in selected patients to improve 28-day survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86, p = 0.003), but also confirmed longer-term benefit was lost at 6 months. Importantly, the rate of infection is significantly higher in patients with AH treated with steroids and in those who develop infection with AH, steroids increase 90-day mortality (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.30, p = 0.002). Therefore, if steroids are to be used, they should be used cautiously after careful screening and aggressive treatment of infection at baseline. Furthermore, if a significant spontaneous decrease in bilirubin is observed after 7 days (< 0.9×baseline bilirubin), 28-day survival may not be improved with steroids, and in this group the risks of steroid treatment could outweigh the benefits. The standard dose of prednisolone is 40 mg daily, this is continued for 28 days in responders and then discontinued without weaning.

Response to treatment with corticosteroids should be assessed after 7 days and corticosteroid treatment discontinued if there is no response

Dynamic prognostic scores, such as the Lille score, predict mortality based on a reduction in bilirubin level in patients who have received corticosteroid therapy. The Lille score combines several variables, including age, renal function, albumin, prothrombin time and bilirubin at baseline and 7 days. A non-response to corticosteroids is defined as a Lille score ≥ 0.45, and this is associated with a much poorer survival at 6 months compared with responders (25% vs 85%) and it is recommended that steroids are discontinued in this group. Calculating the Lille score at day four may give similar diagnostic accuracy in predicting 28-day and 90-day mortality compared with the day seven score, limiting unnecessary steroid exposure and reducing the risk of infection, but this requires further validation.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — corticosteroid response, contraindications, and infection risk are summarized as follows: Response to therapy is determined at 1 week using the Lille score and about 50–60% of patients do not respond (Lille score > 0.45) and do not derive further benefit from continuing steroids; the Lille score at day 4 has been shown to be as accurate as day 7 in predicting outcome, and only 25–45% providers report using corticosteroids in practice. Active hepatitis B virus infection and active tuberculosis are contraindications, whereas active infection or sepsis, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and gastrointestinal bleeding remain relative contraindications. In pooled data from 12 randomized studies, infections during treatment occurred in about 20%, with steroid use associated with risk of fungal infections. In one STOPAH cohort with high bacterial DNA levels (> 8.5 pg/mL), prophylactic antibiotics improved survival in corticosteroid treated patients.

1. In the absence of treatment, 50% of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) [Maddrey function (DF) ≥ 32] die 2 months later. Among patients with severe AH treated by corticosteroids, 80% had 2-month survival. Pentoxifylline is considered by some investigators to be an alternative option to corticosteroids. 2. Non-responders to corticosteroids (NRCs) have poor survival and require new strategies. Liver transplantation should be considered in order to improve survival of non-responders to therapeutic agents. 3. Prognostic models such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and DF are useful tools for predicting short-term mortality of patients with severe AH. Specific models taking into account the particular settings of treated patients are warranted. 4. In an era of organ shortage, use of liver transplants in patients with severe AH may negatively affect the public attitude on transplantation and organ donation, and may cause reluctance on the part of clinicians to modify guidelines for alcoholic patients. 5. Therefore, a reasonable approach would be to carry out only pilot studies on only a small cohort of patients to determine whether transplantation improves survival in patients with severe AH.

### Corticosteroids versus pentoxifylline for severe alcoholic hepatitis: a sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112FQLmf]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with alcoholic hepatitis, a consensus or generally accepted therapeutic strategy has not yet been reached. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of corticosteroids and pentoxifylline on short-term mortality, incidence of hepatorenal syndrome, and sepsis in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane library, PUBMED, Scopus, EMBASE, and published proceedings from major hepatology and gastrointestinal meetings from January 1970 to June 2015. All relevant articles irrespective of language, year of publication, type of publication, or publication status were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data and scored publications; a third investigator adjudicated discrepancies. The κ scores were measured to assess the agreement between the 2 initial reviewers. The review and meta-analyses were performed following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration. Conventional meta-analysis and Trial sequential analysis were performed. GRADEpro version 3.6 was used to appraise the quality of epidemiologic evidence.

Results

A total of 14 studies satisfied inclusion criteria comparing corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, or placebo. Compared with placebo, corticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality (RR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33–0.84; P = 0.006). There was no statistically significant difference in short-term mortality between pentoxifylline and placebo (RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.46–1.18; P = 0.21). Neither corticosteroids nor pentoxifylline impacted the incidence of hepatorenal syndrome or sepsis. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the results of our conventional meta-analysis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Corticosteroids demonstrated a decrease in 28-day mortality in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The evidence from this study is insufficient to support any recommendations regarding the mortality benefit of pentoxifylline in severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Alcoholic hepatitis corticosteroid treatment algorithm details that patients are first assessed for eligibility with Maddrey Discriminant Function ≥ 32 (or possibly MELD > 20), obtaining abdominal ultrasound to exclude other causes of jaundice and screening for infection with chest x-ray, blood, urine and ascites cultures. Assess for contraindications to treatment including uncontrolled infections, acute kidney injury with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, uncontrolled upper gastrointestinal bleeding, concomitant diseases including HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV, DILI (drug-induced liver injury), HCC, acute pancreatitis, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), TB (tuberculosis), and multiorgan failure or shock. For the Eligible for Treatment branch, start prednisolone 40mg daily or equivalent with or without IV N-acetylcysteine and target an enteral nutrition goal of ≥ 21 kcal/kg. Use Lille model after 7 days of treatment. For Response to Treatment, if Lille < 0.45, continue prednisolone for 28 days total and support life-long abstinence from alcohol; for Non-Response to Treatment, if Lille ≥ 0.45, stop prednisolone. For the Ineligible for Treatment branch, consider referral for early LT or palliative care, as clinically appropriate.

### Treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis with corticosteroid, pentoxifylline, or dual therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11229zdR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Although both corticosteroids and pentoxifylline are currently recommended drugs for the treatment of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, their effectiveness in reducing mortality remains unclear. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic and adverse effects of corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and combination by using Cochrane methodology and therefore determine optimal treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from their inauguration until October 2015. Combinations of the following keywords and controlled vocabularies were searched: alcoholic hepatitis, corticosteroid, and pentoxifylline.

Results

A total of 2639 patients from 25 studies were included. The treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of overall mortality. Analysis of 1-month mortality revealed corticosteroid monotherapy reduced mortality compared with placebo (OR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.98; P = 0.04), but pentoxifylline monotherapy did not. The mortality with dual therapy was similar to corticosteroid monotherapy (OR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62–1.34; P = 0.63). However, dual therapy decreased the incidences of hepatorenal syndrome or acute kidney injury (OR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26–0.86; P = 0.01) and the infection risk (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41–0.97; P = 0.04) significantly more than corticosteroid monotherapy did. None of the treatments conferred any medium-term or long-term survival benefits in the present study.

Conclusions

Dual therapy was not inferior to corticosteroid monotherapy and could reduce the incidence of hepatorenal syndrome or acute kidney injury and risk of infection. Therefore, dual therapy might be considered in treatment of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.

### Medical management of severe alcoholic hepatitis: expert Review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^113tTTo5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical practice update is to review diagnostic criteria for severe acute alcoholic hepatitis and to determine the current best practices for this life-threatening condition. The best practices in this review are based on clinical trials, systematic reviews including meta-analysis and expert opinion to develop an approach to diagnosis and management. Best Practice Advice 1: Abstinence from drinking alcohol is the cornerstone of treatment for alcohol hepatitis (AH). Best Practice Advice 2: Patients with jaundice and suspected AH should have cultures of blood, urine, and ascites, if present, to determine the presence of bacterial infections regardless of whether they have fever. Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with AH who have jaundice should be admitted to the hospital to encourage abstinence, restore adequate nutrition, and exclude serious infections. Best Practice Advice 4: Imaging of the liver is warranted as part of the evaluation, but caution should be used in administering iodinated contrast dye, as it increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Best Practice Advice 5: Patients with AH require a diet with 1–1.5 g protein and 30–40 kcal/kg body weight for adequate recovery. If the patient is unable to eat because of anorexia or altered mental status, a feeding tube should be considered for enteral feeding. Parenteral nutrition alone is inadequate. Best Practice Advice 6: Severity and prognosis of AH should be evaluated using Maddrey Discriminant Function (MDF), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), age, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and creatinine (ABIC), or Glasgow scoring systems. Current treatments are based on this assessment. Best Practice Advice 7: Presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) on admission is associated with an increased risk of multi-organ failure (MOF) syndrome. Development of MOF, usually due to infections developing after initial diagnosis of AH, is associated with a very high mortality rate. Best Practice Advice 8: Nephrotoxic drugs, including diuretics, should be avoided or used sparingly in patients with AH, since AKI is an early manifestation of MOF. Best Practice Advice 9: Patients with MDF > 32 or MELD score > 20 without a contraindication to glucocorticoid, such as hepatitis B viral infection, tuberculosis, or other serious infectious diseases, may be treated with methylprednisolone 32 mg daily, but the appropriate duration of treatment remains a subject of controversy. Methylprednisolone does not improve survival beyond 28 days, and the benefits for < 28 days are modest. Best Practice Advice 10: Patients with a contraindication to glucocorticoids may be treated with pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily with meals. Data regarding the efficacy are conflicting. Best Practice Advice 11: Patients with severe AH, particularly those with a MELD score > 26 with good insight into their alcohol use disorder and good social support should be referred for evaluation for liver transplantation, as the 90-day mortality rate is very high. Best Practice Advice 12: Patients with mild to moderate AH defined by a MELD score < 20 and MDF < 32 should be referred for abstinence counseling and prescribed a high protein diet supplemented with B vitamins and folic acid.

Alcohol-associated hepatitis — severe disease treatment recommendations: In patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (Maddrey discriminant function [MDF] ≥ 32; MELD score > 20) in the absence of contraindications, we recommend the use of prednisolone or prednisone (40 mg/d) only to improve 28-day mortality (moderate quality, strong recommendation). In patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (MDF ≥ 32; MELD score > 20), we suggest against the use of pentoxifylline to improve 28-day mortality (very low quality, conditional recommendation).

### Bilirubin response to corticosteroids in severe alcoholic hepatitis [^112n5imB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is little consensus on the management of alcoholic hepatitis, particularly with regard to corticosteroid therapy. We aimed to identify those patients who respond to corticosteroid therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.

Methods

We identified 37 patients with alcoholic hepatitis with a modified Maddrey's discriminant function of 32 or greater. We assessed their outcomes at 28 and 56 days treatment after admission relative to their response to corticosteroid treatment.

Results

Corticosteroid treated patients experienced a change in the serum bilirubin concentration after 6–9 days of -23.0 ± 4.7%. Overall, the mortality was 18.9 and 35.1% at 28 and 56 days. Response to corticosteroids was defined as a 25% fall in serum bilirubin after 6–9 days of treatment. The mortality of the non-responders was 36.8% and 57.9% at 28 and 56 days compared with 0% (P = 0.0148) and 11.1% (P = 0.0084) for corticosteroid responders.

Conclusions

Patients with a 25% fall in bilirubin after 6–9 days of corticosteroid therapy have a significant and sustained improvement in outcome.

### Randomized trial of anakinra plus zinc vs. prednisone for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis [^111Da4P9]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (SAH) is associated with high 90-day mortality. Glucocorticoid therapy for 28 days improves 30- but not 90-day survival. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination of anakinra, an IL-1 antagonist, plus zinc (A+Z) compared to prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule in patients with SAH.

Methods

In this phase IIb double-blind randomized trial in adults with SAH and MELD scores of 20–35, participants were randomized to receive either daily anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously for 14 days plus daily zinc sulfate 220 mg orally for 90 days, or daily prednisone 40 mg orally for 30 days. Prednisone or prednisone placebo was stopped if Day-7 Lille score was > 0.45. All study drugs were stopped for uncontrolled infection or ≥ 5 point increase in MELD score. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 90 days.

Results

Seventy-three participants were randomized to prednisone and 74 to A+Z. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis showed prednisone was associated with higher 90-day overall survival (90% vs. 70%; hazard ratio for death = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14–0.83, p = 0.018) and transplant-free survival (88% vs. 64%; hazard ratio for transplant or death = 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.69, p = 0.004) than A+Z. Acute kidney injury was more frequent with A+Z (45%) than prednisone (22%) (p = 0.001), but rates of infection were similar (31% in A+Z vs. 27% in prednisone, p = 0.389).

Conclusions

Participants with SAH treated with prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule had significantly higher overall and transplant-free 90-day survival and lower incidence of acute kidney injury than those treated with A+Z.

Impact and Implications

There is no approved treatment for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (SAH). In this double-blind randomized trial, patients with SAH treated with prednisone using the Lille stopping rule on Day 7 had higher 90-day overall and transplant-free survival and lower rates of acute kidney injury compared to patients treated with a combination of anakinra and zinc. The data support continued use of glucocorticoids for patients with SAH, with treatment discontinuation for those with a Lille score > 0.45 on Day 7.

Trial Registration

Assessing prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — several validated, lab-based scoring systems can be used to assess the severity and short-term prognosis of AH and perform similarly well in predicting short-term outcome (up to 6 months). The Maddrey discriminant function (MDF) identifies a high-risk group with 30%–50% at 28 days when the MDF was at least 32, whereas a MDF of less than 32 accurately identifies those with mild/moderate AH with supportive care. Table-based actions include to initiate corticosteroids if ≥ 9 and MDF ≥ 32 using the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS), and to use the Lille score for day 7 cessation or continuation of corticosteroids.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^111YKHvC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Alcoholic liver disease — clinical spectrum, diagnosis, severity, and management highlights are as follows: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications, and most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with limited data on early disease. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. Alcoholic hepatitis presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute on chronic liver failure with risk for mortality that may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH, and long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures for hospitalized ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis and may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

We present a systemic review with meta-analysis of first-line treatment of AIH to support the (submitted) British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) AIH Guidelines. We aimed to address the following questions:

Is use of corticosteroid (± steroid-sparing agent) associated with better transplant-free survival (compared with non-use), in patients with (a) AIH overall, (b) asymptomatic AIH, (c) without cirrhosis and (d) with decompensated cirrhosis?
Are these first-line treatment options associated with better outcomes and/or fewer AEs than their comparators: budesonide (vs prednisolone), mycophenolate (vs azathioprine) and 'high' (> 35–40 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day) dose prednisolone (vs lower dose)?

### Corticosteroids reduce risk of death within 28 days for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, compared with pentoxifylline or placebo-a meta-analysis of individual data from controlled trials [^113BW6qo]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, or their combination in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. We compared the effects of the treatments on survival for 28 days or 6 months, and response to treatment based on the Lille model.

Methods

We searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Our final analysis comprised 11 studies, of 2111 patients. We performed 4 meta-analyses of the effects of corticosteroids vs placebo or control, corticosteroids vs pentoxifylline, corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids and placebo or control, and pentoxifylline vs placebo. In each meta-analysis, the effect of treatment on the primary outcome (overall survival at 28 days, defined as the period from the first day of assigned treatment to 28 days) was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, including trials as random effect.

Results

Corticosteroid treatment significantly decreased risk of death within 28 days compared with controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48–0.86) or to pentoxifylline (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43–0.95). In multiple-imputation and complete case analyses, the effect of corticosteroids compared with controls remained significant. When we compared corticosteroids vs pentoxifylline, the corticosteroid effect remained significant in the complete case analysis (HR 0.66; p = 0.04) but not in multiple-imputation analysis (HR 0.71; p = 0.08). There was no difference in 28-day mortality when patients were given a combination of corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids alone or between patients given pentoxifylline vs control. In our analysis of secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in 6-month mortality when any treatments or controls were compared. Corticosteroids were significantly associated with increased response to therapy compared with controls (relative risk 1.24; 95% CI 1.10–1.41) or pentoxifylline (relative risk 1.43; 95% CI 1.20–1.68). We found no difference in response to therapy between patients given a combination of corticosteroids and pentoxifylline vs corticosteroids alone or pentoxifylline vs controls.

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis of 4 controlled trials, we found corticosteroid use to reduce risk of death within 28 days of treatment, but not in the following 6 months. This loss of efficacy over time indicates a need for new therapeutic strategies to improve medium-term outcomes.

Alcoholic hepatitis — severity assessment, complications, and corticosteroid response indicates that severe AH "is identified by Maddrey's discriminant function score > 32 or MELD score ≥ 20". At admission, "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)… predisposes to acute kidney injury and multi-organ failure, which are associated with poor prognosis", and physicians "should take appropriate measures to prevent renal injury, such as avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, judicious use of diuretics, and low threshold for expanding circulating blood volume with albumin or saline infusions". "Infections are common in AH patients and comprehensive infectious screen is recommended as part of routine work-up", and development of bacterial infections during hospitalization "is associated with poor prognosis". "Response to treatment with corticosteroids should be determined at 7 days using the Lille score", and treatment "should be discontinued among nonresponders to therapy, defined as those with a Lille score > 0.45". Patients "non-responsive to corticosteroids, ineligible for early LT, and with multiple organ failures, may be considered for palliative therapy".

### Treatment of alcoholic hepatitis: is this a "dead-end"? [^111UQH8L]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Neither drug showed mid- (90 days) or long-term (12 months) survival benefit. However, prednisolone was associated with an improvement in 28-day mortality with an odds ratio of 0.72 (95%CI 0.52–1.01; P = 0.06). In multivariate analysis, baseline age, encephalopathy, white cell count, prothrombin ratio and levels of bilirubin, creatinine and urea were found to be additional significant factors for mortality. In a secondary analysis adjusting for these prognostic variables the odds ratio for 28-day mortality among the patients who received prednisolone compared with those who did not was 0.61 (95%CI 0.41–0.91; P = 0.02). Serious adverse events were reported in 42% of the patients with approximately half of them resulting in death. No significant differences in the rate of adverse events were noted between treatment groups. However, infection occurred more frequently in patients who received prednisolone compared with those who did not (13% vs. 7%, P = 0.002). Of note, infections were the main reason for death in this trial (24% of deaths). Finally, pentoxifylline was associated with numerically fewer cases of acute kidney injury.

The Lille Model for Alcoholic Hepatitis is a prognostic tool specifically designed for patients with alcoholic hepatitis who are being treated with corticosteroids. This model aids clinicians in predicting the response to corticosteroid therapy and the likelihood of survival at six months. It incorporates variables such as age, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time, and evolution of bilirubin at day 7 of treatment. The Lille Model is particularly useful in identifying patients who are not responding to corticosteroid therapy by day 7, allowing for early discontinuation of treatment and consideration of alternative therapies. It should not be used in patients with non-alcoholic causes of hepatitis or those not receiving corticosteroid treatment for alcoholic hepatitis.

### A phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of pegfilgrastim for patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis [^113JyGS8]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) is an uncommon liver disease that occurs in a minority of subjects who consume large quantities of alcohol for extended periods of time. AH is characterized by new onset of liver failure with jaundice, often with ascites, fever, and elevated WBC. AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend corticosteroid treatment, using prednisolone, for patients with Maddrey's discriminant function (DF) ≥ 32. Despite these recommendations, use is debated because of increased risksamong patients who fail to respond to prednisolone. Corticosteroids are usually discontinued after 7 days if the Lille score > 0.45.

Recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) has been used to treat AH with excellent safety but uncertain efficacy. GCSF injections reduced mortality by > 75% in clinical trials conducted in India, associated with a reduction in infections or liver-related complications (eg, encephalopathy, ascites, etc.). The mechanisms by which GCSF might improve survival in AH are poorly understood.GCSF is hypothesized to stimulate liver regeneration by repopulating the liver with bone-marrow derived pluripotent stem cells that can differentiate into hepatocytes and potentially other liver cell populations. Receptors for GCSF have been identified on hepatocytes, raising the possibility of direct activation of hepatocyte regeneration. Finally, it is postulated that GCSF promotes a neutrophil phenotype that responds more effectively to bacterial translocation and infection.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Severe alcoholic hepatitis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) — management priorities emphasize infection control, short-term steroid benefit, and alcohol abstinence. Severe AAH is probably the most common precipitating event for ACLF, and infection is common. Prednisolone is the only pharmacological therapy associated with improved survival, but only at 28 days, and management should include treatment of infection, nutritional supplementation, and support of failing organs. Abstinence from alcohol is essential for survival beyond 6 months, and liver transplantation (LT) may be considered in highly selected patients.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^1162RzjU]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of AH for more than 40 years. The most studied formulation is prednisolone 40 mg daily for one month, with or without a taper. Although the clinical trials suffer from heterogeneity and high risk of bias, a meta-analysis from individual data observed that corticosteroids improved survival in patients with a high DF. This study confirmed the need for adapting corticosteroid therapy to response to treatment. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the percentile distribution of the Lille score. This approach identified three patterns of responses; complete, partial and null, with significant differences in survival benefit: 91% vs. 79% vs. 53%, respectively. Survival impact of corticosteroids was significant in complete and partial responders, whereas it appeared negligible in null responders. This new classification raises questions concerning management of severe AH. There are two issues that should be raised. First, the survival benefit from corticosteroid therapy is transient, as suggested by the recent STOPAH trial. And second, the use of prednisolone increases the risk of pulmonary infections, especially invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, it is important to develop new therapies that offer a sustained response and do not favor potentially lethal infections.

Results of a trial comparing methylprednisolone (28 days) with a combination of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (14 days) plus PTX (28 days) plus zinc (180 days) for the treatment of severe AH showed no survival benefit at 30, 90, or 180 days.

### What is the optimal first-line treatment of autoimmune hepatitis? A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials and comparative cohort studies [^111zDXib]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

First-line treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the 1960s and 70s. In a meta-analysis, prednisolone+/−azathioprine was more effective than placebo and more effective than azathioprine alone at achieving disease remission. Prednisolone plus azathioprine was as effective as higher-dose prednisolone monotherapy, with fewer adverse effects (AEs).

However, evidence of survival benefit from steroid-based treatment was not demonstrated statistically. Also, it remains unclear whether all patients with AIH require steroids. Or whether there are subgroups who do not.

Acute severe (AS)-AIH comprises about 5% of presentations and about 30% of patients require early liver transplant for survival. The efficacy of corticosteroids is not established.

In a RCT in patients without cirrhosis, budesonide showed higher efficacy than prednisolone in achieving normal serum transaminases after 6 months, with fewer AEs. Its longer-term efficacy is unclear. A meta-analysisof this trial and one observational studyinformed the recommendation of prednisolone and budesonide as equivalent first-line treatments in the 2020 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines. However, more information on budesonide is now available.

Recommendations regarding initial dose of prednisolone have varied widely in guidelinesand from expert opinion. Questions also remain regarding steroid-sparing agents (SSAs) in AIH. Azathioprine was shown in early RCTs to enable reduction of steroid dose without loss of efficacy but with fewer AEs. However, it is unclear if SSAs improve survival. Mycophenolate is used as an alternative SSA in patients intolerant of azathioprine, and recently, as a first-line agentand its efficacy has been compared with that of azathioprine in a recent RCT.
