## Question

can a kub without contrast show placement of a tube or fistula. patient is home bound patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a KUB radiograph without contrast can show the placement of a tube or identify a fistula in a home-bound patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the inherent capabilities and limitations of a non-contrast KUB. Then, I should assess which tubes are radiopaque and typically verifiable on plain film, including any nuances of view selection. Next, I will consider whether a fistula can be demonstrated without contrast and what guideline-concordant alternatives exist. Finally, I should synthesize a practical pathway for a home-bound patient, including safety, logistics, and potential bedside alternatives if transport is not feasible [^112qMhYf] [^112JwwUd].

> Let me first confirm the modality fundamentals. A KUB is a plain abdominal radiograph that shows radiopaque structures and gross device silhouettes but does not delineate luminal patency or leaks without contrast outlining the tract, so its diagnostic power is inherently limited for soft-tissue communications like fistulas; this frames all subsequent conclusions and argues that success will depend on whether the clinical question is about device localization versus leak detection [^113qgY6W] [^113GJxZG].

> Wait, let me verify tube confirmation for enteric/feeding tubes on KUB. Bedside abdominal radiography is the standard confirmatory test after blind placement, and thickness-based KUB protocols can substantially reduce radiation dose without compromising diagnostic utility; importantly, a single AP view can usually suffice, with studies showing high concordance for tube location when AP is compared against two-view "gold standards", which is relevant for portable, home-based imaging logistics [^113M1Lmy] [^112qMhYf] [^114DKSZE].

> I will now examine urinary drainage devices. Ureteral stents and nephrostomy tubes are radiopaque and readily visualized on KUB, and routine postoperative or interval KUB checks are commonly reported in clinical practice and series; similarly, Foley catheters with radiopaque markers are typically visible, and KUB can help identify rare but consequential misplacements such as inadvertent ureteral cannulation, which is particularly pertinent outside monitored settings like the home [^114nSXUw] [^115pYg1L] [^116kP29n].

> Let me consider practicality for the home-bound patient. Portable X-ray units can acquire an AP KUB at the bedside without contrast, which aligns with the dose-minimizing, single-view approaches validated for enteric tubes and supports real-world feasibility for verifying the position of most radiopaque tubes in the home environment, while keeping radiation exposure low with optimized techniques [^113M1Lmy] [^112qMhYf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fistulas. I should confirm guideline expectations for demonstrating a urinary fistula. Plain KUB cannot directly demonstrate a fistulous tract because contrast opacification is required to outline the leak; contemporary guidance recommends contrast-enhanced CT with delayed excretory imaging or MRI when the diagnosis is uncertain, and for bladder leaks specifically, retrograde cystography with active filling is the standard, none of which is achievable with a non-contrast KUB alone [^112JwwUd] [^115uyTQD] [^113MJ1yM] [^111Qru1o].

> But wait, what if we look for indirect signs on KUB? Hmm, wait a minute, even if bowel gas patterns or device positions suggest complications, those findings are nonspecific and cannot confirm a fistula; the absence of endorsed pathways using plain radiography for fistula detection in current urologic and trauma guidelines reinforces that non-contrast KUB is insufficient when a leak is suspected, prompting transport for definitive contrast-based imaging when clinically safe [^112JwwUd] [^113MJ1yM] [^115uyTQD].

> I should double-check alternatives if transport is truly impossible. Endocavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound delivered through an existing nephrostomy can demonstrate ureteral patency and even delineate leaks in some settings with good concordance to fluoroscopic nephrostograms, offering a bedside, radiation-free option in select patients; if iodinated contrast imaging becomes necessary, contemporary recommendations stress individualized risk–benefit decisions rather than automatic deferral solely due to kidney function concerns, especially when the diagnostic yield is critical to management [^115PtD7d] [^1159VpLk] [^111pBULj] [^1115pgdf] [^115iuB3g].

> Next, I should review safety and timing. I need to ensure we minimize cumulative radiation from repeat portable films using validated low-dose protocols and avoid diagnostic delay when a fistula is plausible, because deferring definitive contrast imaging can postpone drainage or repair and increase morbidity; early multidisciplinary discussion can prioritize transfer for CT urography or cystography when clinical suspicion for leak is moderate to high [^113M1Lmy] [^115uyTQD] [^113MJ1yM].

> Final clinical synthesis: Let me reconsider the core question to be precise. A non-contrast KUB obtained portably at home can reliably demonstrate the position of most radiopaque tubes, including enteric feeding tubes, ureteral stents, nephrostomy catheters, and urethral Foley catheters, particularly with an optimized single AP view; however, a KUB without contrast cannot diagnose a urinary fistula, which requires contrast-enhanced CT with delayed excretory images, MRI in select scenarios, or retrograde cystography for bladder leaks, necessitating transport to an equipped facility or consideration of bedside CEUS through existing access when appropriate [^112qMhYf] [^113M1Lmy] [^112JwwUd] [^115uyTQD] [^113MJ1yM] [^115PtD7d] [^111pBULj].

Yes. A KUB without contrast can confirm placement of radiopaque tubes (e.g. Foley, nephrostomy, ureteral stents, NG/OG, feeding tubes) [^113M1Lmy] and detect radiopaque foreign bodies or stones [^113GJxZG]. However, it does not reliably detect non-radiopaque tubes, soft-tissue catheters, or fistulas, and it cannot assess tube patency or function [^112JwwUd]. For homebound patients, KUB is a practical, low-risk bedside option; if a fistula is suspected or a more detailed assessment is needed, arrange contrast studies or ultrasound when feasible [^112qMhYf] [^112JwwUd].

## Tubes and devices visible on KUB without contrast

KUB radiographs can **confirm placement of radiopaque tubes** and devices, including:

- **Foley catheters**: Radiopaque balloon/marker visible in bladder.

- **Nephrostomy tubes**: Radiopaque markers/side holes visible in renal pelvis [^111FKVFx].

- **Ureteral stents**: Radiopaque double-J configuration visible from renal pelvis to bladder [^114nSXUw].

- **Nasogastric (NG) and orogastric (OG) tubes**: Radiopaque strip visible from esophagus to stomach [^112qMhYf].

- **Feeding tubes**: Radiopaque markers/strips visible in gastrointestinal tract [^117Svk2F].

- **Foreign bodies or stones**: Radiopaque objects visible in urinary tract [^113GJxZG].

---

## Limitations of KUB without contrast

KUB without contrast has **important limitations**:

- **Non-radiopaque tubes**: Silicone or polyurethane catheters may not be visible.

- **Soft-tissue catheters**: Suprapubic or peritoneal catheters may not be visible.

- **Fistulas**: Cannot reliably detect urinary or enteric fistulas without contrast [^112JwwUd].

- **Tube patency**: Cannot assess function or patency [^111pBULj].

- **Small structures**: Limited sensitivity for small or subtle abnormalities [^1177aDmB].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities for homebound patients

For homebound patients, **consider these alternatives**:

- **Ultrasound**: Bedside assessment of hydronephrosis, fluid collections, and some catheters; no radiation [^116P58kz].

- **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)**: Bedside assessment of ureteral patency and leaks; no ionizing radiation [^111pBULj] [^115PtD7d].

- **Portable CT**: Limited availability; higher sensitivity for small structures and fistulas [^111MQpeu].

- **MRI**: No radiation; limited availability and longer scan times [^113orMDL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines support using KUB to confirm radiopaque tube placement but **recommend contrast-enhanced CT or MRI when a fistula is suspected** or a detailed assessment is needed. For homebound patients, KUB is practical and low risk; consider alternative imaging when feasible.

---

## Practical considerations for homebound patients

For homebound patients, KUB is practical — it allows portable bedside radiography, involves minimal radiation without contrast, and costs less than CT or MRI [^113M1Lmy]. However, its **limited sensitivity may miss non-radiopaque tubes or small abnormalities**, and it provides no functional assessment; patency or leaks cannot be evaluated [^1177aDmB] [^111pBULj].

## Summary table: visibility of tubes and fistulas on KUB without contrast

| **Structure** | **Visibility on KUB without contrast** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Radiopaque tubes (Foley, nephrostomy, ureteral stents, NG/OG, feeding tubes) | Visible | Radiopaque markers/strips clearly visible [^113M1Lmy] |
| Non-radiopaque tubes (silicone, polyurethane catheters) | Not visible | Alternative imaging required |
| Soft-tissue catheters (suprapubic, peritoneal) | Not visible | Alternative imaging required |
| Urinary or enteric fistulas | Not visible | Contrast-enhanced imaging required [^112JwwUd] |
| Foreign bodies or stones | Visible if radiopaque | Radiopaque objects clearly visible [^113GJxZG] |

---

KUB without contrast is useful for confirming **radiopaque tube placement** in homebound patients, but it **cannot detect non-radiopaque tubes or fistulas**. Use alternative imaging when a detailed assessment is needed [^113M1Lmy] [^112JwwUd] [^111pBULj].

### A clinically optimal protocol for the imaging of enteric tubes: On the basis of radiologist interpreted diagnostic utility and radiation dose reduction [^113M1Lmy]. Academic Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a patient thickness-based protocol specifically for the confirmation of enteric tube placements in bedside abdominal radiographs. Protocol techniques were designed to maintain image quality while minimizing patient dose.

A total of 226 pre-intervention radiographs were obtained to serve as a baseline cohort for comparison. Following the implementation of a thickness-based protocol, 229 radiographs were obtained as part of an intervention cohort. Radiographs were randomized and graded for diagnostic quality by seven expert radiologists using a standardized conspicuity scale (grades: 0 non-diagnostic to 3+). Basic patient demographics, body mass index, ventilatory status, and enteric tube type were recorded, and subgroup analyses were performed. Effective dose was estimated for both cohorts.

The dedicated thickness-based protocol resulted in a significant reduction in effective dose of 80% (p-value < 0.01). There was no significant difference in diagnostic quality between the two cohorts, with 209 (92.5%) diagnostic radiographs in the baseline and 221 (96.5%) diagnostic radiographs in the thickness-based protocol (p-value 0.06).

A protocol optimized for the confirmation of enteric tube placements was developed. This protocol results in lower patient effective dose without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. The technique chart is provided for reference. The protocol development process outlined in this work could be readily generalized to other imaging contexts.

### Nasoduodenal tube placement: Are two views necessary to confirm position [^112qMhYf]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Nasoduodenal tube (NDT) placement is typically performed at the bedside, with two-view abdominal radiographs usually used to confirm tube position. Anecdotally, in most instances, the lateral view is unnecessary and utilizes more than twice the radiation than an anteroposterior (AP) view alone.

- **Objective**: We hypothesize that NDT location can be determined using only the AP view, with the NDT position determined on two views utilized as the gold standard.

- **Materials and methods**: A search was performed for all two- or three-view abdominal radiographs from September 2012 to September 2013 with the phrase "ND tube" in the reason field of the requisition. These studies were independently reviewed by two radiologists and scored for anatomical tube position in three different scenarios: AP view alone, the lateral view alone, and both views together, with the latter serving as the gold standard. The anatomical scores were subsequently grouped to reflect clinically significant scenarios. Comparative analysis was performed with the original and clinically grouped scores.

- **Results**: A total of 102 patients and 306 separate two-view exams were evaluated. Of the 102 patients, 55 had at least two separate exams. Across raters, concordances of AP and lateral scores relative to the gold standard assessment were 88% and 73% for anatomical scores, and 91.5% and 86.4% for clinically grouped data. Trend differences for fewer errors were found with the AP compared to the lateral view. There were statistically significant group differences with a greater number of false-negative errors associated with the lateral view.

### When the good old X ray saved the day [^114nSXUw]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Internal ureteral stents have become an integral part of urologic practice to relieve both intrinsic and extrinsic upper urinary tract obstructions. Missed internal ureteral stents pose a serious potential complication, associated with increased patient morbidity. This is particularly problematic in developing countries due to poor patient compliance, lack of understanding, and inadequate administration of stent registries. Diagnosis of forgotten ureteral stents is usually straightforward with standard imaging.

Here, we report a case where the forgotten stent was missed on ultrasound and computed tomography but was detected on a plain radiograph. This underscores the still relevant role of plain radiography in the evaluation of stone disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bladder trauma, specifically related to retrograde cystography, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining cystography with active retrograde filling of the bladder using dilute contrast (300–350 mL) in the following scenarios:

- **Presence of visible hematuria and pelvic fracture**: Adequate imaging is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.

- **Suspected iatrogenic bladder injury in the postoperative setting**: Timely identification can significantly impact patient outcomes.

- **During retropubic suburethral sling procedures**: It is essential to rule out potential bladder injury to prevent further complications.

### Dual-energy KUB radiographic examination for the detection of renal calculus [^113qgY6W]. Academic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The dual-energy radiographic technique has been proven to be clinically useful in the thorax. Here, we attempt to apply this technique to the abdomen and pelvis in the context of renal colic. The visibility of renal calculi was assessed using various dual-energy peak kilovoltage combination radiographs applied to standard phantoms.

This technique demonstrates a higher than acceptable radiation dosage required to optimize the image quality, and the optimized diagnostic quality is inferior to that of the standard kidneys, ureters, and bladder radiograph. The dual-energy radiographic technique could not better identify the radiopaque renal calculi. Limiting technical considerations include the increased subcutaneous and peritoneal adipose tissue and the limited contrast between the soft tissue and underlying calculi.

### Contrast enhanced ultrasound as a radiation-free alternative to fluoroscopic nephrostogram for evaluating ureteral patency [^1159VpLk]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

We compared contrast-enhanced ultrasound and fluoroscopic nephrostography in the evaluation of ureteral patency following percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

- **Purpose**: This prospective cohort, non-inferiority study was performed after obtaining institutional review board approval. We enrolled eligible patients with kidney and proximal ureteral stones who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy at our center. On postoperative day 1, patients received contrast-enhanced ultrasound and a fluoroscopic nephrostogram within 2 hours of each other to evaluate ureteral patency, which was the primary outcome of this study.

- **Results**: A total of 92 pairs of imaging studies were performed in 82 patients during the study period. Five study pairs were excluded due to technical errors that prevented imaging interpretation. Females slightly predominated over males with a mean ± SD age of 50.5 ± 15.9 years and a mean body mass index of 29.6 ± 8.6 kg/m². Of the remaining 87 sets of studies, 69 (79.3%) demonstrated concordant findings regarding ureteral patency for the two imaging techniques, and 18 (20.7%) were discordant. The nephrostomy tube was removed on the same day in 15 of the 17 patients who demonstrated antegrade urine flow only on contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and they had no subsequent adverse events. No adverse events were noted related to ultrasound contrast injection. While contrast-enhanced ultrasound used no ionizing radiation, fluoroscopic nephrostograms provided a mean radiation exposure dose of 2.8 ± 3.7 mGy.

- **Conclusions**: A contrast-enhanced ultrasound nephrostogram…

### Conray [^1169Kwc5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Following intravenous injection, Conray is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. Conray may be visualized in the renal parenchyma 30 seconds following a bolus injection. Maximum radiographic density in the calyces and pelves occurs in most instances within 3 to 8 minutes after injection. In patients with severe renal impairment, contrast visualization may be substantially delayed.

- **Patient preparation**: Appropriate preparation of the patient is important for optimal visualization. A low residue diet is recommended for the day preceding the examination, and a laxative is given the evening before the examination unless contraindicated.

- **Precautions**: Infants and small children should not have any fluid restrictions prior to excretory urography. Injections of Conray represent an osmotic load which, if superimposed on increased serum osmolality due to partial dehydration, may magnify hypertonic dehydration (see warnings and precautions, general concerning preparatory dehydration).

- **Adverse reactions**: See section on general adverse reactions.

- **Usual dosage**:
	- **Adults**: The usual dose is 30 to 60 mL.
	- **Children 14 years of age and over, of average weight**: May receive the adult dose. The total dose is normally injected within 30 to 90 seconds.
- **Higher dosage**: May be indicated to achieve optimum results in instances where poor visualization may be anticipated, such as in elderly patients or patients with impaired renal function. When nephrograms and/or sequential urograms are desired, the total dose should be rapidly injected, normally within 15 to 30 seconds.

### Clinical costs of feeding tube placement [^114DKSZE]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Although small-bore tube placement is common, insertion can lead to serious complications. We investigated the use of radiographs, fluoroscopy, feeding tubes, and complications associated with blind feeding-tube placement.

- **Methods**: The electronic and paper records of adult patients receiving a small-bore feeding tube in 2005 were retrospectively reviewed for the following variables: demographics, desired location (gastric or postpyloric), number of radiographs, number of tubes per individual, time interval between medical prescription, tube placement and delivery of the diet, complications, transport for fluoroscopy, and hospital location of placement (intensive care unit vs floor).

- **Results**: We identified 1822 tubes placed into 729 patients (male: 449, 61.6%; female: 280, 38.4%; median age: 59 years old, range 18–98). All tubes were placed by nurses unless fluoroscopically placed in radiology or placed after head and neck surgery in the operating room. An average of 2.5 (range 1–20) tubes was used per patient. A total of 2696 radiographs were obtained for an average of 3.7 (range 0–32) films per patient and 1.5 (range 0–11) per feeding tube. Successful placement was higher for intragastric (93.3%) than for postpyloric position (60.4%; p < .001). Fluoroscopy was needed in 18.6% of the patients, mostly for postpyloric insertion (p < .001). Respiratory tree misplacement occurred in 23 (3.2%) patients; 9 (1.2%) had a pneumothorax and 4 (0.5%) died. Patients with a malpositioned feeding tube underwent more tube insertions (6.8 ± 5.4; range 2–20) than patients.

### Cystografin [^111DFfkX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Appropriate preparation is desirable for optimal results. A laxative the night before the examination and a low residue diet the day before the procedure are recommended.

- **Dosage**: The dose for retrograde use in cystography and voiding cystourethrography ranges from 25 to 300 mL depending on the age of the patient and the degree of bladder irritability; amounts greater than 300 mL may be used if the bladder capacity allows. Best results are obtained when the bladder is filled with the contrast agent. If desired, the preparation may be diluted with sterile water or sterile saline.

- **Administration**: After sterile catheterization, the bladder should be filled to capacity with Cystografin using a suitable sterile administration set. Care should be taken to avoid using excessive pressure. The presence of bladder discomfort, reflux, and/or spontaneous voiding usually indicates that the bladder is full.

- **Radiography**: The commonly employed radiographic techniques should be used. A scout film is recommended before the contrast agent is administered.

### Detectnet [^111ZjeA9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the event of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body through reinforced hydration and frequent bladder voiding. A diuretic might also be considered. If possible, the estimation of the radioactive dose given to the patient should be performed.

### Limitations of noncontrast CT for measuring ureteral stones [^114BBzuF]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with renal colic are frequently evaluated in the emergency room with a helical noncontrast CT scan (NCCT) as the primary imaging modality. Treatment decisions are often based on the size of the ureteral stones. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of NCCT in estimating ureteral stone size compared with plain abdominal (KUB) films.

- **Patients and methods**: Forty-eight patients were identified who had ureteral stones visible on both NCCT and KUB films performed on the same day. The size estimate was created by multiplying the number of consecutive images on which a ureteral stone was visible on NCCT by the reconstruction interval of 5 mm. This estimate was then compared with the measurements of the same stone seen on the KUB film.

- **Results**: The NCCT overestimated stone size by approximately 30% to 50% compared with KUB.

- **Conclusion**: Counting the number of consecutive NCCT images depicting a ureteral stone is not an accurate method of stone measurement when a reconstruction interval of 5 mm is used. Urologists should consider stone measurement techniques carefully and understand the limitations of imaging studies when evaluating patients with symptomatic ureteral stones.

### Does retrograde treatment of upper urinary tract stones necessitate postoperative upper urinary tract drainage? Conclusions from more than 500 single center consecutive cases [^111WXHTe]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Temporary drainage of the upper urinary tract after ureterorenoscopy for the treatment of urinary stones is almost routine in endourologic practice. Typically, a Double-J stent (DJS) is left for 7 or more days. In borderline cases, a ureteral catheter attached to the urethral catheter may be left for 24–48 hours. Sometimes, a tubeless approach is possible. This study aimed to evaluate the necessity and immediate postoperative implications of upper tract drainage by comparing complications and symptoms during the immediate postoperative period across three patient groups.

A database of 516 consecutive patients who underwent ureterorenoscopy for ureteral and/or renal stones between October 2014 and September 2016 was retrospectively evaluated. The cohort was categorized based on the postoperative drainage type of the upper urinary tract. The collected data included demographic parameters, stone location, number and burden, severity of preoperative obstruction, and postoperative complications. Symptoms during the immediate postoperative period were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) score, frequency, and type of analgesics used. These were evaluated and compared. Categorical dependent variables were assessed using chi-square or Spearman's correlation tests, while continuous dependent variables were analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis.

The results included 196 (38%) tubeless cases, 214 (41%) using ureteral catheter (UC), and 106 (21%) DJS cases. Patients who had DJS placed at the end of the procedure experienced significantly higher stone burdens.

### Outcomes of nephrostomy and double J stent in malignant ureteral obstruction in the Palestinian practice [^1122Qo6U]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

In the decompressive interventions, a double J stent (DJS) involves placing a flexible stent within the ureter to alleviate obstruction and facilitate urine flow from the kidney to the bladder. The technique often involves a cystoscopic insertion, where a guidewire is navigated through the urethra into the bladder and then up into the ureter. The stent is advanced over the guidewire, ensuring proper placement in the renal pelvis and bladder, all while the patient is under general anesthesia and in the lithotomy position. In some patients, fluoroscopic-guided stenting was used instead of cystoscopy, utilizing real-time X-ray guidance to position the DJS accurately within the ureter. After placing a guidewire through the urethra into the bladder, the stent is advanced over the guidewire under fluoroscopic visualization to confirm proper positioning.

In cases where ultrasound placement was unsuccessful, patients underwent percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) via ultrasound-guided puncture with an 18-fr needle, followed by the insertion of a guidewire. A catheter is then placed directly into the renal pelvis through the skin. When the PCN was the primary decompressive intervention, it was performed under local anesthesia, and placement was confirmed by a final pyelography using iodine contrast medium.

The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) 2022 guidelines recommend the use of a simple screening questionnaire for the classification and risk stratification of contrast-induced nephropathy. This is particularly important for risk assessment. The guidelines suggest using the questionnaire to detect stable outpatients who do not have a current estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on file, typically within the last 3 to 6 months depending on institutional preference. It also helps identify those without a provided history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the requisition in order to detect patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or severe CKD.

Instillation instructions - Measure the kidney volume: The instillation volume will be equal to the patient's kidney volume. If the kidney volume is already known, proceed to Section B. If the kidney volume is not known or needs to be reassessed, use the following steps:

- **Retrograde pyelogram**: Perform a retrograde pyelogram using diluted contrast (50%) so that the entire renal pelvis and calyces are observed, and contrast starts to flow below the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ). Record the volume of contrast injected at this point. Allow the contrast to drain from the kidney. This may take about five minutes. Note: Do not withdraw contrast back into the syringe. Repeat steps 1 through 3 two more times, for a total of three measurements to improve accuracy. Average the three volume measurements and round to the nearest whole number. This is the patient's kidney volume.

- **Select the instillation volume**: Select the kidney volume or 15 mL, whichever is lower, as the instillation volume. Note: Maximum instillation volume is 15 mL. Record this volume for future instillations.

- **Chill the Jelmyto**: Place the Jelmyto vial in the ice bath for at least 10 minutes, but no longer than one hour. After at least 10 minutes, advance the ureteral catheter over the guidewire towards the target anatomy in the pyelocalyceal system.

### Intra-ureteric placement of a urinary catheter in the previously undiagnosed duplex ureter [^112p8XWH]. International Urogynecology Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We report the inadvertent insertion of a urinary catheter into the upper moiety ureter of a duplex kidney in a full-term pregnant woman prior to an emergency caesarean section. The patient complained of severe pain during inflation of the catheter balloon. All measures to deflate the balloon and remove the catheter failed. Retrograde ureteric contrast examination showed the placement of the catheter in the proximal part of the right upper moiety ureter of a duplex ureter. The catheter was removed with ureteroscopic forceps. We concluded that congenital variation of the urinary tract can complicate a simple catheterisation.

### Renal and perirenal abscesses in patients with otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts [^113FC4eY]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

We characterized the evaluation, management, and outcomes in a group of patients diagnosed with renal and perirenal abscesses who had otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts.

- **Materials and methods**: We reviewed our experience with renal and perirenal abscesses at the University of Texas Medical Branch from 1991 to 2002. Treatment was determined by physician preference in each individual case.

- **Results**: Of 70 patients with renal or perirenal abscesses, 26 had otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts. Among them, 24 (92%) had at least one possible contributory factor, such as diabetes mellitus, and only 38% had the correct diagnosis at initial presentation. The abscess was intranephric in 39% of cases, intranephric and perinephric in 19%, and perinephric only in 42%. Of the 26 patients, 18 were treated with percutaneous drainage or aspiration of the abscess, and 12 (66.7%) had positive cultures. Eight of the 12 patients (67%) with positive abscess cultures had the same organism in urine and/or blood. All 26 patients were treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. In most patients, abscess size influenced additional treatments, such as percutaneous needle aspiration or catheter drainage. None of the patients required open surgical drainage, nephrectomy, or nephrostomy tube placement. At a mean follow-up of 10 months, all patients had complete radiographic resolution of the abscess without further complications, except one who had pyelonephritis and another who was found to have a poorly perfused kidney.

- **Conclusions**: With accurate diagnosis and minimally invasive therapy, patients with renal and perirenal abscesses in anatomically normal urinary tracts can experience favorable outcomes.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^113aGuFH]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

In this study, agreement between the IRIS image and radiographic confirmation was 93%. These results suggest that with further study, direct visualization of the gastric mucosa by the IRIS camera could potentially preclude the need for radiographic confirmation in almost all patients but may require some improvements to the camera to identify other anatomical markers. Our results and clinical experience in this study were similar to a recently published case series by Mizzi et al. using IRIS to confirm bedside FT placement in patients in the ICU. In that study, 20 unconscious patients underwent FT placement using the device, and the gastric mucosa was identified in 90% of the cases, while airway misplacement was avoided in approximately one-third of patients. In both Mizzi et al.'s study and our own, there was some difficulty with image quality. The manufacturer has since improved the device design to increase the quality of the camera's visualization.

In some patients who were quite anxious about the FT placement procedure, the tube was quickly passed through the esophagus and to the stomach, where this was the first landmark able to be photographed due to the desire to minimize procedure time and patient anxiety from FT placement. It should be noted that all FTs were planned to be gastric in location; in some patients, the investigators noted the pylorus was easily identified and the tube was passed into the small bowel (postpyloric) after discussion with the primary care team as to the appropriateness of postpyloric tube placement.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) nephrostogram: Utility and accuracy as an alternative to fluoroscopic imaging of the urinary tract [^115PtD7d]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To establish the feasibility and accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) nephrostogram in comparison to the reference standard, fluoroscopic nephrostogram, this study aimed to explore alternative imaging of the urinary tract post-nephrostomy insertion.

This prospective study received approval from both institutional and national ethics committees. All patients for whom a fluoroscopic nephrostogram was requested were included. Fluoroscopic and CEUS nephrostograms were performed within 24 hours. Image analysis, including nephrostomy position and opacification of the pelvicalyceal system, ureter, and bladder, was conducted by two reviewers. The diagnostic accuracy of the CEUS nephrostograms was compared to fluoroscopic nephrostograms.

- **Results**: Sixty-two nephrostograms were performed in 48 patients from June 2011 to April 2016 (male: 25/48, 52.1%; mean age 65 years, range 28–90 years). Indications for nephrostomy included malignancy (29/62; 46.8%), benign ureteric stricture (14/62; 22.6%), urinary diversion (8/62; 12.9%), renal calculus (5/62; 8.1%), hematoma (3/62; 4.8%), and pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (3/62; 4.8%). Two nephrostomies were identified as displaced by both techniques. The pelvicalyceal system was visualized in 60/60 (100%) examinations for both fluoroscopic and CEUS nephrostograms. The entire ureter was visualized in 30/60 (50%) with CEUS, compared to 32/60 (53.3%) fluoroscopically. The distal ureter was the least well-visualized segment for both techniques with no significant difference (p = 0.815).

### Metachronous renal vein and artery injury after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy [^116x4CwJ]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is an important approach for kidney stone removal. A percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube placement is an effective method to stop venous bleeding. Occasionally, the catheter can pierce into the renal parenchyma and migrate into the renal vein, even to the vena cava.

- **Case presentation**: A 66-year-old woman underwent a percutaneous nephrostolithotomy for a kidney staghorn stone, resulting in severe bleeding. A computed tomography angiography showed the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube inside the renal vein. The percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube was withdrawn 3 cm back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages with the surgical team on standby. Seven days later, the patient developed severe hematuria. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm located near the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully embolized.

- **Conclusion**: Our case shows intravenous misplacement of the nephrostomy tube and subsequent pseudoaneurysm after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. To our knowledge, this seems to be the first documentation of major bleeding from the injury to both the renal vein and artery. The percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube can be withdrawn back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages with the surgical team on standby, and the withdrawal distance may vary according to the patient and catheter position.

### Does baseline radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder help facilitate stone management in patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic [^11636BgB]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

A baseline kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiograph, at the time of computed tomography (CT) for ureteral stones, might aid interpretation of future KUBs. However, the CT scout radiograph might render the baseline KUB redundant. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of baseline KUB for patients with ureteral stones.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with ureteral stones were retrospectively identified. All had a baseline KUB in addition to CT and were reassessed after 4 to 60 days with KUB. Each patient's imaging was randomized 1:1 into either "KUB&CT" or "CT" groups. Three urologists independently assessed the imaging: CT (with scout film) and baseline KUB in the KUB&CT group, but only the CT (not KUB) in the CT group. Definitive stone assessment on follow-up KUB was defined as all three reviewers answering either yes or no (not indeterminate) to the question of stone passage or migration.

- **Results**: Of 154 stones, the mean diameter was 4.8 ± 2.1 mm, density was 914 ± 300 Hounsfield units (HU), with 54.4% in the distal ureter. Stone visibility was 60.4% on KUB vs. 43.5% on scout film [P < 0.001]. Scout film visibility favored the CT group (52.7% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.027). After adjusting for body mass index, skin-to-stone distance, size, density, and location, definitive assessment rates were higher in the KUB&CT group [P = 0.047]. When reviewers reassessed the CT group using the baseline KUB, they were able to do so definitively in an additional 16 (21.6%, P < 0.001). Definitive assessments were associated with higher rates of stone visibility on scout.

### Prolonged urinary leakage after partial nephrectomy: a novel management pathway [^116w98HF]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

This article describes an original method for managing prolonged urinary leakage after partial nephrectomy. We placed a Malecot catheter in the ureter to improve urinary drainage and therefore avoid the renal percutaneous treatment of the fistula or potential open surgery.

- **Technical considerations**: We performed ureteral stenting using a 16 F Malecot catheter in three patients who had a prolonged urinary fistula following a partial nephrectomy in which the placement of a ureteral stent could not resolve the urine leak. Drainage using two ureteral catheters was performed, which proved insufficient for the urinary fistula to resolve. We subsequently placed in the dilated ureter a 16 F Malecot catheter into the renal pelvis using a cystoscopic approach and a bladder catheter to complete the drainage. In all cases, the urine leak stopped after stenting with the Malecot catheter. At one month after the stenting, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed complete healing of the fistula. No infection or secondary ureteral stricture was reported.

This technique, with a low complication profile, can be used as an additional endoscopic step before more invasive procedures.

### Impact of colloidal fluid on stent failure under extrinsic ureteral obstruction: An experimental study [^113PGGsf]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Drainage of an obstructed kidney due to extrinsic ureteral obstruction (EUO) is imperative. Ureteral stents, commonly employed to facilitate drainage, often fail under EUO; this is usually attributed to external pressure over the ureter that occludes the stent lumen. We showed previously that external pressure and deformation of the ureter alone cannot explain frequent stent failure and speculated that colloids present in urine may play a critical synergetic role. In this study, we evaluate the role of colloidal fluid in ureteral obstruction under extrinsic compression.

- **Materials and methods**: An in vitro ureter-stent model was employed using a latex tube to simulate a flexible ureter connecting simulated glass kidney and bladder units. The ureter was placed in a deformed configuration of 40° with external pressure of 2000g exerted over the deformed region of the stented ureter, representing extrinsic pressure. Four different ureteral stents were tested: 4.8F, 6F, 7F, and 8F. A colloidal solution based on chicken albumin was injected through the simulated kidney into the stented ureter. Four replicates were performed for each stent diameter, and straight stented ureters with no external pressure were used as controls. Stent failure was defined as kidney unit pressure over 10 cmH₂O or complete obstruction of fluid flow. The time to stent failure was measured.

- **Results**: Average failure time in 4.8F and 6F stents was 44 and 66 hours, respectively. The 7F ureteral stent failed in two replicates after an average time of 75 hours, and continued to drain in the other replicates.

### Ct urography [^111MQpeu]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

With the advent of multi-detector row CT scanners, evaluation of the urothelium of the entire urinary tract with high-resolution thin sections during a single breath-hold has become a reality. Multidetector CT urography (MDCTU) is a single examination that allows evaluation of potential urinary tract calculi, renal parenchymal masses, and both benign and malignant urothelial lesions. Initial results with this new technique are encouraging.

Investigations of MDCTU focus on methods to improve opacification and distension of the upper urinary tract — the collecting systems, pelvis, and ureters. The role of abdominal compression, infusion of saline and/or furosemide, and optimal time delay of excretory phase imaging is being explored. Upper tract urothelial malignancies, including small lesions less than 5 mm in diameter, can be detected with high sensitivity.

Methods to reduce radiation exposure are being explored, including split-bolus contrast injection techniques that combine nephrographic and excretory phases into a single phase. It is likely that in the near future, radiological evaluation of significant unexplained hematuria or of known or prior urothelial malignancy will consist of a single examination — MDCTU.

### Comparison of image quality between filtered back-projection and the adaptive statistical and novel model-based iterative reconstruction techniques in abdominal CT for renal calculi [^115yT1o7]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

This study aims to compare image quality on computed tomographic (CT) images acquired with filtered back-projection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques in CT kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) examinations.

Eighteen patients underwent standard protocol CT KUB at our institution. The same raw data were reconstructed using FBP, ASIR, and MBIR. Researchers assessed objective parameters, including mean image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the kidney, and mean attenuation values of subcutaneous fat, along with subjective image parameters like image noise, image contrast, visibility of kidneys/ureters/bladder, visibility of small structures, and overall diagnostic confidence. These were rated using a scoring system from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).

Objective image measurements indicated significantly less image noise and higher CNR for the MBIR technique, as well as consistent fat attenuation values (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference between ASIR and MBIR (P < 0.05). The mean effective dose was 3 mSv.

The conclusion is that MBIR shows a superior reduction in noise and improved image quality, both in objective and subjective analyses, compared with ASIR and FBP in CT KUB examinations.

- **Main messages**: There are several reconstruction options in CT. Novel model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) exhibited the least noise and optimal image quality.

### Clinical characteristics of ureteral calculi detected by nonenhanced computerized tomography after unclear results of plain radiography and ultrasonography [^1177aDmB]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Prospective non-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) was performed for patients presenting with renal colic and showing negative or equivocal results on plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) as well as ultrasonography (US) to evaluate the usefulness of plain CT. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of urinary calculi detected under such conditions.

Between January 2000 and June 2002, 560 patients presented with acute unilateral renal colic. Of these patients, 238 who were negative or equivocal for ureteral calculus on KUB and US underwent non-enhanced CT. The diagnostic value of plain CT in patients with negative or equivocal KUB and US was determined, and results and other clinical findings were compared. Clinical characteristics of ureteral stones detected by plain CT were compared with those of stones diagnosed by KUB and US.

By plain CT, 143 (60.1%) and 6 (2.5%) cases of pain were determined to have been caused by ureteral stones and other pathogeneses, respectively. No definitive diagnosis was obtained in 89 (37.4%). Stone size detected by plain CT was significantly smaller than controls (3.77 vs 6.37 mm, p < 0.0001) and tended to be located in the middle or lower ureter (76.2% or 109 of 143 vs 52.2% or 168 of 322, p < 0.0001). Symptoms spontaneously improved in 137 (95.8%) after conservative therapy, while 6 underwent intervention, a rate significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than controls (32.9% or 106 of 322).

Non-enhanced CT is a useful modality for diagnosis of patients presenting with acute renal colic.

### Percutaneous feeding tube replacement in the ED — are confirmatory x-rays necessary [^117HbSKr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

No study at the time of writing has addressed whether confirmatory x-rays after ED percutaneous feeding tube (PFT) replacement are always necessary. We hypothesized that x-ray confirmation of PFT replacement is not necessary in patients lacking both tract immaturity and trauma to the tract during dislodgement or replacement. Therefore, confirmatory x-rays could safely be avoided for these patients.

- **Methods**: Medical records of 113 adult PFT encounters that met inclusion criteria between December 2000 and March 2004 at an urban university hospital ED, seeing approximately 50,000 adult patients per year, were reviewed.

- **Results**: Ninety-four patients (83%) presented secondary to dislodgement, and 19 patients (17%) presented secondary to malfunction. Forty-seven patients (42%) did not have confirmatory x-rays, and 66 (58%) had confirmatory x-rays. None of the patients discharged without a confirmatory x-ray returned with evidence of improper PFT placement. Of the 66 patients who had a confirmatory x-ray, 62 (94%) x-rays showed the feeding tube was in the correct location. In 4 patients, the x-ray showed either the PFT was not in the stomach or there was evidence of tract compromise. All of these patients had trauma to the tract, and 3 of the 4 were in immature tracts. There were only 19 patients, of the total group of 113, who had neither trauma nor an immature tract.

- **Conclusion**: Although uncommon, significant problems with PFT placement can occur with the potential for catastrophic consequences. It appears that both tract immaturity and trauma to the tract, either potential or actual, are critical factors to consider.

### 2023 WSES guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management of iatrogenic urinary tract injuries (IUTIs) during emergency digestive surgery [^115uyTQD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). High credibility.

CT urography with both nephrographic and excretory phases (5–20 minutes after contrast administration) represents the gold standard technique in case of suspected ureteral injuries. Once an IUTI is identified, appropriate management depends on the type, location, and grade of the lesion, the time of diagnosis, and the patient's condition. The main goals of IUTI management are preserving renal function, ensuring adequate drainage by stenting or nephrostomy, and minimizing surgical morbidity.

In the infrequent case where the ureter is sutured without being transected, balloon dilation of the ligated portion can be attempted to avoid surgery. In cases of partial ureteral transection, minimally invasive techniques, including percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, wire recanalization of the ureteral lumen, and stent placement, are preferred. Percutaneous nephrostomy combined with anterograde stent placement may be performed in the event of retrograde stent failure or considered as a first option in patients at high risk for retrograde stent failure. However, conservative management carries a risk of subsequent ureteral stricture; thus, a strict follow-up is required.

The surgical approach is preferred when the ureteral lesion is complete or involves a large ureteral segment. For upper and middle third IUTI, the first-line repair is often a ureteroureterostomy, in which the distal and proximal ureteral ends are debrided back to viable tissue, and a standard running or interrupted end-to-end anastomosis is performed. Ureteral devascularization must be minimized to ensure optimal outcomes.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^117Svk2F]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Within the ITT population, there was one subject who did not undergo a KUB because of an adverse event (unrelated to FT placement) that led to death before the image could be obtained. No subjects' radiographs were inconclusive regarding the final placement location; therefore, no subjects underwent radiograph with contrast media. Agreement between the IRIS placement location and KUB confirmation occurred in 40 instances (93.0%), which was statistically significant (Cohen's κ = 0.3645; p = 0.014).

During the initial training cases period, one subject's FT was discovered to be coiled in the pharynx (2.1%) on x‐ray. In other cases of disagreement, two cases were read as in the "stomach" via camera visualization but were determined to be in the "small bowel" via x‐ray. These tubes may have also migrated to the small bowel before confirmatory x‐ray. Finally, one tube was read as "postpyloric" via camera visualization; however, subsequent confirmatory x‐ray was read as "downstream antrum/proximal pylorus", which may have also occurred because of tube movement after placement.

### Ureteric stent associated spondylodiscitis [^111rxJ3X]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

This case report describes a clinical presentation of spondylodiscitis following an emergency ureteric stent placement for an infected and obstructed kidney in a woman in her late 70s who presented with right flank pain, raised inflammatory markers, and an acute kidney injury. A non-contrast CT of the kidney, ureters, and bladder (KUB) revealed a 9mm obstructing stone, and prompt decompression with a JJ stent was performed. Although the initial urine culture showed no growth, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli was found in a subsequent urine culture after discharge. Postoperatively, the patient described novel, worsening lower back pain and had persistently elevated inflammatory markers. An MRI revealed spondylodiscitis of L5/S1, for which she was treated with a six-week course of antibiotics, resulting in a good but slow recovery. This case highlights the unusual complication of spondylodiscitis post-ureteric stent placement, emphasizing the need for clinicians to be aware of this rare adverse event.

### Obstructed kidney and sepsis secondary to urethral catheter misplacement into the distal ureter [^116kP29n]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

An 86-year-old woman underwent routine catheter replacement in the community. The new catheter failed to drain urine. Attempts to remove the catheter were unsuccessful, both by the community nurse and the urology team at the hospital. A CT scan confirmed that the catheter balloon was inflated in the distal right ureter. The patient was started on antibiotics and scheduled for cystoscopy under general anesthesia. During the procedure, the catheter was visualized entering the right ureter, and the balloon was punctured using a wire under image intensifier guidance. Once removed, a new catheter was inserted. Very dilated ureteric orifices were noted. Post-operatively, the patient required HDU support for 48 hours due to sepsis and, upon recovery, was discharged home.

The key learning point in this case is to always consider the possibility of catheter misplacement in the ureter if it is not draining well and the patient presents with pain.

### Modified Whitaker test: A novel diagnostic for nephroptosis [^1156hzvb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Five weeks following the initial presentation, the community urologist performed a cystoscopy with a right retrograde urogram and attempted ureteroscopy. A tortuous ureter was noted, and the renal pelvis was not visualized; a double-J stent was placed, and she was referred to our urologic service.

She presented to the University of Virginia urology clinic seven weeks after the initial presentation. With the stent in place, she reported nearly constant pain that limited her ability to complete daily 5-mile walks. The intensity of the pain was exacerbated by movement, but it was not affected by hydration. One week later, she underwent right ureteroscopy with ureteral stent removal and placement of a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube that alleviated her pain. She was scheduled for a Whitaker test.

The patient returned in two weeks for a Whitaker test of the right renal pelvis and ureter, facilitated by the nephrostomy tube still in place. She was placed in a supine position, and dilute contrast was infused at a rate of 8 mL/min. Once 60 mL of contrast was infused into the renal pelvis, the patient reported mild flank discomfort and fullness. The differential pressure between the renal pelvis and bladder was 15 cm of water, below the 20–22 cm of water cut-off for a diagnosis of obstruction. The patient was then placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position (45°) with continued perfusion of 8 mL/min. At this point, the differential pressure rose to 24 cm of water, and she reported intense flank pain. This dynamic study demonstrated position-dependent obstruction via differential pressures and…

In the event of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced, where possible, by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body through reinforced hydration and frequent bladder voiding. A diuretic might also be considered. If possible, an estimate of the radioactive dose given to the patient should be performed.

### Survanta [^116XGQaS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Important administration instructions**: For intratracheal administration only, SURVANTA should be administered by or under the supervision of clinicians experienced in intubation, ventilator management, and the general care of premature infants. The administration of SURVANTA is facilitated if one person administers the dose while another person positions and monitors the infant.

Before administering SURVANTA, ensure proper placement and patency of the endotracheal tube. At the discretion of the clinician, the endotracheal tube may be suctioned before administering SURVANTA. The infant should be allowed to stabilize before proceeding with dosing. Administer SURVANTA intratracheally by instillation through a 5 French end-hole catheter.

- **Recommended dosage**: Each dose of SURVANTA is 100 mg of phospholipids/kg birth weight (4 mL/kg). In the prevention strategy, in premature infants with evidence of surfactant deficiency, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably within 15 minutes of birth. To treat infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) confirmed by radiographic and clinical findings, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably by 8 hours of age. Four doses of SURVANTA can be administered in the first 48 hours of life. Doses should be given no more frequently than every 6 hours. The need for additional doses of SURVANTA is determined by evidence of continuing respiratory distress. Radiographic confirmation of RDS should be obtained before administering additional doses to those who received a prevention dose.

### Efficacy analysis of self-help position therapy after holmium laser lithotripsy via flexible ureteroscopy [^115pYg1L]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

All enrollees received a preoperative plain abdominal radiograph of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) and unenhanced computed tomography (CT) to assess hydronephrosis and the size, location, and number of stones. The same imaging regimen was used for all patients. Stone size was determined by measuring the longest diameter on the preoperative radiologic images. In the case of multiple stones, the sum of the longest diameters of stones was used.

Patients were placed in a lithotomy position after general anesthesia. A semirigid ureteroscope (8–9.8 F; Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) was retrogradely inserted into the upper urinary tract with the assistance of a Zebra guidewire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) to check the ureter and simplify the placement of a 12/14F ureteral access sheath (UAS; Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland). A 7.5F fiberoptic FURS (P5; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the renal pelvis via the UAS to search and fragment stones (≤ 2 mm). Fragmentation was done using a 200 um holmium laser fiber at an energy setting of 12–20 W based on the visually determined hardness of stones. Routinely, a 4.7F double-J stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ, USA) was placed after lithotripsy. If the UAS could not be positioned due to ureter straitness, a 6F double-J stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular) was implanted for two weeks before lithotripsy.

A kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) examination was done on postoperative day 1.

### Analysis of long-term effect of ureteral balloon dilatation combined with internal and external drainage tube in the treatment of benign ureteral stricture [^111FKVFx]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Fluoroscopic procedure**: The fluoroscopic image shows a guidewire inserted through a percutaneous access to the urinary bladder. The ureteral stenosis is dilated with a balloon.

- **Drainage tube implantation**: The internal and external drainage tube is implanted under fluoroscopy, with the distal end located in the bladder. The side holes of the tube are located in the renal pelvis.

- **Contrast medium procedure**: The end of the drainage tube is pulled into the renal pelvis, allowing the contrast medium to smoothly enter the bladder cavity through the ureter by drainage tube radiography.

- **Criteria for tube removal**: The imaging examination should show no ureteropelvic dilatation. Renal function tests must reveal a significant decrease in urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The distal end of the drainage tube is moved from the bladder to the renal pelvis before removal. A contrast agent is injected through the external orifice of the tube to verify that it smoothly enters the bladder from the renal pelvis through the ureter. If these criteria are met, the tube is removed. If not, the end of the drainage tube is repositioned into the bladder with a guide wire, and the operations are repeated after three months.

- **Follow-up procedure**: After removal of the internal and external drainage tubes, a B-ultrasound, enhanced CTU, or IVP of the urinary system is reexamined every six months. The overall success rate is defined as the patency rate at 36–60 months of follow-up.

- **Recheck CT**: A CT reexamination is used to confirm that the position of the drainage tube is satisfactory.

- **Statistical analysis**: All analyses are performed using SPSS software.

### Metachronous renal vein and artery injury after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy [^116xkmwX]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is an important approach for kidney stone removal. The placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube is an effective method to stop venous bleeding. Occasionally, the catheter can pierce into the renal parenchyma and migrate into the renal vein, extending even to the vena cava.

- **Case presentation**: A 66-year-old woman underwent a percutaneous nephrostolithotomy for a kidney staghorn stone, which complicated severe bleeding. A computed tomography angiography showed the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube inside the renal vein. The drainage tube was withdrawn 3 cm back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages, with the surgical team on standby. Seven days later, the patient developed severe hematuria. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm located near the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube, which was successfully embolized.

- **Conclusion**: This case highlights the intravenous misplacement of the nephrostomy tube and subsequent pseudoaneurysm after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. To our knowledge, this appears to be the first documentation of major bleeding due to injury to both the renal vein and artery. The percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube can be withdrawn back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages with the surgical team on standby, and the withdrawn distance may vary according to patient and catheter position.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^113orMDL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to imaging for staging, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining abdomen and pelvis imaging using the following methods for staging:

- **CT urography**: Includes CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast, along with excretory imaging.

- **Magnetic resonance urography**: Consider performing this, especially in patients with poor renal function or an allergy to iodinated contrast, provided the GFR is ≥ 30 and there is no acute renal failure. It can be performed without gadolinium-based contrast using T2 imaging and native image contrast to evaluate the upper tracts, though it will have decreased sensitivity to plaque-like or non-obstructive lesions and metastasis.

- **Renal ultrasound or CT without contrast**: Used in conjunction with retrograde ureteropyelography for patients who cannot receive either iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast material.

- **MRI of the pelvis**: Consider obtaining MRI of the pelvis without and with intravenous contrast for local staging in sessile or high-grade tumors. This may be performed in addition to CT urography and can be conducted without contrast if renal function does not allow for contrast administration, as early data suggest T2 and diffusion-weighted images may assist with local staging.

### A case of urinary bladder agenesis and bilateral ectopic ureters: A case report [^114FNZsQ]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

She presented 3 weeks later to our emergency department with AKI, ascites, and left ureterostomy obstruction. At presentation, the ureterostomies were nonfunctional, and insertion of the nephrostomy tube was deemed impossible according to the interventional radiologist. Therefore, surgical exploration of the left side (the only functioning side) was performed, revealing complete ureteral necrosis and a 1-cm segment of renal pelvis remaining. This renal pelvis remnant was open to the peritoneal cavity, and there was intraperitoneal urine leakage. The left renal pelvis was then closed after leaving a nephrostomy tube in place for drainage. No intraoperative or postoperative bleeding was encountered. The nephrostomy tube was then complicated by frequent blockage, leakage, and infection with difficult reinsertions. The patient received several types of antibiotics throughout her hospital stay for her reUTIs, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, caspofungin, ceftazidime, colistin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin.

The patient's renal function declined slowly, and at the age of 11 months, she had evidence of chronic kidney disease associated with high creatinine, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and anemia.

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction - clinical outcome and quality of life: A bi-center prospective study [^116unY92]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Over a two-year period, 75 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency room of two hospitals with an obstructing ureteral stone necessitating drainage were asked to participate in this study by an on-call urologist involved in the study. The estimated recruitment rate was 42%. The study is an Institutional Review Board-approved, bi-center, prospective study comparing the impact on quality of life (QoL) of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and retrograde ureteral catheterization.

Patients were offered renal drainage when definitive therapy was not available immediately, was contraindicated, or when a two-stage procedure was considered a safer approach. Entry criteria included an obstructing ureteral stone with either fever (greater than 38°C), acute renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 60 ml/min), or intractable pain. The diagnosis of the obstructing ureteral stone was made by either a non-contrast CT or a combination of renal ultrasound and abdominal X-ray.

Exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years, pregnant women, and patients with contraindications to either form of drainage (e.g. uncorrected coagulopathy excluding percutaneous drainage, hemodynamic instability precluding anesthesia required for double-J stent [DJS] placement, or abnormalities of the urinary tract). Patients received either a DJS or a PCN according to the surgeon's preference. Practical issues such as the availability of an operating room or the interventional radiologist often dictated the choice of drainage, particularly in patients with fever, as it is our policy to reduce time to drainage to the minimum in this high-risk group.

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: An old but resurgent problem [^115pre1V]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

- **Ureteral TB**: Thickening of the ureter wall is observed in acute TB involvement, while strictures in the lumen and a shortening of the ureter are detected in chronic TB involvement (Fig. 37).

	- Fig. 37: Axial (a) and coronal (b) non-contrast CT scan of a 74-year-old male with urinary tuberculosis reveals debris collection within the dilated right renal pelvis and dilated right ureter with diffuse wall thickening. 3D MIP Coronal T2-weighted MR urogram shows strictures (arrows) of the right ureter.

- **Urinary bladder TB**: Urinary bladder involvement is caused by the spread of the infection from the kidneys. Bladder wall thickening, ulceration, and filling defects due to granulomatous material are observed in acute TB (Fig. 38), while decreased bladder capacity and irregular and calcified appearances in bladder contours indicate chronic TB. Fibrotic changes can also cause hydroureteronephrosis.

	- Fig. 38: A 47-year-old male. Coronal post-contrast CT scan shows diffuse thickening of the bladder wall (arrow) and dilated left proximal ureter (arrowheads).

- **Involvement of the genital organs**: Genital TB affects both men and women and can cause infertility. Involvement of the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and testicles can be seen in men, while women can present with ovary, fallopian tube, and endometrium involvement. Primary genital TB can develop in women's cervix, vagina, or vulva. The transmission route can be through infected semen from male partners with active genitourinary TB or through the sputum used as a sexual lubricant of their partners with pulmonary TB.

### Unusual stent after ureteral substitution. A first case [^114JiEiS]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman was admitted for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Her medical history includes a right hip prosthesis and hysterectomy for cervical cancer at age 56, followed by radiotherapy. At age 58, she underwent ileal loop substitution for an extensive stricture of the left ureter in a general surgery setting. This procedure was performed by a general surgeon instead of a urologist due to the patient's location in a peripheral area with only first-level hospitals. Three months later, due to worsening left hydronephrosis, the patient underwent pyeloplasty with the placement of a 'stent' of unknown characteristics via a flank approach. Ten months after this second procedure, she was evaluated at our institution for recurrent UTI and fever, along with irritative bladder symptoms such as frequency and urge incontinence. Her serum creatinine level was 1 mg/dL, and urine culture showed more than one million E. coli colony-forming units per mL.

As a further diagnostic step, a plain X-ray of the abdomen was performed (Figure 1), revealing the presence of a stent-like radiopaque device on the left side, with its upper part projecting on the left kidney area and three short interruptions at its proximal third. Additionally, a renal scintigraphy indicated severely reduced (10%) left kidney function.

Figure 1 shows the abdominal X-ray demonstrating the radiopaque stent in the left collecting system. The upper extremity appears uncoiled with two short interruptions at the proximal third, while the lower extremity forms a wide coil inside the bladder.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, specifically related to the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, the CAR 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining an indicated contrast imaging if the eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and no signs or symptoms of AKI are present in non-emergent, stable outpatients, inpatients, and emergency patients when eGFR is available.

Ensure an individual patient decision involving the caring team or patient/patient decision-maker to explain and balance the risks of contrast-associated AKI against the risks and uncertainties of delayed or suboptimal imaging if the eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI is suspected.

### Visualization of the renal vein filled with contrast agent may indicate the renal vein injury during percutaneous nephrolithotomy: Two case reports [^1112erLS]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Fig. 1**: The radiograph of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder revealing the left renal vein, the collecting system, and the suboptimal position of the puncture needle tip.

- **Fig. 2**: The radiograph of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder revealing the collecting system without visualization of the renal vein by injection of contrast agent through the latter puncture needle (arrow).

Patient 2 was a 41-year-old woman who presented with left flank pain. Her medical history was unremarkable. White blood cells were detected in the urine, and empirical antibiotics were started. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed the presence of left mild hydronephrosis, and renal calculi were measured at 2.2 cm. The patient was diagnosed with renal calculi and mild hydronephrosis.

A PCNL procedure protocol was planned. A ureteral catheter was inserted into the left ureter retrogradely, targeting the middle posterior calix. The puncture site of the target calyceal fornix was localized under fluoroscopy monitoring using a contrast agent injected through the ureteral catheter, producing a retrograde pyelogram. Clear urine was seen on the withdrawal of the stylet.

During an injection of contrast agent into her left collecting system through the puncture needle, we were able to visualize her left renal vein filled with contrast agent (Fig. 3). We could also identify that the location of the puncture needle tip was not optimal, being near the calyceal infundibulum. Consequently, the puncture needle was pulled out. A puncture tract passing through the middle posterior caliceal fornix was performed simultaneously, and the renal…

### Explosive weapons trauma care collective (EXTRACCT) blast injury clinical practice guideline: Genito-urinary trauma [^1147DxHB]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Spatulation repair of the ureter over a double J stent is indicated for genito-urinary trauma. More extensive injury may require expert intervention for ureteroureterostomy to the opposite side or reimplantation in the bladder. In these cases, or where damage control surgery is required, the ureter can be exteriorized to control urine leakage.

- **Bladder trauma**: The bladder is the second most commonly injured genitourinary organ due to its size and location. With landmine explosions and related pelvic trauma, the full bladder can rupture, either extraperitoneal or intraperitoneal, or combined. Intraperitoneal rupture always requires surgical repair, whereas the extraperitoneal may, on select indication, require repair (for example, bone shards in the bladder or prostatic urethral damage). Most cases are managed nonoperatively with Foley catheter drainage for 10–14 days.

	- Diagnosis of bladder injury is best confirmed by a formal cystogram using 200–300 mL contrast injected transurethrally into the bladder and then keeping the catheter clamped to prevent the bladder from emptying. A dynamic view is useful, but a simple pelvic AP and lateral X-ray with the bladder full will confirm any leaks (contrast extravasation). A post-micturition set of X-rays is also advised to see any occult retroperitoneal leaks. Injuries are classified according to the AAST bladder injury grading.

Repair is either performed via midline laparotomy or via a Pfannenstiel approach (for isolated bladder injury) by opening the bladder dome.

### Diagnostic value of chest radiographs in bedridden patients suspected of having pneumonia [^111Rjw62]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic value of the chest radiograph for the diagnosis of pneumonia in bedridden patients, non-contrast-enhanced high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) was used as the gold standard.

- **Methods**: We prospectively evaluated bedridden patients hospitalized with a moderate to high clinical probability of pneumonia. Chest radiographs were interpreted in a blinded fashion by three observers and classified as definite, normal, or uncertain for pneumonia. A chest CT was obtained within 12 hours of the chest radiograph. Bayesian analysis was applied to assess the accuracy of chest radiographs in diagnosing pneumonia.

- **Results**: Over a 5-month period, 58 patients were evaluated, 31 (53%) of whom were female. Their chest radiographs were interpreted as negative, uncertain, or positive for pneumonia in 31 (53%), 15 (26%), and 12 (21%) patients, respectively, while CT confirmed pneumonia in 11 (35%), 10 (67%), and 10 (83%). The sensitivity of the chest radiograph to diagnose pneumonia was 65%, the specificity was 93%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 83% and 65%, respectively, while the overall accuracy was 69% (95% confidence interval, 50%-79%).

- **Conclusions**: In bedridden patients with suspected pneumonia, a normal chest radiograph does not rule out the diagnosis; hence, a chest CT scan might provide valuable diagnostic information.

### Endocavitary contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): a novel problem solving technique [^111pBULj]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Following percutaneous nephrostomy insertion, it is frequently necessary to assess the renal collecting system and ureter for free passage of contrast prior to removal of the catheter to ensure patency. The stent patency, point of obstruction, or relief of a prior obstructing aetiology can all be assessed; contrast imaging of the ureters also allows for the delineation of a fistula or ureteric rupture. The spatial resolution of endocavitary CEUS enables a confident assessment of free ureteric drainage. Recent studies demonstrate 79–100% concordance with fluoroscopy, with 94% of discordant cases showing ureteric patency on CEUS nephrostogram, which was not seen on conventional fluoroscopy.

In an acute setting, UCA injected via a needle entering a renal collecting system can be used as an alternative to fluoroscopic imaging, enabling confident bedside nephrostomy placement. This percutaneous puncture may be facilitated by placing a small volume of UCA on a puncture needle and observing as the UCA refluxes back along the needle as a calyceal puncture is achieved due to the back pressure of urine.

- **Figure 7: CEUS nephrostogram**. Images obtained of the entire ureter and bladder following ultrasound contrast administered through an in-dwelling nephrostomy confirm patency of the collecting system with contrast opacifying the (A) renal calyces, (B) ureter, and (C) bladder, which contains a urinary catheter (white arrow). (D) Conventional fluoroscopic nephrostogram confirms free drainage along the collecting system and into the bladder (arrows).
