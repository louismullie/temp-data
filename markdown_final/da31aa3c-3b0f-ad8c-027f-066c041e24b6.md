## Question

How to explain elevated lactate in layman's terms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to explain elevated lactate in layman's terms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology and why lactate appears in the blood. Then, I should verify the main causes of elevated lactate and how to categorize them simply. Next, I will translate the clinical significance into everyday language, including thresholds and trends. After that, I need to check common confounders and exceptions that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, patient-friendly explanation and confirm it aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the basic physiology so I don't overstate anything. Lactate is a normal byproduct of metabolism that your body makes even when you have enough oxygen, and it gets cleared by the liver and kidneys. When cells switch to anaerobic metabolism because oxygen is limited or demand is very high, lactate production rises and can accumulate in the bloodstream, which is why we measure it as a warning signal of stress or hypoperfusion.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that all high lactate means lack of oxygen. I should categorize the causes in a way patients can grasp. Type A reflects inadequate oxygen delivery from shock, severe anemia, or hypoxia, while Type B reflects problems with clearance or altered metabolism from sepsis, liver disease, medications like metformin, or toxins, and both can coexist in the same patient, so the number reflects both production and clearance dynamics rather than a single cause [^e13d663d] [^5064cd17].

> Next, I should review what the numbers mean in plain language. Normal lactate is roughly 0.5 to 2.0 mmol/L, mild elevation around 2 to 4 mmol/L suggests stress or early hypoperfusion, and levels above 4 mmol/L are concerning and associated with higher risk of death in sepsis and other critical illnesses. Importantly, even small increases within the "normal" range can signal worse outcomes in sick patients, so trends matter as much as a single value [^98e69fc3] [^91a012ad] [^e8beae2a].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance so I don't overpromise. Elevated lactate is a red flag that the body is under strain, but it is not a specific disease test; it helps doctors identify patients at higher risk and guide how aggressively to treat, and serial measurements showing lactate is falling generally predict better outcomes than when it stays high or rises, which is why guidelines suggest using lactate trends to help guide resuscitation in sepsis and shock [^e8beae2a] [^e2fb61fd] [^e13d663d].

> I need to ensure I cover common confounders that can mislead families. Exercise, anxiety, and hyperventilation can transiently raise lactate, alcohol use can increase lactate, and certain medications like metformin can contribute to lactic acidosis, especially with kidney problems. Even the lactate in lactated Ringer's can modestly bump measured lactate, so clinicians interpret values alongside the whole clinical picture rather than in isolation [^59d1b1b2] [^60b1edd5] [^ce8371c7] [^e9b24bec].

> Let me think about how to phrase this for a lay audience. I would say: "Your lactate level is a bit like a smoke alarm for your body's energy system. When tissues don't get enough oxygen or the body is under extreme stress, lactate builds up. A small rise can mean early trouble, and a larger rise warns us to act quickly. Doctors track how lactate changes over time because falling lactate usually means we are moving in the right direction, even though the number itself is not the disease and must be read with everything else going on with you" [^e8beae2a] [^61754fec].

> But wait, what if the patient asks whether a high lactate means they are definitely in shock or will die. I should clarify that lactate supports risk assessment and guides therapy, yet it is neither sensitive nor specific enough to diagnose sepsis or shock by itself, and many patients with elevated lactate recover with timely treatment, so the number is a tool for vigilance rather than a verdict [^40e9372e] [^f2eeaee0].

Elevated lactate means your body is making more **lactate than it can clear**, often because tissues are not getting enough oxygen or because your liver or kidneys are not working well. Think of it like a traffic jam: when cells can't use oxygen efficiently, they switch to a backup fuel that produces lactate, and if the liver or kidneys can't clear it fast enough, levels rise. This is a **warning sign** of serious illness — such as sepsis, shock, or organ failure — and doctors use lactate levels to guide urgent care and monitor recovery [^e8beae2a] [^61754fec].

---

## What is lactate?

Lactate is a normal byproduct of metabolism; your body makes it even when you have enough oxygen, and it is usually cleared by the liver and kidneys. At rest, blood lactate is about **0.5–2.0 mmol/L** [^98e69fc3].

---

## Why does lactate rise?

Lactate rises when production increases or clearance slows. The main causes are:

- **Low oxygen (hypoxia)**: When tissues don't get enough oxygen, cells switch to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactate [^e13d663d].
- **Poor blood flow (hypoperfusion)**: Shock, sepsis, or heart failure reduce oxygen delivery and cause lactate buildup [^e8beae2a].
- **Liver or kidney problems**: These organs clear lactate; if they fail, lactate accumulates [^e13d663d].
- **High metabolic demand**: Intense exercise or seizures can temporarily raise lactate [^6d04571b].

---

## What does elevated lactate mean clinically?

Elevated lactate is a **red flag** for serious illness. Levels above 2 mmol/L are abnormal, and levels above 4 mmol/L are especially concerning and linked to higher mortality in sepsis and shock [^91a012ad]. Doctors use lactate to:

- **Identify severity**: Higher lactate signals worse illness and higher risk of death [^91a012ad].
- **Guide treatment**: Falling lactate shows recovery; rising lactate warns of worsening illness [^61754fec].
- **Monitor response**: Serial lactate helps track whether treatments are working [^e2fb61fd].

---

## How is elevated lactate treated?

Treatment targets the **cause**, not the lactate itself:

- **Improve oxygen delivery**: Give oxygen, fluids, and blood if needed [^notfound].
- **Treat the underlying problem**: Antibiotics for sepsis, surgery for bleeding, or support for heart or kidney failure [^notfound].
- **Support organs**: Use ventilators, dialysis, or medications as indicated [^18641a2c].

---

## Can elevated lactate be harmless?

Sometimes, lactate rises briefly with intense exercise or anxiety, but **persistent elevation is never normal** and needs evaluation [^d00f819f].

---

Elevated lactate means your body is under stress and struggling to meet oxygen needs or clear waste. It is a **critical marker** that helps doctors detect severity, guide urgent care, and monitor recovery.

We performed a literature search on this subject to address several questions. First, is the observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations a consistent finding in all types of critically ill patient? Second, although some studies have suggested that repeated lactate measurements may be particularly useful in sepsis, can similar observations be made in other acute disease states or even in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients? Third, how fast should lactate concentrations decrease in optimal conditions and is there any particular time interval that could be recommended? Fourth, some studies in emergency medicine considered only patients with lactate values > 4 mEq/l as an at-risk population, but is this approach valid? In other words, is the study of lactate kinetics more useful when lactate concentrations exceed a given value?

### Lactate as a marker of energy failure in critically ill patients: hypothesis [^acc4ecfd]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lactate measurement in the critically ill has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcome. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms such as man who are forced to produce ATP for their integrity adapt in many different ways up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow the cell to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may therefore be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^72f43252]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, early lactate measurement (within 1 h after ICU admission) in septic patients with elevated serum lactate levels (> 2.0 mmol/L) is associated with a lower risk-adjusted 28-day mortality. The decrease in time to the administration of vasopressors may have mediated this effect. Repeating the measurement within 3 h after the initial measurement is appropriate for patients whose lactate was measured within 1 h of admission.

Lactate as a goal of what?

The complexity of lactate as a molecule, substrate, biomarker, energy source, component of some intravenous fluids, and major modulator of cellular bioenergetics during physiological stress is formidable. Such complexity makes it impossible to define what goal it should be a marker or target of. Seeking to lower lactate levels (by whatever means given the multiple events that regulate its blood levels) has no credibility and no logic in terms of hemodynamics, bioenergetics, or tissue protection. In fact, it could make more biological sense to assist the natural process of lactate utilization and generation during sepsis or during other physiological stress situations by administering lactate. Until we are able to define the goals that we wish to achieve by manipulating lactate and have the means of measuring whether we have achieved such goals or not, the idea of seeking to lower lactate by increasing its "clearance" in sepsis is both an illusion and a folly.

Introduction

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of in-hospital death in the intensive care unit (ICU), with a short-term mortality rate ranging from 30 to 50%. Elevation as well as slow clearance of serum lactate levels has been reported to be associated with increased mortality in sepsis. As a product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate elevation can to some extent reflect poor tissue perfusion, though it can be affected by other factors. Thus, monitoring lactate levels may help clinicians understand the tissue perfusion situation and identify unrecognized shock, enabling them to adjust treatment in a timely fashion.

Because randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality with lactate-guided resuscitation, lactate measurement has been introduced into the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as an important component of the treatment bundles. The 2012 SSC bundle emphasized that an initial lactate level must be measured between 6 h before and 3 h after sepsis onset, followed by a repeated measurement within 6 h of sepsis presentation if the initial value is elevated. Levy et al. updated the SSC bundle to indicate that the initial lactate measurement should be performed within 1 h of onset and remeasured within 2–4 h to guide resuscitation if the initial lactate is > 2.0 mmol/L. However, there are limited studies focused on the timing of lactate measurement and remeasurement and its effect on outcomes. One study by Han et al. demonstrated that patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and initial lactate levels > 2.0 mmol/L had a 2% increase in the odds of death with each hour delay in lactate measurement. According to the analysis of 96 studies, Vincent et al. concluded that lactate measurement every 1–2 h is probably sufficient in most acute conditions, including sepsis. However, the optimal timing of the initial lactate measurement for septic patients remains controversial, and whether earlier initial and repeated lactate measurements could make a difference for septic patients with a higher lactate level remains unexplored.

Therefore, we designed this study to examine the relationship between early lactate measurement (within 1 h after ICU admission) and the outcomes of septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level (> 2.0 mmol/L), as well as to characterize the association of delays in initial lactate measurement and remeasurement with 28-day mortality to better understand the benefit of lactate monitoring in sepsis management.

### Blood lactate monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic health technology assessment [^345b44f1]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To decide whether the use of blood lactate monitoring in critical care practice is appropriate. We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood lactate monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated properly.

Data Source

PubMed, other databases, and citation review.

Study Selection

We searched for lactate combined with critically ill patients as the target patient population. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does lactate measurement: 1) perform well in a laboratory setting? 2) provide information in a number of clinical situations? 3) relate to metabolic acidosis? 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic decisions? 6) result in benefit to patients? 7) result in similar benefits in your own setting? 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra costs?

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We concluded that blood lactate measurement in critically ill patients: 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the (an)aerobic etiology is required for its correct interpretation; 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important prognostic information; 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other acid-base variables; 4) has an unknown effect on healthcare workers' confidence; 5) can alter therapeutic decisions; 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment algorithm to optimize oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown indirectly; 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings worldwide; and 8) has an unknown cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The use of blood lactate monitoring has a place in risk-stratification in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of lactate as a resuscitation end point improves outcome. This warrants randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of lactate-directed therapy.

### Lactate dehydrogenase levels predict coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality: a pooled analysis [^42808c28]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has now reached a pandemic state, affecting more than a million patients worldwide. Predictors of disease outcomes in these patients need to be urgently assessed to decrease morbidity and societal burden. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with viral infections. In this pooled analysis of 9 published studies (n = 1532 COVID-19 patients), we evaluated the association between elevated LDH levels measured at earliest time point in hospitalization and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Elevated LDH levels were associated with a ~6-fold increase in odds of developing severe disease and a ~16-fold increase in odds of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Occurrence and adverse effect on outcome of hyperlactatemia in the critically ill [^70668d6e]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hyperlactatemia occurs in approximately one-half of patients admitted to the ICU.

- Presentation with or development of hyperlactatemia after ICU admission is associated with increased mortality.

- Elevated admission lactate levels are step-wise associated with increased risk for death after controlling for severity of illness, age, and diagnosis.

The panel recognizes that normal serum lactate levels are not achievable in all patients with septic shock, but these studies support resuscitative strategies that decrease lactate toward normal; lactate should be interpreted in clinical context and measurement may not always be available in some resource-limited settings.

### Lactate elevation during and after major cardiac surgery in adults: a review of etiology, prognostic value, and management [^58be85fb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated lactate is a common occurrence after cardiac surgery. This review summarizes the literature on the complex etiology of lactate elevation during and after cardiac surgery, including considerations of oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, increased metabolism, lactate clearance, medications and fluids, and postoperative complications. Second, the association between lactate and a variety of outcomes are described, and the prognostic role of lactate is critically assessed. Despite the fact that elevated lactate is strongly associated with many important outcomes, including postoperative complications, length of stay, and mortality, little is known about the optimal management of postoperative patients with lactate elevations. This review ends with an assessment of the limited literature on this subject.

### Risk stratification of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated with sepsis using lactate trajectories [^be83b422]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated lactate levels are common in the setting of sepsis and usually represent an imbalance between increased production in the presence or absence of tissue hypoxia and changes in clearance. Given their well-established association with multiple organ dysfunction, blood lactate levels and their trend over time are increasingly recognized as reliable markers of illness severity and mortality. Border and Weil et al. observed that lactate levels ≥ 4 mmol/L were associated with a 50% mortality in patients with shock during a study period of 36 h. An increasing body of evidence suggests that lactate measurements represent a valuable and straightforward indicator for the early identification of severe sepsis and are associated with poor outcomes. Interestingly, current evidence suggests that compared with initial lactate levels at presentation or other single measured lactate values, serial blood lactate level measurements can better characterize the dynamic process of lactate production and elimination in vivo. Serial lactate levels can also help define the patient's trajectory and encourage a review of the therapeutic strategy. Over the years, the prognostic value of serial measurements of multiple types of lactate levels or calculations from lactate levels has been investigated, for example, the duration of hyperlactatemia, the area under the curve of serial lactate measurement (lactate AUC), and lactate clearance. Importantly, decreased lactate levels were associated with improved outcomes in almost all critically ill patients. Moreover, the later the lactate level is reduced, the worse the clinical prognosis is.

### Does intravenous lactated Ringer's solution raise serum lactate? [^e9b24bec]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Serum lactate increases in states of severe sepsis and shock, but its interpretation may be subject to confounders. Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) is used in the resuscitation of septic patients and contains 28 mmol/L of sodium lactate.

Objectives

We sought to determine if a bolus of 30 mL/kg of LR increases serum lactate levels.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 30 volunteers were assigned to receive either 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR or normal saline (NS). Serum lactate was measured before and after the fluid bolus. The primary outcome was the difference in the change in lactate between the LR and NS groups. Secondarily, we assessed the change in pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride in each group.

Results

After 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR, the mean serum lactate level increased by 0.93 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.42–1.44 mmol/L). However, there was also a small increase in the mean serum lactate level in the NS group of 0.37 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -0.26 mmol/L to 1.00 mmol/L), such that there was not a statistically significant difference in the change in lactate when comparing the LR group to the NS group (p = 0.2). The NS group saw larger declines in pH and bicarbonate and greater increases in chloride compared with the LR group.

Conclusion

In healthy individuals, a modest but significant rise in mean serum lactate was seen after a 30 cc/kg LR bolus. There was no difference in mean serum lactate when comparing a 30 mL/kg bolus of NS to LR.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^91ccf997]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^85d20524]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^61754fec]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The time course of blood lactate levels could be helpful to assess a patient's response to therapy. Although the focus of published studies has been largely on septic patients, many other studies have reported serial blood lactate levels in different groups of acutely ill patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase until the end of February 2016 plus reference lists of relevant publications. We selected all observational and interventional studies that evaluated the capacity of serial blood lactate concentrations to predict outcome. There was no restriction based on language. We excluded studies in pediatric populations, experimental studies, and studies that did not report changes in lactate values or all-cause mortality rates. We separated studies according to the type of patients included. We collected data on the number of patients, timing of lactate measurements, minimum lactate level needed for inclusion if present, and suggested time interval for predictive use.

Results

A total of 96 studies met our criteria: 14 in general ICU populations, five in general surgical ICU populations, five in patients post cardiac surgery, 14 in trauma patients, 39 in patients with sepsis, four in patients with cardiogenic shock, eight in patients after cardiac arrest, three in patients with respiratory failure, and four in other conditions. A decrease in lactate levels over time was consistently associated with lower mortality rates in all subgroups of patients. Most studies reported changes over 6, 12 or 24 hrs, fewer used shorter time intervals. Lactate kinetics did not appear very different in patients with sepsis and other types of patients. A few studies suggested that therapy could be guided by these measurements.

Conclusions

The observation of a better outcome associated with decreasing blood lactate concentrations was consistent throughout the clinical studies, and was not limited to septic patients. In all groups, the changes are relatively slow, so that lactate measurements every 1–2 hrs are probably sufficient in most acute conditions. The value of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^cf2b3786]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

As for the blood levels of any substance, elevated lactate levels can be the result of increased production, reduced elimination, or both. A dynamic evaluation of serial lactate concentrations may thus be more informative than a single value. This concept of repeating blood lactate concentrations over time as an indicator of response to therapy was first proposed in 1983, based on an idea raised after a publication by Orringer et al. in 1977 showing that the decrease in lactate levels after cessation of grand mal seizures was actually quite rapid, with a half-life of about 50% in 1 hr. Many studies have since emphasized that changes in lactate over the first hrs of treatment may represent a valuable monitoring tool. Some studies have even proposed integrating changes in lactate concentrations as a target in therapeutic protocols or including them as one of the sepsis resuscitation "bundles". A number of investigators have used the term "lactate clearance" to describe decreasing lactate levels, but this is incorrect for two reasons. The first is that the changes in lactate concentrations over time reflect changes in production and in elimination. The decrease in lactate over time may reflect decreased (over)production more than increased clearance by the liver and other organs. The specific study of lactate clearance would require intravenous injection of radiolabeled lactate, as has been done in several studies. The second reason why use of the term is incorrect is that "clearance" or "elimination" implies a progressive normalization of blood lactate concentrations, which is too simplistic. Blood lactate concentrations can have a complex evolution and may even increase over time (Fig. 1), a situation that one should then call "negative lactate clearance".

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^f2eeaee0]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults notes that an elevated serum lactate is associated with sepsis and part of the definition of septic shock, but that "a serum lactate level alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnosing sepsis and should be interpreted based on the clinical context and with consideration for other causes of an elevated lactate level"; for these reasons, "a weak recommendation is made for measurement of serum lactate levels in adults suspected of having sepsis".

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^ff001648]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic literature review has provided the following answers to our initial questions. First, observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations is consistent throughout the literature. Second, these observations are not specific to septic patients, but apply to all common situations of hyperlactatemia and in heterogeneous patient populations. Third, the changes are relatively slow, and it is difficult to provide recommendations about the speed of decrease in lactate concentrations in the best conditions. Clearly repeating measurements every 12 hrs can generally separate those who will do well from those who are likely to die, but shorter time intervals may be helpful. On the basis of our observations, we would recommend checking blood lactate concentrations as often as every 1–2 hrs in acute conditions. Fourth, the study of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value and not only in patients with severe hyperlactatemia.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^40e9372e]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Serum lactate for suspected sepsis — diagnostic performance and adjunctive use: Lactate cutoffs for an elevated level ranged from 1.6–2.5 mmol/L, with sensitivities 66–83% and specificities 80–85%, and pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios 4.75 and 0.29, respectively; lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule-in or rule-out sepsis, and a weak recommendation favors using serum lactate as an adjunctive test to modify pretest probability in suspected but not confirmed sepsis. Lactate is part of the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock.

### Lactic acidosis, metformin use, and dose-response association… [^034619bf]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor Lazarus and collegues, 1 both in the title and in the introduction of their article published in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, used the term lactic acidosis, which endorses the concept that lactic acidosis is a state of acidosis determined by an elevated plasma lactate concentration. This term, based on the old lactate paradigm, 2 does not consider that, since the 1980s, this paradigm has radically shifted, and lactate is not considered responsible for acidosis. The same lactic acidosis is deemed a misnomer and should be replaced by the term lactate anion acidosis. 3 Indeed, the intermediate acids — another misleading definition4 — of glycolysis have a low pKa; therefore, at body pH levels, they all exist in their base form, and in their production process, no molecules are ever in an acid form and do not function as sources of protons.

The acidosis associated with hypoxia is induced by the increased H+ production from the cytosolic adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. As a matter of fact, the production of lactate also consumes 2 protons and, by definition, retards acidosis. Although blood lactate accumulation is a good proxy of increased proton release, and the potential for decreased cellular and blood pH, such relationships should not be interpreted as cause and effect, but rather "guilt by association". 5 More explicitly, high levels of lactate are only a marker for the acidosis. As physiologist Robert A. Robergs put it, "The lactic acidosis explanation of metabolic acidosis is not supported by fundamental biochemistry, has no research base of support, and remains a negative trait of all clinical, basic, and applied science fields and professions that still accept this construct.

### Stress hyperlactataemia: present understanding and controversy [^d00f819f]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

An increased blood lactate concentration is common during physiological (exercise) and pathophysiological stress (stress hyperlactataemia). In disease states, there is overwhelming evidence that stress hyperlactataemia is a strong independent predictor of mortality. However, the source, biochemistry, and physiology of exercise-induced and disease-associated stress hyperlactataemia are controversial. The dominant paradigm suggests that an increased lactate concentration is secondary to anaerobic glycolysis induced by tissue hypoperfusion, hypoxia, or both. However, in the past two decades, much evidence has shown that stress hyperlactataemia is actually due to increased aerobic lactate production, with or without decreased lactate clearance. Moreover, this lactate production is associated with and is probably secondary to adrenergic stimulation. Increased lactate production seems to be an evolutionarily preserved protective mechanism, which facilitates bioenergetic efficiency in muscle and other organs and provides necessary substrate for gluconeogenesis. Finally, lactate appears to act like a hormone that modifies the expression of various proteins, which themselves increase the efficiency of energy utilisation and metabolism. Clinicians need to be aware of these advances in our understanding of stress hyperlactataemia to approach patient management according to logical principles. We discuss the new insights and controversies about stress hyperlactataemia.

### The role of lactate clearance in the resuscitation bundle [^c9583b4e]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The sepsis resuscitation bundle is the result of an effort on behalf of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to translate individual guideline recommendations into standardized, achievable goals for physicians caring for the critically ill patient. Implementation of this bundle is associated with decreased mortality. Many of the bundle items reflect components of therapy shown to improve mortality in the seminal early goal-directed therapy trial for severe sepsis and septic shock, including an initial lactate measurement. Elevations in serum lactate are associated with increased mortality, and may result from either increased lactate production or impaired lactate clearance. Lactate clearance may be an important addition to the monitoring and management bundles of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, However, specific mechanisms of lactate clearance, the relation of lactate clearance to traditional hemodynamic parameters, and the importance of lactate clearance as a therapeutic target or monitoring tool remain unclear.

### Lactate in the critically ill patients: an outcome marker with the times [^9a692bdf]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic acid was first discovered in human blood in 1843. Since then it has been used as a prognosticator of outcome in critical illness. Regardless of its etiology, lactate's presence and trend over time have been shown to be independently associated with mortality. Two dynamic lactate measures, the time-weighted average lactate and the absolute change in lactate over the first 24 hours in the ICU, were recently shown to be better than static lactate measurements in predicting hospital and ICU deaths.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^dd647a65]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of intensive care medicine, researchers and clinicians are continually exploring novel approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Among the emerging therapeutic strategies, the use of lactate has garnered increasing attention for its multifaceted role in cellular metabolism and its potential to serve as a valuable tool in managing critically ill patients. It has traditionally been viewed as a metabolic waste product associated with anaerobic metabolism, and circulating lactate is often a strong predictor of disease severity. However, the production of lactate is not only confined to anaerobic conditions but it is recognized as an energy intermediate, produced in tissues with high glycolytic activity (during exercise for example), which can then be transported throughout the body to be oxidized in other tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart and brain. This paradigm shift called "cell-to-cell lactate shuttle", introduced by Brooks in 2007, has led to a deeper understanding of lactate's therapeutic potential, prompting over the last two decades to both fundamental and clinical trials investigations into its targeted use to improve outcomes, particularly in the intensive care setting. As a crucial component of the bodys energy metabolism, lactate serves not only as a substrate for energy production but also as a signaling molecule with diverse physiological effects such as volume-cell control or pathological effects such as its role in carcinogenesis.

In critically ill patients, modification in metabolism, including lactate production and utilization, often occurs in response to a variety of stressors, such as inflammation, sepsis, and shock, among others. Both high plasma levels of lactate and poor lactate clearance are associated with prognosis, making the reduction of blood levels of lactate a potential therapeutic objective in the management of critically ill patients. But beyond this pragmatic approach for monitoring patients, recent studies have highlighted a more nuanced role in the pathophysiology of critical illness.

This review reports the current knowledge about lactate as a potential therapeutic in intensive care, examining the underlying mechanisms, clinical evidence, and emerging strategies that harness lactate modulation to enhance the recovery of critically ill patients.

### Hyperlactatemia in type 2 diabetes: can physical training help? [^23965003]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetic patients often exhibit hyperlactatemia in association with a reduced aerobic-oxidative capacity and a restricted lactate transport. Studies suggest a link between increased lactate levels and the manifestation and progression of insulin resistance. However, the specificities of molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and it is not entirely clear whether elevated lactate levels are a cause or consequence of type 2 diabetes. This review focuses on lactate as a key molecule in diabetes and provides an overview of how regular physical activity can be helpful in normalizing elevated lactate levels in type 2 diabetic patients. Physical training may reduce lactate production and reinforce lactate transport and clearance among this particular patient group. We emphasize the crucial role physical training plays in the therapy of type 2 diabetes due to evidence that pharmacological treatment with metformin, which is commonly used in the first-line therapy of type 2 diabetes, does not help reducing lactate levels.

### Lactic acidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^61fceed2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis occurs when lactate production exceeds its metabolism. There are many possible causes of lactic acidosis, and in any given patient, several causes may coexist. This Attending Rounds presents a case in point. Metformin's role in the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is complex, as the present case illustrates. The treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial, except for the imperative to remedy its underlying cause. The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat the often alarming metabolic derangements may be quite efficacious in that regard but is of questionable benefit to patients. Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) have particular appeal in this setting for a variety of reasons, but their effect on clinical outcomes is untested.

### How to interpret lactate [^b64c5416]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

The association between hyperlactataemia and poorer outcomes in acutely unwell adults and children is well recognised. Blood lactate testing has become readily available in acute settings and is considered a first-line investigation in international guidelines for the management of sepsis. However, while healthcare professionals do appreciate the value of measuring blood lactate in acute severe illness, its clinical significance and interpretation remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the evidence for the use of lactate as a diagnostic test and prognostic marker in acutely unwell children.

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^3f2713d9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Why has the tissue hypoxia paradigm emerged and dominated until now?

The clinical syndrome of lactic acidosis was popularized by Huckabee and Weil over five decades ago. These authors proposed that elevated blood lactate levels during experimental and clinical shock states served as a measure of the degree of oxygen deficit and the severity of injury. It became widely believed that, in critically ill patients, when oxygen delivery failed to meet oxygen demand an oxygen debt with global tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis would ensue. Furthermore, classic teaching describes type A lactic acidosis, which occurs due to inadequate oxygen delivery with the presence of anaerobic glycolysis, and type B lactic acidosis, which occurs in the absence of anaerobic glycolysis and is secondary to altered clearance, malignancy, or drugs. It is widely assumed that type A lactic acidosis is the cause of an elevated lactate concentration in the critically ill patient with an overt or occult hemodynamic disturbance. An increased blood lactate concentration is therefore regarded as evidence of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoxia. It follows from this reasoning that patients with an elevated blood lactate level should be treated by increasing oxygen delivery.

### CSF lactate [^89a5dc5d]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lactate is produced from anaerobic glycolysis, which occurs in most tissues in the human body. Blood lactate is tested in most physiologically unwell patients in the Emergency Department and helps to guide treatment and prognosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate, however, is not often measured. Various central nervous system (CNS) conditions lead to a rise in CSF lactate, including acute neurological infection, stroke, seizures and mitochondrial pathologies. This article discusses the utility and limitations of CSF lactate, highlighting specific clinical situations where it can help in the diagnosis of CNS infections and unexplained encephalopathy.

### Prognostic significance of blood lactate and lactate clearance in trauma patients [^43f19ef0]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lactate has been shown to be a prognostic biomarker in trauma. Although lactate clearance has already been proposed as an intermediate endpoint in randomized trials, its precise role in trauma patients remains to be determined.

Methods

Blood lactate levels and lactate clearance (LC) were calculated at admission and 2 and 4 h later in trauma patients. The association of initial blood lactate level and lactate clearance with mortality was tested using receiver-operating characteristics curve, logistic regression using triage scores, Trauma Related Injury Severity Score as a reference standard, and reclassification method.

Results

The authors evaluated 586 trauma patients (mean age 38 ± 16 yr, 84% blunt and 16% penetrating, mortality 13%). Blood lactate levels at admission were elevated in 327 (56%) patients. The lactate clearance should be calculated within the first 2 h after admission as LC0-2 h was correlated with LC0-4 h (R = 0.55, P < 0.001) but not with LC2-4 h (R = 0.04, not significant). The lactate clearance provides additional predictive information to initial blood lactate levels and triage scores and the reference score. This additional information may be summarized using a categorical approach (i.e., less than or equal to -20%/h) in contrast to initial blood lactate. The results were comparable in patients with high (5 mM/l or more) initial blood lactate.

Conclusions

Early (0–2 h) lactate clearance is an important and independent prognostic variable that should probably be incorporated in future decision schemes for the resuscitation of trauma patients.

### Demystifying lactate in the emergency department [^a6b23261]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^af19e569]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The time course of blood lactate levels could be helpful to assess a patient's response to therapy. Although the focus of published studies has been largely on septic patients, many other studies have reported serial blood lactate levels in different groups of acutely ill patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase until the end of February 2016 plus reference lists of relevant publications. We selected all observational and interventional studies that evaluated the capacity of serial blood lactate concentrations to predict outcome. There was no restriction based on language. We excluded studies in pediatric populations, experimental studies, and studies that did not report changes in lactate values or all-cause mortality rates. We separated studies according to the type of patients included. We collected data on the number of patients, timing of lactate measurements, minimum lactate level needed for inclusion if present, and suggested time interval for predictive use.

Results

A total of 96 studies met our criteria: 14 in general ICU populations, five in general surgical ICU populations, five in patients post cardiac surgery, 14 in trauma patients, 39 in patients with sepsis, four in patients with cardiogenic shock, eight in patients after cardiac arrest, three in patients with respiratory failure, and four in other conditions. A decrease in lactate levels over time was consistently associated with lower mortality rates in all subgroups of patients. Most studies reported changes over 6, 12 or 24 hrs, fewer used shorter time intervals. Lactate kinetics did not appear very different in patients with sepsis and other types of patients. A few studies suggested that therapy could be guided by these measurements.

Conclusions

The observation of a better outcome associated with decreasing blood lactate concentrations was consistent throughout the clinical studies, and was not limited to septic patients. In all groups, the changes are relatively slow, so that lactate measurements every 1–2 hrs are probably sufficient in most acute conditions. The value of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value.

Perfusion-guided resuscitation — For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest guiding resuscitation to decrease serum lactate in patients with elevated lactate level, over not using serum lactate (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and during acute resuscitation, serum lactate level should be interpreted considering the clinical context and other causes of elevated lactate. For adults with septic shock, we suggest using capillary refill time to guide resuscitation as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^91d41ba5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of lactate levels exceeds that of blood pressure. While hyperlactatemia is associated with worse outcome in any type of shock, a correct interpretation also depends on the type of shock, i.e. septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock.

From a metabolic perspective, elevations in blood lactate concentration may be due to increased production, a decreased clearance or a combination of the two. As elevated plasma lactate forms part of the definition of shock, the argument to measure it as a diagnostic marker of shock is circular. Many studies have confirmed the association between initial serum lactate level and mortality independently of clinical signs of organ dysfunction in patients not only with severe sepsis, but also those in cardiogenic shock.

An early decrease in blood lactate levels may indicate the resolution of global tissue hypoxia and has been associated with a decreased mortality rate. Two studies proposed 'lactate-based management' of ICU patients. Jones et al. studied 300 patients, of whom more than 80% had septic shock, who were treated to normalize central venous pressure (CVP) and MAP; additional management to normalize lactate clearance compared with management to normalize ScvO 2 did not result in different rates of hospital mortality. Jansen et al. showed, in patients with hyperlactatemia (> 3.0 mEq/L) on ICU admission, that lactate-guided therapy (with the aim of decreasing lactate by ≥ 20% every 2 h for the initial 8 h) in comparison with no lactate-guided therapy (in which the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels other than the admission level) reduced hospital mortality when predefined risk factors were adjusted (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.87; P = 0.006). These authors demonstrated a reduced rate of organ failure — but no reduced mortality — in the lactate group compared with the control group in the early observation period (between 9 and 72 h). Lactate levels between the control and lactate groups were similar over a 3-day period. In clinical practice, we suggest serial measurements of lactates and/or base deficit to evaluate not only the outcome and prognosis but also to guide therapy; lactate measurements can be performed every 2 h in the first 8 h and every 8–12 h thereafter.

### Early lactate-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial [^e33886b3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

It is unknown whether lactate monitoring aimed to decrease levels during initial treatment in critically ill patients improves outcome.

Objectives

To assess the effect of lactate monitoring and resuscitation directed at decreasing lactate levels in intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted with a lactate level of greater than or equal to 3.0 mEq/L.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the lactate group, treatment was guided by lactate levels with the objective to decrease lactate by 20% or more per 2 hours for the initial 8 hours of ICU stay. In the control group, the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels (except for the admission value) during this period. The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

The lactate group received more fluids and vasodilators. However, there were no significant differences in lactate levels between the groups. In the intention-to-treat population (348 patients), hospital mortality in the control group was 43.5% (77/177) compared with 33.9% (58/171) in the lactate group (P = 0.067). When adjusted for predefined risk factors, hospital mortality was lower in the lactate group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.87; P = 0.006). In the lactate group, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were lower between 9 and 72 hours, inotropes could be stopped earlier, and patients could be weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the ICU earlier.

Conclusions

In patients with hyperlactatemia on ICU admission, lactate-guided therapy significantly reduced hospital mortality when adjusting for predefined risk factors. As this was consistent with important secondary endpoints, this study suggests that initial lactate monitoring has clinical benefit. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00270673).

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^5064cd17]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Scenarios

Lactic Acidosis

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

Objectives

Lactate clearance has been widely investigated for its prognostic value in critically ill patients. However, the results are conflicting. The present study aimed to explore the diagnostic accuracy of lactate clearance in predicting mortality in critically or acutely ill patients.

Data Sources

Databases of Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge were searched from inception to June 2013.

Study Selection

Studies investigating the prognostic value of lactate clearance were defined as eligible. The searched item consisted of terms related to critically ill patients and terms related to lactate clearance.

Data Extraction

The following data were extracted: the name of the first author, publication year, subjects and setting, mean age of study population, sample size, male percentage, mortality of study cohort, definition of clearance, and the initial lactate level. Relative risk was reported to estimate the predictive value of lactate clearance on mortality rate, with relative risk less than 1 indicating that lactate clearance was a protective factor. Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy of lactate clearance in predicting mortality was performed by using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model.

Data Synthesis

A total of 15 original articles were included in the study. Because of the significant heterogeneity across studies (I = 61.4%), random-effects model was used to pool relative risks. The pooled relative risk for mortality was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.29–0.50). The overall sensitivity and specificity for lactate clearance to predict mortality were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.58–0.87) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61–0.80), respectively. The diagnostic performance improved slightly when meta-analysis was restricted to ICU patients, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.67–0.92) and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.59–0.75), respectively.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that lactate clearance is predictive of lower mortality rate in critically ill patients, and its diagnostic performance is optimal for clinical utility.

### Blood lactate measurements and analysis during exercise: a guide for clinicians [^6d04571b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2007). Low credibility.

Blood lactate concentration ([La(-)](b)) is one of the most often measured parameters during clinical exercise testing as well as during performance testing of athletes. While an elevated [La(-)](b) may be indicative of ischemia or hypoxemia, it may also be a "normal" physiological response to exertion. In response to "all-out" maximal exertion lasting 30–120 seconds, peak [La(-)](b) values of approximately 15–25 mM may be observed 3–8 minutes postexercise. In response to progressive, incremental exercise, [La(-)](b) increases gradually at first and then more rapidly as the exercise becomes more intense. The work rate beyond which [La(-)](b) increases exponentially [the lactate threshold (LT)] is a better predictor of performance than VO₂max and is a better indicator of exercise intensity than heart rate; thus LT (and other valid methods of describing this curvilinear [La(-)](b) response with a single point) is useful in prescribing exercise intensities for most diseased and nondiseased patients alike. H(+)-monocarboxylate cotransporters provide the primary of three routes by which La(-) transport proceeds across the sarcolemma and red blood cell membrane. At rest and during most exercise conditions, whole blood [La(-)] values are on average 70% of the corresponding plasma [La(-)] values; thus when analyzing [La(-)](b'), care should be taken to both (1) validate the [La(-)](b)-measuring instrument with the criterion/reference enzymatic method and (2) interpret the results correctly based on what is being measured (plasma or whole blood). Overall, it is advantageous for clinicians to have a thorough understanding of [La(-)](b) responses, blood La(-) transport and distribution, and [La(-)](b) analysis.

Blood lactate — use of trends to guide resuscitation: We suggest using trends in blood lactate levels, in addition to clinical assessment, to guide resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In children with an elevated blood lactate, repeat testing that reveals a persistent elevation in blood lactate may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should prompt efforts to further promote hemodynamic stability. Pediatric evidence includes one observational study of lactate-guided resuscitation that included 77 children with sepsis in the ED, in which lactate normalization was associated with a decreased risk of persistent organ dysfunction (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73 and adjusted RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.78); indirect adult evidence includes six RCTs with a total of 1,007 patients evaluating lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with septic shock.

### Longitudinal monitoring of lactate in hospitalized and ambulatory COVID-19 patients [^c70857a2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Lactate levels associated with COVID-19 clinical phenotype (hospitalized patients vs. outpatients). The nonparametric Friedman test was used to detect differences in the analysis of variance with repeated measurements. Figures were created using ggplot2 package version 3.2.1 supported on R program software version 3.5.0.

Lactate levels in our hospitalized patients were moderately elevated compared with pneumonia caused by non–SARS-CoV-2 infections, where more severe disease (CURB-65 ≥ 4) had a median lactate level of around 4 mmol/L. In severe systemic infections such as malaria, admission lactate levels are also elevated with cutoffs > 5 mmol/L associated with severe disease and fatal outcomes, particularly if sustained for hours. The time course of decreases in lactate levels in COVID-19 reflects a longer course of illness. In some patients, the lactate level increased at D28, perhaps reflecting increased activity when diffusion defects in lungs may not have recovered fully. Elevations in lactate levels reflect different pathophysiological processes with decreased oxygen diffusion in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, perhaps with adequate tissue oxygenation being maintained in many patients until the disease progresses in severity ("silent hypoxia"), whereas in malaria, tissue hypoxia caused by microvascular obstruction increases lactate production in the host tissues.

A total of 10% of hospitalized patients could only be recruited, as many of the hospitalized patients do not fulfill the inclusion criteria, that includes denial of informed written consent. This is acknowledged as a major limitation in this study. Although age and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the COVID-19 clinical course, elevated lactate levels equally facilitate the assessment of disease course.

### Endpoints of resuscitation [^a794a79d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the multiple causes of the shock state, all causes possess the common abnormality of oxygen supply not meeting tissue metabolic demands. Compensatory mechanisms may mask the severity of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, since catecholamines and extracellular fluid shifts initially compensate for the physiologic derangements associated with patients in shock. Despite the achievement of normal physiologic parameters after resuscitation, significant metabolic acidosis may continue to be present in the tissues, as evidenced by increased lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. This review discusses the major endpoints of resuscitation in clinical use.

### The science and translation of lactate shuttle theory [^42d1096f]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule. "Lactate shuttle" (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a "strain" and not a "stress" biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review.

### Relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective multi-centre study [^59923e52]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Blood lactate concentration is increasingly being measured in the critically ill.

- Higher intensive care unit blood lactate concentrations above the current normal range (absolute hyperlactatemia) are associated with increased hospital mortality.

- Higher intensive care unit admission blood lactate concentrations within the current normal range (relative hyperlactatemia) are associated with increased hospital mortality.

- Higher time weighted intensive care unit blood lactate concentrations within the current normal range (relative hyperlactatemia) are associated with increased hospital mortality.

- Higher blood lactate concentrations within the current normal range can be used to identify patients at high risk of death; possibly suggesting that we need to revise the current definition of normal blood lactate concentration in the critically ill.

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^98e69fc3]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill patients with lactate levels within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 m M), we found lactate of 1.35 m M to be the best cutoff threshold that discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors. Relative hyperlactatemia was an independent predictor of hospital and ICU mortality.

The first demonstration of lactate in human blood was in shock patients, by Johann Joseph Scherer in 1843. Subsequent work led to the demonstration that tissue hypoxia was associated with increased lactate level. Elevated lactate is frequently seen in critically ill patients and is primarily a consequence of inadequate oxygen delivery, usually associated with significant cardiopulmonary compromise, as seen in cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic shock.

In an unstressed individual, the basal lactate concentration is 1.0 ± 0.5 m M. In critically ill patients, a lactate level of ≤ 2 m M is considered to be within the reference range, and therefore, hyperlactatemia is defined as lactate of > 2 m M. A wealth of literature exists on hyperlactatemia (> 2 m M) but not on lactate within the reference range.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is used in dermatology practice, particularly as a prognostic marker for cutaneous lymphoma. LDH is an intracellular enzyme involved in anaerobic glycolysis, and is found at low concentrations in the blood. LDH is produced in every tissue, thus cell damage releases LDH into the circulation, so the causes of elevated LDH levels are multiple. The utility of LDH in dermatology practice is reviewed, alongside current diagnostic and staging guidelines.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^2fe25f0b]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective observational study in which data were extracted from an online international database, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). The MIMIC-III is a large, single-center database that comprises information related to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital located in Boston. The database contains 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients (age 16 years or above) admitted to critical care units between 2001 and 2012. It is possible to access this database by passing an examination and obtaining the certification. One author (HC) obtained access and was responsible for the data extraction (certification number 27252652).

Selection of participants

Septic patients with an initial lactate level > 2.0 mmol/L after ICU admission were eligible for inclusion in our study. The diagnoses of sepsis were consistent with the third sepsis definition, that is, patients with documented or suspected infection and an acute change in total SOFA score ≥ 2 points. Infection was identified from the ICD-9 code in the MIMIC-III database. Patients who were younger than 18 years or spent fewer than 48 h in the ICU were excluded. For patients who were admitted to the ICU more than once, only the first ICU stay was included for analysis. Included patients were subsequently divided into two groups: the early lactate group (EL group, the initial lactate level was measured within 1 h after ICU admission) and the late lactate group (LL group, the initial lactate level was measured more than 1 h after ICU admission).

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^9136152d]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Can elevated lactate and LDH produce a false positive enzymatic ethanol result in live patients presenting to the emergency department? [^f8106ef6]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There have been allegations in the courtroom that elevated serum lactic acid in trauma victims can yield a falsely elevated serum ethanol assay. Most hospitals utilize an indirect method of ethanol measurement where a serum sample is added to a mix of alcohol dehydrogenase and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This allows any ethanol in the patient's serum to be metabolized to acetaldehyde, and in the process results in the reduction of NAD+to NADH. NADH is then measured using spectrophotometry. The courtroom allegation stems from the concept that oxidation of lactate to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) results in the same molar-for-molar reduction of NAD+to NADH, and could therefore theoretically cause patients with elevated lactate and LDH to have a falsely elevated ethanol concentration.

Methods

Patients with elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations who presented to a university hospital from 20 April 2015 to 13 December 2015 were identified to provide possible test specimens. If a sufficient amount of serum was available, the sample was used to re-run the lactate and LDH concentration simultaneously with an enzymatic ethanol assay. Any samples that had elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations on this retesting, and also yielded a positive ethanol concentration, were sent for confirmatory gas chromatography testing of ethanol concentrations. A control group of 20 samples with normal lactate and LDH were included.

Results

A total of 37 samples were included in the final analysis. Only 4 patients had an elevated enzymatic ethanol concentration, and all 4 also had a measurable GC ethanol concentration. The lactate in this dataset ranged from 2.4 to 24.2mmol/L, with a mean of 6.53mmol/L (normal value 0.5–2.2). The LDH ranged from 242 to 8838U/L with a mean of 1695U/L (normal value 122-225U/L). Twenty control samples were run on patients with normal lactate and LDH, none of which yielded a positive enzymatic ethanol result.

Conclusions

This data does not support the contention that an elevated LDH and lactate can yield a false positive serum ethanol result as run by enzymatic ethanol assay in live patients presenting to the emergency department.

### Serum lactate as a predictor of mortality in patients with infection [^91a012ad]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of an initial serum lactate measurement for identifying high risk of death in patients with infection.

Design and Setting

Post-hoc analysis of a prospectively compiled registry in an urban academic hospital.

Participants

Patients with (a) a primary or secondary diagnosis of infection and (b) lactate measurement who were admitted over the 18 months following hospital-wide implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guideline for lactate measurement in patients with infection and possible severe sepsis. There were 1,177 unique patients, with an in-hospital mortality of 19%.

Measurements and Results

Outcome measures included acute-phase (≤ 3 days) death and in-hospital death. We defined lactate ranges a priori (low, 0.0–2.0; intermediate, 2.1–3.9; high, 4.0 mmol/l or above) — and tested for linear associations with mortality by one-way analysis of variance. We determined sensitivity/specificity, odds ratios, and likelihood ratios for a lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/l and performed a Bayesian analysis to determine its impact on a full range (0.01–0.99) of hypothetical pretest probability estimates for death. In-hospital mortality was 15%, 25%, and 38% in low, intermediate, and high lactate groups, respectively. Acute-phase deaths and in-hospital deaths increased linearly with lactate. An initial lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/l was associated with sixfold higher odds of acute-phase death; however, a lactate level less than 4 mmol/l had little impact on probability of death.

Conclusions

When broadly implemented in routine practice, measurement of lactate in patients with infection and possible sepsis can affect assessment of mortality risk. Specifically, an initial lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/l substantially increases the probability of acute-phase death.

The final diagnosis of 158 patients who had a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate concentration greater than 2 mmol/l was ascertained. The conditions included seizures, inflammatory changes, and proven metabolic disorders. For the diagnosis of congenital lactic acidoses, CSF lactate should ideally be measured in a seizure free patient after any acute illness.

### New sepsis and septic shock definitions: clinical implications and controversies [^ba6e6e50]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

New sepsis definitions shift emphasis from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to organ dysfunction, quantified using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The new definitions also propose Quick SOFA criteria to rapidly identify potentially infected patients at risk for poor outcomes. The diagnosis of septic shock requires vasopressor dependence and increased lactate levels. Strengths of these definitions include their simplicity and clear association with adverse outcomes. However, their utility in identifying patients with serious infections before frank sepsis ensues remains to be seen. This article reviews challenges in defining sepsis, strengths and weaknesses of the new definitions, and unresolved issues.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^03542d00]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^8a7c61f1]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Rationale

Our intent was to identify a cohort of patients in which lactic acidosis was suspected but for whom other acid–base abnormalities might be present. Focusing on this group of patients permitted us to limit our analysis to a subgroup with a high incidence of metabolic acidosis and a high risk of death. Describing the incidence and impact of various forms of acidosis in this cohort is potentially more clinically relevant than in the entire intensive care unit (ICU) population.

We divided this cohort into two groups depending on the presence or absence of a metabolic acidosis, where SBE < -2 mEq/l determined metabolic acidosis. The metabolic acidosis group was further subdivided into groups depending on the anion contributing to the majority of the acidosis.

Data abstraction

After approval from the Investigational Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh we searched the database of Medical Archival Systems Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) from 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2002 for all ICU admissions at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Oakland, PA. We selected cases on the following criteria. First, clinicians caring for each patient suspected the presence of lactic acidosis and obtained an analysis for arterial blood gas (ABG) and serum lactate. In the hospitals included in this study, to obtain a lactate level a physician has to order one specifically. There are no routine, standing orders or protocols for lactate measurement. Thus, blood lactate measurements are usually obtained only when there is a suspicion of lactic acidosis. Next, to account for all ions, electrolytes had to be drawn within four hours (0.8 ± 2, mean ± SD) hours), and calcium, magnesium and phosphorus within 24 hours (mean 1.3 ± 4.6 hours) of the referenced ABG and an albumin level at some time during the hospitalization. If more than one albumin value was recorded, the lowest value was used to avoid spurious elevations due to possible resuscitation with albumin. If the patient had more than one ABG that fitted these criteria, the ABG with the highest lactate level was used. Finally, if there was more than one data set of electrolytes that fitted around the index ABG, the data set with an absolute time frame closest to the indexed ABG was used. Data could be collected at any time that the patient fitted these criteria. A few patients might have actually had the highest lactate level while in the Emergency Department or on the general wards; however, we included only patients who were ultimately admitted to an ICU.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f022dd9b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, subgroup analysis of patients with metabolic acidosis revealed that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival outcomes for pediatric patients, regardless of whether they have lactic acidosis or non-lactic acidosis. However, it was observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively reduces the mortality risk of patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L) in both types of patients, while it increases the mortality risk of patients without hyperchloremia (chloride < 107 mmol/L). This indicates that the level of lactate does not influence the impact of chloride levels on sodium bicarbonate treatment.

Among non-LA patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, there was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality risk between patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment after matching and those who did not. This is because the mortality rate of non-LA patients themselves is relatively low, and the reduction in sample size after matching leads to a decrease in statistical power. Nevertheless, the mortality rate of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment was still lower. Findings of this study suggest that in pediatric metabolic acidosis, if chloride is markedly elevated, sodium bicarbonate therapy might be considered even if lactate is high. Whereas if chloride is normal, clinicians should be more cautious and ensure other treatments are prioritized.

The categorization of metabolic acidosis patients based on the presence of lactic acidosis divides them into two groups with potentially distinct acidosis mechanisms. There is a considerable difference in the acidic components contributing to pH reduction in these two group patients. In vitro cytological studies have demonstrated that the body's response to acidosis induced by lactate or hydrochloric acid involves different cytokine reactions, suggesting that the response to and harm caused by various acid components may vary. Research on prognostic indicators for patients has shown that the severity of acidosis, as measured by pH or standard base excess, is not independently linked to hospital mortality when controlling for the causal anion (lactate, chloride, or others). The anion causing the metabolic acidosis may play a more significant role in determining outcomes than the pH itself. Different levels or categories of causal anions can result in significantly diverse prognoses, although the importance of the acidosis cause has been emphasized in previous research. Nevertheless, this study found that sodium bicarbonate can decrease the mortality risk in patients with both lactic and non-lactic acidosis with hyperchloremia. This suggests that the mechanism of action of sodium bicarbonate may not be dependent on the components causing the acidosis and is effective in correcting acidosis resulting from multiple pathological mechanisms in hyperchloremia.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^ec59ed0a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Delays in lactate measurement and the primary outcome

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a delay in initial lactate measurement was an important determinant of 28-day mortality. The odds ratio (OR) of mortality was 1.04 per hour delay (95% CI 1.02–1.05; p < 0.001) (Additional file 1: Table S7). The relationship between the time to complete the initial lactate measurement and 28-day mortality is shown in Fig. 4. In the EL group, 635 patients had more than 1 lactate measurement made (Additional file 1: Table S8). Each hour delay in remeasuring lactate was associated with an increase in 28-day mortality (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04–1.15; p < 0.001) (Additional file 1: Table S9). Furthermore, there was a consistent increase in the risk of mortality in patients in whom lactate was remeasured more than 3 h later (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.01–2.27; p = 0.042). Figure 5 shows the relationship between the time to complete the lactate remeasurement and 28-day mortality.

### Cause of an elevated lactate level… [^78a307fe]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor An article in the Diagnostic Test Interpretation series discussed elevated lactate levels in a non–critically ill patient. 1 We wish to underscore the importance of considering infection as a cause of lactic acidosis early in the clinical course of similar patients. Infection is one of the leading causes of death in non-Hodgkin lymphoma2; patients with lymphoma can become immunocompromised as a consequence of the underlying cancer or secondary to myeloablative therapies. Although this patient was not currently neutropenic, his absolute lymphocyte count of 200/μL was very low. A history of advanced, refractory lymphoma and signs of immune suppression should increase clinical suspicion for infection. Swenson KE, Wira CR. Cause of an Elevated Lactate Level. JAMA. 2015;

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^b2a6284f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Blood lactate trends in pediatric septic shock — resuscitation guidance: "We suggest using trends in blood lactate levels, in addition to clinical assessment, to guide resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence)", and "In children with an elevated blood lactate, repeat testing that reveals a persistent elevation in blood lactate may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should prompt efforts, as needed, to further promote hemodynamic stability". Although "blood lactate is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion", it is noted that increased lactate "is associated with worse outcomes in children", and the only pediatric evidence cited is "one pediatric observational study… which included 77 children with sepsis in the ED", where "lactate normalization was associated with a decreased risk of persistent organ dysfunction (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73 and adjusted RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.78)". Indirect adult data include "six RCTs (total of 1,007 patients) evaluating lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with septic shock".

### Recurrent ethylene glycol poisoning with elevated lactate levels to obtain opioid medications [^509dd230]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Malingering is when a patient feigns illness for secondary gain. While most patients with malingering manufacture or exaggerate symptoms, some patients may induce illness. Previous reports of malingering patients inducing illness include sepsis, kidney pain, migraine, and chest pain. However, acute poisoning as a manifestation of malingering appears to be rare.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 39-year-old man who presented to the emergency department complaining of diffuse body pain. The patient reported multiple admission at outside hospitals for "lactate" and said, "it feels like it is happening again because of how my body feels". Laboratory findings were concerning for serum lactate of > 20.0 mmol/L and ethylene glycol (EG) level of 19 mg/dL. A chart review found that the man had been admitted for elevated serum lactate 8 times to area hospitals in several years, often in the setting of EG poisoning. During these episodes he required intravenous fluids and frequent intravenous pain medications. When confronted about concern regarding the recurrent fallacious lactate levels in the setting of factitious EG ingestion, the patient often became combative and left against medical advice. The primary metabolite of EG, glycolic acid, can interfere with lactate assays, causing a false elevation. Our patient apparently recognized this and took advantage of it to be admitted and receive intravenous opioids. This is the only case known to us of malingering via EG ingestion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware that metabolites of EG may interfere with serum lactate assay. In addition, they should be aware of possible malingering-related poisoning and plausible association with requests for intravenous opioid pain medications. This represents a risk to the patient and others if undiagnosed.

### The utility of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase in current clinical practice [^9f3a4d30]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Because of its wide tissue distribution, elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LD) is a nonspecific finding. Although serum LD is still included in the prognosis and staging of metastatic melanoma and germ cell tumors, its nonspecificity has led to decreased usefulness.

Methods

In this study, we analyzed the serum LD assays performed in a 726-bed hospital during a 1-year period and reviewed charts of patients with serum LD of > 3 standard deviations (SD).

Results

Of 312 patients with elevated serum LD, only 9 were patients with melanoma and germ cell tumors. The other 303 patients had other malignancies, chronic conditions, and sepsis.

Conclusion

Elevated serum LD (even > 3 SD) is an extremely nonspecific finding that does not contribute to clinical management in a majority of patients. As such, serum LD testing should be retired from routine clinical order sets and restricted in use.

### Lactate level, aetiology and mortality of adult patients in an emergency department: a cohort study [^d4afc4a3]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Increased lactate is associated with high mortality among patients with suspected infection or trauma in the emergency department (ED), but the association with patients with other aetiologies is less well described. The aim of this study was to describe the relation between lactate, aetiology and 7-day mortality in adult ED patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of all adult patients who had a lactate measured within 4h after arrival to the ED at Odense University Hospital between June 2012 and May 2013. The categorisation of suspected aetiology was based on discharge diagnoses.

Results

5360 patients were included; 51.7% were men, and the median age was 67years (IQR 50–79). 77.2% had low lactate (0–1.9mmol/L), 16.2% intermediate lactate (2–3.9mmol/L), and 6.6% high lactate (≥ 4mmol/L). 7-day mortality was 2.9% (95% CI 2.4% to 3.5%) for patients with low lactate, 7.8% (95% CI 6.1% to 9.8%) for patients with intermediate lactate, and 23.9% (95% CI 19.6% to 28.8%) for patients with high lactate. The association between lactate level and mortality varied across different diagnostic groups. Based on Area Under the Curve in receiver operating characteristic analysis, lactate level showed to be useful in patients with infection (0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.84), trauma (0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.92), cardiac diseases (0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91) and gastrointestinal diseases (0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98). Lactate level was not useful in neurological (0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.67) and respiratory disease (0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74), and of uncertain value in the remaining diagnostic groups.

Conclusions

Among adult ED patients, the prognostic value of lactate varies between diagnostic groups.

### Blood lactate in mild and moderate ARDS secondary to SARS COV 2 [^ff4c1b07]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Elevated blood lactate levels are associated with poor outcome in several critical conditions. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 rarely develop hyperlactatemia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the trend of lactatemia in patients affected by mild/moderate SARS-Co V-2-ARDS and if it affected prognosis.

Methods

We analyzed blood lactate levels in thirty-eight patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to COVID Care Unit of Santa Maria delle Grazie Hospital, Pozzuoli.

Results

Twenty patients survived and were discharged at home and 18 patients died. Despite severe hypoxia that affected all patients enrolled, T0 lactate was within normal values. All survivors showed a significant increase in lactate concentration the day prior to clinical improvement. In not-survivors levels of lactate did not increase significantly.

Conclusion

In our study, patients who survive SARS CoV-2 ARDS have a fleeting increase in lactate, which precedes clinical improvement by one day.

### Failure to clear elevated lactate predicts 24-hour mortality in trauma patients [^763d7007]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Lactate clearance is a standard resuscitation goal in patients in nontraumatic shock but has not been investigated adequately as a tool to identify trauma patients at risk of dying. Our objective was to determine if trauma patients with impaired lactate clearance have a higher 24-hour mortality rate than patients whose lactate concentration normalizes.

Methods

A retrospective chart review identified patients who were admitted directly from the scene of injury to an urban trauma center between 2010 and 2013 and who had at least one lactate concentration measurement within 24 hours. Transfers, patients without lactate measurement, and those who were dead on arrival were excluded. Of the 26,545 screened patients, 18,304 constituted the initial lactate measurement population, and 3,887 were the lactate clearance cohorts.

Results

Initial lactate had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 and 0.73 for mortality at 24 hours and in the hospital, respectively. An initial concentration of 3 mmol/L or greater had a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.73 for mortality at 24 hours. The mortality rate among patients with elevated lactate concentrations (n = 2,381; 5.6 [2.8] mmol/L) that did not decline to less than 2.0 mmol/L in response to resuscitative efforts (mean [SD] second measurement, 3.7 [1.9] mmol/L) was nearly seven times higher (4.1% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001) than among those with an elevated concentration (n = 1,506, 5.3 [2.7]mmol/L) that normalized (1.4 [0.4]mmol/L). Logistic regression analysis showed that failure to clear lactate was associated with death more than any other feature (odds ratio, 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5–35.5), except having an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 25 (odds ratio, 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.7–25.2).

Conclusion

Failure to clear lactate is a strong negative prognostic marker after injury. An initial lactate measurement combined with a second measurement for high-risk individuals might constitute a useful method of risk stratifying injured patients.

### Do patients die with or from metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA)? Systematic review and meta-analysis of pH and lactate as predictors of mortality in MALA [^8f3d2fbc]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) may occur after acute metformin overdose, or from therapeutic use in patients with renal compromise. The mortality is high, historically 50% and more recently 25%. In many disease states, lactate concentration is strongly associated with mortality. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the utility of pH and lactate concentration in predicting mortality in patients with MALA.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from their inception to April 2019 for case reports, case series, prospective, and retrospective studies investigating mortality in patients with MALA. Cases and studies were reviewed by all authors and included if they reported data on pH, lactate, and outcome. Where necessary, authors of studies were contacted for patient-level data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for pH and lactate for predicting mortality in patients with MALA.

Results

Forty-four studies were included encompassing 170 cases of MALA with median age of 68.5 years old. Median pH and lactate were 7.02 mmol/L and 14.45 mmol/L, respectively. Overall mortality was 36.2% (95% CI 29.6–43.94). Neither lactate nor pH was a good predictor of mortality among patients with MALA. The area under the ROC curve for lactate and pH were 0.59 (0.51–0.68) and 0.43 (0.34–0.52), respectively.

Conclusion

Our review found higher mortality from MALA than seen in recent studies. This may be due to variation in standard medical practice both geographically and across the study interval, sample size, misidentification of MALA for another disease process and vice versa, confounding by selection and reporting biases, and treatment intensity (e.g., hemodialysis) influenced by degree of pH and lactate derangement. The ROC curves showed poor predictive power of either lactate or pH for mortality in MALA. With the exception of patients with acute metformin overdose, patients with MALA usually have coexisting precipitating illnesses such as sepsis or renal failure, though lactate from MALA is generally higher than would be considered survivable for those disease states on their own. It is possible that mortality is more related to that coexisting illness than MALA itself, and many patients die with MALA rather than from MALA. Additional work looking solely at MALA in healthy patients with acute metformin overdose may show a closer relationship between lactate, pH, and mortality.

### Elevated lactate in noncritically ill patients… [^3cf9cfc0]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

After 5 days of nausea and vomiting, a man in his 60s with advanced, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving the abdomen presented to the emergency department. The patient noted chronic, left-sided abdominal pain related to his lymphoma and normal passage of stool and flatus. He reported no other illnesses and was taking only esomeprazole. He was afebrile and normotensive with a pulse rate of 104/minute. A large, firm, tender mass located near the umbilicus was palpable in his abdomen, but there was no rigidity or rebound tenderness. Laboratory studies showed an elevated lactate level of 6. 3 mmol/L. Chen M, Kim TY, Pessegueiro AM. Elevated Lactate Levels in a Non–Critically Ill Patient. JAMA. 2015; 313: 849–850.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^95de36c2]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Not all metabolic acidoses are the same. In our cohort study, each type of metabolic acidosis had a different mortality associated with it. There was increased mortality associated with lactate and unidentified anions (SIG). Metabolic acidosis (both lactic and non-lactic) seems to be associated with high mortality and increased length of stay in hospital and in the ICU. Like that of lactate, monitoring of SIG seems warranted and this can be simplified by the use of an anion gap normalized to the patient's albumin and phosphate concentrations.

Patients in shock present frequently to the emergency department. The emergency physician must be skilled in the resuscitation of both differentiated and undifferentiated shock. Early, aggressive resuscitation of patients in shock is essential, using macrocirculatory, microcirculatory, and clinical end points to guide interventions.

### Diagnostic performance of venous lactate on arrival at the emergency department for myocardial infarction [^c30c6915]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the sensitivity of the venous lactate level at presentation for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain.

Methods

A prospective, double-blind observational study was done in a tertiary care ED. From January to April 2000, all consecutive patients presenting with chest pain were eligible. Lactate level was obtained on arrival and compared with two criterion standards for the diagnosis of AMI: the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Committee (ESC/ACC) classifications. A lactate level greater than 1.50 mmol/L was considered positive.

Results

Between January and April 2000, 718 patients were enrolled. By the WHO criteria, 64 patients suffered an AMI, of whom 59 had an elevated lactate level, yielding a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI = 86% to 99%), a specificity of 44% (95% CI = 40% to 48%), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98% (95% CI = 97% to 99%). For all patients presenting with more than two hours of chest pain (n = 34), the lactate level was elevated. When using the ESC/ACC criteria, 100 patients sustained an AMI, of whom 88 had an elevated lactate level, yielding a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI = 82% to 94%), a specificity of 46% (95% CI = 42% to 50%), and an NPV of 96% (95% CI = 94% to 98%).

Conclusions

Venous lactate level at presentation is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of AMI, particularly in patients with more than two hours of chest pain. Given its limitations in specificity and ability to detect creatine kinase-MB-negative/troponin-positive microinfarcts, further research is needed to determine how lactate can complement other cardiac enzymes in risk-stratifying all acute coronary syndromes.

### The combination of lactate level, lactate clearance and APACHE II score better predicts short-term outcomes in critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study [^acefeab9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, a high lactate level is closely related to mortality risk. Some researchers suggest that when the lactate level is high, the patient's prognosis is poor, and there is a dose-dependent relationship between the lactate level and the risk of mortality. In addition, there is a significant correlation between persistently high lactate levels and an increased risk of mortality. Patients with higher baseline lactate levels have a higher risk of mortality, and thus, the initial lactate concentration better predicts the risk of patient mortality. In a large retrospective study by Bou et al. lactate level was an independent predictor of hospital mortality in critically ill patients, and higher lactate values were associated with a higher risk of hospital mortality and a longer hospital stay. In previous studies, researchers have also investigated the prediction of blood lactate values in critically ill patients using the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets on the MIMIC-III cohort in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. The results show that elevations in initially obtained serum lactate levels are strong predictors of mortality in critically ill patients and identifying patients whose serum lactate levels are more likely to increase can alert physicians to improve care and guide them in determining the frequency of conducting blood tests. Therefore, lactate levels are considered a valuable indicator of patient mortality and can be used to guide treatment.

However, there are few studies on the relationship between dynamic changes in lactate levels and risk of mortality in critically ill patients. A retrospective study showed that lactate dynamics at 6 h and time-weighted average lactate may predict survival beyond 30 days in critically ill patients. The clinical utility of delta lactate was investigated to predict early in-hospital mortality in adult patients in a prospective, multicentric, cohort study, and it was observed that the assessment of the dynamic changes in lactate levels can be a quick and easy tool for determining the initial state and the short-term prognosis of a critical patient. Their results also showed that both a low lactate level and a lactate clearance of more than 10% were related to an increase in survival. Hyperlactatemia, a dynamic indicator, has significant independent predictive value, and a higher average lactate level and continuous increases in lactate concentration during a 24-h period were related to higher mortality in patients. Dynamic monitoring of lactate levels is needed, preferably at intervals of 2 or 6 h or longer, but corresponding results have not yet been reliably confirmed.

### Assessment of intensive care unit laboratory values that differ from reference ranges and association with patient mortality and length of stay [^5c89258b]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This work is exploratory, and thus has many limitations. First, it is a single-center study from 1 ICU database. Second, the approach described does not immediately lend itself to direct clinical translation. Crude outcomes such as length of stay and mortality are highly dependent on multiple interacting factors, including the patient's specific pathology (or pathologies) and comorbidities, as well as interactions between laboratory values. However, our goal is not direct clinical translation, but rather to point out that there is limited overlap between our normal reference ranges and the laboratory values of patients, and that other approaches may be possible.

Third, our approach does not investigate the interactions with these other factors. It does not take into account specific pathologies or underlying comorbidities — steps that would certainly be necessary for this approach to be translated clinically.

Fourth, generating population-specific, outcome-based probability distributions for laboratory value interpretation requires the input of large amounts of data, as well as complex computational analysis. This represents a major barrier to clinical translation. Again, the purpose of our work is to highlight a potentially different mechanism to interpret laboratory values; the best way to integrate such an approach clinically remains to be seen.

Finally, 1 significant downside to using an approach such as this is that it represents a major departure from how clinicians are trained to interpret laboratory values — that is, to ask, "Is this value abnormal (high or low) and, if so, what does this mean?" The interpretation of values generated in our approach is not clear; thus, how to interpret these novel distributions and how to apply them in clinical decision making remains to be studied.

Future Directions

This approach is intended to question what is normal when interpreting laboratory (or other) tests in a specific patient population. A probabilistic approach to interpreting laboratory results may be applied to other uses of a diagnostic test apart from prognostication, such as translation to the likelihood of a specific clinical event, complication, or disease being present. This approach might lend itself to various use cases, including estimation of the likelihood of life-threatening arrhythmia based on commonly monitored and oft-repleted serum electrolytes (eg, potassium and magnesium); the likelihood of Clostridium difficile infection based on the degree of white blood cell count elevation; or the likelihood of response to chemotherapy based on serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Future research will focus on probabilistic interpretation of discrete outcomes and on probabilistic interpretation of dynamic trends of laboratory values and other clinical parameters.

### Anion gap as a screening tool for elevated lactate in patients with an increased risk of developing sepsis in the emergency department [^2efc445c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum lactate levels are a useful tool in monitoring critically ill patients, especially those who are septic. However, lactate levels are often not routinely drawn or rapidly available in some institutions. The objective of this study was to determine if a readily available anion gap (AG) could be used as a surrogate marker for abnormal lactate level in Emergency Department (ED) patients at risk for sepsis.

Methods

Prospective, observational cohort study of consecutive ED patients seen at an urban university tertiary care referral center with 46,000 annual ED visits. ED patients aged 18 years or older presenting with clinically suspected infection were eligible for enrollment if a serum chemistry and lactate levels were drawn during the ED visit. During the 9-month study period, 1419 patients were enrolled. The initial basic chemistry panels, calculated AG, and lactate levels drawn in the ED were collected. We defined, a priori, an AG > 12 and a lactate > 4 mmol/L to be abnormal. Analysis was performed with Student's t-test, operating characteristics with 95% confidence intervals, and logistic regression.

Results

The mean AG was 11.8 (SD 3.6) and the mean lactate was 2.1 (SD 1.3). For an AG > 12, the mean lactate was 2.9 (SD 1.7), compared with 1.8 (SD 0.8) for an AG < 12. The sensitivity of an elevated AG (> 12) in predicting elevated lactate levels (> 4 mmol/L) was 80% (72–87%) and the specificity was 69% (66–71%). Patients with a gap > 12 had a 7.3-fold (4.6–11.4) increased risk of having a lactate > 4 mmol/L. The area under the curve was 0.84.

Conclusion

This study suggests that an elevated AG obtained in the ED is a moderately sensitive and specific means to detect elevated lactate levels in ED patients at risk for sepsis. This information may be somewhat helpful to Emergency Physicians to risk-stratify their patients to provide more aggressive early resuscitation.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^e13ba5a4]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Upcoming research in this field should be focused on the optimal strategy to treat severe metabolic acidosis, including symptomatic therapy.

### Quantitative analysis of high plasma lactate concentration in ED patients after alcohol intake [^60b1edd5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Plasma lactate concentration is known to increase after alcohol intake. However, this increase has rarely been analyzed quantitatively in emergency department (ED) settings. Evaluating plasma lactate elevation in ED patients after alcohol intake is important because it can affect patients' evaluation based on the plasma lactate level.

Methods

This study analyzed venous lactate concentrations of 196 continuous patients presented to our ED after alcohol intake. The control group comprised 219 successive ED patients without alcohol intake. Patients who had conditions that might induce lactate elevation were excluded from both groups.

Results

Venous lactate concentration was significantly higher in the alcohol intake group (2.83 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, 2.69–2.96 mmol/L) than in the control group (1.65 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, 1.53–1.77 mmol/L; P < .05). Lactate concentrations exceeding 3 mmol/L and exceeding 4 mmol/L were found, respectively, in 41.8% and 12.2% of the alcohol intake group compared with in 8.7% and 2.3% of the control group (P < .05). Lactate concentrations do not correlate with patients' level of consciousness. Therefore, a higher plasma ethanol level is apparently unrelated to elevated lactate.

Discussion and Conclusion

Analyses show that plasma lactate concentration is significantly higher in ED patients after alcohol intake and to a greater degree than previously reported, even in patients without previously known alcohol-related diseases. Emergency department physicians must be careful when interpreting the lactate level of the patients with alcohol intake.

SCAI Door to Lactate Clearance flowchart — cardiogenic shock care is guided by serial lactate and lactate clearance with stage-based actions: For SCAI SHOCK Stage A/B, obtain lactate levels Q2–3H, as clinically indicated. For SCAI SHOCK Stage C–E, obtain lactate levels Q2–3H; if LC < 10% without worsening clinical status and/or hemodynamics, evaluate and treat alternative causes of persistent lactate and recheck lactate Q2–3H, proceeding when Lactate < 2 mmol/L or adequate LC; if there is rising lactate with LC < 10% with worsening clinical status and/or hemodynamics, escalate care. Escalation options include reevaluation through additional imaging or invasive hemodynamics, vasopressors, inotropes, MCS, cardiac substrate intervention, or consider initiating palliative care, and if adverse prognosticators are present and recovery or advanced therapies are not possible consider consultation with Palliative Care Service.

### Metformin hydrochloride extended release (metformin HCl ER) [^ce8371c7]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Warnings Section

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^2ab789b7]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Lactate and pH — monitoring and prognostication in CS: Lactate is produced in many tissues in response to tissue ischaemia and serves as a non-specific marker of poor perfusion; elevated lactate levels correlate with increased mortality in patients with CS not receiving tMCS and there is universal support for the use of lactate as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, including evaluation for monitoring response to tMCS. Rising lactate levels are associated with higher mortality, suggesting that early initiation of tMCS is warranted to reduce risk; two retrospective studies demonstrated that lactate > 15 mmol/L was associated with 100% mortality, yet due to variability in published data no definitive lactate threshold for futility can be established, and metabolic markers (eg, lactate and pH) and end-organ markers (eg, creatinine and liver enzymes) should be interpreted together with clinical factors such as age.

### Lactic acidosis… [^46a6378c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ALTHOUGH endogenous lactic acid has been recognized as a source of metabolic acidosis for many years in a variety of situations, 1–5 it was not until the publication by Huckabee of his clinical observations of the significance of lactic acid acidosis 6, 7 that great interest was stimulated in this condition. The demonstration that severe metabolic acidosis, frequently of fatal outcome, was a significant clinical problem has led to the increasing recognition of this situation in clinical practice. 5, 8–17. The definition of lactic acidosis remains arbitrary. Since the production of lactate is always accompanied by an equivalent appearance of hydrogen ion, significant elevation in blood lactate must be interpreted as lactic acidosis regardless of resultant arterial pH or bicarbonate levels.

Qualifying factors include the degree of compensation for the metabolic acidosis, represented by arterial pH, eventual outcome, the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of metabolic acidosis. TRANQUADA RE, GRANT WJ, PETERSON CR. Lactic Acidosis. Arch Intern Med. 1966; 117: 192–202.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^e13d663d]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### The combination of lactate level, lactate clearance and APACHE II score better predicts short-term outcomes in critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study [^aab49a75]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The mortality rate of critically ill patients is high due to the complexity and seriousness of their conditions. Risk stratification is conducive to the timely prediction of predict the prognosis of patients. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore some indicators to predict short and long-term outcomes and guide the treatment of critically ill patients.

Hypoxia is very common in critically ill patients. Hypoxia accelerates the progression of disease and leads to poor prognosis of patients. When combining max lactate at T24 with APACHE III, the lactate level is more sensitive and easier to detect and acts as an indicator to predict the prognosis of critically ill patients. The imbalance between oxygen delivery and consumption will cause the accumulation of lactate, and lactate levels will rise sharply. In addition, hypoperfusion can also result in an increased lactate level. Therefore, lactate levels can always reflect the state of oxygen metabolism, and hyperlactatemia is usually caused by hypoxia and hypoperfusion. Moreover, the decrease of in lactate clearance also plays a key role in the process of hyperlactatemia, particularly in elderly individuals with liver insufficiency or acute liver disease. However, in recent experimental studies, researchers found that lactate clearance is reduced significantly in patients with sepsis, even if hemodynamics remain steady and liver function is normal, which may be related to the decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Increased lactate production or decreased clearance will eventually lead to an increase in lactate levels, resulting in hyperlactatemia.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^681b7bd7]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The association between serum phosphate and mortality was somewhat surprising. Because we did not exclude patients with renal failure, one possible explanation is that elevated phosphate is a marker for renal insufficiency, leading to the positive correlation with mortality. However, if we exclude patients with a phosphate level of more than 5 mg/dl and reanalyze with our regression model, the association between phosphate and mortality remains just as strong. This finding is therefore not explained satisfactorily. Another possible explanation is that increases in phosphate reflect cellular damage. For example, increased serum phosphate in patients with ischemic bowel disease indicates extensive bowel injury. This finding is consistent with the report by Hucker and colleagues. that phosphate (among other biochemical and clinical measurements) was a significant variable in a mortality prediction model of Emergency Department patients who required hospital admission.

The 'SIG' category does not in itself identify an individual causative anion (for example ketones), but rather recognizes the presence of unidentified anions. The term 'SIG' is in itself potentially misleading, because the determinants of SIG include not only strong ions but also weak acids. However, this terminology has been used with increasing frequency and introducing new terminology would most probably confuse rather than clarify. We do not have sufficient information to exclude the effect of acute renal failure on SIG. Comparing the distribution of acidosis subtypes between patients with and without renal dysfunction (defined as a serum creatinine level of more than 2 mg/dl), we found less hyperchloremic and more lactic acidosis in the patients with elevated serum creatinine (Table 3). Interestingly, the proportion of cases defined by elevated SIG was about the same in both groups. These results are similar to those of Rocktaeschel and colleagues. who reported metabolic acidosis and high levels of SIG in patients with acute renal failure. Because patients receiving renal replacement therapy might have normal blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels at the time of the acidosis, we cannot be sure that they did not have acute renal failure even if the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal. However, even if we knew the patient's native renal function, we could not control for the effect of renal replacement therapy on the SIG. We did not attempt to quantify the presence of ketones or other anions that might be present because these data were usually not available. However, despite these limitations, our study is one of the largest epidemiologic series of critically ill patients with metabolic acidosis.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^698bff5d]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acid–base abnormalities are common in the intensive care unit (ICU). Differences in outcome exist between respiratory and metabolic acidosis in similar pH ranges. Some forms of metabolic acidosis (for example, lactate) seem to have worse outcomes than others (for example, chloride). The relative incidence of each type of disorder is unknown. We therefore designed this study to determine the nature and clinical significance of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Methods

An observational, cohort study of critically ill patients was performed in a tertiary care hospital. Critically ill patients were selected on the clinical suspicion of the presence of lactic acidosis. The inpatient mortality of the entire group was 14%, with a length of stay in hospital of 12 days and a length of stay in the ICU of 5.8 days.

Results

We reviewed records of 9,799 patients admitted to the ICUs at our institution between 1 January 2001 and 30 June 2002. We selected a cohort in which clinicians caring for patients ordered a measurement of arterial lactate level. We excluded patients in which any necessary variable required to characterize an acid–base disorder was absent. A total of 851 patients (9% of ICU admissions) met our criteria. Of these, 548 patients (64%) had a metabolic acidosis (standard base excess < -2 mEq/l) and these patients had a 45% mortality, compared with 25% for those with no metabolic acidosis (p < 0.001). We then subclassified metabolic acidosis cases on the basis of the predominant anion present (lactate, chloride, or all other anions). The mortality rate was highest for lactic acidosis (56%); for strong ion gap (SIG) acidosis it was 39% and for hyperchloremic acidosis 29% (p < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression model identified serum lactate, SIG, phosphate, and age as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusion

In critically ill patients in which a measurement of lactate level was ordered, lactate and SIG were strong independent predictors of mortality when they were the major source of metabolic acidosis. Overall, patients with metabolic acidosis were nearly twice as likely to die as patients without metabolic acidosis.

Pediatric sepsis — lactate-guided resuscitation: RCTs showed significant reduction in mortality compared with resuscitation without lactate monitoring (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.81).

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^b2726d69]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, high redox state, and release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels who had AKA. He recovered completely with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with an impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Elevated lactate during psychogenic hyperventilation [^59d1b1b2]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Elevated arterial lactate levels are closely related to morbidity and mortality in various patient categories. In the present retrospective study, the relation between arterial lactate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(2)) and pH was systematically investigated in patients who visited the emergency department (ED) with psychogenic hyperventilation.

Methods

Over a 5-month period, all the patients who visited the ED of a university hospital with presumed psychogenic hyperventilation were evaluated. Psychogenic hyperventilation was presumed to be present when an increased respiratory rate (> 20 min) was documented at or before the ED visit and when somatic causes explaining the hyperventilation were absent. Arterial blood gas and lactate levels (reference values 0.5–1.5 mmol/l) were immediately measured by a point-of-care analyser that was managed and calibrated by the central laboratory.

Results

During the study period, 46 patients were diagnosed as having psychogenic hyperventilation. The median (range) Pco(2) for this group was 4.3 (2.0–5.5) kPa, the pH was 7.47 (7.40–7.68) and the lactate level was 1.2 (0.5–4.4) mmol/l. 14 participants (30%) had a lactate level above the reference value of 1.5 mmol/l. Pco(2) was the most important predictor of lactate in multivariate analysis. None of the participants underwent any medical treatment other than observation at the ED or had been hospitalised after their ED visit.

Conclusions

In patients with psychogenic hyperventilation, lactate levels are frequently elevated. Whereas high lactates are usually associated with acidosis and an increased risk of poor outcome, in patients with psychogenic hyperventilation, high lactates are associated with hypocapnia and alkalosis. In this context, elevated arterial lactate levels should not be regarded as an adverse sign.

### Lactic acidosis: relationship between metformin levels, lactate concentration and mortality [^10f3e614]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

The role of metformin in lactic acidosis is regularly questioned. Arguments against a causal role for metformin in lactic acidosis occurrence are the lack of correlation between plasma metformin and lactate levels, as well as between metformin plasma levels and mortality. We aim to analyse these correlations in a large series of lactic acidosis cases recorded in the French nationwide pharmacovigilance database.

Methods

All cases of lactic acidosis spontaneously reported between 1985 and October 2013 associated with metformin exposure were extracted from the pharmacovigilance database. We assessed the statistical correlations between prescribed daily doses of metformin, plasma concentrations of metformin and lactate, pH and plasma creatinine, as well as the relationship between mortality and these variables.

Results

Seven hundred and twenty-seven cases of lactic acidosis were reported during the period. Metformin plasma concentration was documented for 260 patients, lactate plasma concentration for 556 patients, pH for 502 patients, creatinine for 397 patients and the vital outcome for 713 patients. Metformin plasma concentration, lactate concentration, pH and plasma creatinine were all correlated (P < 0.001). There were significant differences between surviving and deceased patients in terms of metformin plasma levels (25.2 vs. 37.4 mg/l, P = 0.002) and lactate concentrations (10.8 vs. 16.3 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Thirty per cent of patients died when metformin concentration was > 5 mg/l compared with 11% for patients with concentration < 5 mg/l (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that metformin accumulation contributes to the pathogenesis and prognosis of lactic acidosis.

### Current status and future opportunities in lung precision medicine research with a focus on biomarkers. An American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute research statement [^7f491f4b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Sepsis definitions and biomarkers — diagnostic criteria evolution and key markers are outlined as follows: A 1992 consensus defined sepsis as infection concern plus ≥ 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, specifically "temperature > 38° C or < 36° C; heart rate > 90 beats/min; respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or PaCO2 < 32 mm Hg; white blood cell count > 12,000/μL, < 4,000/μL, or > 10% immature bands", a definition "extremely broad" since "up to 50% of hospitalized patients met these criteria". In 2016, "Sepsis 3" was proposed as "a suspected infection and a change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of at least 2", with in-hospital mortality "greater than 10%". Plasma lactate is emphasized: "septic shock is clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L", and "even a modest elevation of lactate (2.1–4.0 mmol/L) has been associated with increased risk of death", with measurement of "6-hour lactate clearance" included in the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines and CMS SEP-1. Broader biomarker surveys report "178 candidate biomarkers in 3,370 references". Procalcitonin shows "modest" diagnostic performance with "sensitivity and specificity of 71% to 81%", limiting diagnostic utility, though serial procalcitonin algorithms "have been shown to be useful for avoiding prolonged courses of antibiotics".
