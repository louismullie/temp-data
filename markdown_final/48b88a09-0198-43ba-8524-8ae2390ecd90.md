## Question

What are the indications for a 2D/M mode Doppler ultrasound study in cardiovascular disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for 2D/M-mode and Doppler echocardiography in cardiovascular disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational role of these modalities and how guidelines frame their use. Then, I should categorize indications by major clinical domains such as valvular disease, ventricular function, ischemia, pericardial disease, congenital heart disease, hypertension, critical care, and special populations. Next, I will examine modality-specific strengths and limitations, including when M-mode, 2D, color Doppler, spectral Doppler, and tissue Doppler add unique value. Finally, I will integrate appropriate use criteria and quality standards to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable and evidence-based [^115otDuk] [^1165MXso].

> Let me first confirm the foundational role. Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography in adults is expected to include 2D/M-mode imaging, color flow Doppler, and spectral Doppler, with the modality selection tailored to the clinical question and image quality, and this triad remains the backbone of standard practice across inpatient and outpatient settings [^1165MXso]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric expectations as well; core pediatric TTE competencies similarly require proficiency in M-mode, 2D, and Doppler techniques, underscoring that these are not optional but essential elements of a complete study [^115KLQqe] [^111kemfL].

> Now, valvular heart disease. I need to ensure I capture the primary hemodynamic parameters that are Level 1 for aortic stenosis: peak jet velocity, mean gradient, and valve area by continuity, all derived from Doppler and integrated with 2D structural assessment rather than relying on a single metric, given loading and rhythm effects [^111zKEpT] [^114wpbMB]. Wait, let me verify prosthetic valve follow-up; baseline TTE with Doppler is recommended 2–4 weeks post-discharge, with subsequent imaging guided by symptoms or clinical change, and specific Doppler signs like pressure half-time and holodiastolic flow reversal help grade regurgitation severity and paravalvular leaks [^114YS8ot] [^11446UhB]. For mitral stenosis, I should confirm that stress echocardiography with Doppler gradients and estimated pulmonary pressures is indicated when symptoms and resting severity are discordant, with exercise preferred for sPAP estimation [^115AJxvY].

> Next, ventricular function and cardiomyopathies. I will now examine quantitative systolic function: 2D biplane Simpson-derived ejection fraction is preferred for serial assessment, while M-mode shortening fraction remains acceptable in pediatrics but is load-dependent; 3D echocardiography offers superior accuracy and reproducibility for volumes and EF when feasible [^111RqHeY] [^112iRjke] [^113kWo5w]. Hold on, I should verify diastolic function; tissue Doppler e′ velocities, E/e′ ratio, LA volume index, and TR velocity are the key variables for estimating filling pressures, and M-mode-derived LA anteroposterior diameter is discouraged for diastolic assessment, with 2D or 3D LA volume preferred [^11158ia8]. For infiltrative disease such as cardiac amyloidosis, I need to ensure reports include wall thickness, myocardial "texture", longitudinal strain, and comprehensive Doppler hemodynamics including E/e′ and estimated RV pressure, as these inform prognosis and management [^114RoEf3].

> Ischemic heart disease and stress testing. Let me consider standard stress echocardiography first; rest and stress 2D wall motion with Doppler hemodynamics are standard, and Doppler coronary flow reserve of the LAD can be added to refine risk stratification beyond wall motion, particularly when microvascular dysfunction is suspected [^1165MXso] [^116RWfVe]. But wait, what if the question is valvular or congenital rather than ischemia; stress echocardiography is also indicated to unmask dynamic LV outflow obstruction in HCM, quantify exercise-induced mitral regurgitation, and assess pulmonary pressures, with Doppler gradients and sPAP estimation central to the analysis [^115AJxvY] [^111Muote]. I should double-check syncope guidance; exercise 2D/Doppler is recommended in HCM with resting or provoked LVOT gradient less than 50 mmHg to detect provocable obstruction [^112YX9S4] [^113ChadS].

> Pericardial disease. Let me think about tamponade physiology first; 2D shows chamber collapse and respiratory septal shift, while Doppler with respirometry demonstrates reciprocal respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflows and venous flow abnormalities, which are highly specific for constrictive physiology when present [^115L5ZAN]. I should confirm that M-mode contributes with posterior wall flattening in diastole and respiratory variation of ventricular size, and that color M-mode of mitral inflow can assist with timing and hemodynamic interpretation in these syndromes [^115L5ZAN] [^115dPCD6]. Hold on, I should verify that Doppler remains the most useful noninvasive modality for pericardial hemodynamics due to superior temporal resolution, with CMR as an adjunct when echo is non-diagnostic [^115aTJy2].

> Congenital heart disease. I need to check that M-mode, 2D, and Doppler remain the mainstay for segmental anatomy, shunt detection, and pressure estimation in children, with Doppler methods essential for assessing blood flow and predicting intracardiac pressures across lesions [^115KLQqe] [^114SkEGB]. Let me verify neonatal screening infrastructure; equipment and personnel must be capable of M-mode, 2D, and both pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler, with age-appropriate transducers and ECG gating to ensure diagnostic quality [^116MBknz]. For adult congenital follow-up, comprehensive TTE may include 2D, 3D, M-mode, and strain, with Doppler integrated as indicated for residual shunts, valve dysfunction, and ventricular function [^117KTB4D].

> Hypertension and LV hypertrophy. I should confirm that echocardiography is not for universal screening in hypertension; rather, it is reserved for those with suspected hypertensive heart disease or comorbid cardiac pathology, where a complete 2D and Doppler study is warranted to assess LV mass, geometry, and function [^115qZScg]. Let me reconsider LV mass quantification; M-mode is simple and efficient for large cohorts, but 2D-guided methods are preferred for individual patient follow-up due to better orientation and less geometric assumption error, and 3D can further improve accuracy when image quality allows [^111RqHeY] [^112Q3MGp].

> Critical care and shock. I need to ensure I emphasize that basic 2D and M-mode can rapidly classify shock type and guide initial therapy, while advanced competencies add color and spectral Doppler, tissue Doppler, and occasionally 3D or speckle tracking for comprehensive hemodynamics and monitoring [^117GragT]. Hold on, I should verify that focused cardiac ultrasound platforms are not a substitute for full diagnostic capability; equipment for comprehensive studies must include 2D, M-mode, color, and spectral Doppler with DICOM storage, whereas FCU devices are intentionally limited to targeted questions [^113FsUfB].

> Special populations and contexts. For cardio-oncology, I should confirm that serial TTE with LVEF and GLS is recommended, and if GLS is unavailable, mitral annular displacement by M-mode or peak systolic annular velocity by pulsed-wave tissue Doppler can substitute as longitudinal function surrogates, with contrast or CMR when image quality is suboptimal [^111SLGU7]. In syncope with suspected HCM, I need to check that exercise 2D/Doppler is advised to detect provocable LVOTO when resting gradients are under 50 mmHg, aligning with ESC guidance [^112YX9S4] [^111Muote]. For peripartum or pandemic-era care, I should confirm that echocardiography's clinical utility hinges on how findings change management, reinforcing selective, question-driven use rather than routine screening [^115sR9f4].

> Modality-specific strengths and limitations. Let me verify M-mode's niche; despite being considered "obsolete" by some, M-mode retains value for timing events, valve motion, and efficient multi-beat recordings, and steerable M-mode can improve alignment for linear measurements, though it should be 2D-guided to avoid obliquity errors [^113D5tpj] [^115dPCD6]. I should confirm that routine linear M-mode quantification is not recommended in adults, but targeted M-mode of the aortic valve or LV assist device timing remains clinically useful in select scenarios [^11468yiR] [^116E4gU9]. For 2D, I need to ensure optimal frequency and harmonic imaging to maximize resolution, and for Doppler, I should double-check that color Doppler is applied broadly after 2D to screen for regurgitation and shunts, with spectral Doppler optimized for velocity quantification and tissue Doppler for myocardial velocities and diastolic assessment [^116UC1B8] [^1133ssfb] [^116UysHE].

> Integration with appropriate use and quality standards. I should confirm that comprehensive TTE reports document the use of 2D/M-mode and Doppler as indicated, and that laboratories maintain presets and operator controls to ensure consistent image quality and efficient acquisition across modalities and patient types [^115otDuk]. Hold on, I should verify that both inpatient and outpatient TTE are expected to include 2D/M-mode and Doppler when clinically indicated, and that stress echocardiography includes rest and stress 2D with Doppler hemodynamics when relevant to the question, aligning with appropriate use criteria [^1165MXso] [^116rdiw1].

> In summary, 2D/M-mode and Doppler echocardiography together provide a complementary, guideline-mandated toolkit for evaluating cardiovascular disease across valvular, myocardial, ischemic, pericardial, congenital, hypertensive, and critical care domains, with modality selection driven by the clinical question, patient factors, and image quality, and with ongoing integration of 3D, strain, and contrast where they add diagnostic and prognostic value [^115otDuk] [^1165MXso] [^113kWo5w].

Instrumentation for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — Operators performing TTE imaging are expected to be familiar with instrumentation settings and their contributions to image quality; some features are determined by system design and cannot be changed by the operator, whereas several settings can be modified during image acquisition or manipulated after data are collected, and these are important for optimal image acquisition. To improve efficiency and consistency, laboratories set up imaging "presets", which are instrumentation settings optimal for a particular patient, anatomic structure, or blood flow and should be considered starting points for optimization, and presets are available for all ultrasound imaging modes, including M-mode, 2D, and all forms of Doppler imaging.

M-mode echocardiography — operator settings and variations are outlined: "using rapid sweep speeds of 100 to 200 mm/sec is advantageous for making the most accurate time-related measurements", whereas "Other physiologic conditions that require observation of multiple beats may benefit from a slow sweep speed". "Color M mode integrates the color Doppler image with the M-mode tracing" and "may be used to assist with timing of certain color-flow events within the cardiac cycle". "Steerable M mode permits the M-mode cursor to be rotated" so it "can be directed perpendicular to a structure of interest, improving the accuracy of linear M-mode measurements", though "temporal and range resolution are no better than the 2D image parameters, much inferior to directly obtained M-mode images".

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (linear method, 2D) notes that 2D imaging facilitates orientation perpendicular to the LV long axis, but it shares the same geometrical assumptions as M‑mode and the same limitations in patients with abnormal LV geometry; the impact of harmonic imaging on mass calculations and normal values remains to be defined, and normal values are less well established than for M‑mode measurements.

Adult hypertension — recommendations for clinical laboratories and utilization: Echocardiography's research value in hypertension is uncontested, but its value in clinical management is unproven, and demonstration of value requires that decision impacts be accompanied by improved outcomes. WHO-ISH suggested drug treatment could be withheld in low-risk hypertensive individuals by non-echocardiographic criteria, yet echocardiographic findings increase risk classification in 29% of such cases. Broad screening is limited by cost, with approximately 76.4 million U.S. adults with hypertension and reimbursement for echocardiography of $238 implying a total of $181.2 billion. Given these considerations, it has been recommended that echocardiography be reserved for hypertensive individuals with suspected hypertensive cardiac disease or cardiac disease in association with hypertension comorbidities; in such cases, a complete 2D and Doppler study should be performed. Hand-held ultrasound could obtain LV wall thickness and dimensions at the office visit, but its effectiveness remains uncertain.

Echocardiography technical considerations in RIHD — detection of cardiac structural abnormalities, measurement of left ventricular (LV) performance, and evaluation of valvular disease severity are critical; approaches include M-mode, Doppler, two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) transthoracic or transoesophageal, contrast, or stress echocardiography. When 2D is used, the 2D biplane disk summation method (biplane Simpson's) is recommended for LV volumes and ejection fraction, and 3D makes no assumptions about LV shape and avoids foreshortened views; a common limitation of 2D/3D is suboptimal endocardial border visualization, and when more than two segments are not adequately visualized, contrast agents improve inter observer variability to a level comparable with CMR. Tissue Doppler imaging and 2D speckle tracking may yield complementary information, with 2D speckle tracking an accurate angle independent modality for strain quantification; for valve analysis, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography is the recommended first-line imaging, transoesophageal echocardiography is advocated when transthoracic studies are non-diagnostic or require refinement, and 3D echocardiography is reasonable for complex valve lesions.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113FsUfB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Limited echocardiography equipment and data standards — equipment "should be capable of performing two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, M-mode, color-flow imaging, and spectral and tissue Doppler ultrasound", and "Although all of these modalities may not be used in every case, their availability is critical in preserving the expectation that a patient referred for echocardiography (whether limited or complete) will receive the examination needed to delineate all abnormalities". Examinations "require that a broad selection of transducers be available for use, whereas FCU does not". FCU platforms "are intended to answer a specific clinical question within the technologic limitations of a small device and thus do not require all these modalities", and "The platform of a typical FCU device is incompatible with the performance of detailed or gated measurements that are the minimum professional standard for echocardiography". For image storage and interoperability, "Echocardiographic platforms must store images in a method compatible with DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standards" and "Platforms that do not adhere to the DICOM Format should not be used to perform echocardiography (limited or comprehensive)".

### Recommendations on the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve stenosis: a focused update from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^111zKEpT]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of aortic stenosis — recommendation levels and integrative practice are defined and operationalized as follows: Methods are categorized as "Level 1 Recommendation: an appropriate and recommended method for all patients with aortic stenosis", "Level 2 Recommendation: a reasonable method for clinical use when additional information is needed in selected patients", and "Level 3 Recommendation: a method not recommended for routine clinical practice although it may be appropriate for research applications and in rare clinical cases". It is essential in clinical practice to use an integrative approach when grading severity by combining all Doppler and 2D data with clinical presentation rather than relying on a single measurement, and loading conditions, rhythm, and rate can complicate assessment; heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure should be stated in the report, and hemodynamic assessment should be performed at heart rates and blood pressures within the normal range.

### Guidelines and standards for performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the task force of the pediatric council of the American Society of Echocardiography [^112iRjke]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Medium credibility.

Pediatric echocardiography — ventricular size and function assessment states that an objective assessment of cardiac function is recommended, and that M-mode, 2D imaging, and Doppler methods can be used to assess ventricular function, while newer modalities such as 3-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler tissue imaging, and strain and strain rate calculations are promising new techniques that are currently under investigation. For left ventricular (LV) size and systolic function, measurement of LV dimensions in diastole and systole by M-mode and/or 2D imaging is recommended for a complete study, and the parasternal short axis at the midpapillary level is the preferred site for measurement of LV chamber size and wall thickness, but the subcostal short axis can be used as well. The ventricular septum, LV dimension, and LV posterior wall are used to determine LV size and exclude hypertrophy, LV mass may be helpful in patients with long-standing hypertension or other forms of LV hypertrophy, the standard M-mode method of LV systolic function assessment is the shortening fraction, which is affected by loading conditions, altered LV geometry, and regional wall-motion abnormalities, and relatively load-independent indices of myocardial performance based on M-mode measurements are useful for the serial assessment of patients at high risk for diminished function, such as those undergoing chemotherapy.

Echocardiography is a fundamental component of pediatric cardiology, and appropriate indications have been established for its use in the setting of suspected, congenital, or acquired heart disease in children. Since the publication of guidelines for pediatric transthoracic echocardiography in 2006 and 2010, advances in knowledge and technology have expanded the scope of practice beyond the use of traditional modalities such as two-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiography to evaluate the cardiac segmental structures and their function. Adjunct modalities such as contrast, three-dimensional, and speckle-tracking echocardiography are now used routinely at many pediatric centers. Guidelines and recommendations for the use of traditional and newer adjunct modalities in children are described in detail in this document. In addition, suggested protocols related to standard operations, infection control, sedation, and quality assurance and improvement are included to provide an organizational structure for centers performing pediatric transthoracic echocardiograms.

### Current and evolving echocardiographic techniques for the quantitative evaluation of cardiac mechanics: ASE / EAE consensus statement on methodology and indications endorsed by the Japanese society of echocardiography [^115cL9qu]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic imaging is ideally suited for the evaluation of cardiac mechanics because of its intrinsically dynamic nature. Because for decades, echocardiography has been the only imaging modality that allows dynamic imaging of the heart, it is only natural that new, increasingly automated techniques for sophisticated analysis of cardiac mechanics have been driven by researchers and manufacturers of ultrasound imaging equipment. Several such technique shave emerged over the past decades to address the issue of reader's experience and inter measurement variability in interpretation. Some were widely embraced by echocardiographers around the world and became part of the clinical routine, whereas others remained limited to research and exploration of new clinical applications. Two such techniques have dominated the research arena of echocardiography: (1) Doppler based tissue velocity measurements, frequently referred to as tissue Doppler or myocardial Doppler, and (2) speckle tracking on the basis of displacement measurements. Both types of measurements lend themselves to the derivation of multiple parameters of myocardial function. The goal of this document is to focus on the currently available techniques that allow quantitative assessment of myocardial function via image-based analysis of local myocardial dynamics, including Doppler tissue imaging and speckle-tracking echocardiography, as well as integrated backscatter analysis. This document describes the current and potential clinical applications of these techniques and their strengths and weaknesses, briefly surveys a selection of the relevant published literature while highlighting normal and abnormal findings in the context of different cardiovascular pathologies, and summarizes the unresolved issues, future research priorities, and recommended indications for clinical use.

Ultrasound enhancing agents (UEAs) — indications are delineated as follows: "the only US Food and Drug Administration–approved cardiac indication for the use of UEAs is to opacify the LV chamber and to improve delineation of the LV endocardial border". The guideline states, "UEAs should be used in patients with suboptimal images for assessment of LV contractility, defined as the inability to detect endocardial motion in two or more contiguous segments in any of the three apical views". Off‑label uses include "assessment of cardiac masses and intracardiac thrombi when endocardial border detection is limited", and "Poor-quality spectral Doppler signals, particularly CW Doppler envelopes for tricuspid regurgitation and aortic stenosis, may be enhanced with UEAs".

Required knowledge base for core and advanced levels of expertise — pediatric echocardiography outlines foundational and expanded domains. Core knowledge includes understanding of the basic principles of ultrasound physics, knowledge of the indications for transthoracic echocardiography in pediatric patients, knowledge of Doppler methods and their application for assessment of blood flow and prediction of intracardiac pressures, knowledge of standard acoustic windows and transducer positions, ability to recognize normal and abnormal cardiovascular structures by 2-dimensional imaging and to correlate the cross-sectional images with anatomic structures, and familiarity with major developments in the field of noninvasive diagnostic imaging. Advanced knowledge, in addition to the knowledge base required in the core level, includes in-depth knowledge of ultrasound physics, the ability to recognize and characterize rare and complex congenital and acquired cardiovascular abnormalities in a variety of clinical settings, in-depth understanding of Doppler methods and their application to the assessment of cardiovascular physiology, familiarity with all echocardiographic methods available for assessment of global and regional ventricular function and knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques, up-to-date knowledge of recent advances in the field of noninvasive cardiac imaging including ability to review critically published research, and knowledge of current training guidelines and regulations relevant to pediatric echocardiography.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^1167Ztex]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for research studies and clinical trials — acquisition and interpretation of echocardiograms for research purposes in hypertension poses some special challenges with a significant learning curve, and quality improved over time in a Framingham cohort: in M‑mode echocardiograms performed in over 6000 subjects aged 17–90, the ability to record acceptable quality echocardiograms in subjects older than 60 years rose from a minimum of 28% during the first 5 months of the study to a maximum of 74–81% during studies 2 years later; hence, echocardiography 'drop‑outs' may not be randomly distributed and two‑dimensional echocardiographic measurements were even more problematic than 2D‑guided M‑mode. Extensive previous clinical experience in echocardiography was no guarantee of high‑quality echocardiograms for research purposes, monitoring of study quality is important, the inclusion of 'control' subjects is a protection against apparent changes due only to regression to the mean, and the use of sample echocardiograms is a means of ensuring common methodology and to prevent 'drift' over time; the role of imaging in these settings is unproven and warrants further study.

Congenital heart disease follow-up imaging — modality assumptions — explains that although the document examines imaging modalities in specific scenarios, it does not address the specific techniques associated with each modality and assumes that a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination may include 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, M-mode, and strain imaging; color, spectral, and tissue Doppler imaging; and use of contrast agents for opacification, when applicable. The document defines stress imaging to include echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging performed with exercise or pharmacological stress designed to provoke ischemia, may also refer to echocardiography performed with exercise or dobutamine to assess the severity of valvular or outflow tract obstruction or changes in Doppler-derived RV pressure estimates, specifies that these tests should be considered under stress imaging rather than the underlying modality, and notes that other diagnostic tests such as electrocardiography, chest x-ray, and imaging of noncardiovascular structures are not addressed.

### Role of M-mode technique in today's echocardiography [^113D5tpj]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

M-mode echocardiography is considered to be obsolete by many. The technique rarely is included in American Society of Echocardiography standards documents, except for M-mode measurements, which have limited value. The superior temporal resolution of M-mode echocardiography is frequently overlooked. Doppler recordings reflect blood velocity, whereas M-mode motion of cardiac structures reflect volumetric blood flow. The 2 examinations are hemodynamically complementary. In the current digital era, recording multiple cardiac cycles of two-dimensional echocardiographic images is no longer necessary. However, there are times when intermittent or respiratory changes occur. The M-mode technique is an effective and efficient way to record the necessary multiple cardiac cycles. In certain situations, M-mode recordings of the valves and interventricular septum can be particularly helpful in making a more accurate and complete echocardiographic cardiac assessment, thus helping to make the examination more cost-effective.

### Three-dimensional echocardiography [^117ULU3k]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past two to three decades echocardiography has come a considerable distance from the early M-mode machines, and has become an indispensable diagnostic tool in any cardiovascular department. It has long been proved to be safe and cost-effective, and its clinical versatility has steadily increased with the continued integration of newer techniques, such as two-dimensional and harmonic imaging, Doppler and much more. One of the more recent developments in the field is three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). 3DE, in various forms, has been used as a research tool for many years now, but lately improvements in software and transducer technology have begun to facilitate its integration into clinical practice. As with any technique, 3DE has its strengths and weaknesses, and these must be fully appreciated if it is to be utilised effectively.

### Stress echo applications beyond coronary artery disease [^114PQaGT]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Stress echocardiography is an established method for the diagnosis and prognostic stratification of coronary artery disease. In the last few years, the tremendous technological and conceptual versatility of this technique has been increasingly applied in challenging diagnostic fields. Today, in the echocardiography laboratory we can detect not only ischaemia from coronary artery stenosis, but can also recognize abnormalities of the coronary microvessels, myocardium, heart valves, pulmonary circulation, alveolar-capillary barrier, and right ventricle. Therefore, we evaluate coronary arteries as well as coronary microvascular disease (associated with diabetes and hypertension), suspected or overt dilated cardiomyopathy, systolic and diastolic heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, athletes' hearts, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, incipient or overt pulmonary hypertension, and heart transplant patients for early detection of chronic or acute rejection as well as potential donors for better selection of suitable donor hearts. From a stress echo era with a one-fits-all approach (wall motion by 2D-echo in the patient with known or suspected coronary artery disease) now we have moved on to an omnivorous, next-generation laboratory employing a variety of technologies (from M-Mode to 2D and pulsed, continuous and colour Doppler, to lung ultrasound and real-time 3D echo, 2D speckle tracking and myocardial contrast echo) on patients covering the entire spectrum of severity (from elite athletes to patients with end-stage heart failure) and ages (from children with congenital heart disease to the elderly with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis). For each patient, we can tailor a dedicated stress protocol with a specific method to address a particular diagnostic question. Provided that the acoustic window is acceptable and the necessary expertise available, stress echocardiography is useful and convenient in many situations, from valvular to congenital heart disease, and whenever there is a mismatch between symptoms during stress and findings at rest. Increasing societal concern regarding cost, environment and radiation risks of medical imaging will lead to a preferential application of ultrasound over competing techniques, due to its unsurpassed versatility, portability, absence of radiation, and low cost.

Instrumentation — ultrasound instruments used for diagnostic studies should include, at a minimum, hardware and software to perform M-mode, 2D imaging, color flow mapping, and spectral Doppler studies, including pulsed wave and continuous wave capabilities; transducers used in pediatric studies should provide adequate imaging across the wide range of depths, with multiple imaging transducers ranging from low frequency (2–2.5 MHz) to high frequency (≥ 7.5 MHz) available, a multifrequency option that includes all these frequencies, and a transducer dedicated to continuous wave Doppler; the video screen and display should be of suitable size and quality, the display should identify the parent institution, a patient identifier, and the date and time of the study, the electrocardiogram should also be displayed in real time with the echocardiographic signal, range or depth markers should be available on all displays, and measurement capabilities must be present to allow distances, areas, blood flow velocities, time intervals, and peak and mean gradients from spectral Doppler studies.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113Sjr51]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Curved M‑mode strain rate imaging — feasibility and clinical value are described as follows: Visual assessment of curved M‑mode images utilizes the information provided by strain rate imaging without the requirement for time consuming, detailed analysis of strain rate plots, and the M‑mode technique has higher feasibility than quantitative Doppler strain imaging. A limited number of studies have shown that visual assessment of curved M‑mode images has supplemental diagnostic and prognostic value to visual assessment of wall motion. Curved M‑mode images can be easily obtained following completion of the stress exam on images where two‑dimensional (2D) and TDI information were simultaneously acquired; however, the process of deriving these images and arranging them for physician review takes several minutes, and further validation is required. Visual assessment of cardiac motion should be used to distinguish artifact from true abnormalities in strain rate.

### Recommendations for the adult cardiac sonographer performing echocardiography to screen for critical congenital heart disease in the newborn: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^116MBknz]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2021). High credibility.

Recommended infrastructure for newborn echocardiography — instrumentation and patient setting: Infrastructure is the same as for an adult echocardiography lab and consists of three major components (age-appropriate echocardiography equipment, storage/transmission of images, and structured communication). Equipment for diagnostic studies should include hardware and software for M-mode and 2D imaging, color Doppler, and pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler. Mid- to high-frequency transducers (6–12 MHz) should be available, near-field imaging typically requires a high-frequency transducer between 10 and 12 MHz, and deeper anatomy or color Doppler may require lower-frequency transducers capable of 6–9 MHz. Guidelines specify that the video screen and display should be of suitable size and quality and should identify the performing institution, appropriate patient identifiers, and the date and time of the study; range or depth markers should be available, measurement capabilities must be present (distance, area, velocities, time intervals, and peak and mean gradients), and frame rate should be optimized for neonatal heart rates. The use of electrocardiogram (ECG) leads should be part of every study when screening for congenital heart disease. Typically, the patient should be placed supine in a darkened room with gentle neck extension using a roll under the shoulders and the head slightly left; hypothermia prevention includes swaddling and exposing only necessary windows, and if clinically appropriate a nurse or physician should be bedside to monitor oxygen saturation and heart rate, with sonographic gel warmed to help maintain body temperature.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^11158ia8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular diastolic function — recommended variables and interpretation are as follows: The four recommended variables and abnormal cutoffs are annular e′ velocity (septal e′ < 7 cm/sec, lateral e′ < 10 cm/sec), average E/e′ ratio > 14, LA volume index > 34 mL/m^2, and peak TR velocity > 2.8 m/sec. LV diastolic function is normal if more than half of the available variables do not meet these cutoff values, diastolic dysfunction is present if more than half meet them, and the study is inconclusive if half meet them. Average E/e′ ratio is recommended for simplification, and when only one annulus is available a lateral E/e′ ratio > 13 or a septal E/e′ > 15 is considered abnormal. LA maximum volume index is recommended rather than LA anteroposterior diameter by M‑mode.

Core skills include the ability to safely, properly, and efficiently use cardiac ultrasound equipment and the ability to perform a complete transthoracic echocardiographic examination with proper use of M-mode, 2-dimensional, and Doppler techniques. Advanced skills, in addition to the skills required in the core level, include independent performance of complete transthoracic examinations using all available ultrasound techniques in patients with all types of congenital heart disease, the ability to assess cardiovascular physiology and global and regional ventricular function using a variety of ultrasound techniques, and the ability to supervise and teach pediatric echocardiography to sonographers, pediatric cardiology fellows, and other physicians.

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^115AJxvY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Mitral stenosis — stress echocardiography (SE) acquisition and indications are outlined as follows: Images should be acquired at baseline and immediately post-exercise when using a treadmill; at baseline, low dose and peak when using dobutamine; and at baseline, low workload and peak when using supine bicycle exercise, and the minimum acquired dataset comprises TR CW Doppler for estimation of sPAP and mitral valve CW Doppler for gradient measurement; maximal sweep speed and optimal minimal velocity scale should be used for mitral valve continuous Doppler acquisition. SE is indicated to reveal symptoms and assess haemodynamic consequences of MS — based on the gradient and sPAP increase during stress — in patients with discordance between symptoms and stenosis severity, and exercise SE is preferred for sPAP assessment. For treatment considerations, ESC/EACTS and AHA/ACC guidelines consider symptomatic MS as a class I indication for intervention, but suitability for percutaneous balloon valvotomy plays a central role in the final decision to treat.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^111RqHeY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular mass (LV mass) quantification in adults by echocardiography — measurement timing, methods, and calculation considerations — includes that measurements should be performed at the end of diastole (the frame before mitral valve closure or the frame in the cardiac cycle in which the ventricular dimension or volume is largest). Methods include M‑mode, two‑dimensional echocardiography (2DE), and three‑dimensional echocardiography (3DE); M‑mode and 2D linear dimensions use geometric formulas to estimate myocardial volume while 3DE can measure it directly, and all methods convert volume to mass using myocardial density (approximately 1.05 g/mL). When using 2D images of the entire ventricle, either the area‑length or truncated ellipsoid technique is used. Proper technique requires wall thickness and LV dimensions be perpendicular to the long axis, and 2D‑guided M‑mode or 2D image measurements are preferred over blind M‑mode imaging. The commonly used formula includes a correction for the 20% overestimation from original M‑mode validation and raises the linear dimensions to the power of 3, so small dimensional errors can significantly affect calculated LV mass; moreover, because direct 2D wall thickness measures may be smaller than M‑mode, LV mass values derived with this formula may not be directly interchangeable. For serial assessment in individual patients, 2D echocardiographic methods have advantages over linear dimensions, whereas for screening or studying large populations, the M‑mode method has advantages because it is simple, quick, and subject to less measurement variability. Because 3DE directly measures myocardial volume, it is an appropriate approach, but it is the consensus of this committee that available 3D echocardiographic LV mass data in normal subjects are not sufficient to recommend normal reference values. In patients with upper septal hypertrophy, linear dimension methods using basal measurements result in overestimation of the true mass.

TEE and stress testing modality assumptions and perioperative considerations: In general, it is assumed that TEE is most appropriately used as an adjunct or subsequent test to TTE when indicated, such as when suboptimal TTE images preclude obtaining a diagnostic study, and the indications for which TEE may reasonably be the test of first choice include, but are not limited to, the indications presented in Table 8 of this document; intraoperative TEE is an important use of cardiovascular ultrasound, but this application is outside the scope of this document and thus is not addressed here; for all stress imaging, the mode of stress testing is assumed to be exercise for patients able to exercise, whereas for patients unable to exercise it is assumed that dobutamine is used, and any indications requiring a specific mode are labeled as such; Doppler hemodynamic assessment during stress echocardiography includes both right and left heart hemodynamics; the indications for the perioperative evaluation for noncardiac surgery were modeled after the ACCF/AHA guidelines, and if a patient has signs/symptoms of suspected cardiac etiology, the clinical scenario should be considered in the symptomatic category and not in the perioperative section; and as with other surgeries, the need for coronary artery disease assessment prior to solid organ transplantation is related to patient and surgical risk, and in general, solid organ transplantation should be considered in the vascular surgery category given that coronary artery disease is common in patients with diabetes mellitus who have end-stage renal disease.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive pediatric transthoracic echocardiogram: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^114SkEGB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) modalities and scope — Two-dimensional echocardiography, M-mode, and Doppler evaluation continue to be the mainstay of pediatric TTE, but the armamentarium of adjunct diagnostic tools has expanded to include 3DE, STE, and the use of contrast agents. In addition, improvements in transducer technology and image processing as well as continued development of more robust and effective artificial intelligence algorithms have broadened the capabilities of TTE to provide accurate and reliable anatomic and physiologic information for children with heart disease. In developing this update to the 2006 and 2010 documents, there has been significant effort to distinguish between guidelines as practices that should be performed and additional or adjunct recommendations as practices that may be performed during a comprehensive pediatric TTE and to avoid describing practices that must be part of an examination, and these recommendations result from a consensus of expert opinions based on published pediatric guidelines, reports of studies involving pediatric and congenital echocardiography, and clinical experience. Although it is not discussed in this document because it is not an adjunct modality during standard pediatric TTE, transthoracic stress echocardiography is gaining increased use in children, particularly in the setting of valve disease, CA abnormalities, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and after heart transplantation, and minimal guidelines for its use and interpretation in pediatrics are included in the ASE stress echocardiography guidelines and standards for adults, but detailed recommendations have not yet been published. In the current era, pediatric TTE is still limited in its ability to provide accurate data as it relates to cardiac output, relative flow between the pulmonary and systemic vascular beds, pulmonary vascular disease, and valve disease, and in addition, many echocardiographic parameters used routinely in adult echocardiography have not yet been validated for children and pediatric disease. Further research in children is needed for these and other areas, particularly in terms of the relationship between echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcomes in acquired and CHD, assessment of diastolic function in general, quantification of systolic and diastolic function for the right ventricle and the single ventricle, use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in pediatric echocardiography, and pediatric applications of strain imaging and contrast echocardiography.

Anthracyclines are old drugs that have been associated with several cardiovascular toxicities, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and heart failure (HF). 19, 20 The monitoring strategies of anthracyclines proposed by the recent guidelines are shown in Table S2.

Briefly, all of the guidelines recommend screening and optimal management of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors before, during, and after anthracycline therapy. They emphasize the importance of screening for early signs of cardiotoxicity, allowing indication of cardioprotective strategies to prevent the development of overt LVSD and HF. However, there are many differences in the strategies for pretherapy assessment and monitoring (including the use of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin) as well as indications for drug prophylaxis in the primary prevention of cardiotoxicity. Regarding the long‐term follow‐up in survivors, no general agreement has emerged from these guidelines.

Which Pragmatic Approach May be Suggested?

The pragmatic harmonized approach proposed by the working group is depicted in Figure 1A.

Figure 1
Pragmatic approach for monitoring patients treated with anthracyclines (A) and human epidermal growth factor‐2 (HER2) inhibitors (B).

*The cardio‐oncological evaluation will systematically include at least 1 visit with:

Clinical consultation (including BP measurement).
ECG.
Blood glucose, lipid profile, and glomerular filtration rate calculation should be evaluated before initiation of anthracyclines and HER2 inhibitors. Recheck at least at 1 year, 2 years, and periodically thereafter for patients who received anthracyclines.
TTE including measurements of LVEF measurements (ideally 3‐dimensional but at least 2‐dimensional Simpson biplane method) and GLS. In the absence of GLS quantification of LV longitudinal function, use mitral annular displacement by M‐mode echocardiography and/or peak systolic velocity of the mitral annulus by pulsed‐wave DTI.
LV contrast agents could be potentially useful in 2‐dimensional echocardiography.
CMR is recommended if the quality of TTE is suboptimal.
Use the same imaging modality for monitoring.
Actively manage modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and diseases.
Encourage exercise on a regular basis and healthy dietary habits.

Diastolic function assessment in reduced versus normal ejection fraction — because patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) also have impaired diastolic function, the evaluation has a different focus than in patients with normal LVEF (≥ 50%). In reduced ejection fractions, the main reason for evaluating diastolic function is to estimate left ventricular filling pressure, and it is important to look for consistency between the different parameters.

Valvular heart disease — mitral stenosis limits the utility of Doppler indices for diastolic assessment and usually does not elevate diastolic pressures. In this condition, transmitral blood flow velocities and mitral annular dynamics are largely determined by the degree of valvular disease and therefore of limited value as indicators of LV disease, and typically, patients with mitral stenosis have normal or reduced LV diastolic pressures, except for the rare occurrence of coexisting myocardial disease.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^113EqN7i]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

LV ejection fraction has been the main parameter used for the diagnosis, treatment, and stratification of patients with heart failure. However, this parameter has several limitations that are particularly relevant in the acute setting, such as load-dependency and inotropydependency. Even in the absence of high-quality 2D images, Doppler abnormalities in transmitral filling might provide an early indicator of important pathology.

Unlike LUS, echocardiography might be challenging to perform well and interpret accurately, as a number of considerations add to the complexity of its application in the acute setting. First, in all parameters described for LAP estimation, the confounding factors imposed by critical illness (changes in heart rate, cardiac output, LV compliance, and volume and ventilatory status) have not been fully evaluated. Second, not only might patients with a relatively normal LAP have radiographic and sonographic evidence of pulmonary oedema, but conversely, patients with chronically elevated LAP might have no evidence of pulmonary oedema. Similarly to LUS, however, the echocardiographic findings should be integrated with those from clinical examination, laboratory investigations, and lung imaging data (radiographic and/or sonographic), and be assessed within the clinical context. The main value of echocardiography in this setting is to diagnose or exclude an underlying cardiac cause for dyspnoea and guide subsequent interventions.

Cardiovascular evaluation in AGHD

Adults with GHD have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; therefore, it is essential for these patients to undergo regular evaluation of cardiovascular parameters. Based on the recent guideline, parameters that are considered to be monitored at 6–12-month intervals include blood pressure and heart rate while more thorough evaluation involving electrocardiography, echocardiography and carotid echo-Doppler examination can be performed if clinically indicated. In the absence of disease-specific guidelines detailing how to assess the cardiovascular

status of these patients, we generally recommend close follow-up of the cardiovascular status as well as low threshold for a more detailed evaluation.

Echocardiography

Due to its widespread availability, echocardiography is commonly used for the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. Echocardiographic findings in AGHD may involve reduced LV mass especially in young patients and impaired LV function. Several studies demonstrated positive effects of GHRT on LV mass, IVS and LVPW probably resulting from the hypertrophic effect of GH and contributing to the improved cardiac performance in treated patients. Besides cardiac MRI, echocardiography is considered the best modality to assess LV mass with several methods available for the effective calculation including M-mode echocardiography, 2DE and 3DE. LV mass is generally presented as LV mass index (LVMI) where LV mass is indexed to height, weight or body surface area allowing it to compare different patients with different stature. Based on the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), 2DE is considered an advisable method for follow-up of changes of LVMI in an individual patient. Ejection fraction (EF) is the most widely-used and accepted echocardiographic parameter of the LV systolic function. In AGHD a substantial number of studies employing echocardiography and the highly sensitive radionuclide angiography found reduced EF, which improved with GHRT. At present, the biplane method of disks (modified Simpson's rule) is the recommended 2 DE method to assess LVEF with EFs lower than 52% for men and 54% for women considered indicative of LV systolic dysfunction.

Changes in mitral inflow with Valsalva maneuver — this helps distinguish normal from PN filling patterns; a decrease of E/A ratio of ≥ 50% or an increase in A-wave velocity during the maneuver, not caused by E and A fusion, are highly specific for increased LV filling pressures; when performed adequately under standardized conditions keeping 40 mm Hg intrathoracic pressure constant for 10 sec, accuracy for diagnosing increased LV filling pressures is good; limitations are that not every patient can perform the maneuver adequately and assessment is difficult if not standardized.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement approach — B-mode is preferred and calibration is advised: B-mode imaging is preferred over M-mode imaging, as M-mode provides measurement of only a single point of thickness rather than a segmental value and perpendicular imaging is challenging. Because M-mode or point-to-point B-mode measurements are limited to multiples of the pixel size, precision is reduced unless multiple (several hundred) points are measured, and multiple measurements of several extended segment lengths permit higher precision expression of CIMT values. All reported observational studies relating CIMT values to cardiovascular events used B-mode measurements. A small parts ultrasound phantom should be used to determine whether the ultrasound system is calibrated.

### Echocardiography in shock management [^117GragT]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is pivotal in the diagnosis and management of the shocked patient. Important characteristics in the setting of shock are that it is non-invasive and can be rapidly applied. In the acute situation a basic study often yields immediate results allowing for the initiation of therapy, while a follow-up advanced study brings the advantage of further refining the diagnosis and providing an in-depth hemodynamic assessment. Competency in basic critical care echocardiography is now regarded as a mandatory part of critical care training with clear guidelines available. The majority of pathologies found in shocked patients are readily identified using basic level 2D and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive diagnosis can be achieved with advanced levels of competency, for which practice guidelines are also now available. Hemodynamic evaluation and ongoing monitoring are possible with advanced levels of competency, which includes the use of colour Doppler, spectral Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging and occasionally the use of more recent technological advances such as 3D or speckled tracking. The four core types of shock-cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and vasoplegic-can readily be identified by echocardiography. Even within each of the main headings contained in the shock classification, a variety of pathologies may be the cause and echocardiography will differentiate which of these is responsible. Increasingly, as a result of more complex and elderly patients, the shock may be multifactorial, such as a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock or hypovolemia and ventricular outflow obstruction. The diagnostic benefit of echocardiography in the shocked patient is obvious. The increasing prevalence of critical care physicians experienced in advanced techniques means echocardiography often supplants the need for more invasive hemodynamic assessment and monitoring in shock.

Paravalvular regurgitation assessment — As an approximate guide, < 10% of the sewing ring suggests mild, 10% to 20% suggests moderate, and > 20% suggests severe, and rocking of the prosthesis is usually associated with > 40% dehiscence. Spectral Doppler notes pressure half‑time is useful when the value is < 200 ms (severe) or > 500 ms (mild), whereas intermediate ranges of pressure half‑time (200–500 ms) are less specific. Holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending thoracic aorta is indicative of at least moderate AR, severe AR is suspected when the VTI of the reverse flow approximates that of the forward flow, and holodiastolic flow reversal in the abdominal aorta is usually indicative of severe AR. Regurgitant volume can be calculated as the difference between stroke volume at the LVO (or 2D‑derived total LV stroke volume) and the transmitral or pulmonary flow.

Echocardiography — 2D and Doppler acquisition and reporting in suspected or known cardiac amyloidosis should follow the ASE/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) guidelines, and all standard transthoracic echocardiography views should be obtained. When reporting results, it is important to distinguish other forms of LV hypertrophy from increased LV wall thickness due to amyloid infiltration, and therefore the report should include not only wall-thickness measurements but also qualitative assessment of the "texture" of the myocardium. The visual assessment of the loss of longitudinal motion of the heart on 2D imaging (i.e., minimal descent of the base in the apical views) can be helpful to include in the report as it increases the likelihood of cardiac amyloidosis. In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, right ventricular involvement confers a worse prognosis; thus, right ventricular wall thickness (measured in the subcostal view at end-diastole) and assessment of right ventricular systolic function should be included in the report; on Doppler assessment, evaluation of diastolic function (mitral inflow velocities, early mitral inflow [E] deceleration time, and early diastolic relaxation velocity on tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)) should be reported; in addition, estimation of hemodynamics (including right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, LV filling pressure [based on E/e′ ratio], and cardiac output [based on LV outflow tract diameter, velocity-time integral (on pulse wave Doppler)]) is helpful for the management of heart failure.

### Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's guidelines and standards committee and the task force on prosthetic valves, developed in conjunction with the American college of cardiology cardiovascular imaging committee, cardiac imaging committee of the American Heart Association, the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography and the Canadian society of echocardiography, endorsed by the American college of cardiology foundation, American Heart Association, European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography, and Canadian society of echocardiography [^113Gpcmo]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic imaging of prosthetic valves includes standardized measurements and multi-view inspection with attention to specific anatomic and motion features and use of techniques to optimize visualization. The echocardiographic assessment of patients with prosthetic valves includes standardized measurement and evaluation of the size of cardiac chambers, LV wall thickness and mass, and indices of LV systolic and diastolic function per guidelines of the ASE, and in patients with aortic prostheses, measurements of the aortic root and ascending aorta are recommended. Valves should be imaged from multiple views, with particular attention to the opening and closing motion of the moving parts of the prosthesis (leaflets for bioprostheses and occluders for mechanical prostheses), the presence of leaflet calcifications or abnormal echo density attached to the sewing ring, occluder, leaflets, stents, or cage, and the appearance of the sewing ring, including careful inspection for regions of separation from the native annulus and for abnormal rocking motion during the cardiac cycle. In general, magnification of real-time images is necessary for better visualization of the leaflets or occluder mechanism, mild thickening is often the first sign of primary failure of a biologic valve and is a signal to follow the patient more carefully, occluder motion of a mechanical valve may not be well visualized by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) because of artifact and reverberations, and optimal 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic visualization of occluder motion in tilting disc valves in the mitral or tricuspid position frequently necessitates incremental rotation of the imaging plane.

This recommendation paper is aimed to be a practical technical operation document for 3D transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography with current standard echocardiographic systems and on-cart software. It is important that 3D images be displayed in a uniform manner to facilitate interpretation and comparisons between studies, and in the near future the ability to acquire a single-heartbeat full-volume data set with higher temporal and spatial resolution, and live 3DE color Doppler imaging with a larger angle, should be feasible.

Two chapters explain the advantages and limitations of Doppler ultrasound in the assessment and evaluation of normal heart function and selected intracardiac disorders. During the past three years, major advances have been made in cardiovascular diagnosis by means of combined M-mode or two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler wave analysis.

It is unfortunate that the authors did not include these methods, and, in fact, they dismiss such utility in the introduction. Major areas of application such as carotid or peripheral vascular disease are not discussed at. Benchimol A, Desser KB.
