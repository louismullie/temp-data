## Question

cost effective treatment for new onset diabetes with HgA1c of 10%

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most cost-effective treatment approach for new-onset type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c of 10%, including when to use insulin, how to sequence therapies, and how to individualize by comorbidity, age, and cost constraints. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical severity implied by HbA1c 10% and the urgency of action. Then, I should verify guideline thresholds for initiating insulin and combination therapy. Next, I will examine the cost-effectiveness evidence for metformin, insulin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers such as cardiovascular or kidney disease, obesity, and age. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, cost-conscious algorithm and monitoring plan, and I should double-check for any internal inconsistencies or overstatements that need correction along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity. An HbA1c of 10% in a new-onset patient signals marked hyperglycemia and a high likelihood of glucotoxicity and beta-cell dysfunction; this level meets multiple guideline thresholds where insulin is recommended from the outset, particularly if symptomatic or with catabolic features, and it is well above the range where monotherapy is likely to succeed [^115C63cJ] [^111HQmAu].

> Wait, let me verify the insulin initiation thresholds so I don't overgeneralize. The ADA 2025 Standards advise initiating insulin when A1C is very high (for example, A1C > 10% or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL), especially with symptoms of hyperglycemia, and AACE similarly recommends basal insulin initiation when A1C > 10% or with significant hyperglycemic symptoms. Both also emphasize that if insulin is used, combining with a GLP-1 RA can improve glycemia while mitigating weight gain and hypoglycemia, which I should keep in mind for cost-effectiveness as well as clinical outcomes [^115C63cJ] [^111HQmAu] [^117WzJKy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cost without anchoring to first-line therapy. Metformin remains the preferred initial agent for most patients due to low cost, durability, favorable safety profile, and minimal hypoglycemia; in cost-effectiveness syntheses, metformin-based regimens and intensive glycemic control early in disease are consistently very cost-effective or cost-saving, which supports using metformin as the backbone unless contraindicated [^114yCGpj] [^112WNrb9] [^115Kx4cT].

> I need to check the role of insulin more precisely. For new-onset patients with A1C around 10%, short-course early insulin can rapidly reverse glucotoxicity and may preserve beta-cell function, after which many can de-escalate to oral therapy; this approach can be more effective and sometimes more cost-effective than escalating through multiple oral agents sequentially, particularly when baseline A1C is high, and it aligns with ADA/AACE guidance to consider insulin early in marked hyperglycemia [^111u5Xs3] [^115C63cJ] [^111HQmAu].

> Let me consider GLP-1 receptor agonists carefully. GLP-1 RAs are preferred over insulin for many patients without clear insulin deficiency because they lower A1C, promote weight loss, and reduce hypoglycemia; however, I should confirm cost-effectiveness signals. High-quality cost-effectiveness reviews rate GLP-1 RAs as low value as first-line therapy versus metformin but of intermediate value when added to background therapy, so for cost-sensitive patients I should prioritize metformin and insulin when indicated, reserving GLP-1 RAs for those with obesity, high cardiovascular risk, or when insulin is undesirable and affordability is acceptable [^115d4ypT] [^115C63cJ] [^117WzJKy].

> Next, I should review SGLT2 inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors offer cardiorenal benefits beyond glycemic control and are cost-effective in appropriate high-risk populations, but they are generally more expensive than metformin or sulfonylureas; thus, in a cost-first approach for new-onset diabetes with A1C 10%, SGLT2 inhibitors are better reserved for patients with established ASCVD, HF, or CKD where their added value is greatest, rather than as initial therapy purely for glycemia [^115buSUy] [^1158avd1] [^117WzJKy].

> I will now examine sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones as lower-cost options. Sulfonylureas are inexpensive and can provide meaningful A1C reduction but carry hypoglycemia risk; TZDs are low cost and effective but have weight gain and fluid retention concerns; both can be reasonable second agents when cost is paramount and GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors are not affordable, with the choice individualized to hypoglycemia risk, heart failure, and weight goals [^115Kx4cT] [^117WzJKy].

> But wait, what if the patient is young, has long life expectancy, and no comorbidities? In that scenario, more aggressive early control may yield greater lifetime QALYs and can be cost-effective, so a regimen that rapidly achieves target — such as metformin plus a short insulin course, or metformin plus a GLP-1 RA if affordable — may be justified despite higher upfront costs, given the long horizon for benefit accrual and complication avoidance [^1162tFrG] [^112WNrb9].

> Hold on, I should verify the opposite case: older adults or those with limited life expectancy. For patients over about 75 or with significant comorbidity, less stringent A1C targets (around 7.5–8.5%) are appropriate, and the incremental benefit of intensive control is smaller or can be harmful when treatment burden is high; cost-effectiveness analyses show diminishing returns and potential net harm from overly aggressive glycemic lowering in older adults, reinforcing individualized, less intensive goals [^114UCmQQ] [^11179p6N] [^116xhM13].

> Let me synthesize a practical, cost-conscious algorithm for this A1C 10% presentation. Start metformin immediately if eGFR is adequate, titrate to 2000 mg/day if tolerated, and initiate basal insulin for rapid correction of hyperglycemia, especially if symptomatic. Reassess in 2–3 months and de-escalate insulin once glucotoxicity resolves and A1C is near goal, maintaining metformin long term. If insulin is declined or unavailable, consider a GLP-1 RA with metformin recognizing higher cost but favorable weight and hypoglycemia profile. If neither insulin nor GLP-1 RA are feasible, use metformin plus a sulfonylurea as a lower-cost intensification, with close monitoring for hypoglycemia [^115C63cJ] [^111HQmAu] [^115Kx4cT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "triple oral therapy is never appropriate at diagnosis", but I should double-check that. Some guidelines allow early combination therapy including two or three agents in selected patients with very high A1C, yet for cost-effectiveness at A1C 10% the balance favors metformin plus a single additional agent initially, escalating based on response; so I should correct that overstatement and frame triple oral therapy as possible but not the default cost-effective choice at diagnosis [^111HQmAu] [^117WzJKy] [^115C63cJ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up to avoid clinical inertia. Check A1C every 3 months until at goal, then every 6 months. Monitor for hypoglycemia, weight changes, and blood pressure and lipids per guidelines. Screen for financial barriers at each visit and pivot to lower-cost options such as human insulin, sulfonylureas, or TZDs when needed. Ensure patient education and shared decision-making to sustain adherence and outcomes [^115JRcg9] [^114MHkee] [^114ckfLp].

> I need to ensure I incorporate comorbidity-specific add-ons. If the patient has established ASCVD or is at high risk, add an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA for cardiorenal benefit once basic glycemic control is underway. If CKD is present, prioritize an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven kidney protection. If obesity is prominent and resources allow, a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA can achieve glycemic control with weight loss, though cost-effectiveness versus simpler regimens should be discussed transparently [^1158avd1] [^115buSUy] [^117WzJKy].

> Finally, let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For new-onset type 2 diabetes with A1C 10%, the most cost-effective approach is to initiate metformin promptly, add basal insulin early for rapid correction of severe hyperglycemia, then de-escalate insulin once stabilized while maintaining metformin. GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors are valuable for selected patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities or when insulin is not acceptable, but their higher cost generally places them after lower-cost foundational therapy unless cardiovascular or renal risk shifts the value equation. Throughout, individualize targets by age, comorbidity, and patient preferences, and embed cost-sensitivity checks at every step [^115C63cJ] [^112WNrb9] [^115d4ypT].

For new-onset diabetes with A1c 10%, the most cost-effective approach is to **start metformin immediately** [^114yCGpj] and add basal insulin if A1c remains ≥ 10% or symptoms persist [^115C63cJ] [^111HQmAu]. Metformin is first-line due to low cost, efficacy, and safety [^114yCGpj]; insulin is reserved for severe hyperglycemia because of cost and hypoglycemia risk [^115C63cJ]. GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors are **not first-line for cost reasons** but may be added if cardiovascular or renal risk is high and resources allow [^115d4ypT] [^1158avd1]. Lifestyle intervention is essential and cost-effective [^112WNrb9] [^1118RmRK]. This strategy balances rapid glycemic control with cost, minimizing complications and long-term costs [^1162tFrG].

---

## Initial pharmacologic therapy

### Metformin as first-line therapy

- **Rationale**: Metformin is recommended as first-line therapy due to its efficacy, safety, low cost, and minimal risk of hypoglycemia [^114yCGpj] [^117WzJKy].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Metformin is highly cost-effective, with low acquisition cost and significant reductions in diabetes-related complications [^115TcJLY].

- **Clinical evidence**: Metformin effectively lowers A1c by approximately 1–2% and is associated with cardiovascular benefits [^114yCGpj] [^117H4U9h].

---

### Insulin therapy for severe hyperglycemia

- **Indication**: Basal insulin should be initiated if A1c is ≥ 10% or if there are significant symptoms of hyperglycemia [^115C63cJ] [^111HQmAu].

- **Cost considerations**: While insulin therapy is more expensive than oral agents, its use in severe hyperglycemia is justified by rapid glycemic control and prevention of acute complications [^115TcJLY].

- **Clinical evidence**: Early insulin therapy provides rapid A1c reduction and may improve long-term outcomes by preserving beta-cell function [^111u5Xs3].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions, including dietary modification, physical activity, and weight loss, are **essential** and cost-effective [^112WNrb9] [^1118RmRK]. They reduce A1c by 0.5–1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors, with favorable cost-effectiveness due to low implementation costs and significant long-term health benefits [^1158avd1] [^1118RmRK].

---

## Cost-effectiveness of combination therapy

Combination therapy with metformin plus a second agent (e.g. sulfonylurea, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or SGLT2 inhibitor) may be required if A1c remains above target [^112JDMsi]. Sulfonylureas are **cost-effective** due to low cost and efficacy, though they carry a higher risk of hypoglycemia [^notfound]. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors are effective but more expensive; their use may be justified in patients with cardiovascular or renal comorbidities due to additional benefits [^115d4ypT] [^1158avd1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of A1c every 3 months until the target is achieved, then every 6 months, is recommended [^notfound]. Frequent follow-up allows timely therapy adjustments, improves adherence, and reduces complications, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness [^notfound].

## Summary of cost-effective treatment strategy

| **Treatment** | **Cost-effectiveness** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Metformin | High | - First-line <br/> - Low cost <br/> - Minimal hypoglycemia |
| Basal insulin | Moderate | Use if A1c ≥ 10% or symptomatic hyperglycemia |
| Lifestyle interventions | High | Essential <br/> - Low cost <br/> - Significant benefits |
| Sulfonylureas | Moderate | Cost-effective second-line agent |

---

The most cost-effective treatment for new-onset diabetes with A1c 10% is to **initiate metformin immediately**, add basal insulin if A1c remains ≥ 10% or symptoms persist, and implement lifestyle interventions. This approach balances rapid glycemic control with cost considerations, minimizing complications and long-term healthcare costs.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — treatment escalation thresholds specify that for some recently diagnosed individuals with T2D and more severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 7.5%), early combination pharmacotherapy should be considered, usually to include metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia; for newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an entry A1C > 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, clinicians should initiate dual- or possibly triple-combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin, and basal insulin along with noninsulin therapy is recommended if there are significant signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia, especially including catabolism or a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L); persons with T2D initially treated with monotherapy who do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets should progress to dual-combination therapy and then triple-combination therapy, if needed, and use a basal insulin to adequately obtain and maintain control.

### Evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom [^116pY796]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present analysis found that treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg once daily was associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes versus exenatide 10 μg BID and lixisenatide 20 μg once daily in the UK. The network meta-analysis on which the analysis was based identified that liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with a greater reductions in HbA1c and systolic blood pressure than exenatide 10 μg BID and lixisenatide 20 μg. These improvements drove greater reductions in the cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications, increased the time to onset of diabetes-related complications, and resulted in increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy in long-term projections. Liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with higher acquisition costs, but lower costs of treating diabetes-related complications. This resulted in liraglutide 1.2 mg being associated with reduced overall direct costs versus exenatide 10 μg BID and lixisenatide 20 μg, with liraglutide 1.2 mg found to be dominant over exenatide 10 μg BID and lixisenatide 20 μg. Therefore liraglutide 1.2 mg is likely to be considered a cost-effective treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting, compared with alternative daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Metformin remains the first-line pharmacological therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK. Clinicians have a number of treatment options for a second agent to be added to metformin, and a previous analysis has assessed the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus sulfonylureas and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in the UK setting. This analysis found that liraglutide 1.2 mg was cost-effective versus both comparators, but the key drivers of the improved clinical outcomes varied (greater reductions in systolic blood pressure and BMI versus sulfonylurea and greater reductions in HbA1c and BMI versus DPP-4 inhibitors). Given the multifactorial clinical benefits of daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, exenatide BID and lixisenatide) and their potential to address many of the clinical needs of patients with type 2 diabetes, the present analysis sought to address the question of which of these agents is most cost-effective. The present analysis is the first to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists available to clinicians in the UK, and suggests that liraglutide 1.2 mg may be the most cost-effective daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonist.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

### Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Treat-to-target versus benefit-based tailored treatment of type 2 diabetes in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis [^113zYgSi]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal prescription of blood pressure, lipid, and glycaemic control treatments for adults with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two treatment approaches for diabetes management in five low-income and middle-income countries.

Methods

We developed a microsimulation model to compare a treat-to-target (TTT) strategy, aiming to achieve target levels of biomarkers (blood pressure < 130/80 mm Hg, LDL < 2·59 mmol/L, and HbA 1c < 7% [ie, 53·0 mmol/mol]), with a benefit-based tailored treatment (BTT) strategy, aiming to lower estimated risk for complications (to a 10 year cardiovascular risk < 10% and lifetime microvascular risk < 5%) on the basis of age, sex, and biomarker values. Data were obtained from cohorts in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, and South Africa to span a spectrum of risk profiles.

Findings

The TTT strategy recommended treatment to a larger number of people-who were generally at lower risk of diabetes complications-than the BTT. The BTT strategy recommended treatment to fewer people at higher risk. Compared with the TTT strategy, the BTT strategy would be expected to avert 24·4–30·5% more complications and be more cost-effective from a societal perspective (saving US$4·0–300·0 per disability-adjusted life-year averted in the countries simulated). Alternative treatment thresholds, matched by total cost or population size treated, did not change the comparative superiority of the BTT strategy, nor did titrating treatment using fasting plasma glucose (for areas without HbA 1c testing). However, if insulin were unavailable, the BTT strategy would no longer be superior for preventing microvascular events and was superior only for preventing cardiovascular events.

Interpretation

A BTT strategy is more effective and cost-effective than a TTT strategy in low-income and middle-income countries for prevention of both cardiovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes. However, the superiority of the BTT strategy for averting microvascular complications is contingent on insulin availability.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes screening and new-onset diabetes prediction: a 6-year community-based prospective study [^116CYxTT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Various cutoff levels of hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) have been suggested to screen for diabetes, although more consensus about the best level, especially for different ethnicities, is required. We evaluated the usefulness of A1C levels when screening for undiagnosed diabetes and as a predictor of 6-year incident diabetes in a prospective, population-based cohort study.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total 10,038 participants were recruited from the Ansung-Ansan cohort study. All subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and at each biennial follow-up. Excluding subjects with a previous history of diabetes (n = 572), the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the A1C cutoff. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to predict diabetes at 6 years.

RESULTS

At baseline, 635 participants (6.8%) had previously undiagnosed diabetes. An A1C cutoff of 5.9% produced the highest sum of sensitivity (68%) and specificity (91%). At 6 years, 895 (10.2%) subjects had developed incident diabetes. An A1C cutoff of 5.6% had the highest sum of sensitivity (59%) and specificity (77%) for the identification of subsequent 6-year incident diabetes. After multivariate adjustment, men with baseline A1C ≥ 5.6% had a 2.4-fold increased risk and women had a 3.1-fold increased risk of new-onset diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS

A1C is an effective and convenient method for diabetes screening. An A1C cutoff of 5.9% may identify subjects with undiagnosed diabetes. Individuals with A1C ≥ 5.6% have an increased risk for future diabetes.

### The cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous semaglutide versus empagliflozin in type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin alone in Denmark [^112zz37M]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), worldwide 463 million adults were living with diabetes in 2019, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounted for almost 90% of all the diabetes cases. More than 240,000 Danes had T2D in 2020, which is expected to increase to 430,000 by 2030. It is further predicted that the proportion of individuals with T2D will increase from 43 to 46% for women and from 38 to 45% for men in elderly populations (≥ 70 years) in Denmark. In 2020, the cost of diabetes medication was the largest component on the primary care drug budget in Denmark, primarily owing to the rapidly increasing Danish population with T2D.

T2D leads to inadequate glycaemic control, which is further associated with the development of macrovascular complications (cardiovascular diseases [CVD], stroke, myocardial infarction [MI] and angina pectoris) and microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). This was supported by the results from a previous database survey in primary care in Denmark which showed high prevalence (21.4%) of CVD in individuals with T2D. Evidence suggests that achieving an early and intensive glycaemic control can reduce diabetic-related complications and lead to substantial savings for the Danish society.

Glycaemic control can be achieved, according to individualised glycated haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) targets, initially using metformin together with lifestyle interventions. Timely intensification of the treatment of chronic, progressive conditions such as T2D is important to maintain glycaemic control and decrease the risk of diabetes-related complications and long-term healthcare costs. When glycaemic control is no longer achieved with metformin alone, dual therapy with glucose-lowering agents (GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors) is recommended, considering the clinical characteristics of the patient, according to the consensus guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). In line with these international guidelines, Danish clinical guidelines also recommend lifestyle changes and advocate a stepwise approach to achieve glycaemic control that initiates with metformin, followed by treatment intensification with dual and triple therapy if HbA1c is at a certain level (7.5–9.0% and > 9.0%, respectively).

### Update and next steps for real-world translation of interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^114HQ7cX]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million adults worldwide now have diabetes and 318 million have impaired glucose tolerance. These numbers are expected to increase to 642 million and 482 million, respectively, by 2040. This burgeoning pandemic places an enormous burden on countries worldwide, particularly resource-poor regions. Numerous landmark trials evaluating both intensive lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions have persuasively demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or its onset can be delayed in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, key challenges remain, including how to scale up such approaches for widespread translation and implementation, how to select appropriately from various interventions and tailor them for different populations and settings, and how to ensure that preventive interventions yield clinically meaningful, cost-effective outcomes. In June 2015, a Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum convened to discuss these issues. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, begins with a summary of seminal prevention trials, followed by a discussion of considerations for selecting appropriate populations for intervention and the clinical implications of the various diagnostic criteria for prediabetes. The authors outline knowledge gaps in need of elucidation and explore a possible new avenue for securing regulatory approval of a prevention-related indication for metformin, as well as specific considerations for future pharmacological interventions to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. They conclude with descriptions of some innovative, pragmatic translational initiatives already under way around the world.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111FocK4]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — HbA1c target range and individualized management: We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved, and both deprescribing and augmentation of pharmacotherapy are reasonable considerations when individualizing management to achieve this range.

### Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Treat-to-target versus benefit-based tailored treatment of type 2 diabetes in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis [^112HbfDQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Comparative effectiveness of TTT and BTT

Under the TTT strategy, we simulated recommended treatment of people with type 2 diabetes with: (i) a statin with dose titration to achieve low-density lipoprotein < 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL);(ii) blood pressure agents to achieve a blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg;(iii) metformin, a sulfonylurea and, if needed, insulin replacing the sulfonylurea to achieve a haemoglobin A1c < 7%(see sensitivity analyses, below, for testing of alternate targets). We adopted medication choices following WHO guidelines (including NPH insulin as basal insulin, with regular insulin for prandial coverage as needed), and simulated dose effects on biomarkers and the risk of each complication based on meta-analyses of randomized trials (detailed in Appendix text).– The TTT strategy attempts to achieve each of the targets independently, such that an individual person with normal BP would not require BP lowering treatment but may require only statin and glycemic treatment. Under the BTT strategy, we envisioned that CVD and microvascular risk could be assessed by risk tables (see Appendix Figure 1 for an example of a microvascular risk table), based on the UKPDS OM2 equations, similar to current WHO guideline charts displaying CVD risk by patient demographics and biomarker values. We simulated recommended treatment with: (i) statin treatment with simvastatin 40mg if an individual's 10-year baseline CVD risk (combined risk of MI and stroke) was ≥ 10%; then (ii) subsequent addition of blood pressure agents to achieve a 10-year combined risk of MI and stroke ≥ 10% (provided blood pressure remained ≥ 110/55 mmHg for safety); and then (iii) glucose treatment with metformin, a sulfonylurea and, if needed, insulin replacing the sulfonylurea to achieve a lifetime combined risk of the major microvascular complications < 5% (as long as fasting plasma glucose remained ≥ 3.33 mmol/L [60 mg/dL], for safety), with additional blood pressure agents and a statin prescribed to achieve the microvascular goal, if it was not achieved through glucose control alone (with blood pressure maintained ≥ 110/55 mmHg). Single-dose statin therapy, ordered first in the BTT protocol, was chosen because of prior work justifying this empiric dosing approach, and given limited availability of alternative statins and statin doses in low- and middle-income countries.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for HbA1c test intervals to screen patients with type 2 diabetes based on risk stratification [^112wTdvb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The best HbA1c test interval strategy for detecting new type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cases in healthy individuals should be determined with consideration of HbA1c test characteristics, risk stratification towards T2DM and cost effectiveness.

Methods

State transition models were constructed to investigate the optimal screening interval for new cases of T2DM among each age- and BMI-stratified health individuals. Age was stratified into 30–44-, 45–59-, and 60–74-year-old age groups, and BMI was also stratified into underweight, normal, overweight and obesity. In each model, different HbA1c test intervals were evaluated with respect to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Annual intervals (Japanese current strategy), every 3 years (recommendations in US and UK) and intervals which are tailored to each risk stratification group were compared. All model parameters, including costs for screening and treatment, rates for complications and mortality and utilities, were taken from published studies. The willingness-to-pay threshold in the cost-effectiveness analysis was set to US $50,000/QALY.

Results

The HbA1c test interval for detecting T2DM in healthy individuals varies by age and BMI. Three-year intervals were the most cost effective in obesity at all ages-30–44: $15,034/QALY, 45–59: $11,849/QALY, 60–74: $8685/QALY-compared with the other two interval strategies. The three-year interval was also the most cost effective in the 60–74-year-old age groups-underweight: $11,377/QALY, normal: $18,123/QALY, overweight: $12,537/QALY-and in the overweight 45–59-year-old group; $18,918/QALY. In other groups, the screening interval for detecting T2DM was found to be longer than 3 years, as previously reported. Annual screenings were dominated in many groups with low BMI and in younger age groups. Based on the probability distribution of the ICER, results were consistent among any groups.

Conclusions

The three-year screening interval was optimal among elderly at all ages, the obesity at all ages and the overweight in 45–59-year-old group. For those sin the low-BMI and younger age groups, the optimal HbA1c test interval could be longer than 3 years. Annual screening to detect T2DM was not cost effective and should not be applied in any population.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

### Effect of patients' risks and preferences on health gains with plasma glucose level lowering in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11179p6N]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is common, and treatment to correct blood glucose levels is standard. However, treatment burden starts years before treatment benefits accrue. Because guidelines often ignore treatment burden, many patients with diabetes may be overtreated.

Objective

To examine how treatment burden affects the benefits of intensive vs moderate glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We estimated the effects of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction on diabetes outcomes and overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using a Markov simulation model. Model probabilities were based on estimates from randomized trials and observational studies. Simulated patients were based on adult patients with type 2 diabetes drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study.

Interventions

Glucose lowering with oral agents or insulin in type 2 diabetes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were QALYs and reduction in risk of microvascular and cardiovascular diabetes complications.

Results

Assuming a low treatment burden (0.001, or 0.4 lost days per year), treatment that lowered HbA1c level by 1 percentage point provided benefits ranging from 0.77 to 0.91 QALYs for simulated patients who received a diagnosis at age 45 years to 0.08 to 0.10 QALYs for those who received a diagnosis at age 75 years. An increase in treatment burden (0.01, or 3.7 days lost per year) resulted in HbA1c level lowering being associated with more harm than benefit in those aged 75 years. Across all ages, patients who viewed treatment as more burdensome (0.025–0.05 disutility) experienced a net loss in QALYs from treatments to lower HbA1c level.

Conclusions and Relevance

Improving glycemic control can provide substantial benefits, especially for younger patients; however, for most patients older than 50 years with an HbA1c level less than 9% receiving metformin therapy, additional glycemic treatment usually offers at most modest benefits. Furthermore, the magnitude of benefit is sensitive to patients' views of the treatment burden, and even small treatment adverse effects result in net harm in older patients. The current approach of broadly advocating intensive glycemic control should be reconsidered; instead, treating patients with HbA1c levels less than 9% should be individualized on the basis of estimates of benefit weighed against the patient's views of the burdens of treatment.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116Fw9dd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 PATIENT FACTORS IMPACTING GLYCEMIC GOALS AND THERAPY SELECTION

Most patients with T2D will require basal insulin. Patients with T2D requiring insulin therapy have, in most circumstances, a longer duration of diabetes, whether this time period is with diagnosed or undiagnosed T2D. In the context of FRCs, while the GLP‐1 RA component may mitigate the weight gain associated with basal insulin, insulin therapy is still associated with a net increase in body weight and hypoglycaemia risk vs. not using insulin. Thus, patients being treated with FRCs are more similar to subjects in older trials of glycemic control (e.g. ACCORD, ADVANCE and VDAT) vs. newer trials of incretins and SGLT2 inhibitors where lower or even HbA1c levels below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes may be beneficial.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) prefers an HbA1c of < 6.5% as the primary glycemic goal for people with T2D. However, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) prefer a HbA1c goal of < 7% as the primary glycemic goal for most adults with T2D. While these goals seem to contrast, they begin to mirror each other when patient‐specific adjustments to these goals are brought into focus.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a well‐characterised metabolic disorder known to affect approximately 6.2% of the UK population, with 2.9 million people estimated to have diabetes nationwide in 2015. 1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounts for approximately 90% of diabetes cases, and is primarily caused by insulin resistance, with progressive beta‐cell loss eventually leading to insulin deficiency. 2, 3 Poor glycaemic control has been linked to an increased risk of diabetes‐related complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic nervous system malfunction, diabetic foot (possibly requiring amputation) and increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) outlined the most recent UK treatment guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes in 2015. 12 Evidence‐based, patient‐specific education and lifestyle modification should form the initial basis of treatment. If this proves unsuccessful in controlling blood glucose levels (inadequate control defined as a glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] level of ≥ 7.5% [53 mmol/mol]) then metformin should be administered as a first‐line pharmacologic therapy, followed by intensification of therapy as the disease progresses according to patient preferences and multifactorial treatment targets. The combination of metformin with long‐acting basal insulin should be considered an essential therapy for patients with advanced disease not achieving agreed HbA1c targets on current antidiabetic medications. 13 However, it has been reported that approximately 64% of patients with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin therapy experience inadequate glycaemic control, with 60% not receiving intensified treatment in a timely manner. 14, 15 At this stage, intensification to basal‐bolus insulin therapy is typically recommended. While efficacious in terms of reducing HbA1c, such a treatment regimen is associated with weight gain and high risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Additionally, the multiple daily injections required represent a more complex treatment regimen. These factors have been linked to reduced patient adherence, leading to impaired glycaemic control. 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

### Early insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes: what are the pros? [^111oFx64]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes in the world is growing at an unprecedented rate and rapidly becoming a health concern and burden in both developed and developing countries. In addition, we are now witnessing an upsurge in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, with the potential of translating into a future catastrophic disease burden as vascular complications of the disease begin affecting a younger population. Although there may be contention regarding the impact of lowering glycemia on macrovascular disease risk, there is strong consensus of the definite benefits of lowering blood glucose to reduce the risk of retinopathy and nephropathy in either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Despite supporting data and multiple guidelines advanced by professional organizations, overall glycemic control falls far below expectations. Overall, < 36% of individuals with diabetes are at recommended glycemic targets, with the most difficult-to-control cases represented by insulin-deficient individuals on insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Furthermore, as β-cell dysfunction progresses over time, many patients with type 2 diabetes, treated with oral agents, fail to achieve or maintain adequate glycemic control. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, antiglycemic therapy is not adjusted or advanced, thereby exposing patients to prolonged hyperglycemia and the increased risk of diabetes-related complications. The term "clinical inertia", which has come to define the lack of initiation, or intensification of therapy when clinically indicated, is most pronounced in the setting of insulin initiation. Subjects with type 2 diabetes, managed in a large integrated health care system, were initiated on additional blood glucose–lowering treatment only when the mean baseline A1C reached a value of 9.0%. Patients started on insulin had an even higher mean A1C of 9.6% and tended to have more severe baseline complications and comorbidities than those started on sulfonylurea, or metformin therapy. In addition, the higher the starting A1C when therapy was initiated or changed, the less likely the patient was of achieving adequate glycemic control. Although specialists are slightly more proficient than general practitioners in intensifying diabetes therapy when warranted, overall clinical inertia results in the majority of patients failing to achieve, or maintain, adequate metabolic goals from a period of months to several years. In summary, to improve these suboptimal metabolic outcomes, and reduce the risk of disease-related complications, more intensive management of glycemia is warranted, including the option of introducing insulin therapy earlier than the current widely practiced substandard of care.

### Cost-effectiveness of intensive multifactorial treatment compared with routine care for individuals with screen-detected type 2 diabetes: analysis of the ADDITION-UK cluster-randomized controlled trial [^114ZscNL]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of costly macro- and microvascular complications. Treating diabetes accounts for over 10% of the UK National Health Service (NHS) budget, and the condition exerts a heavy burden on people with diabetes and on those who care for them.

There are a number of treatment options for individuals with established Type 2 diabetes. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend structured lifestyle interventions focusing on diet, physical activity and smoking cessation as the first line of treatment, followed by pharmacological management of cardiovascular risk factors. Intensive multifactorial treatment of individuals with established diabetes reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and premature death by 50% and is cost-effective relative to other preventive interventions. With the advent of national programmes, such as the UK Health Checks, many people will be diagnosed with diabetes earlier in the disease trajectory. Less is known about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment among these newly diagnosed patients. The balance of benefits, harms and costs of intensive treatment may be different among individuals with screen-detected diabetes compared with those with clinically diagnosed and long-standing diabetes.

The ADDITION–Europe study was a cluster-randomized trial of the effect of intensive multifactorial treatment compared with routine care on cardiovascular risk over 5 years among individuals with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes. The intervention was associated with small, but significant increases in cardioprotective treatment, and in turn, a non-significant 17% relative risk reduction in the incidence of a composite cardiovascular endpoint. We report the short-term (1- to 6-year within-trial analysis) and long-term (10–30 years based on decision modelling) cost-effectiveness of the intervention in the UK from a UK payer (NHS) perspective.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

Main Outcome Measures Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Costs and QALYs were discounted at a 3% annual rate. Results The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for intensive glycemic control is $41 384 per QALY; this ratio increased with age at diagnosis from $9614 per QALY for patients aged 25 to 34 years to $2. 1 million for patients. aged 85 to 94 years. For intensified hypertension control the cost-effectiveness ratio is −$1959 per QALY.

In the UKPDS, conventional treatment primarily involved obtaining the best possible fasting plasma glucose concentration with diet alone; drug treatment was added if hyperglycemic symptoms or an excessive fasting plasma glucose. chlorpropamide, glipizide, and insulin, respectively, following trial proportions. We incorporated intensive glycemic control by adjusting baseline hazard rates using the ratio of glycemic level under intensive control to glycemic level under conventional treatment raised to an exponent that varies across progression paths and stages. Using a similar equation, researchers have shown. analysis of diabetic patients in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial, 44 in which pravastatin reduced CHD by 25%. We assumed that intervention patients would receive pravastatin for their remaining lifetime.

The cost of the first year of treatment with pravastatin was based on a 40-mg daily dose and 4 physician visits with blood test samples. lipid profiles, and biochemical profiles. Subsequent yearly costs included pravastatin and 2 physician visits with tests. We report 3 cost components. Standard treatment cost is the cost of conventional glycemic control for all patients and moderate hypertension control for patients with hypertension. Complications cost is the cost of nephropathy. glycemic control reduced the probability of CHD by 16%, based on UKPDS reductions in MI that approached conventional levels of significance. 30 Cost-effectiveness ratios are often sensitive to assumptions about costs. We reestimated the cost-effectiveness ratio under the assumption of no case management costs.

For intensified hypertension control, we first applied control to patients who developed hypertension after diagnosis and who received the intervention only after developing hypertension. We dropped the assumption that patients with hypertension developed nephropathy and retinopathy faster than nonhypertensive. For all interventions, we varied the discount rate from 0% to 5%. 9 Intensive glycemic control applied to all persons in the United States newly diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes and led to an undiscounted 0. 3173-year increase in life expectancy and a discounted

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111WDk7V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes guideline evidence review — key questions and GRADE categories are summarized as follows: The CGC identified key questions and asked CGC members and CGC Public Panel members a priori to independently rate the importance of evaluated outcomes, and all critical and important outcomes were considered in developing recommendations. The ACP Center for Evidence Reviews at Wisconsin conducted the supporting systematic review, and the evidence review team and CGC used GRADE tables to summarize findings and to rate the certainty of evidence for clinical outcomes using categories of high, moderate, low, or insufficient. Key question 1 addresses the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or long-acting insulins as monotherapy or in combination, and whether benefits and harms vary by demographic characteristics, diabetes severity and control, HbA1c levels, duration of diabetes, and comorbidities including baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD), congestive heart failure (CHF), obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key question 2 focuses on patients' values and preferences regarding diabetes medications, including how patients weigh benefits and harms and what patient factors are associated with treatment preferences. Key question 3 addresses the costs and cost-effectiveness of diabetes medications alone or in combination for adults with type 2 diabetes, noting that the CGC's value thresholds for economic evidence were used by the CER in its ACP-funded systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses.

Insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) — economic evidence indicates CSII has been associated with a reduction of severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness compared with conventional insulin therapy using 1 to 2 injections per day, yet in pump‑naïve persons with type 1 diabetes there would be no cost benefit to pump use; a pragmatic pediatric-focused randomized controlled trial (median age, 9.8 years) newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes showed no financial benefit of CSII versus multiple daily injections with conclusions generalizable for the 12 months after pump initiation, and a 2019 randomized controlled trial with economic analysis reported CSII was not cost-effective; payer thresholds illustrate that if the cost-effectiveness threshold is $50 000 per QALY gained, treatment needs an average annual additional 0.1 QALY or subpopulation gains of 0.016 to 0.12 QALY, whereas with a $100 000 threshold the required annual QALY gain is between 0.03 and 0.06; registry-based modeling estimated a discounted (3%) lifetime cost difference of $62 000 over a 20-year horizon and $95 000 over a 40-year horizon, and other investigators have noted that non-integrated pumps may increase the risk of treatment-emergent hypoglycemia and may not be cost-effective in managing type 1 diabetes.

### Cost-effectiveness of intensive multifactorial treatment compared with routine care for individuals with screen-detected type 2 diabetes: analysis of the ADDITION-UK cluster-randomized controlled trial [^113mDH9M]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A driver of our results compared with other studies might be the disease stage of study participants. The ADDITION study recruited participants detected by screening and therefore at an early stage in the disease trajectory. Early detection might help prevent complications in the future directly by attenuating disease progression, but intervening 'too early' might be less cost-effective. For example, intervening when a patient presents with diabetes-related symptoms may reduce the risk of an event that would otherwise have occurred in 5 years' time. Intervening at an earlier stage, e.g. detection of impaired glucose tolerance, may prevent an event that would not otherwise occur for 20 years. Generally, individuals and society have a preference for benefits now rather than in the future, so would value preventing an event in five years' time more highly than preventing that same event in 20 years.

Strengths and limitations

This economic evaluation used data from a large randomized controlled trial and the cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a robust evaluation framework. We examined cost-effectiveness outcomes both for the short- and long-term and performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings. We used data derived from a UK population with long-term CVD outcomes (the UKPDS study) to calculate unit costs, utility decrements and modelled CVD risk. We adjusted for centre (Cambridge/Leicester) rather than practice site, because the intervention differed slightly between the centres but within the same centre practices shared standardized practitioner guidelines. Intra-class correlation values for GP practice for the primary outcome were very small in the main ADDITION-Europe trial, supporting our decision to adjust for centre rather than practice.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of incretin therapy for type 2 diabetes in Spain: 1.8 mg liraglutide versus sitagliptin [^112TieZP]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

A previous cost-effectiveness analysis in the Spanish setting has suggested that liraglutide 1.2 mg is a cost-effective treatment option, versus sitagliptin, for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The present analysis has aimed to expand on the previously published work, by investigating the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide 1.8 mg in Spain based on the 52-week trial data. It was found that liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improved life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with sitagliptin in the Spanish setting. Clinical improvements resulted from a reduced incidence and increased time to onset of diabetes-related complications, driven predominantly by a greater reduction in HbA1c, but changes in systolic blood pressure, serum lipid levels and BMI were also found to be important. Liraglutide was associated with an increase in direct medical costs over patient lifetimes. This resulted from the increased acquisition cost of liraglutide over the short term, but was partially offset by avoidance of treatment of diabetes-related complications over the long term. Based on the projected outcomes, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with an ICER of EUR 10,436 versus sitagliptin in the Spanish setting for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic targets on metformin monotherapy. This ICER falls below the commonly quoted willingness to pay threshold of EUR 30,000 per QALY gained, and therefore liraglutide 1.8 mg is likely to be considered a cost-effective treatment option in patients failing to meet glycemic targets on metformin monotherapy.

### Cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent and control diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^1178h793]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To synthesize the cost-effectiveness (CE) of interventions to prevent and control diabetes, its complications, and comorbidities.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic review of literature on the CE of diabetes interventions recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and published between January 1985 and May 2008. We categorized the strength of evidence about the CE of an intervention as strong, supportive, or uncertain. CEs were classified as cost saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), very cost-effective (≤ $25,000 per life year gained [LYG] or quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001 to $50,000 per LYG or QALY), marginally cost-effective ($50,001 to $100,000 per LYG or QALY), or not cost-effective (> $100,000 per LYG or QALY). The CE classification of an intervention was reported separately by country setting (U.S. or other developed countries) if CE varied by where the intervention was implemented. Costs were measured in 2007 U.S. dollars.

Results

Fifty-six studies from 20 countries met the inclusion criteria. A large majority of the ADA recommended interventions are cost-effective. We found strong evidence to classify the following interventions as cost saving or very cost-effective: (I) Cost saving- 1) ACE inhibitor (ACEI) therapy for intensive hypertension control compared with standard hypertension control; 2) ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy to prevent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with no ACEI or ARB treatment; 3) early irbesartan therapy (at the microalbuminuria stage) to prevent ESRD compared with later treatment (at the macroalbuminuria stage); 4) comprehensive foot care to prevent ulcers compared with usual care; 5) multi-component interventions for diabetic risk factor control and early detection of complications compared with conventional insulin therapy for persons with type 1 diabetes; and 6) multi-component interventions for diabetic risk factor control and early detection of complications compared with standard glycemic control for persons with type 2 diabetes. (II) Very cost-effective- 1) intensive lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes among persons with impaired glucose tolerance compared with standard lifestyle recommendations; 2) universal opportunistic screening for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in African Americans between 45 and 54 years old; 3) intensive glycemic control as implemented in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study in persons with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with conventional glycemic control; 4) statin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease compared with no statin therapy; 5) counseling and treatment for smoking cessation compared with no counseling and treatment; 6) annual screening for diabetic retinopathy and ensuing treatment in persons with type 1 diabetes compared with no screening; 7) annual screening for diabetic retinopathy and ensuing treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes compared with no screening; and 8) immediate vitrectomy to treat diabetic retinopathy compared with deferred vitrectomy.

Conclusions

Many interventions intended to prevent/control diabetes are cost saving or very cost-effective and supported by strong evidence. Policy makers should consider giving these interventions a higher priority.

### Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide versus dulaglutide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK [^113GmAVb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Improving glycaemic control remains a key focus of care for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and landmark studies show that good glycaemic control can reduce the incidence of diabetes‐related complications. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for individuals with T2DM who are managed with lifestyle modifications and a single drug, and a target of 7% (53 mmol/mol) for individuals with T2DM who are not adequately controlled by a single glucose‐lowering drug. 6 In addition, there is substantial evidence that multifactorial care, targeting not only glycaemic control but also blood pressure, serum lipids, body weight and hypoglycaemia risk, is associated with a reduced risk of complications. 7, 8, 9, 10 Consequently, NICE guidelines recommend a weight loss target of 5% to 10% of body weight and a blood pressure target of below 140/80 mmHg, in conjunction with glycaemic control targets. 6

A significant number of individuals with T2DM in the UK are not reaching recommended targets. Data from the National Diabetes Audit show that during 2016–2017, one third of the individuals with T2DM in England and Wales had an HbA1c value above 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and one quarter had blood pressure above 140/80 mmHg. 11 In Scotland, over 40% of the individuals with T2DM had an HbA1c value above 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and one quarter had systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg in 2016. 12 Therefore, there is a significant need to improve care for individuals with T2DM in the UK. Bringing a greater proportion of individuals with T2DM to glycaemic control and multifactorial treatment targets can improve long‐term outcomes for patients and reduce the costs of treating diabetes‐related complications for healthcare providers and UK society as a whole. This is key in optimizing the use of the limited resources within the National Health Service (NHS).

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114iDSiA]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes and stroke prevention — intensive glycemic control evidence: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have not demonstrated that intensive glycemic control (targeting hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%) reduces stroke risk more than looser glycemic control (targeting hemoglobin A1c of 7%–8%) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A review of intensive versus conventional glycemic targets in type 1 diabetes, including 12 trials and 2230 patients, found low-quality evidence for stroke with small numbers of the outcome, and the authors concluded that the evidence of the effect of intensive glycemic control on stroke was insufficient. Furthermore, tight glycemic control increases treatment burden, costs, and side-effect risks and might cause patient harm (eg, severe hypoglycemia). In summary, for individuals with diabetes, both the potential benefit of more intensive control (eg, to hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%) for prevention of microvascular disease and the potential risk of hypoglycemia should be considered in decision-making.

### Hemoglobin A1c targets for glycemic control with pharmacologic therapy for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a guidance statement update from the American College of Physicians [^114M26zM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians developed this guidance statement to guide clinicians in selecting targets for pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The National Guideline Clearinghouse and the Guidelines International Network library were searched (May 2017) for national guidelines, published in English, that addressed hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets for treating type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant outpatient adults. The authors identified guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. In addition, 4 commonly used guidelines were reviewed, from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology, the American Diabetes Association, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the guidelines.

Guidance Statement 1

Clinicians should personalize goals for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on the basis of a discussion of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy, patients' preferences, patients' general health and life expectancy, treatment burden, and costs of care.

Guidance Statement 2

Clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Guidance Statement 3

Clinicians should consider deintensifying pharmacologic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve HbA1c levels less than 6.5%.

Guidance Statement 4

Clinicians should treat patients with type 2 diabetes to minimize symptoms related to hyperglycemia and avoid targeting an HbA1c level in patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 years or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions (such as dementia, cancer, end-stage kidney disease, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure) because the harms outweigh the benefits in this population.

### Implications of risk stratification for diabetes prevention: the case of hemoglobin A1c [^115SgtWp]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been widely recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes, considerable ambiguity remains about how HbA1c should be used to identify people with prediabetes or other high-risk states for preventive interventions. The current paper provides a synthesis of the epidemiologic basis and the health and economic implications of using various HbA1c-based risk-stratification approaches for diabetes prevention. HbA1c predicts diabetes and related outcomes across a wide range of HbA1c values. However, the authors estimate that, among U.S. adults, the top 15% of the nondiabetic HBA1c distribution (HbA1c of 5.7%-6.4%) accounts for 47% of diabetes cases over 5 years, and the top 30% (5.5%-6.4%) accounts for about 70% of cases. Although this clustering of eventual cases at the high end of the HbA1c risk distribution means that intervention resources will be more efficient when applied to the upper end of the distribution, no obvious threshold exists to prioritize people for preventive interventions. Thus, the choice of optimal thresholds is a tradeoff, wherein selecting a lower HbA1c cut-point will lead to a higher rate of eligibility and health benefits for more people, and a higher HbA1c cut-point will lead to fewer cases of diabetes prevented but greater "economic efficiency" in terms of diabetes cases prevented per intervention participant. Selection of optimal HbA1c thresholds also may change with the evolving science, as better evidence on the biologic effectiveness of lower-intensity interventions and effects of lifestyle interventions on additional outcomes could pave the way for a more comprehensive, tiered approach to risk stratification.

### Long-term cost-effectiveness analyses of empagliflozin versus oral semaglutide, in addition to metformin, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the UK [^112M758E]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Data

The cost-effectiveness analysis is based on the efficacy results of the PIONEER 2 study, which enrolled T2DM patients with HbA1c values between 7.0 and 10.5% (53–91 mmol/mol), who were treated with metformin. Hence, the baseline characteristics incorporated in the model are the reported weighted average of the baseline cohort from the published clinical trial or cost-effectiveness analyses. Baseline CVD and microvascular complications were based on cohort data from other studies that enrolled a similar patient population (Supplementary material Table S1).

The effects of each of the drugs on HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and BMI (Table 1), as well as on hypoglycaemia rates (Table 2), were as reported in the PIONEER-2 study and were also obtained from the PIONEER-2 study. In the PIONEER 2 study, efficacy was assessed in the context of two estimands: treatment policy and trial product. The treatment policy estimand evaluated the treatment effect for all randomised patients, regardless of trial product discontinuation or use of rescue medication (intention-to-treat principle). The trial product estimand evaluated the treatment effect for all randomised patients under the assumption that all patients remained on trial product for the entire planned duration of the trial and did not use rescue medication, thus reflecting the effect of oral semaglutide compared with empagliflozin without the confounding effect of rescue medication. In the current cost-effectiveness analysis, the data from the treatment policy estimand were used for treatment effects. Additional analyses were performed using the data on treatment effects from the trial product estimand (Supplementary material Table S2).

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112cY7d4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Applicability of recommendations — population scope and baseline glycemia indicates these recommendations apply to adults with long-standing type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c level around 8% (mean range in included primary RCTs, 7.2% to 9.5%) despite usual care, with metformin as the most common usual care medication; subgroup enrollment included Three RCTs requiring CKD, 4 requiring existing CVD or acute coronary syndrome, 3 requiring overweight or obesity, and 11 requiring participants to be "at risk for CVD"; evidence did not allow evaluation of differences between secondary and primary prevention populations; therefore, recommendations apply to patients with type 2 diabetes with and without established CVD or CKD.

### Advances in the treatment of prediabetes [^111r8Vhg]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is epidemic in most developed and many developing countries. Owing to the associated morbidity, mortality and high costs of care, T2DM is an important global public health challenge and target for prevention. Patients at high risk for T2DM (referred to as having prediabetes) can be easily identified based on fasting glucose levels or responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). More recently, glycosylated hemoglobin (i.e. HbA1c, which is also termed A1C in the US) has also been introduced as a diagnostic tool for both prediabetes and diabetes. Such patients are also at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Since obesity and physical inactivity are important risk factors for T2DM, lifestyle interventions, emphasizing modest weight loss and increases in physical activity, should be recommended for most patients with prediabetes. Such interventions are safe and effective and also reduce risk factors for CVD. A number of oral antidiabetic agents have been shown to be effective at delaying onset of T2DM in patients with prediabetes. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are the most effective, reducing incident diabetes by up to 80%. Metformin, acarbose and orlistat also reduce incident diabetes, but their efficacy is much lower than the TZDs. Pharmacologic interventions may be appropriate for patients at particular risk for developing diabetes, but the benefits of treatment need to be balanced against the safety and tolerability of the intervention. If pharmacologic treatment is warranted, metformin should be considered first because of its favorable overall safety, tolerability, efficacy and cost profile.

Decision domains — patient values and preferences and other implications — list questions to consider and judgment options. For Patient values and preferences, questions include "What are the patients' values and preferences?", "Are values and preferences similar across the target population?", and "Are you confident about typical values and preferences?", with judgment options "Similar values", "Some variation", and "Large variation". For Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations), questions include "What are the costs per resource unit?", "Is this intervention generally available?", "What is the variability in resource requirements across the target population and settings?", "Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation?", and "Is this intervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions?", with the judgment noted as "Various considerations".

### The economic costs of diabetes: is it time for a new treatment paradigm? [^1118RmRK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The increase in health care expenditures related to the increase in the size of the population with diagnosed diabetes, the large proportion of expenditures incurred by the population ≥ 65 years of age, and the large proportion of expenditures related to late diabetes complications suggest that interventions to delay or prevent the development of diabetes in at-risk Americans, and treatments to delay or prevent the development of complications and comorbidities in Americans with diagnosed diabetes, may be most effective in stemming the growing economic burden of diabetes.

Randomized controlled clinical trials have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. Observational follow-up studies of clinical trials have demonstrated that the benefits of lifestyle interventions persist for 7–20 years. Translational studies have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions can be adapted and translated into primary care and can achieve short-term weight loss outcomes comparable to those observed in clinical trials. Lifestyle interventions can also be successfully translated into community practice through organizations such as YMCAs and diabetes self-management education programs. In Finland, lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention have been successfully translated into a National Diabetes Prevention Program and a 1-year follow-up study has demonstrated effectiveness. Randomized controlled clinical trials of pharmacologic interventions have demonstrated that at least 3 classes of oral antidiabetic medications are effective in delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. By delaying the onset of diabetes, such interventions reduce the cumulative incidence of diabetes complications and result in longer lives and improved quality of life.

A recent review of 12 economic analyses conducted by 10 research groups in 9 countries also demonstrated that in 11 of 12 analyses, lifestyle interventions were cost-effective. A recent within-trial analysis of resource utilization and outcomes from the Diabetes Prevention Program/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study confirmed that an intensive lifestyle intervention is extremely cost-effective and metformin treatment is possibly cost-saving over 10 years.

Randomized controlled clinical trials have also demonstrated that intensive glycemic management can delay the onset of microvascular, neuropathic, and cardiovascular complications in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and that the benefits of early intensive treatment persist over time. Randomized controlled clinical trials have also demonstrated that blood pressure management (target blood pressure 135/80 mmHg) and lipid management using statin medications can delay or prevent the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115C63cJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

### Second-line pharmaceutical treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes [^112JDMsi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control. However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

### Early treatment revisions by addition or switch for type 2 diabetes: impact on glycemic control, diabetic complications, and healthcare costs [^111oPoBe]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to impaired insulin secretion and reduced sensitivity to insulin's effects. In 2012, 29.1 million people, approximately 9.3% of the US population, had diabetes with the highest percentages of individuals with diabetes aged 65 and older. Patients with type 2 diabetes are at risk for a range of complications as the disease progresses, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease, which predispose to limb amputation. Adults with diabetes are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Complications can significantly increase the cost incurred by patients and payers. For example, the American Diabetes Association estimated total healthcare costs (direct and indirect) for 2012 at $245 billion for patients with diabetes, a 41% increase from the previous estimate of $174 billion (adjusted to 2007 dollars).

The American Diabetes Association's recent addition of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance testing as an alternative method to diagnose diabetes may increase the rate of early detection of diabetes because it is more convenient. HbA1c has been identified as the strongest predictor of hospitalisation in persons with diabetes, in that better glycemic control is associated with fewer hospitalisations and lower inpatient costs when hospitalisations do occur.

The American Diabetes Association recommends an HbA1c target < 7% (53 mmol/mol). An HbA1c level ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol) represents less than ideal glycemic control indicating that treatment initiation or modification may be needed. Glycemic targets such as HbA1c should be individualized to accommodate patient preference, age, risk for hypoglycemia, and other factors. Therefore, HbA1c goals can vary from patient to patient. While an HbA1c above 7% (53 mmol/mol) might not require a treatment revision by way of treatment addition or switch in real-world practice, an HbA1c ≥ 9% (75 mmol/mol) is certainly indicative of extremely poor control for which aggressive therapy with insulin is usually recommended. Delayed treatment revision in cases of uncontrolled hyperglycemia can unnecessarily place patients at increased risk for negative clinical outcomes, increased healthcare utilization, and higher costs.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of delayed pharmacological treatment revisions in cases where HbA1c ≥ 9.0% (75 mmol/mol) was observed, and to estimate the impact of early treatment revision on glycemic control, diabetic complications, and healthcare costs.

### The impact of patient preferences on the cost-effectiveness of intensive glucose control in older patients with new-onset diabetes [^116dtFRt]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Cost-effectiveness analyses have reported that intensive glucose control is not cost-effective in older patients with new-onset diabetes. However, these analyses have had limited data on patient preferences concerning diabetic health states. We examined how the cost- effectiveness of intensive glucose control changes with the incorporation of patient preferences.

Research Design and Methods

We collected health state preferences/utilities from 519 older diabetic patients. We incorporated these utilities into an established cost-effectiveness model of intensive glucose control and compared incremental cost-effectiveness analyses ratios (ICERs) (cost divided by quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) when using the original and patient-derived utilities for complications and treatments.

Results

The mean utilities were approximately 0.40 for major complications, 0.76 (95% CI 0.74–0.78) for conventional glucose control, 0.77 (0.75–0.80) for intensive therapy with oral medications, and 0.64 (0.61–0.67) for intensive therapy with insulin. Incorporating our patient-derived complication utilities alone improved ICERs for intensive glucose control (e.g., patients aged 60–65 years at diagnosis, 136,000 dollars/QALY→78,000 dollars/QALY), but intensive therapy was still not cost-effective at older ages. When patient-derived treatment utilities were also incorporated, the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment depended on the method of glucose control. Intensive control with insulin generated fewer QALYs than conventional control. However, intensive control with oral medications was beneficial on average at all ages and had an ICER ≤ 100,000 dollars to age 70.

Conclusions

The cost-effectiveness of intensive glucose control in older patients with new-onset diabetes is highly sensitive to assumptions regarding quality of life with treatments. Cost-effectiveness analyses of diabetes care should consider the sensitivity of results to alternative utility assumptions.

### The long-term cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide 5 mg versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes in Japan [^115zTc6g]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease, affecting 10.5% of the global population with projections estimating an increase to 12.2% by 2045. The disease is associated with an increased risk of macro- and microvascular complications which, in turn, lead to large health and economic burdens. Due to an increasingly aging population and lifestyle changes, approximately 5.6% of the Japanese population was estimated to have T2D in 2019. National medical expenses relating to the management of T2D in Japan reached Japanese Yen (JPY) 1.22 trillion in 2017, with this expenditure not including the costs associated with diabetes-related complications, which can drastically increase the total cost of treatment. Japanese patients with T2D differ from non-Asian patients by demonstrating lower body mass index (BMI) but higher levels of visceral fat at the same BMI level, and a higher risk of developing diabetes-related comorbidities, including renal and cardiovascular complications. Japanese individuals also tend to be younger at disease onset than non-Asians, which further exacerbates treatment-related costs. Despite advances in antihyperglycemic treatment, many patients do not achieve adequate glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c). Improved glycemic control may reduce the health and economic burden of T2D by avoiding macro- and micro-vascular complications associated with failure to reach glycemic targets.

### Cost-effectiveness of sitagliptin-based treatment regimens in European patients with type 2 diabetes and haemoglobin A1c above target on metformin monotherapy [^117LKpq7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Sitagliptin is a novel oral incretin enhancer that acts by inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 enzyme and is indicated in Europe as a treatment adjunct to metformin (MF), sulphonylurea (SU), MF plus SU and diet and exercise, in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding sitagliptin to the regimens of patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) above the International Diabetes Federation goal (6.5%) while on MF in six European countries: Austria, Finland, Portugal, Scotland (United Kingdom), Spain and Sweden.

Methods

A discrete event simulation model, which employed the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model risk equations for predicting risks of diabetes-related complication, was used. Lifetime costs and benefits were projected for alternative treatment strategies of adding sitagliptin, compared with adding rosiglitazone or a SU to MF in patients not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy. Changes in HbA1C as well as side effects associated with these different treatment strategies were based on clinical trial data. Mean baseline values from local epidemiologic studies involving patients with type 2 diabetes not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy were included in the current analysis. Costs of medications, side effects and direct costs of diabetes-related complications were based on country-specific data. UKPDS-based disutility weights associated with diabetes complications were incorporated. Disutilities associated with medication side effects were based on published data. All future costs and benefits were discounted according to local guidelines on cost-effectiveness analysis. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key input parameters.

Findings

The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) associated with the addition of sitagliptin to MF, compared with adding rosiglitazone, in the different countries analysed ranged from treatment with sitagliptin being dominant (cost saving with improved health outcome) to its being cost-effective [4,766 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)]. Treatment with sitagliptin added to MF was cost-effective compared with adding a SU, with discounted ICER values ranging from 5949 euros/QALY to 20,350 euros/QALY across countries. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes in input parameters, including clinical efficacy, costs and utility weights for both diabetes-related complications and hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

Compared with adding rosiglitazone or a SU to MF, adding sitagliptin to MF is projected to be either cost saving or cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not at HbA1C goal on MF.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1158avd1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults.

Observations

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C < 7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications.

Type 2 diabetes epidemiology and glycemic control — among U.S. adults, the age-adjusted prevalence is higher in Black (19%) and Hispanic (21%) adults than in White adults (12%), and 16% of adults with type 2 diabetes have inadequate glycemic control with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 9% or higher; inadequate control is more prevalent among Black (24%) and Hispanic (29%) adults than among White adults (9%). In the United States, the excess risk for premature deaths attributed to type 2 diabetes decreased between 1997 and 2011 among Hispanic and White adults, but not among Black adults, and access to high-quality health care in people with type 2 diabetes differs by race and ethnicity even after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health factors.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113eP4Uv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider achieving lower HbA1c levels than the goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) as an acceptable option, even beneficial if it can be achieved safely without frequent or severe hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment, based on healthcare professional judgment and the preference of the patient with diabetes.

### Achieving good glycemic control early after onset of diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis in patients with type 1 diabetes in Sweden [^113YgBU9]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Improving glycemic control was projected to reduce complication incidence and the associated costs while improving life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Modeled improvements in microvascular complication incidence were more pronounced than those in macrovascular complications, but there was no increase in the projected incidence of any modeled complication with reduced HbA1c. Analyses in which the baseline cohort was stratified by age and in which the HbA1c benefit was maintained over different time periods showed that early glycemic control in younger patients is most beneficial in terms of its overall effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy. The diminishing effect of longer periods of control was particularly notable, with the first 10 years of control at an HbA1c of 7.1% (54.1 mmol/mol) improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.297 QALYs compared to the final 30 years of control, which improved life expectancy by 0.083 QALYs. The cost analysis showed that SEK 19,575 per annum would be a justifiable cost of a diabetes treatment that could reduce HbA1c from 7.9% to 7.1% and maintain control over time.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^111oZQ9e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

### Rationale and design of the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness study (GRADE) [^114x9mHS]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) threatens to become the major public health problem of this century. However, a comprehensive comparison of the long-term effects of medications to treat T2DM has not been conducted. GRADE, a pragmatic, unmasked clinical trial, aims to compare commonly used diabetes medications, when combined with metformin, on glycemia-lowering effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes.

Research Design and Methods

GRADE was designed with support from a U34 planning grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The consensus protocol was approved by NIDDK and the GRADE Research Group. Eligibility criteria for the 5,000 metformin-treated subjects include < 5 years' diabetes duration, ≥ 30 years of age at time of diagnosis, and baseline hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.8–8.5% (51–69 mmol/mol). Medications representing four classes (sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and insulin) will be randomly assigned and added to metformin (minimum-maximum 1,000–2,000 mg/day). The primary metabolic outcome is the time to primary failure defined as an A1C ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol), subsequently confirmed, over an anticipated mean observation period of 4.8 years (range 4–7 years). Other long-term metabolic outcomes include the need for the addition of basal insulin after a confirmed A1C > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and, ultimately, the need to implement an intensive basal/bolus insulin regimen. The four drugs will also be compared with respect to selected microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease risk factors, adverse effects, tolerability, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

GRADE will compare the long-term effectiveness of major glycemia-lowering medications and provide guidance to clinicians about the most appropriate medications to treat T2DM. GRADE begins recruitment at 37 centers in the U.S. in 2013.

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^112sWpxw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of the different drug classes have demonstrated similar clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c for all classes of second-line drugs when they are added to metformin as dual therapy, but with differences in weight gain and risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the real-world effectiveness of these drugs in routine clinical practice is less well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the real-world efficacy profiles of OHAs following metformin monotherapy in terms of glycaemic control as a function of baseline phenotypic characteristics. By using data collected from routine primary care practice, the study will generate valuable evidence that is currently lacking to inform clinical decision making on the management of people with T2DM who have failed metformin monotherapy. A better understanding of patient profiles and treatment practices may lead to improved disease management through better targeting of second-line regimens according to demographic and clinical characteristics to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a combination biomarker-associated screening, a 2-stage approach was taken. The first stage included application of a T3cD biomarker test to preselect the 10% of individuals with T3cD from among those with new-onset diabetes. To this preselected population of individuals with T3cD, a cancer-specific biomarker test was applied; on a positive result, patients underwent diagnostic investigations and treatment for PDAC (Figure 1 B).

### Glycemic control with insulin glargine plus insulin glulisine versus premixed insulin analogues in real-world practices: a cost-effectiveness study with a randomized pragmatic trial design [^116uiWfB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cost can be an important consideration, along with safety and efficacy, in deciding the most appropriate treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. Both basal-bolus and premixed insulin analogue regimens are widely used in clinical practice; however, limited information is available regarding cost-effectiveness.

Objective

The goal of this study was to compare glycemic control, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life effects of insulin glargine plus insulin glulisine (glargine/glulisine) versus premixed insulin analogues in real-world clinical practice.

Methods

Adults with type 2 diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)] ≥ 7.0%) at 3 US endocrinology centers were randomly assigned to receive either glargine/glulisine or premixed insulin analogues and continued treatment following the centers' usual practice. HbA(1c), weight, insulin dose, concomitant oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) usage, and hypoglycemia were evaluated at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months. Medication costs, including costs for all insulin or OAD regimens, were estimated using published wholesale acquisition costs.

Results

A total of 197 patients were randomized to receive glargine/glulisine therapy (n = 106) or premixed analogue therapy (n = 91). Overall, the mean age was 56 years, the mean duration of diabetes was 13 years, with a mean HbA(1c) of 9.25% and mean BMI of 35.8 kg/m² at baseline. Patients randomized to receive glargine/glulisine had a greater mean HbA(1c) reduction from baseline (-2.3%) than patients receiving a premixed analogue regimen (-1.7%). Adjusted mean follow-up HbA(1c) was 6.9% versus 7.5%, respectively (difference, -0.59%; P < 0.01). The glargine/glulisine group also used a lower mean number of OADs (0.86 vs 1.14; difference, -0.28; P = 0.04) but had a higher weight (240 vs 235 lb; difference, 4.55 lb; P = 0.03) than the premixed analogue group at follow-up. There were no significant differences in daily insulin dose and rates of hypoglycemia. Overall medication costs per 1.0% reduction in HbA(1c) were $841 with glargine/glulisine and $1308 with premixed analogues.

Conclusions

Overall, treatment with glargine/glulisine provided greater improvement in glycemic control and may represent a more cost-effective treatment option than premixed regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes in real-world clinical practice. However, due to the pragmatic trial design, the study concluded before follow-up assessments were available for all randomized patients.

### Treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes: a real-world study of 2-OAD regimens, GLP-1 RAs, or basal insulin [^114A4woA]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend individualized treatment to achieve control of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels soon after diagnosis. The ADA-recommended HbA1c goal for most people with diabetes is < 7.0%, while that from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology is ≤ 6.5%. Treatment strategies should be designed to attain and maintain goals to prevent or delay hyperglycemia-related complications. HbA1c targets may be achieved and maintained with a stepwise approach to treatment intensification, based on regular HbA1c testing to identify the need for additional therapy if treatment goals are not met. Often, the recommended first step in pharmaceutical treatment is metformin. Guidelines recommend that if a patient's HbA1c level is above goal after 3 months, a second agent should be added to metformin. The ADA recommends the addition of one of the following six available treatment options: sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or basal insulin. If the HbA1c goal is not achieved or the patient's glycemic control is not maintained with dual therapy, triple therapy can be initiated. For patients with marked hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥ 10.0%) at diagnosis, initial treatment with insulin may be considered. Combination injectable therapy comprising basal insulin plus preferably a GLP-1 RA or rapid-acting insulin (or a change to premixed insulin twice daily) is usually the next recommended step in the treatment course if HbA1c remains above target. The latest algorithm from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) recommends initiation with combination therapy rather than monotherapy in patients presenting with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% [if the HbA1c goal is ≤ 6.5%] and initiating treatment with insulin, with or without other agents, in symptomatic patients presenting with HbA1c > 9.0%. AACE/ACE recommends antihyperglycemic agents in descending order of preference.

### Statement by an American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control [^116Vz6kN]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

This report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A1C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. We prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. We recommend only combinations of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. It is essential to monitor therapy with A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. We provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. This algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology Diabetes Guidelines and the recent medical literature.

### Cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach vs standard care for diabetes prevention in India [^1175TDc6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

A stepwise approach that includes screening and lifestyle modification followed by the addition of metformin for individuals with high risk of diabetes is recommended to delay progression to diabetes; however, there is scant evidence regarding whether this approach is cost-effective.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation study included 578 adults with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. Participants were enrolled in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program, a randomized clinical trial with 3-year follow-up conducted at a diabetes care and research center in Chennai, India.

Interventions

The intervention group underwent a 6-month lifestyle modification curriculum plus stepwise addition of metformin; the control group received standard lifestyle advice.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cost, health benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated from multipayer (including direct medical costs) and societal (including direct medical and nonmedical costs) perspectives. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2019 Indian rupees (INR) and purchasing power parity-adjusted international dollars (INT $).

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 578 participants was 44.4 (9.3) years, and 364 (63.2%) were men. Mean (SD) body mass index was 27.9 (3.7), and the mean (SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 6.0% (0.5). Implementing lifestyle modification and metformin was associated with INR 10 549 (95% CI, INR 10 134–10 964) (INT $803 [95% CI, INT $771–834]) higher direct costs; INR 5194 (95% CI, INR 3187-INR 7201) (INT $395; 95% CI, INT $65–147) higher direct nonmedical costs, an absolute diabetes risk reduction of 10.2% (95% CI, 1.9% to 18.5%), and an incremental gain of 0.099 (95% CI, 0.018 to 0.179) quality-adjusted life-years per participant. From a multipayer perspective (including screening costs), mean ICERs were INR 1912 (INT $145) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, INR 191 090 (INT $14 539) per diabetes case prevented and/or delayed, and INR 196 960 (INT $14 986) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the scenario of a 50% increase or decrease in screening and intervention costs, the mean ICERs varied from INR 855 (INT $65) to INR 2968 (INT $226) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, from INR 85 495 (INT $6505) to INR 296 681 (INT $22 574) per diabetes case prevented, and from INR 88 121 (INT $6705) to INR 305 798 (INT $23 267) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that a stepwise approach for diabetes prevention is likely to be cost-effective, even if screening costs for identifying high-risk individuals are added.

New SBD algorithm proposal for the treatment of type 2 diabetes

Laboratory goals for characterization of good glycemic control

The desirable goal for A1C, as defined by the previous position statement in 2007, recommended A1C levels < 6.5%. In this new Position Statement, the recommended A1C goal was redefined to < 7.0% as shown in table 3. However, according to the ADA's 2010 statement, in patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, patients with limited life expectancies, children, individuals with comorbidities, those with longstanding diabetes, advanced age and those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications" intensive glycemic control may outweigh its benefits. But for patients with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant CVD a level of A1c even lower than the general goal of < 7%, has been suggested if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects.

Laboratory targets for proper T2DM treatment

Regarding tolerable levels for laboratory goals, they were defined based on the recommendations contained in the bibliographical references.

New SBD algorithm proposal for treating type 2 diabetes

The new algorithm proposal for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was developed based on the premises and assessments conducted through the survey with SBD members and the assessment of conclusions from the panel of specialists (Table 4).

The presentation format of the new algorithm proposal was developed taking as fundamental reference the recommendations by the Joslin Diabetes Center & Joslin Clinic and also by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.

The present algorithm was completed before the publication of the recent AACE/ACE algorithm. As pointed out in the recent AACE algorithm safety, efficacy and effectiveness must be the priorities and in developing countries like Brazil cost of medications is an important barrier and could Influence the treatment.

### Costs and consequences associated with newer medications for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes [^113EErKZ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Our model is an extension of a previously published model, using as its platform the published model's analytic algorithm but changing treatment regimens and inputs, in keeping with the newer medications being considered. Adults enter the analysis at diabetes diagnosis and progress through the model until death or age 95. Only patients between the ages of 25 and 64 with newly diagnosed diabetes are included. It is assumed that there is a 10-year lag between diabetes onset and diagnosis.

Patients have an annual risk of diabetes complications, modified by age, race, and sex, time since diabetes onset, time since diagnosis, treatment, A1C achieved, smoking, hypertension, and/or concomitant hypercholesterolemia. It is assumed that hypertensive patients develop complications more rapidly than nonhypertensive patients and that glycemic control has no impact on the progression of coronary heart disease. Costs accrue due to diabetes treatment and treatment of diabetes complications. Costs are averted when complications are averted.

The summary metric used to estimate the value of exenatide and sitagliptin is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In this analysis, ICER = (costs of treatment–averted diabetes complication-related costs)/(quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained). Costs were calculated from a health care system perspective, using a lifetime analytic horizon. Key model assumptions are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Assumptions regarding model parameters

Table 2
Side effect–related quality-of-life assumptions

Treatment strategies

We assumed that intensive glycemic control is now the standard of care in the U.S. Three intensive glycemic control strategies were modeled: 1) glyburide as second-line treatment strategy, 2) exenatide as second-line treatment strategy, and 3) sitagliptin as second-line treatment strategy. In each strategy, patients were treated with combinations of metformin, the second-line agent specific to the strategy, rosiglitazone, and NPH insulin.

In all three strategies, patients requiring medication were given metformin initially. If glycemic control was not achieved with metformin alone, other medications were added, based on modeled rates of treatment failure (see supplementary Table, available in an online appendix at). All three strategies incorporated rosiglitazone as third-line therapy.

### American college of endocrinology pre-diabetes consensus conference: part three [^115B2zrg]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Can society afford the costs of treating or not treating the pre-diabetes state?

William Herman (Ann Arbor, MI) discussed costs of type 2 diabetes and approaches to assessing cost-effectiveness of diabetes prevention, suggesting it to be a highly useful endeavor. Taking into account diabetes, its complications, and general medical care, the annual direct cost of diabetes is 116 billion USD, with an additional indirect cost of illness, disability, and premature mortality totaling 58 billion USD. Of these amounts, 56% is incurred by individuals aged ≥ 65 years and 35% by those aged 45–64 years. Fifty percent of direct costs are in hospital, 24% for pharmaceutical products and supplies, 20% for outpatient care, and 6% for nursing home care. "We're spending a lot of the money on older people and a lot of it is driven by late, chronic complications", Herman summarized. Macrovascular disease contributes 52% of costs, but as diabetes duration increases, the costs of microvascular complications, particularly of diabetic nephropathy, become more important. Cost-effectiveness may be calculated as the ratio between the difference in cost of intervention versus usual care to the difference in health outcomes associated with intervention versus usual care. Cost-utility analysis includes costs of the interventions and outcomes, expressing outcomes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, perfect health might be assigned a utility of 1.0, pre-diabetes 0.8, diabetes 0.6, diabetes with complications 0.4, and death 0.0. Assuming the usual cost of pre-diabetes to be 800 USD and that of pre-diabetes with intervention 1,600 USD annually, and annual costs of uncomplicated and complicated diabetes of 1,800 and 3,000 USD, respectively, Herman presented an analysis of a Diabetes Prevention Program–type intervention that, on average, delayed diabetes onset by 5 years (3.4 years with metformin and 11.1 years with lifestyle modification). If complications began an average of 10 years after diagnosis, Herman calculated that, viewed over a 30-year period, standard and intervention approaches beginning with pre-diabetes cost 56,000 and 57,000 USD, respectively; however, with outcomes of 18 vs. 20 QALYs, the intervention approach thus costs 500 USD per QALY, representing a very inexpensive approach compared with typical intervention costs of well over 10,000–20,000 USD per QALY. "In essence", Herman said, "the costs of pre-diabetes will be paid later if we don't do anything today".

### The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in treating high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an economic evaluation using data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial [^115buSUy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing, driven by increased incidence, ageing and population growth. 1 T2DM and its associated complications, including macrovascular (coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and microvascular complications (diabetic kidney disease, neuropathy and retinopathy), are a significant economic burden to healthcare providers, 2, 3 with the management of people with T2DM and vascular complications costing up to 2.5 times more than that of those without such complications. 4

Metformin is generally recommended as the first‐line treatment of T2DM, with sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGTL2) inhibitors often recommended as second line treatment in individuals who have been unable to achieve glycaemic control with metformin (or as first‐line treatment in cases of metformin intolerance). 5, 6, 7, 8 SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in reducing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body weight in people with T2DM without increasing hypoglycaemia. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 In addition, they have demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefits 14, 15, 16, 17 and kidney function improvements. 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

DECLARE‐TIMI 58 was the largest SGLT2 inhibitor CV outcome trial (CVOT; n = 17 160) and applied broad eligibility criteria (age ≥ 40 years, HbA1c 48‐107 mmol/mol, creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min), including people with established CV disease (defined as clinically evident ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease or peripheral artery disease) or with multiple CV risk factors (≥ 55‐year‐old men and ≥ 60‐year‐old women with at least one of the following: dyslipidaemia, hypertension or current smoking). The trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or CV death compared with placebo, as well as reducing kidney disease progression, in individuals with or without established CV disease. The findings of a reduction in CV disease with dapagliflozin in both high‐ and low‐CV‐risk populations has also been suggested in a number of real‐world studies. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 While the safety and clinical efficacy results of the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial are well described, the impact of the observed beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on its cost‐effectiveness is not known.

### Cost-effectiveness of intensive multifactorial treatment compared with routine care for individuals with screen-detected type 2 diabetes: analysis of the ADDITION-UK cluster-randomized controlled trial [^115ajvaY]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness of intensive multifactorial treatment compared with routine care among people with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Cost-utility analysis in ADDITION-UK, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of early intensive treatment in people with screen-detected diabetes in 69 UK general practices. Unit treatment costs and utility decrement data were taken from published literature. Accumulated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using ADDITION-UK data from 1 to 5 years (short-term analysis, n = 1024); trial data were extrapolated to 30 years using the UKPDS outcomes model (version 1.3) (long-term analysis; n = 999). All costs were transformed to the UK 2009/10 price level.

Results

Adjusted incremental costs to the NHS were £285, £935, £1190 and £1745 over a 1-, 5-, 10- and 30-year time horizon, respectively (discounted at 3.5%). Adjusted incremental QALYs were 0.0000, - 0.0040, 0.0140 and 0.0465 over the same time horizons. Point estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) suggested that the intervention was not cost-effective although the ratio improved over time: the ICER over 10 years was £82,250, falling to £37,500 over 30 years. The ICER fell below £30 000 only when the intervention cost was below £631 per patient: we estimated the cost at £981.

Conclusion

Given conventional thresholds of cost-effectiveness, the intensive treatment delivered in ADDITION was not cost-effective compared with routine care for individuals with screen-detected diabetes in the UK. The intervention may be cost-effective if it can be delivered at reduced cost.

### What are the clinical, quality-of-life, and cost consequences of 30 years of excellent vs. poor glycemic control in type 1 diabetes? [^116dq18m]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive therapy for type 1 diabetes delayed the development of microvascular and neuropathic complications compared to conventional therapy. At the end of DCCT, all participants were trained in intensive therapy, care was transferred to community providers, and the difference in HbA1c between treatment groups narrowed and disappeared. Our objective was to describe the outcomes and the quality-of-life and costs associated with those outcomes in participants who maintained excellent vs. poor glycemic control over 30 years.

Research Design and Methods

We assessed the incidence of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, acute metabolic complications, death, quality-of-life, and costs in the tertile of DCCT intensive therapy participants who achieved a mean updated HbA1c of < 7.2% (55 mmol/mol) and the tertile of DCCT conventional therapy participants (n = 240) who achieved a mean updated HbA1c of > 8.8% (73 mmol/mol) over 30 years.

Results

Thirty years of excellent vs. poor glycemic control substantially reduced the incidence of retinopathy requiring laser therapy (5% vs. 45%), end-stage renal disease (0% vs. 5%), clinical neuropathy (15% vs. 50%), myocardial infarction (3% vs. 5%), stroke (0.4% vs. 2%), and death (6% vs. 20%). It also resulted in a gain of ~1.62 quality-adjusted life-years and averted ~$90,900 in costs of complications per participant.

Conclusions

Thirty years of excellent vs. poor glycemic control for T1DM can substantially reduce the incidence of complications, comorbidities, and death, improve quality-of-life, and reduce costs. These estimates represent the benefits that may be achieved with excellent glycemic control.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116xhM13]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — 2017 VA/DoD individualized HbA1c target ranges described patient-tailored goals and tradeoffs: an "HbA1c range of 6–7% was suggested for patients with a life expectancy greater than 10–15 years and absent or mild microvascular complications, if it could be safely achieved", whereas "an HbA1c range of 7–8.5% was recommended for patients with established microvascular or macrovascular disease, comorbid conditions, or a life expectancy of 5–10 years". The Work Group noted that intensively lowering HbA1c "will reduce microvascular complications… but not other important clinical outcomes", and that any benefits are "counterbalanced by an increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and, in one trial, all-cause mortality".

### Individualized glycemic control for U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^117839oC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] level < 7%) is an established, cost-effective standard of care. However, guidelines recommend individualizing goals on the basis of age, comorbidity, diabetes duration, and complications.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of individualized control versus uniform intensive control (HbA1c level < 7%) for the U.S. population with type 2 diabetes.

Design

Patient-level Monte Carlo-based Markov model.

Data Sources

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012.

Target Population

The approximately 17.3 million persons in the United States with diabetes diagnosed at age 30 years or older.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Health care sector.

Intervention

Individualized versus uniform intensive glycemic control.

Outcome Measures

Average lifetime costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Individualized control saved $13 547 per patient compared with uniform intensive control ($105 307 vs. $118 854), primarily due to lower medication costs ($34 521 vs. $48 763). Individualized control decreased life expectancy (20.63 vs. 20.73 years) due to an increase in complications but produced more QALYs (16.68 vs. 16.58) due to fewer hypoglycemic events and fewer medications.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Individualized control was cost-saving and generated more QALYs compared with uniform intensive control, except in analyses where the disutility associated with receiving diabetes medications was decreased by at least 60%.

Limitation

The model did not account for effects of early versus later intensive glycemic control.

Conclusion

Health policies and clinical programs that encourage an individualized approach to glycemic control for U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes reduce costs and increase quality of life compared with uniform intensive control. Additional research is needed to confirm the risks and benefits of this strategy.

### Results of a model analysis of the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus exenatide added to metformin, glimepiride, or both for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States [^114s4mbe]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Nearly half of all US patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are unable to maintain adequate glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA₁(c)) control (ie, < 7.0%).

Objective

The aim of this work was to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of incretin-based therapy with once-daily liraglutide (vs twice-daily exenatide) combined with metformin, glimepiride, or both for the treatment of T2DM.

Methods

Patient data were obtained from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 (LEAD 6) trial. Baseline data included mean HbA₁(c) (8.15%), age (56.7 years), disease duration (8 years), sex, body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels, cardiovascular and renal risk factors, and other complications. The IMS Center for Outcomes Research Diabetes Model was used to project and compare lifetime (ie, 35-year) clinical and economic outcomes for once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg compared with twice-daily exenatide 10 (ig, each used as add-on therapy with maximum-dose metformin and/or glimepiride. Treatment-effect assumptions were also derived from the LEAD 6 trial. Transition probabilities, utilities, and complication costs were obtained from published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in the United States.

Results

The base-case analysis indicated that, compared with exenatide, liraglutide add-on therapy was associated with a mean (SD) increase in life expectancy of 0.187 (0.250) years and an increase in qualityadjusted life-years of 0.322 (0.164) years. Compared with exenatide, total lifetime treatment costs for liraglutide were $12,956 higher, yielding an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of $40,282. However, the costs of diabetes-related complications were lower with liraglutide than with exenatide ($49,784 vs $52,429, respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicated that setting patient HbA(1c) levels at the 95% upper limit reduced the ICER for liraglutide compared with exenatide to $33,086.

Conclusion

In this model analysis using published clinical data and current medication acquisition price assumptions, liraglutide (in combination with metformin and/or glimepiride) appeared to be cost-effective in the US payer setting over a 35-year time horizon.

### The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes… [^117R1rL1]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

gained. Results. — The incremental cost of opportunistic screening among all persons aged 25 years or older is estimated at $236, 449 per life-year gained and $56, 649 per QALY gained. Screening is more cost-effective among younger people and among African Americans. The benefits of early detection and treatment accrue. Because the link between glycemic level and cardiovascular disease is uncertain, 41–43 our base case model restricts the causal links to the microvascular complications, which may understate some of the benefits of early detection and treatment. The HbA1c value is assumed to be 6. 8% at onset of diabetes. with an annual increase of 0. 2 percentage points, resulting in an estimated
8. 9% at clinical diagnosis, 22 a value comparable with that found in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. 34 Under screening, the HbA1c level is on average 7. 8% at diagnosis.

We estimated the SD at clinical diagnosis as 20% to 26% of the mean HbA1c value, 22, 34 and assumed that at screening diagnosis this SD would be roughly half because true duration is constant across individuals. We also assumed that the coefficient of variation remains constant as the mean glycemic level varies. On the basis. of UKPDS results, we estimated that the reduction in HbA1c level after 1 year is 2. 1 percentage points with treatment by diet only. Thed initial HbA1c reduction was not sustained over time in the UKPDS study.
20. Thus, our model assumes a rate of increase in HbA1c levels after treatment is initiated that is comparable with the UKPDS diet-only group rate at
0. 156 percentage points per year. The average HbA1c values for the cohort are not permitted to decrease below. base case, glyburide at half the maximum dose was used, as was done by Eastman et al.

14, 15 The cost of insulin treatment was based on the experiences of the control group in the Veterans Affairs trial. 21 The costs of routine treatment specific to diabetes and the costs of treating diabetes complications are expressed in US 1995 dollars. and adjusted for inflation. The model assumes that treatment costs vary by duration from onset regardless of when diagnosis occurred. This assumption may underestimate the benefits of screening to the extent that earlier implementation of diet may delay the need for drugs. Primary outcome measures were additional life-years and quality-adjusted life-years, as measured from onset of diabetes. A utility value of. cost per QALY is estimated at $56, 649. It is more cost-effective to screen younger cohorts who can potentially gain more life-years free from major complications. The greatest gain from screening is observed for blindness, for which the cumulative incidence is reduced by 7. 5 percentage points for.

decreases by $1275 with screening, for an average gain in life-years of 0.
13. The cost per life-year for adults aged 25 to 34 years is $35, 768, which is about one sixth the ratio obtained for. per QALY, after screening costs are incorporated. If HbA1c levels of 7. 0% or more49 are used as the screening test, the cost-effectiveness ratio is $46, 948 per life-year. Thus, using HbA1c as the screening test appears slightly more cost-effective. because treatment is directed at patients at higher risk of developing complications. The model is moderately sensitive to the performance characteristics of the screening test. If sensitivity and specificity each were 10% lower, the cost per case detected increases. nearly 3-fold to $137, 148.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115An8B8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Table 4
Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes a

Table 5
WHO criteria for interpreting 2-h OGTT a

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people, previously controversial, is now recommended for those at risk of developing the disease. The ADA proposes that all asymptomatic people ≥ 45 years of age be screened in a healthcare setting. An HbA 1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT evaluation is appropriate for screening. The IDF recommends that the health service in each country decide whether to implement screening for diabetes. FPG is the suggested test. In contrast, the International Expert Committee and the ADA have recommended that HbA 1c can be used for screening for diabetes (see section on HbA 1c below). If an FPG result is < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and/or a 2-h plasma glucose concentration is < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year intervals. Screening should be considered at a younger age or be carried out more frequently in individuals who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) or obese and who have a least one additional risk factor for diabetes [see for conditions associated with increased risk]. Because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children, screening of children is now advocated. Starting at age 10 years (or at the onset of puberty if puberty occurs at a younger age), testing should be performed every 3 years in overweight individuals who have two other risk factors — namely, family history, a race/ethnicity recognized to increase risk, signs of insulin resistance, and a maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation. Despite these recommendations and the demonstration that interventions can delay and sometimes prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, there is as yet no published evidence that treatment based on screening has an effect on long-term complications. In addition, the published literature lacks consensus as to which screening procedure (FPG, OGTT, and/or HbA 1c) is the most appropriate (,–). On the basis of an evaluation of NHANES III data, a strategy has been proposed to use FPG to screen whites ≥ 40 years and other populations ≥ 30 years of age. The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes has been estimated. The incremental cost of screening all persons ≥ 25 years of age has been estimated to be $236,449 per life-year gained and $56,649 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Interestingly, screening was more cost-effective at ages younger than the 45 years currently recommended. In contrast, screening targeted to individuals with hypertension reduces the QALY from $360,966 to $34,375, with ages between 55 and 75 years being the most cost-effective. Modeling run on 1 × 10⁶ individuals suggests considerable uncertainty as to whether screening for diabetes would be cost-effective. By contrast, the results of a more recent modeling study imply that screening commencing at 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective (< $11,000 per QALY gained). Long-term outcome studies are necessary to provide evidence to resolve the question of the efficacy of diabetes screening.

### Effectiveness of targeted insulin-adherence interventions for glycemic control using predictive analytics among patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^117D1X53]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Patient adherence to antidiabetic medications, especially insulin, remains poor, leading to adverse outcomes and increased costs. Most adherence interventions have only been modestly effective, partly because they are not targeted to patients who could benefit most.

Objective

To evaluate whether delivering more intensive insulin-adherence interventions only to individuals with type 2 diabetes predicted to benefit most was more effective than delivering a lower-intensity intervention to a larger group of unselected individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 3-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial used data from Horizon, the largest health insurer in New Jersey, on 6000 participants 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who were receiving basal insulin. Patients were excluded if they were insured by Medicaid or Medicare or had fewer than 3 months of continuous enrollment. The study was conducted from July 7, 2016, through October 5, 2017. Analyses were conducted from February 5 to September 24, 2018.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified based on baseline availability of 1 or more glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test values. All arms were designed to cost the same, and each cohort received a tailored pharmacist telephone consultation varying based on (1) proportion receiving the intervention and (2) intensity, including follow-up frequency and cointerventions. Arm 1 offered a low-intensity intervention to all patients. Arm 2 offered a moderate-intensity intervention to 60% of patients based on their predicted risk of insulin nonadherence. Arm 3 offered a high-intensity intervention to 40% of patients based on glycemic control and predicted risk of insulin nonadherence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was insulin persistence. Secondary outcomes were changes in HbA1c level and health care utilization. Outcomes were evaluated in arms 2 and 3 vs arm 1 using claims data, intention-to-treat principles, and multiple imputation for missing values in the 12-month follow-up.

Results

Among 6000 participants, mean (SD) age was 55.9 (11.0) years and 3344 (59.8%) were male. Compared with arm 1, insulin nonpersistence did not differ in arm 2 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75–1.03) or arm 3 (relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77–1.06). Glycemic control was similar in arm 2 and arm 1 (absolute HbA1c level difference, -0.15%; 95% CI, -0.34% to 0.05%) but was better in arm 3 (absolute HbA1c level difference, -0.25%; 95% CI, -0.43% to -0.06%). Total spending and office visits did not differ, but arm 2 (moderate intensity intervention) had more hospitalizations (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06–1.41) and emergency department visits (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.24–1.53) than did arm 1 (low intensity intervention).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with an untargeted low-intensity intervention, delivering a highly targeted high-intensity intervention did not improve insulin persistence but modestly improved mean glycemic control. A partially targeted moderate-intensity intervention did not change insulin persistence or HbA1c level but was associated with a small increase in hospitalizations.

### Insulin-based versus triple oral therapy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: which is better? [^111u5Xs3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin is the most effective hypoglycemic agent in our treatment armamentarium and is now recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines as the second agent added after metformin. Insulin is also thought to protect β-cell function decline, therefore exerting a "disease-modifying" effect. Yet there is resistance to insulin initiation among physicians and patients alike, not only as an early treatment option but also when oral hypoglycemic agents fail to control glucose levels. Some commonly cited barriers to insulin initiation are patient fear of disease progression and needle anxiety, as well as patient and provider fears of weight gain and hypoglycemic episodes. For these reasons, insulin has traditionally been viewed as a last resort for patients who fail to maintain glycemic control with diet and oral hypoglycemic drugs.

However, previous studies have shown comparable weight gain, edema, and lipid changes in a comparison of insulin glargine or rosiglitazone added to a combination of sulfonylurea and metformin therapy. Insulin therapy was more cost-effective and produced greater reductions in A1C, when the baseline A1C was > 9.5%. When an insulin and metformin treatment regimen was compared with addition of a third oral hypoglycemic agent after failure of two oral agents, patients with triple oral therapy were less likely to complete the regimen due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects. Studies suggest that short-term treatment with insulin after diagnosis or at time of "secondary drug failure" improves β-cell function and metabolic control. To evaluate the feasibility of an insulin-based regimen as first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes we compared compliance, satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), effectiveness, and safety in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to triple oral hypoglycemic therapy or an insulin-based regimen.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111ZXfet]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Cost-effectiveness of biomarker-associated early pancreatic cancer detection in new-onset diabetes [^111ZfC1a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

In this economic evaluation, an integrated decision tree and a Markov state-transition model were developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of biomarker-associated screening for PDAC among individuals with new-onset diabetes compared with the standard of care for PDAC diagnosis and treatment. New-onset diabetes was defined as diabetes occurring among individuals aged 50 years or older within 6 months of diabetes diagnosis (hemoglobin A 1c level ≥ 48 mmol/mol [≥ 6.5%]; to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, as described in the UK-EDI study protocol. The UK-EDI Studyreceived ethical approval from the London-West London and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee Research Ethics Committee. Considering the nature of this economic evaluation used a simulated population with new-onset diabetes, obtaining informed consent from study participants was not possible. This study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards reporting guideline.

Entry into the pathway for the standard-of-care cohort occurred on the development of clinical symptoms suspicious of PDAC. Patients were subjected to routine diagnostic investigations, currently used for PDAC diagnosis, such as laboratory tests (carbohydrate antigen 19–9 [CA19–9]); computed tomography scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis; endoscopic ultrasonography; and positron emission tomography. For the biomarker-associated early detection strategies, the model considered the same diagnostic investigations. However, they were applied after a positive biomarker test result. All biomarker-based strategies were compared with the standard of care. The model allowed for the diagnosis of resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease in all pathways. The proportion of patients at each disease stage was potentially influenced by early cancer detection, with an increase in diagnoses for patients with resectable tumors and a reduction in metastatic cancers in the biomarker strategies compared with the standard-of-care cohort (Table 1). Clinical and economical outcomes in each PDAC stage were tracked over a 5-year time horizon, or until death, with a cycle length of 1 year (Figure 1 A).

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic targets — We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved (Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended). We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of T2DM, comorbidities, and life expectancy. The discussion notes intensive control as targets such as HbA1c < 7.0%. Supporting evidence cited includes a Cochran review of 20 trials (n = 29,986) reporting no significant difference between intensive and conventional glucose control for all-cause mortality but reduced risk of amputation and microvascular diseases in the intensive treatment arm, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

### Cost-effectiveness of interventions to manage diabetes: has the evidence changed since 2008? [^112WNrb9]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To synthesize updated evidence on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of interventions to manage diabetes, its complications, and comorbidities.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review of studies from high-income countries evaluating the CE of diabetes management interventions recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and published in English between June 2008 and July 2017. We also incorporated studies from a previous CE review from the period 1985–2008. We classified the interventions based on their strength of evidence (strong, supportive, or uncertain) and levels of CE: cost-saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), very cost-effective (≤ $25,000 per life year gained [LYG] or quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001-$50,000 per LYG or QALY), marginally cost-effective ($50,001-$100,000 per LYG or QALY), or not cost-effective (> $100,000 per LYG or QALY). Costs were measured in 2017 U.S. dollars.

Results

Seventy-three new studies met our inclusion criteria. These were combined with 49 studies from the previous review to yield 122 studies over the period 1985–2017. A large majority of the ADA-recommended interventions remain cost-effective. Specifically, we found strong evidence that the following ADA-recommended interventions are cost-saving or very cost-effective: In the cost-saving category are 1) ACE inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for intensive hypertension management compared with standard hypertension management, 2) ACEI/ARB therapy to prevent chronic kidney disease and/or end-stage renal disease in people with albuminuria compared with no ACEI/ARB therapy, 3) comprehensive foot care and patient education to prevent and treat foot ulcers among those at moderate/high risk of developing foot ulcers, 4) telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy screening compared with office screening, and 5) bariatric surgery compared with no surgery for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). In the very cost-effective category are 1) intensive glycemic management (targeting A1C < 7%) compared with conventional glycemic management (targeting an A1C level of 8–10%) for individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, 2) multicomponent interventions (involving behavior change/education and pharmacological therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, nephropathy/retinopathy, secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin) compared with usual care, 3) statin therapy compared with no statin therapy for individuals with T2D and history of cardiovascular disease, 4) diabetes self-management education and support compared with usual care, 5) T2D screening every 3 years starting at age 45 years compared with no screening, 6) integrated, patient-centered care compared with usual care, 7) smoking cessation compared with no smoking cessation, 8) daily aspirin use as primary prevention for cardiovascular complications compared with usual care, 9) self-monitoring of blood glucose three times per day compared with once per day among those using insulin, 10) intensive glycemic management compared with conventional insulin therapy for T2D among adults aged ≥ 50 years, and 11) collaborative care for depression compared with usual care.

Conclusions

Complementing professional treatment recommendations, our systematic review provides an updated understanding of the potential value of interventions to manage diabetes and its complications and can assist clinicians and payers in prioritizing interventions and health care resources.

If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of strategies for managing people at high risk for diabetes [^117KF6nh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lifestyle modification can forestall diabetes in high-risk people, but the long-term cost-effectiveness is uncertain.

Objective

To estimate the effects of the lifestyle modification program used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) on health and economic outcomes.

Design

Cost-effectiveness analysis using the Archimedes model.

Data Sources

Published basic and epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, and Kaiser Permanente administrative data.

Target Population

Adults at high risk for diabetes (body mass index > 24 kg/m², fasting plasma glucose level of 5.2725 to 6.9375 mmol/L [95 to 125 mg/dL], 2-hour glucose tolerance test result of 7.77 to 11.0445 mmol/L [140 to 199 mg/dL]).

Time Horizon

5 to 30 years.

Perspective

Patient, health plan, and societal.

Interventions

No prevention, DPP's lifestyle modification program, lifestyle modification begun after a person develops diabetes, and metformin.

Measurements

Diagnosis and complications of diabetes.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Compared with no prevention program, the DPP lifestyle program would reduce a high-risk person's 30-year chances of getting diabetes from about 72% to 61%, the chances of a serious complication from about 38% to 30%, and the chances of dying of a complication of diabetes from about 13.5% to 11.2%. Metformin would deliver about one third the long-term health benefits achievable by immediate lifestyle modification. Compared with not implementing any prevention program, the expected 30-year cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of the DPP lifestyle intervention from the health plan's perspective would be about 143,000 dollars. From a societal perspective, the cost/QALY of the lifestyle intervention compared with doing nothing would be about 62,600 dollars. Either using metformin or delaying the lifestyle intervention until after a person develops diabetes would be more cost-effective, costing about 35,400 dollars or 24,500 dollars per QALY gained, respectively, compared with no program. Compared with delaying the lifestyle program until after diabetes is diagnosed, the marginal cost-effectiveness of beginning the DPP lifestyle program immediately would be about 201,800 dollars.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Variability and uncertainty deriving from the structure of the model were tested by comparing the model's results with the results of real clinical trials of diabetes and its complications. The most critical element of uncertainty is the effectiveness of the lifestyle program, as expressed by the 95% CI of the DPP study. The most important potentially controllable factor is the cost of the lifestyle program. Compared with no program, lifestyle modification for high-risk people can be made cost-saving over 30 years if the annual cost of the intervention can be reduced to about 100 dollars.

Limitations

Results depend on the accuracy of the model.

Conclusions

Lifestyle modification is likely to have important effects on the morbidity and mortality of diabetes and should be recommended to all high-risk people. The program used in the DPP study may be too expensive for health plans or a national program to implement. Less expensive methods are needed to achieve the degree of weight loss seen in the DPP.

Combination therapy thresholds and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are specified: "For newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an A1C ≥ 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, one should initiate, along with lifestyle modifications, oral possibly triple combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin and considering basal insulin". When there are "significant symptoms of hyperglycemia" or "a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels (≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]), insulin is recommended". Metformin can be combined with other agents, but clinicians should "avoid its use in persons with CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) or GI intolerance".

### Improving outcomes with early and intensive metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a long-term modeling analysis of clinical and cost outcomes in Italy [^114kkQgx]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This analysis quantifies the potential long-term clinical and cost benefits of early and intensive metabolic control (EIMC) versus conventional management in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in Italy.

Methods

The PRIME T2D Model was used to project clinical and cost outcomes over long-term time horizons for a newly diagnosed cohort of patients receiving EIMC or conventional management. EIMC was associated with a mean glycated hemoglobin reduction of 0.6% from baseline and a mean weight loss of 9.5 kg (8.2%) for a duration of 6 years, before gradually returning to the same levels as the conventional management arm over 6 years. Modifiable risk factors were assumed to progress over time based on published regression functions. Direct and indirect costs associated with diabetes-related complications were accounted in 2021 Euros (EUR), with unit costs and health state utilities derived from published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually.

Results

For the population diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2021 (estimated at 216,417 cases), EIMC was projected to add approximately 33,112 years of life and 55,403 quality-adjusted life years versus conventional management. Cost savings with EIMC were estimated at EUR 494 million, EUR 608 million and EUR 628 million in the incident population at 10- and 20- and 50-year time horizons, respectively.

Conclusions

According to this modeling study, early and intensive metabolic control has the potential to substantially improve clinical outcomes and reduce economic burden compared with conventional management of patients with type 2 diabetes in Italy.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Cost-effectiveness of newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies for the American College of Physicians [^115d4ypT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, costs of antidiabetes medications exceed $327 billion.

Purpose

To systematically review cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of newer antidiabetes medications for type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

Bibliographic databases from 1 January 2010 through 13 July 2023, limited to English.

Study Selection

Nonindustry-funded CEAs, done from a U.S. perspective that estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for newer antidiabetic medications. Two reviewers screened the literature; disagreements were resolved with a third reviewer.

Data Extraction

Cost-effectiveness analyses were reviewed for treatment comparisons, model inputs, and outcomes. Risk of bias (RoB) of the CEAs was assessed using Drummond criteria and certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluations). Certainty of evidence was determined using cost per QALY thresholds predetermined by the American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee; low (> $150000), intermediate ($50 to $150000), or high (< $50000) value per QALY compared with the alternative.

Data Synthesis

Nine CEAs were eligible (2 low, 1 high, and 6 some concerns RoB), evaluating glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP1a), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide agonist (GIP/GLP1a), and insulin. Comparators were metformin, sulfonylureas, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, and others. Compared with metformin, GLP1a and SGLT2i are low value as first-line therapy (high CoE) but may be of intermediate value when added to metformin or background therapy compared with adding nothing (low CoE). Insulin analogues may be similarly effective but more expensive than NPH insulin (low CoE). The GIP/GLP1a value is uncertain (insufficient CoE).

Limitations

Cost-effectiveness analyses varied in methodological approach, assumptions, and drug comparisons. Risk of bias and GRADE method for CEAs are not well established.

Conclusion

Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and SGLT2i are of low value as first-line therapy but may be of intermediate value when added to metformin or other background therapy compared with adding nothing. Other drugs and comparisons are of low or uncertain value. Results are sensitive to drug effectiveness and cost assumptions.

### Cost-effectiveness of pharmacist care in diabetes management: a systematic review [^111PervN]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was the commonly used effectiveness measurement to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions in diabetes (Table 3). Short-term studies (less than 1 year) have shown that the pharmacist-led care group exhibited a significantly greater improvement in HbA1c levels compared to the standard care group (mean difference 0.43%, 95% CI 0.34–0.52). This intervention not only resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving HbA1c improvement (HbA1c reduction ≥ 0.1% from baseline) but also achieved higher rates of HbA1c compliance (49.53% vs 72.88%, p < 0.01).

Table 3
Base case analysis of eligible studies

CV cardiovascular, HbA1c hemoglobin A1c, ICER incremental cost-effective ratio, IUER incremental cost-utility ratio, LYG life years gained, NR not reported, QALY quality-adjusted life year, WTP willing-to-pay

a Using predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease using the UK Prospective Diabetes (UKPDS) Risk Engine

b The definition of probability was based on the number of patients who showed improvement in HbA1c compared to the total number in each group. The scale ranges from 0 (no improvement) to 1 (improvement of 0.1% or more)

c Participants were divided into three groups based on their initial HbA1c levels: 8% to < 9%, 9% to < 10%, and ≥ 10%

d 1 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita

The other two studies utilized LYG and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk [calculated using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine] as the measure of long-term effect in the cost-effectiveness analysis, respectively. Pharmacist-led care resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the annual risk of cardiovascular events (mean difference 0.26%, 95% CI 0.08–0.63%) and an increase of 0.29 LYG compared to the standard care group.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for HbA1c test intervals to screen patients with type 2 diabetes based on risk stratification [^117Lfe4c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Annual screening to detect T2DM was not cost effective and should not be used for any population. The three-year screening interval was optimal for all elderly populations, the obesity at all ages and the overweight 45–59-year-old group. Among low BMI and younger age groups, the optimal HbA1c test interval can be longer than 3 years.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114UCmQQ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Individualizing glycemic goals — glycemic goals and pharmacologic management should be individualized and not one size fits all, and glycemic goals should be individualized in the context of shared decision-making to address individual needs and preferences; more aggressive goals may be recommended if they can be achieved safely and with an acceptable burden of therapy and if life expectancy is sufficient to reap the benefits of stringent goals; less stringent goals, such as A1C up to 8% [64 mmol/mol], may be recommended when the benefits of an intensive goal may not be realized or when the risks and burdens outweigh the potential benefits.

### Early treatment revisions by addition or switch for type 2 diabetes: impact on glycemic control, diabetic complications, and healthcare costs [^113uWHda]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Even though all study participants had a record of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 9%, a minority (34.7%) added a treatment or switched treatments within 90 days of the HbA1c ≥ 9% laboratory test.
Early treatment revision by addition or switch was associated with a greater level of near-term glycemic control.
Early treatment revision had no impact on end points such as diabetic complications. However, the effect of this intervention may not be realized over relatively short time periods.
Future studies should extend the observation period for outcomes.

### Initiating therapy in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes: combination therapy vs a stepwise approach [^114jH2JQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

There is clear evidence that achieving glycaemic targets reduces the risk of developing complications as a result of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Many patients, however, continue to have suboptimal glycaemic control because of issues that include unclear advice on how to achieve these targets as well as clinical inertia. The two management approaches recommended for patients newly diagnosed with T2D are stepwise and combination therapy, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Stepwise therapy may result in good patient adherence and allow greater individualization of therapy, and minimization of side effects and cost, and so may be appropriate for patients who are closer to goal. Stepwise therapy, however, may also lead to frequent delays in achieving glycaemic goals and longer exposure to hyperglycaemia. Combination therapy, which is now emerging as an important therapy option, has a number of potential advantages over stepwise therapy, including reduction in clinical inertia and earlier and more frequent achievement of glycated haemoglobin goals by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms simultaneously, which may more effectively delay disease progression. Compared with stepwise therapy, the disadvantages of combination therapy include reduced patient adherence resulting from complex, multi-drug regimens, difficulty determining the cause of poor efficacy and/or side effects, patient refusal to accept disease, and higher cost. Fixed-dose and fixed-ratio combinations are novel therapeutic approaches which may help address several issues of treatment complexity and patient burden associated with combination therapy comprising individual drugs. The choice of which drugs to administer and the decision to use stepwise vs combination therapy, however, should always be made on an individualized basis.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114MHkee]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Additional recommendations for all individuals with diabetes — monitoring insulin therapy, prescribing glucagon, and addressing cost barriers — are as follows: 9.27 Monitor for signs of overbasalization during insulin therapy, such as significant bedtime-to-morning or postprandial-to-preprandial glucose differential, occurrences of hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glycemic variability. When overbasalization is suspected, a thorough re-evaluation should occur promptly to further tailor therapy to the individual's needs. E. 9.28 Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals requiring insulin therapy or at high risk for hypoglycemia. Family, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these individuals should know its location and be educated on how to administer it. Glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution are preferred. B. 9.29 Routinely assess all people with diabetes for financial obstacles that could impede their diabetes management. Clinicians, members of the diabetes care team, and social services professionals should work collaboratively, as appropriate and feasible, to address these barriers and reduce costs, thereby improving access to evidence-based care. E. 9.30 In adults with diabetes and cost-related barriers, consider use of lower-cost medications for glycemic management (i.e., metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin) within the context of their risks for hypoglycemia, weight gain, cardiovascular and kidney events, and other adverse effects.

### Type 2 diabetes can be prevented with early pharmacological intervention [^114CqeQk]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes occurs in 7% of the U.S. population and affects ∼21 million individuals. Its prevalence has escalated dramatically during the last decade (references accompanied by the letter "a" can be found in the Supplementary Data) because of multiple factors: 1) increased longevity of the population, 2) increased prevalence of obesity, 3) decreased physical activity, and 4) rapid growth of minority populations at high risk developing type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes experience significant morbidity and mortality from microvascular and macrovascular complications. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has estimated that the cost of treating diabetes and its associated complications in 2007 was $174 billion, and recent studies estimate that diabetes will more than double by the year 2050.

Results from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, UK Prospective Diabetes Study, and other trials have established hyperglycemia as the major risk factor for microvascular and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular complications. Consequently, increased emphasis has been placed on achieving as close to euglycemic control as possible without untoward side effects of therapy in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. Nonetheless, the average level of glucose control in U.S. patients with diabetes remains suboptimal. Moreover, once overt fasting hyperglycemia becomes manifest, there is a relentless deterioration in β-cell function with an accompanying rise in glycemia. Because most of the morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes arises from long-term complications, early detection and prevention would be expected to have a tremendous beneficial human, social, medical, and economic impact. With these considerations in mind, it is logical to intervene early in the natural history of type 2 diabetes with measures targeted to reverse specific pathophysiological defects present in the prediabetic state and that ultimately lead to development of overt diabetes. This approach requires 1) the ability to identify prediabetic individuals at risk to develop type 2 diabetes later in life and 2) interventions that reverse the pathogenic disturbances responsible for type 2 diabetes. Prevention of diabetic levels of hyperglycemia would be expected to prevent/reduce the incidence of microvascular complications. However, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG) subjects only have mild-modestly elevated plasma glucose levels, and glucose is a relatively weak risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is likely that other cardiovascular factors are responsible for the increased incidence of macrovascular disease. Thus, reduction in HbA 1c per se may not decrease cardiovascular complications unless the medications used to treat IGT/IFG correct established cardiovascular risk factors, independent of their glucose-lowering effect.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults-2024 update [^114yCGpj]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, metformin, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic medication due to its durable efficacy in lowering HbA1c, negligible risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain, relatively mild side effect profile, long-term track record, and affordability.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for HbA1c test intervals to screen patients with type 2 diabetes based on risk stratification [^116injtf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is expected to be close to 600 million worldwide by 2030. The HbA1c test to detect new cases of T2DM in a healthy population is one of the most effective ways to prevent and start early treatment for type 2 diabetes; however, the best frequency for HbA1c testing remains unclear. Although multiple studies have tried to investigate the optimal frequency for HbA1c testing, current guidelines about test frequencies to screen type 2 diabetes patients in a healthy population still rely on expert opinion.

Kahn et al. suggested that 30- to 45-year-old people are required to have 3- to 5-year interval screening on the basis of cost effectiveness analysis. However, this study does not consider the possibility of an incidence rate for type 2 diabetes based on risk factors. Multiple studies have reported that subjects with obesity are more likely to have type 2 diabetes than people with a normal BMI. In addition to body mass index level, age also matters in the development of type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases as people live longer, and the complication rate among older adults with type 2 diabetes is significantly higher for both acute and chronic microvascular and cardiovascular diseases than that among younger adults with type 2 diabetes. People with a higher risk of onset of type 2 diabetes seem to require screening at shorter intervals than those with a lower risk. Previously, we reported and recommended that subjects with obesity aged 30–44 should be screened every 2 years, while those with a normal body mass index in the same age group would not need screening for the next 10 years because the paces of HbA1c progression are different based on age and BMI. These results considered only HbA1c test characteristics and did not include economic impact in determining the optimal interval for HbA1c screening. People whose screening results were false positive may receive unnecessary treatment, and people whose screening results were false negative may incur higher treatment costs. When optimal screening intervals are introduced based on patient risk stratification, it would be possible to eliminate unnecessary tests as well as to minimize the chance of failing to detect affected patients.

Our study aimed to determine the optimal HbA1c test interval strategy to detect new type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cases in a healthy population stratified by age and body mass index (BMI), considering HbA1c test characteristics and cost effectiveness.

### Rationale and design of the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness study (GRADE) [^114GxU5D]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

One of the major challenges for practitioners is to choose from the considerable armamentarium of glucose-lowering medications the best means of maintaining an appropriate level of glycemic control over time. Consensus algorithms have been developed to help clinicians to select among the numerous medications and their combinations for achieving and maintaining a target A1C of < 7% (53 mmol/mol). Other published algorithms selected different glycemic goals and recommended different strategies to achieve them. Recent American College of Physicians guidelines suggest that metformin is the only drug supported by solid evidence and that data are insufficient to choose a second agent. The dearth of head-to-head comparator studies of glucose-lowering medications, either alone or in combinations, and of trials that have lasted > 6–12 months to examine the durable effects of interventions on glycemic control has hampered the development of all these algorithms.

Because T2DM is a progressive disease with worsening metabolic control over time, the long-term glycemia-lowering effects of interventions are particularly important. Safety, side effect profiles, tolerability, patient acceptance, burden of therapy, and cost are other important factors in the long-term treatment of this chronic, degenerative disease. Finally, recent position statements have emphasized individualization and patient-centered approaches to therapy, but few studies have examine which patients might do better or worse with specific therapies.

Comparative effectiveness research has been identified as a high national priority in the U.S. Similarly, improved understanding of phenotypic and genotypic differences between patients that affect responses to medications has been identified as an important element in individualizing therapy for maximum effectiveness. Of note, most industry-sponsored studies have not addressed either long-term comparative effectiveness or interpatient differences that may affect responses to therapy. As a result, patients with T2DM are currently treated without taking into account individual characteristics that might direct the choice of more effective interventions.

### Real-world evidence of the effectiveness on glycaemic control of early simultaneous versus later sequential initiation of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^116fGps8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Consensus guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who need a greater glucose‐lowering effect than is achieved by their current dual/triple oral diabetes therapy should add an injectable medication. 1 Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) are the preferred first‐choice injectable for most patients, however, insulin is recommended first for people with significant and symptomatic hyperglycaemia (HbA1c ≥ 10%). 1 Furthermore, guidelines currently recommend that if an individual requires further glucose‐lowering therapy despite treatment with a GLP‐1 RA or basal insulin, the other injectable can be promptly added as a treatment intensification. 1, 2

In people with a baseline HbA1c of 9.0% or higher, the likelihood of reaching glycaemic control is even lower than in people with a baseline HbA1c of 7% to less than 8%, or of 8% to less than 9%. 3 In a retrospective, longitudinal, observational study, in those subjects with a baseline HbA1c of 9% or higher, the cumulative probability of achieving an HbA1c of less than 7.0% with either basal insulin or a GLP‐1 RA alone was 15% and 19% at 12 months, and 26% and 28% at 24 months, respectively. 3 By contrast, in those with a baseline HbA1c of 8% to less than 9%, the cumulative probability of achieving an HbA1c of less than 7.0% with either a basal insulin or GLP‐1 RA was 24% and 41% at 12 months, and 36% and 59% at 24 months, respectively, and in those with a baseline HbA1c of 7% to less than 8%, the probability was 34% and 75% at 12 months, and 50% and 91% at 24 months, respectively. 3 Thus, in people with an HbA1c of 9.0% or higher, combined treatment intensification with a GLP‐1 RA and basal insulin should be considered, administered either separately or together in the form of a fixed‐ratio combination. 1, 3

### Long-term cost-effectiveness of two GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Italian setting: liraglutide versus lixisenatide [^115KyGHk]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Maintaining glycemic control is the key treatment target for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may be associated with other favorable treatment characteristics, such as reduction in body weight and reduced risk of hypoglycemia compared with traditional diabetes interventions. The aim of the present analysis was to compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of 2 GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 μg (both administered once daily), in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control with metformin monotherapy in the Italian setting.

Methods

The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project long-term clinical outcomes and subsequent costs (in 2015 Euros) associated with liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 μg treatment in a cohort with baseline characteristics derived from the open-label LIRA-LIXI trial (Efficacy and Safety of Liraglutide Versus Lixisenatide as Add-on to Metformin in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes; NCT01973231) over patient lifetimes from the perspective of a health care payer. Efficacy data were taken from the 26-week end points of the same trial, including changes in glycated hemoglobin, body mass index, serum lipid levels, and hypoglycemic event rates. Outcomes projected included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative incidence and time to onset of diabetes-related complications, and direct medical costs. Outcomes were discounted at 3% annually, and sensitivity analyses were performed.

Findings

Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improved discounted life expectancy (14.07 vs 13.96 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.18 vs 9.06 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) compared with lixisenatide 20 μg. These improvements were mostly attributable to a greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin level with liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 μg, leading to reduced incidence and increased time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Compared with lixisenatide 20 μg, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with increased total costs over patient lifetimes (€41,623 vs €41,380), but this was offset by lower costs of treating diabetes-related complications (€26,682 vs €27,476). Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €2001 per QALY gained versus lixisenatide 20 μg. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per QALY gained, liraglutide 1.8 mg had a probability of 77.2% of being cost-effective.

Implications

Based on long-term projections, liraglutide 1.8 mg is likely to be considered cost-effective compared with lixisenatide 20 μg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in Italy.
