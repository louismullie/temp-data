## Question

If a patient is getting mouth twitching and too much appetite suppressant at 10 mg of adderall xr, and is 10 with anxiety and adhd. Would it be appropriate to stop and switch to atomoxatine or guanfacine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, in a 10-year-old with ADHD and comorbid anxiety who is on Adderall XR 10 mg and now has mouth twitching and marked appetite suppression, it would be appropriate to discontinue the stimulant and switch to atomoxetine or to guanfacine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the current stimulant adverse effects change the risk-benefit calculus. Then, I should verify how comorbid anxiety steers medication choice. Next, I will compare atomoxetine versus guanfacine on efficacy, tics, appetite, sedation, and cardiovascular safety. After that, I should check guideline-concordant pathways for switching off stimulants when they are not tolerated. Then, I will outline age-appropriate dosing and monitoring for atomoxetine and provide a contingency path for guanfacine if needed. Finally, I will address counterarguments and ensure the plan integrates behavioral therapy and safety follow-up, with citations to support each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem: the child has stimulant-associated adverse effects — mouth twitching that could represent a stimulant-induced tic or stereotypy and significant appetite suppression — both of which can undermine adherence and long-term outcomes; anxiety remains comorbid and likely unaddressed by the stimulant monotherapy, which typically does not treat anxiety directly [^1177nf8h]. I should also confirm that tics and other comorbidities are part of standard screening in pediatric ADHD, and indeed AAP guidance emphasizes evaluating for tics and anxiety as coexisting conditions that influence treatment selection [^116XYQVH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether the current stimulant regimen remains appropriate given tolerability. The AAP recommends titrating to maximum benefit with tolerable side effects; here tolerability is clearly poor, so the benefit-risk ratio is unfavorable and supports a change in therapy rather than further dose escalation of the stimulant [^1145xUKk]. The WHO guidance supports using methylphenidate as first-line in many children but also switching away when adverse effects or poor tolerability occur, which aligns conceptually with moving to a non-stimulant when stimulant risks outweigh benefits in this individual.

> Next, I should review how comorbid anxiety informs medication choice. Let me verify the evidence: stimulants can still be effective for ADHD even with anxiety, but they do not treat anxiety per se; atomoxetine, in contrast, has demonstrated benefit and good tolerability in pediatric ADHD with anxiety and has signal for improving anxiety symptoms, although much of the anxiety-specific efficacy data are stronger in adults and should be extrapolated cautiously to pediatrics [^1177nf8h] [^111SrU75]. Given this comorbidity profile, choosing a medication that addresses ADHD while not exacerbating anxiety — and possibly improving it — favors atomoxetine over a stimulant or alpha-2 agonist as a first switch [^1177nf8h].

> I will now examine atomoxetine's profile versus guanfacine in this context. Initially I wrote "no appetite suppression" for atomoxetine — wait, let me verify and correct that; meta-analytic data show atomoxetine can increase headache risk and is also associated with appetite effects in some trials, albeit generally milder than classic stimulants, so "less appetite impact than stimulants" is more accurate than "none" [^111NPK3g]. Atomoxetine does not typically worsen tics and is often chosen when tics or stereotypies emerge on stimulants, making it attractive here given the mouth twitching concern and co-occurring anxiety [^1177nf8h].

> Let me consider guanfacine's profile carefully. Guanfacine extended-release is effective for ADHD, can reduce tics, and often improves sleep, but sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia are meaningful risks requiring cautious titration and vital sign monitoring; rare but serious toxicity, including bradycardia and cardiogenic pulmonary edema after overdose, has been reported, underscoring the need for careful dosing and safety planning in children [^1121hADU] [^116aiznU]. Sedation generally attenuates over time, yet in a child with anxiety and daytime functional demands, this adverse effect burden may be less favorable than atomoxetine as an initial non-stimulant choice, unless tics dominate the clinical picture [^116BVsLn].

> I should confirm whether guidelines support switching to a non-stimulant when stimulant tolerability is poor and comorbid anxiety is salient. AAP emphasizes optimizing benefit with acceptable side effects and integrating behavioral therapy; when adverse effects are limiting, a change in class is reasonable, and ASAM guidance similarly recommends non-stimulants when stimulant risks outweigh benefits, which fits this case [^1145xUKk] [^113V75nV]. Practical psychopharmacology sources also advise switching rather than augmenting when stimulants are poorly tolerated and comorbidity remains problematic, particularly anxiety or tics [^1157D5T2].

> Now, dosing and titration: I need to ensure a weight-based, pediatric-appropriate atomoxetine plan. For a 10-year-old, a conservative start at about 0.5 mg/kg/day with gradual titration to approximately 1.2 mg/kg/day is evidence-based, acknowledging slower onset over 2–4 weeks; maintenance at lower doses may still sustain response after acute stabilization, but the acute target is typically near 1.2 mg/kg/day, with careful monitoring for GI upset, headache, mood changes, and rare hepatic issues and suicidal ideation signals reported with ADHD medications broadly [^113Rw9zv] [^114sALti] [^111NPK3g]. I should double-check the family's expectations about the slower onset and plan earlier follow-up to reinforce adherence while assessing both ADHD and anxiety trajectories using standardized scales [^1113HZak].

> But wait, what if atomoxetine is ineffective or tics become the primary impairment; I should outline a contingency. In that scenario, guanfacine extended-release is a reasonable next option, starting low (for example, 1 mg nightly) and increasing by about 1 mg per week as tolerated while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate; sedation and hypotension are dose-limiting, and a "start low, go slow" approach mitigates early adverse effects and supports adherence [^1121hADU]. Given guanfacine's cardiovascular profile and overdose risks, I need to ensure caregiver education and secure storage, and consider once-daily extended-release to simplify administration and reduce peaks and troughs that can worsen side effects [^116aiznU] [^1121hADU].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic integration, because anxiety is comorbid and contributes to impairment. Parent training and school-based behavioral interventions should accompany medication in school-aged children, and CBT for anxiety can be particularly helpful when ADHD symptoms are at least partially controlled, improving overall functioning and potentially reducing medication burden over time [^113V75nV] [^1177nf8h]. I need to ensure the plan includes measurement-based care for both ADHD and anxiety domains to guide titration and therapy adjustments [^113V75nV].

> I should double-check counterarguments. If Adderall XR were highly effective for ADHD symptoms, could we simply manage side effects and continue it; ongoing appetite suppression and emergent tics often drive discontinuation and poor adherence in real-world care, so even with good symptom control, intolerability justifies a switch, particularly with comorbid anxiety unaddressed by the stimulant [^115rtsGj] [^1177nf8h]. Another concern is that atomoxetine may have a smaller effect size than stimulants; that is true on average, but in anxious comorbidity, atomoxetine's dual benefits can yield better net functioning and tolerability, which is the pivotal outcome in this case [^1177nf8h] [^111SrU75].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final recommendation. Given the stimulant-induced mouth twitching and significant appetite suppression alongside comorbid anxiety, the most evidence-aligned and safety-conscious course is to discontinue the Adderall XR and switch to atomoxetine, titrating thoughtfully and monitoring both ADHD and anxiety outcomes, with guanfacine as a second-line alternative if atomoxetine is ineffective or if tics predominate, all while integrating behavioral interventions and close early follow-up to optimize adherence and safety [^1177nf8h] [^1145xUKk] [^1157D5T2] [^113V75nV] [^1121hADU].

Yes, discontinuing Adderall XR is appropriate in a 10-year-old with ADHD and anxiety who develops **mouth twitching** and **excessive appetite suppression**. These are **concerning stimulant side effects** [^1145xUKk], and continuing the medication risks worsening tics and anxiety [^notfound]. **Atomoxetine** or **guanfacine** are **suitable alternatives**: atomoxetine is effective for ADHD and may help anxiety [^111SrU75], while guanfacine is useful for ADHD with tics or anxiety [^113SRexJ] but can cause sedation and hypotension [^116BVsLn] [^116aiznU]. Slow titration with close monitoring is recommended [^1121hADU], and behavioral therapy should be included [^113V75nV].

## Clinical significance of mouth twitching and appetite suppression

**Mouth twitching** may indicate emerging tics or neuromuscular side effects, which stimulants can precipitate or worsen, especially in children with anxiety or a predisposition to tics [^1138vcH5] [^1151PZ9i]. **Appetite suppression** is common with stimulants, but excessive suppression can impair growth and nutrition, warranting prompt intervention.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

**AAP guidelines** advise titrating to maximum benefit with tolerable side effects; intolerable effects warrant dose reduction, discontinuation, or switching [^1145xUKk]. For **comorbid anxiety**, stimulants can exacerbate anxiety, so consider non-stimulants when anxiety is significant or side effects are problematic.

---

## Alternative medications: atomoxetine and guanfacine

### Atomoxetine

- **Mechanism**: Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

- **Efficacy**: Effective for ADHD and may improve anxiety symptoms [^1177nf8h] [^111SrU75].

- **Side effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, mood changes, rare suicidal ideation; monitor closely.

- **Onset**: 2–4 weeks for initial response; 6–8 weeks for full effect.

---

### Guanfacine

- **Mechanism**: Alpha-2A adrenergic agonist [^116BVsLn].

- **Efficacy**: Effective for ADHD, especially with tics or anxiety; reduces hyperactivity/impulsivity and improves emotional regulation.

- **Side effects**: Sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, headache; monitor blood pressure and heart rate [^116aiznU].

- **Onset**: 1–2 weeks for initial response; 4–6 weeks for full effect.

---

## Clinical considerations for switching medications

- **Tapering**: Gradually taper Adderall XR to avoid withdrawal or rebound symptoms.

- **Washout**: Consider a brief washout before starting the new medication.

- **Titration**: Start low and titrate slowly to minimize side effects [^1121hADU].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess ADHD and anxiety symptoms, side effects, growth, and cardiovascular parameters [^1113HZak].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

**Behavioral therapy**, including parent training and CBT, is recommended alongside medication, especially with comorbid anxiety [^113V75nV] [^1177nf8h]. **School accommodations** should include classroom strategies to support attention and reduce anxiety [^111orm8m].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's side effects and comorbid anxiety, **it is appropriate to stop Adderall XR and switch to atomoxetine or guanfacine**. Atomoxetine is preferred if anxiety is prominent; guanfacine is preferred if tics are present or sedation would be beneficial. Titrate slowly with close monitoring, and include behavioral therapy.

Is it best to replace methylphenidate with guanfacine or use it as adjunct when ADHD is present but tics require treatment as well?

As both methylphenidate and guanfacine are licensed for the treatment of ADHD, they can be helpful and effective treatments for this condition; however, the co-occurrence of tics is unlikely to be treated adequately using methylphenidate. While treating ADHD with methylphenidate can have beneficial effects on associated symptoms that increase tics, such as frustration, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation, there does not appear to be a direct effect on tics.

- **Clinical decision considerations**: The choice to switch to guanfacine or to augment methylphenidate with guanfacine is based on several factors:
	- The relative severity of ADHD and tic symptoms.
	- Whether methylphenidate is effectively managing the ADHD symptoms.
	- Whether methylphenidate appears to be worsening tics.

If methylphenidate is already effective in treating ADHD symptoms but tics worsen and/or require treatment, guanfacine may be added. In cases of mild to moderate ADHD symptoms with co-existing tics, and/or if methylphenidate is only partially effective or poorly tolerated, discontinuation of methylphenidate and switching to guanfacine may be considered. If tics improve with guanfacine alone but ADHD worsens, then methylphenidate may be restarted. In cases of mild-to-moderate ADHD with co-existing tics where both require treatment, there is an argument to suggest that guanfacine monotherapy should be considered as the first-line medication choice rather than methylphenidate.

### Treating ADHD and comorbid anxiety in children: A guide for clinical practice [^1177nf8h]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently comorbid with anxiety disorders, with rates as high as 25% to 50% in children and adolescents. Despite various treatment options for ADHD symptoms, limited research addresses treatment in the context of comorbidity. This article seeks to provide a review of the evidence regarding the treatment of this comorbid population.

Distinct emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms have been observed in this population, suggesting a need for tailored treatment. Despite common concerns about anxiety exacerbation, stimulant medications demonstrate good tolerability and a good response in addressing symptoms. Atomoxetine has also demonstrated some benefit and good tolerability for treating this comorbid population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used as adjunctive treatment for anxiety but require careful monitoring of side effects.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an important treatment to improve anxiety symptoms in the absence of significant ADHD symptoms. Psychosocial interventions are also essential to improve outcomes.

- **Dosing**: Failing to 'start low and go slow': When initiating medication, adverse effects typically occur before therapeutic benefits are seen and can lead to premature discontinuation. This can be avoided by gradual titration; 'starting low and going slow'. For example, initial syncope (due to postural hypotension) can be related to the initiation of clonidine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) and guanfacine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors), and sedation is potentially related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur. Suggested appropriate initial doses are 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg of guanfacine, and 0.5–1 mg of aripiprazole once daily, with titrations using a weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly approach according to the response. The initial dose and titration speed could differ according to body weight, age, and other characteristics of the patient.

- **Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose**: When a medication has been initiated, it is important to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. For clonidine, this relates to an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg, for aripiprazole around 5–10 mg daily, and for guanfacine between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents according to weight. Often, young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects.

Only after all these aspects have been assessed should the prescriber consider: (1) second-line medications such as atomoxetine, which selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter, and guanfacine, which selectively stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, or clonidine, that selectively stimulates alpha-2A adrenergic receptors; (2) augmenting agents like guanfacine or clonidine XR; (3) other agents, under specialist advice or supervision, for which RCTs provide preliminary evidence of efficacy, such as bupropion, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Does the concomitant use of cannabis impact the effectiveness and tolerability of psychostimulants?

The evidence on the effectiveness of psychostimulants in marijuana users and the tolerability of the combination of psychostimulants and marijuana is limited. In an RCT of OROS-methylphenidate and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in youths with substance use disorder — where the majority of cases (66%) involved marijuana — there were no significant differences in terms of efficacy between participants assigned to OROS-methylphenidate plus CBT and those in the placebo plus CBT group when considering the primary outcome (scores on the ADHD-RS completed by the clinicians). However, ADHD-RS scores rated by parents were significantly lower in adolescents treated with OROS-MPH + CBT compared to those in the placebo + CBT arm at 8 and 16 weeks. The tolerability of OROS-methylphenidate was not substantially different compared to what would be expected with OROS-methylphenidate alone. Another RCT showed addictive effects.

### Managing the risks of ADHD treatments [^114sALti]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-established and effective treatment modality. However, ADHD medications are not without side effects. Understanding the prevalence of adverse events and the effective management of risks associated with stimulants and other medications used to treat ADHD is central to broad applicability and effective treatment. This review discusses the literature on the prevalence of adverse events and management strategies employed.

We searched online MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles using several keywords relating to adverse events associated with ADHD medication management. We discuss the relevant data on the significance and prevalence of side effects and adverse events, highlight recent updates in the field, and suggest approaches to clinical management.

### Diagnosing and treating adult ADHD and comorbid conditions [^115HD69i]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Many adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were never diagnosed as children. The impairment caused by untreated ADHD can complicate or even lead to other psychiatric conditions. Accurate diagnosis and efficacious treatment of ADHD in adults, which may include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, are vital to improve their functioning. When a patient has ADHD and a co-occurring condition, the clinician should usually treat the most impairing condition first.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), more specifically with respect to patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend addressing ADHD symptoms as part of the substance use disorder treatment in patients with substance use disorder and co-occurring ADHD. Consider offering the following:

- **Psychostimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.
- **Non-stimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.
- **Behavioral approaches**: Implement behavioral strategies to support treatment.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^116BVsLn]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The α-2-adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine have long been known to assist in treating ADHD. Recently, once-daily extended-release guanfacine has proven effective in both short-term and long-term studies. Sedation is a common side-effect that diminishes over time.

Responses to single-agent treatment for ADHD often fall short of full remission. Recent studies have shown that adding clonidine to methylphenidate, extended-release guanfacine to stimulants, or OROS methylphenidate to atomoxetine improved residual ADHD symptoms and was well tolerated. The FDA recently approved a long-acting form of clonidine for use in monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications.

Treatment of ADHD can alleviate comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and/or aggression. However, in cases where this does not occur, polypharmacy targeting each condition may have added benefits without unacceptable side effects. Examples include the use of atomoxetine or methylphenidate in children being treated for bipolar spectrum disorders or borderline personality disorder, and atypical antipsychotics or valproic acid preparations for children with ADHD and aggression or bipolar disorder. For patients with autistic spectrum disorder, optimal results may require stimulants, SNRIs, antipsychotics, and α-2-agonists.

A number of reports have been published on the use of alternative and complementary medicines in the treatment of ADHD. In a small study, traditional Chinese medicines were found to compare favorably with methylphenidate.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^116XBR6j]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood onset, neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental origins characterized by pervasive behavioral symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity that have been present for at least 6 months and adversely impact daily functioning and development. ADHD is highly prevalent, as research combining data from multiple sources and analyzed using meta-regression reported a worldwide pooled estimate of 5.29–7.2% in children, 2.5% in adults, and approximately 2.8% in older adulthood. Symptoms must persist across the lifespan, although the relative balance and specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics vary across individuals and may change over the course of development. For example, hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly reduce with age.

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in DSM-5 and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th edition beta (ICD-11). While the basic symptom criteria did not change from the revision of DSM-IV, DSM-5 increased the typical age of onset to age 12 (previously age 7). The definition of ADHD was expanded to more accurately characterize the experience of adults, and the number of symptoms required was relaxed for adults (over 17 years), who are now required to have five or more symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months in the inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive domains. For a diagnosis made in childhood, the number of symptoms remained as six, respectively.

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115YcDv3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years, several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed, and recommendations on assessment and treatment were extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality.

Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis. Eleven guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence, and five guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good, reflecting similarities and differences in healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

### Adderall XR [^115HqPhK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years**: The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 with ADHD, who are either initiating treatment for the first time or switching from another medication, is 10 mg/day. If ADHD symptoms are not adequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 20 mg/day after one week.

- **Recommended dosage in adults**: For adults with ADHD who are either beginning treatment or switching from another medication, the recommended dose is 20 mg/day.

- **Dosage in patients with renal impairment**: For adult patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily in the morning. Pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with severe renal impairment are recommended to take 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose for children aged 6 to 12 with severe renal impairment is 20 mg once daily. Adderall XR is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Dosage modification due to drug interactions**: Agents that alter urinary pH can impact excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamines. Acidifying agents (e.g. ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels; therefore, adjust Adderall XR dosage based on clinical response [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Adderall [^112gQuRP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The mode of therapeutic action in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not known. Amphetamines are thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Adderall® tablets contain d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine salts in the ratio of 3:1. Following the administration of a single dose of 10 or 30 mg of Adderall® to healthy volunteers under fasted conditions, peak plasma concentrations occurred approximately 3 hours post-dose for both d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) for d-amphetamine was shorter than the t1/2 of the l-isomer (9.77 to 11 hours vs. 11.5 to 13.8 hours). The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-inf) of d- and l-amphetamine increased approximately three-fold from 10 mg to 30 mg, indicating dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.

The effect of food on the bioavailability of Adderall® has not been studied.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^114pUDUG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

ADHD medication consumption and prevalence of ADHD, geographical region, and income level

In the multivariable analysis, adjusting for yearly GDP per capita, ADHD prevalence, and geographical region, the worldwide trend for an increase in ADHD medication consumption was smaller but remained statistically significant (average annual percentage change: +4.58%; 95% CI, +1.33 to +7.93). When adjusting for these factors, ADHD prevalence (P = 0.22) and geographical region (P = 0.37) were not associated with the trends, while GDP per capita (P < 0.001) was positively associated with the trend in ADHD medication consumption (Table S3, Supplement pp5).

- **ADHD medication consumption by income level**: We also investigated ADHD medication consumption in countries by income levels. The annual average increase of ADHD medication consumption was only significant for high-income countries (n = 39; +11.28%; 95% CI, +9.48% to +13.12%). No significant changes in ADHD consumption rates were observed for upper-middle-income countries (n = 17; +3.23%; 95% CI, −1.88% to 8.61%) nor lower-middle-income countries (n = 8; +16.60%; 95% CI, −7.15% to +46.43%; Table 2). In 2019, the pooled consumption rates of ADHD medication were 6.39 DDD/TID (95% CI, 4.63 to 8.84) in high-income countries, 0.37 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.58) in upper-middle-income countries, and 0.02 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.05) in lower-middle-income countries (Table 2).

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, particularly in relation to pharmacotherapy, the AAP 2019 guidelines suggest offering methylphenidate to pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions do not yield significant improvement. This recommendation is especially relevant when there is a moderate-to-severe disturbance in the patient's functioning. It is important to weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment, especially in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

### Effect of pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on later psychiatric comorbidity: A population-based prospective long-term study [^1151PZ9i]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**:

- **Summary and interpretation of findings**: We found psychiatric comorbidity to be common in individuals with ADHD, with more than half of patients being registered with at least one additional psychiatric diagnosis within 5 years of being diagnosed with ADHD. There were sex differences in most categories of comorbid diagnoses; for example, conduct and tic disorders were more prevalent in males, whereas affective, anxiety, and stress-related disorders were more common in females. LPM showed significant associations between ADHD medication and incidence of several diagnostic categories, although the strength of associations, direction, and consistency during follow-up years varied. In contrast, causal analyses by IV, applicable for eight outcomes and 4 years of follow-up, mainly returned null findings. However, among females, medication nearly eliminated the incidence of reactive disorders over the first 2 years of follow-up. Likewise, for males, medication strongly decreased the incidence of tic disorders in the first 3 years.

Despite comprehensive data, ruling out unobserved confounding when investigating medication effects is challenging. For instance, the positive associations found between medication and CD and tics are unsurprising, as symptom severity is a predictor for both treatment and these outcomes. In the case of tics, positive associations may also be a result of stimulants directly triggering symptoms. A reduction in comorbidity with treatment, like we partially find for SUD and reactive disorders, on the other hand, could be caused by diverse mechanisms.

### Cost-effectiveness of ADHD treatments: Findings from the multimodal treatment study of children with ADHD [^114j8CxK]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a costly public health problem. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study on the cost-effectiveness of the major forms of ADHD treatments used in NIMH's Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA Study).

- **Method**: Five hundred seventy-nine children with ADHD, combined type, ages 7 to 9.9, were assigned to 14 months of medication management, behavioral treatment, both combined, or community care. Services were tallied throughout the study, including medication, health care visits, behavioral treatments, and rental costs. Provider specialty, total time, and number of visits with providers were used to calculate costs, adjusted to FY 2000 dollars with the consumer price index.

- **Results**: Treatment costs varied fourfold, with medication management being the least expensive, followed by behavioral treatment, and then combined treatment. Lower costs of medication treatment were found in the community care group, reflecting the less intensive (and less effective) nature of community-delivered treatment. Medical management was more effective but more costly than community care and more cost-effective than combination treatment and behavioral treatment alone. Under some conditions, combination treatment (medical management and psychotherapy) were somewhat more cost-effective, as demonstrated by lower costs per additional child "normalized" among children with multiple comorbid disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Medical management treatment, although not as effective as combined medical management and behavioral treatment, shows varying cost-effectiveness depending on the conditions and comorbidities present.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: An integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^111Ws6tP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Access to clinical resources for ADHD in adults remains limited in many countries, in part because of the traditional perspective that ADHD is a problem restricted to childhood and due to the lack of approved treatments in many countries. However, awareness of ADHD in adults is growing rapidly, and there is now an urgent need to broaden understanding of the condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of available therapeutic interventions.

Based on evidence, national and international guidelines recommend drug treatments as the first-line of clinical management for ADHD in adults, particularly where the disorder is associated with moderate-to-severe levels of impairment. In the United States, a wide range of pharmacological treatments are approved for use in adults, including atomoxetine (ATX), methylphenidate (MPH), dexmethylphenidate, and various amphetamines. ATX was approved in the EU in May 2013 for initiation in adults to treat ADHD. No other medications are approved in Europe to be initiated for the treatment of ADHD in adults, except in Germany, where a long-acting form of MPH has been approved since 2011.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, are hyperactive, and are impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: In February 2015, we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behavior, and quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Two review authors independently performed all tasks.

### Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and risk for non-affective psychotic disorder: The role of ADHD medication and comorbidity, and sibling comparison [^1124Bm6F]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in childhood. It is unclear whether ADHD increases the risk of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD). The study included a matched cohort, drawn from all individuals born in Sweden between 1987–1991 (n = 548,852). ADHD was defined as an ICD diagnosis and/or prescription of ADHD medication.

- **Medication type and duration**: The study distinguished between stimulants and non-stimulants, and usage duration was categorized as less than 1 year, 1–2 years, and more than or equal to 2 years. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NAPD were calculated and adjusted for confounders, comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and substance abuse.

- **Cohort comparison**: ADHD cases were compared to their unaffected full siblings. A total of 18,139 ADHD cases and 72,437 sex and birth year-matched controls were analyzed. NAPD was more common in ADHD cases than in controls (2.7% versus 0.4%, respectively).

After adjustment for confounders, ADHD cases exhibited a markedly high risk for NAPD (OR: 6.99; 95% CI 6.03–8.10), which attenuated further after adjustment for ASD and substance abuse (OR: 2.57; 95% CI 2.09–3.16). Utilization of ADHD medication increased the risk for NAPD. Specifically, odds ratios for change in odds of NAPD for every 5 extra prescriptions of stimulants were 1.06 (95% CI 1.02–1.10) and for non-stimulants were 1.15 (95% CI 1.01–1.30). There was no association found between the length of medication usage and risk for NAPD. The risk was higher in individuals with ADHD than their unaffected siblings (OR: 2.95; 95% CI 2.07–4.20). Overall, ADHD was associated with an elevated risk for NAPD, which is not entirely explained by shared familial factors. The clinical severity leading to medication use may partially explain the association.

### Electrophysiological and clinical predictors of methylphenidate, guanfacine, and combined treatment outcomes in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^1145U6xP]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The combination of d-methylphenidate and guanfacine (an α-2A agonist) has emerged as a potential alternative to either monotherapy in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it is unclear what predicts response to these treatments. This study is the first to investigate pretreatment clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) profiles as predictors of treatment outcome in children randomized to these different medications.

A total of 181 children with ADHD (aged 7–14 years; 123 boys) completed an 8-week randomized, double-blind, comparative study with d-methylphenidate, guanfacine, or combined treatments. Pretreatment assessments included ratings on ADHD, anxiety, and oppositional behavior. EEG activity from cortical sources localized within midfrontal and midoccipital regions was measured during a spatial working memory task with encoding, maintenance, and retrieval phases. Analyses tested whether pretreatment clinical and EEG measures predicted treatment-related change in ADHD severity.

- **Results**: Higher pretreatment hyperactivity-impulsivity and oppositional symptoms and lower anxiety predicted greater ADHD improvements across all medication groups. Pretreatment event-related midfrontal beta power predicted treatment outcome with combined and monotherapy treatments, albeit in different directions. Weaker beta modulations predicted improvements with combined treatment, whereas stronger modulation during encoding and retrieval predicted improvements with d-methylphenidate and guanfacine, respectively. A multivariate model includi…

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: challenges and opportunities [^115rtsGj]. Current psychiatry reports (2013). Low credibility.

The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuing medication are the family's experience that the medications are not effective or the child is experiencing intolerable adverse effects. The clinician should help the family have realistic expectations for how ADHD medication can help and provide frequent monitoring in the initial stages to address emerging adverse effects, as two important methods to improve medication adherence.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, particularly in patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the following agents for patients with stimulant use disorder and co-occurring ADHD:

- **Topiramate combined with extended-release mixed amphetamine salts**: This combination could be beneficial for managing symptoms.

- **Long-acting amphetamine formulation psychostimulants**: These are suggested for their effectiveness in treatment.

- **Long-acting methylphenidate formulations**: Another viable option for addressing the disorder in this patient group.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: How much responsibility are pediatricians taking [^114XYyYZ]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the most common childhood behavioral condition, is one that pediatricians think they should identify and manage.

- **Objective**: Our goals were to explore the relationships between pediatricians' self-reports of their practice behaviors concerning usually inquiring about and treating/managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and (1) attitudes regarding perceived responsibility for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and (2) personal and practice characteristics.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the 59th Periodic Survey of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the 447 respondents who practice exclusively in general pediatrics. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify attitudes and personal and practice characteristics associated with usually identifying and treating/managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

- **Results**: A total of 67% reported that they usually inquire about and 65% reported that they usually treat/manage attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Factors positively associated with usually inquiring about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adjusted multivariable analyses include perceived high prevalence among patients, attendance at a lecture/conference on child mental health in the past 2 years, having patients who are assigned or can select a specific pediatrician, practicing in suburban communities, practicing for 10 or more years, and being female. Pediatricians' attitudes about responsibility for identification of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were also examined.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115fgAZ5]. Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood, significantly affecting children's academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for evaluating and diagnosing pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA), providing clear and manageable steps for clinicians to implement the recommendations.

With the release of the 2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was revised to the fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Thus, only incremental updates have been made in this guideline revision, including a key action statement related to diagnosing and treating comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist clinicians in applying the guideline recommendations.

Throughout the revision process, numerous systemic barriers were identified that limit pediatric clinicians' ability to adopt the recommendations. In response, the subcommittee developed a companion article available in the supplemental information, focusing on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD.

### Prevalence of pharmacotherapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and prescription stimulant misuse: A national study of us college students [^112Y5zNJ]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Increasing rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pharmacotherapy may simultaneously benefit patients and increase the availability of stimulants for misuse. We measured the association between university-level prevalence of ADHD medication treatment and prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse (PSM) among college students.

- **Design, setting and participants**: This was an observational study using cross-sectional data from the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment III. Data included 395 participating universities between Fall 2019 and Fall 2022. Our sample included 224,469 undergraduates aged 18–25 years (65.2% cisgender female; 58.7% White).

- **Measurements**: Students self-reported any lifetime clinical ADHD diagnosis, past-year ADHD medication treatment, and past-3-month PSM. We defined university-level ADHD medication prevalence as the proportion of included students endorsing past-year ADHD medication treatment. Secondary outcomes included lifetime PSM and moderate- to high-risk alcohol and cannabis use. We also measured university-level depression medication prevalence as a negative control exposure.

- **Findings**: Among the included students, 9.6% reported a lifetime clinical ADHD diagnosis, 5.1% reported past-year medication treatment, and 2.4% reported past-3-month PSM. The prevalence of ADHD medication treatment varied among universities [mean = 5.3%, standard deviation (SD) = 2.8%]. In adjusted models, prevalence of PSM was 7% relatively greater for every 1% increase in university-level medication prevalence.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112DPiQs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically in the management of hyperadrenergic symptoms, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of the following adjunctive agents in patients experiencing a hyperadrenergic state persisting despite appropriate improvement in agitation and neuromuscular hyperactivity after treatment with benzodiazepines or other GABAergic agents:

- **Beta-blocker with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism**: Options include carvedilol or labetalol.

- **Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist**: Use dexmedetomidine for severe symptoms or clonidine for mild-to-moderate symptoms.

- **Other pharmacological options**: Consider using calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators if beta-blockers are contraindicated, while taking into account other clinically relevant signs and symptoms.

### Headache in ADHD as comorbidity and a side effect of medications: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NPK3g]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There is mixed evidence on the association between headache and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as between headache and ADHD medications. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the co-occurrence of headache in children with ADHD, and the effects of ADHD medications on headache. Embase, Medline, and PsycInfo were searched for population-based and clinical studies comparing the prevalence of headache in individuals with ADHD and controls through January 26, 2021. Additionally, the search of a previous systematic review and network meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ADHD medications was updated on June 16, 2020. Trials of amphetamines, atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with a placebo arm and reporting data on headache as an adverse event were included.

Thirteen epidemiological studies and 58 clinical trials were eligible for inclusion.

- **Epidemiological studies**: A significant association between headache and ADHD was found [odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.63–2.46], which remained significant when limited to studies reporting ORs adjusted for possible confounders. The pooled prevalence of headaches in children with ADHD was 26.6%.

- **RCTs**: Three ADHD medications were associated with increased headache during treatment periods compared to placebo: atomoxetine (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.06–1.56), guanfacine (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.12–1.82), and methylphenidate (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.09–1.63).

The summarized evidence suggests that headache is common in children with ADHD.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^1137eDhM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Guanfacine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, was the fastest-growing ADHD medication during the study period. An extended-release formulation of guanfacine was first approved as a treatment for ADHD in the U.S. in 2009, and it has since been approved in several other countries. In contrast, clonidine, another alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist licensed for ADHD as the extended-release formulation, is only available in five countries. Although immediate-release clonidine is used off-label in some countries, our study did not capture this data. There have been far fewer studies examining the safety and tolerability of clonidine and guanfacine than stimulants and atomoxetine.

A recent network meta-analysis reported less precise estimates with broad confidence intervals when evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of these medications, leading to uncertainty when interpreting the results. This highlights the need for larger and longer-term studies that monitor the safety of these recently approved medications. Despite its fast growth, consumption rates of guanfacine remained low compared with stimulants. Following guanfacine, amphetamines had the second-highest annual increase in consumption.

Northern and Western Europe had the highest regional annual increase in amphetamine consumption during the study period. In non-U.S. countries, this was likely due to the recent approval of lisdexamfetamine, an amphetamine prodrug, where previously only the immediate release of dexamfetamine was available. In children and adolescents, amphetamines may have moderately greater efficacy than methylphenidate in ADHD.

### Update on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tic disorders: A review of the current literature [^1138vcH5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Tic disorders impact quality of life, but when they co-occur with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the combined impact significantly affects psychosocial functioning and adds complexity to treatment approaches. A review of the literature supports evidence of a unique relationship between comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tic disorders, emphasizing the intricate phenotype and impairment associated with these co-occurring conditions. The complexity of these symptoms requires careful diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which should be determined by the level of impairment. Treatment may include pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, or a combination of therapies.

To achieve the greatest benefits in improving quality of life and eliminating further comorbidity, an ideal treatment plan would include a comprehensive evaluation. This should involve a hierarchical treatment approach encompassing the education of the child, family, and teachers; careful medication management; and cognitive and behavioral training.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^1175n4LX]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include a national sample comprising both children and adults, a long follow-up period, validated measures of exposure and outcome, and the use of SCCS design. However, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the observational nature, our results cannot establish causal effects of ADHD medication treatment on the outcomes. Unmeasured time-varying confounders, such as lifestyle factors associated with initiating and stopping pharmacotherapy, which may also influence their risk of a certain outcome, could contribute to the observed associations. Second, we cannot rule out exposure misclassification, as some individuals may not have consistently adhered to their prescribed medication, leading to potential underestimation of the true effects. Third, the findings are based on Swedish population data, and generalizations across cultures and countries should be made with caution. Fourth, these outcomes represent only a subset of those associated with ADHD that we would expect ADHD medications to affect. We cannot draw conclusions about ADHD symptoms or other outcomes.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^115DoA7P]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

When treating people with co-occurring ADHD and ASD, practitioners need to be particularly mindful of the following:

- **Limited data and careful approach**: There is limited data on treating patients who have both ADHD and ASD with ADHD medications. A careful and circumspect approach should be taken when treating children and adults with co-occurring ADHD and ASD, in comparison to prescribing for ADHD alone. Prescribers should "start low and go slow", as people with both conditions may be more treatment resistant and more sensitive to the effects of medication, especially regarding side effects. Some individuals may have lower thresholds for experiencing side effects from medication, including sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, tics, mood volatility, and irritability.

- **Clear goals and outcome measures**: In collaboration with the child and parents/carers, clear goals and outcome measures should be specified and monitored to determine the effectiveness of medications prescribed. This includes medication for aggression, anxiety, and sleep problems.

- **Sensory issues and medication form**: Due to sensory issues and physical difficulties, individuals with ASD may experience difficulties with consuming medications in tablet form, such as difficulty swallowing or aversion to tablets. Many medications are available in liquid or sprinkle preparations.

- **Risk of pregnancy and stimulant use**: Young people with ADHD are at higher risk of teenage pregnancy, and it is not advisable to treat pregnant females with stimulant medications. It is important that alternative support is set in place for those who are taken off medication for this reason.

### Second opinions improve ADHD prescribing in a medicaid-insured community population [^114PDk8j]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The appropriate use of psychotropic medications in youths is an important public health concern. In this article, we describe a review process developed to monitor the use of stimulants and atomoxetine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in youths receiving fee-for-service Medicaid services.

- **Method**: Washington State Medicaid developed threshold safety parameters for ADHD medications through a process involving the community. A second opinion was mandated when safety thresholds based on dose, combination therapies, or age were exceeded. Use and cost were compared 2 years before and after the program began.

- **Results**: From May 2006 to April 2008, 5.35% of ADHD prescriptions exceeded safety thresholds, resulting in 1,046 second-opinion reviews. Of those, 538 (51.4%) resulted in a prescription adjustment. Adjustments were made to primary care physician (52%), psychiatrist (50%), nurse practitioner (54%), and physician assistant-written (51%) prescriptions. When the preperiod and postperiod were compared, second opinions reduced ADHD medication at high doses (53%), in combinations (44%), and for patients 5 years of age and younger (23%). The review process resulted in a savings of $1.2 million, with 538 fewer patients exceeding safety thresholds. This was a 10:1 return over administrative costs; however, the overall Medicaid expenditures for ADHD medication still increased because of higher unit costs and the preferential use by clinicians of newer brands entering the market.

- **Conclusions**: A statewide second-opinion process reduced outlier ADHD medication usage, leading to significant cost savings and adjustments in prescribing patterns.

### Strategies for managing the risks associated with ADHD medications [^1171jk86]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

College students with ADHD may need assistance to overcome symptoms that make studying, organizing, completing projects, and managing their time a challenge. In order to properly treat these patients, clinicians must correctly assess ADHD and comorbid conditions using rating scales and educate patients about their responsibility to achieve their treatment goals and properly use and protect their medication. Patients with a history of substance use may require treatment options that are less likely to be misused, such as nonstimulants or long-acting stimulants. Throughout the treatment process, clinicians should continue to monitor symptoms and side effects with regular office visits and random testing, watching for signs of drug misuse.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on its benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases, as well as two trials registers, up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes: ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes: adverse events considered non-serious, general behavior, and quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial.

### ADHD medication discontinuation and persistence across the lifespan: a retrospective observational study using population-based databases [^116gfhk1]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Although often intended for long-term treatment, discontinuation of medication for ADHD is common, yet cross-national estimates of discontinuation are missing due to the absence of standardized measures. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of ADHD treatment discontinuation across the lifespan and to describe similarities and differences across countries to guide clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective observational study using population-based databases from eight countries and one Special Administrative Region: Australia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the United States. We employed a common analytical protocol approach and extracted prescription data to identify new users of ADHD medication. Eligible individuals were aged 3 years or older who had initiated ADHD medication between 2010 and 2020. We estimated treatment discontinuation and persistence in the 5 years after treatment initiation, stratified by age at initiation (children [age 4–11 years], adolescents [age 12–17 years], young adults [age 18–24 years], and adults [age ≥ 25 years]) and sex. Ethnicity data were not available.

- **Findings**: The study included 1,229,972 individuals (735,503 males [60%], 494,469 females [40%]; median age 8–21 years). Across countries, treatment discontinuation 1–5 years after initiation was lowest in children and highest in young adults and adolescents. Within 1 year of initiation, 65% (95% CI 60–70) of children, 47% (43–51) of adolescents, 39% (36–42) of young adults, and 48% (44–52) of adults remained on treatment.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarize literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed, and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently, there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults, and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Low-dose atomoxetine for maintenance treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^113Rw9zv]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Data from acute studies of atomoxetine in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder suggest that a dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg per day is required to attain a maximal symptom response. However, lower doses could be effective during maintenance treatment, which would reduce drug exposure and potential problems related to tolerability during chronic treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 6 to 16 years who had a robust response to an initial acute trial of atomoxetine were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions. They continued treatment for up to 8 months with either the dose to which they had responded acutely (1.2–1.8 mg/kg per day, N = 116) or a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg per day, N = 113). The primary outcome measure was relapse, defined as an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-Administered and Scored total score returning to ≥ 90% of the original baseline value (before acute treatment) for 2 consecutive visits. Mean change in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale total score was assessed as a secondary outcome.

- **Results**: At randomization, symptom severity was low and similar in both groups. At end point, relapse rates did not differ between the groups. The mean change in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale total score from the conclusion of acute treatment to the end point also was not different between groups. Reports of affective lability were higher in the patients in the low-dose group. Additionally, increases in heart rate were observed more frequently in the low-dose group.

### Guanfacine toxic ingestion with subsequent cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^116aiznU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Guanfacine is a central alpha-2 agonist often prescribed for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as tic disorder, with a usual dose of 1–4 mg per day. Due to its sympatholytic mechanism of action, guanfacine can cause autonomic instability and hypotension. It can additionally cause cardiac dysfunction, including symptomatic bradycardias and contractility suppression.

The authors present a case of a 17-year-old male with an ingestion of 80 mg of extended-release guanfacine with delayed onset cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation. Previous pediatric ingestions have generated bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased level of consciousness, responsive to intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and occasionally naloxone. However, cardiogenic pulmonary edema from reduced cardiac contractility is a novel consequence of extended-release guanfacine ingestion. With guanfacine's extended half-life, this unique case underscores the importance of emergency providers' familiarity with this toxidrome as well as the necessity for prolonged, close observation following guanfacine ingestion.

Regarding the medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, specifically in relation to pharmacotherapy, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the offer of methylphenidate to pediatric patients aged ≥ 6 years with ADHD, provided that the following conditions are met:

- **Symptoms cause significant impairment**: Symptoms should cause persistent, significant impairment in at least one domain of functioning (such as education, interpersonal relationships, or occupation) after environmental modifications have been implemented in schools, at home, or in other relevant settings.

- **Assessment and consultation**: A careful assessment of the child or adolescent should be obtained, and methylphenidate prescriptions should be made by, or in consultation with, a specialist.

- **Informed decision-making**: The child or adolescent, and their caregivers, as appropriate, should be informed about treatment options and supported in decision-making.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering arrangements for a parent, health professional, such as a trained school nurse, or other trusted adult to directly observe the administration of the medication, especially if using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder and ADHD. It is also advised to counsel families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the order of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation has additional benefits for sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. Clonidine can also be divided into two or three doses, so children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects often find that a BD or TDS regimen of clonidine suits them better than the once-daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, while guanfacine appears to be more potent at postsynaptic receptors, translating into increased prefrontal activity, impulse control regulation, and improved behavior regulation. Therefore, in cases of comorbidities where behavioral modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines indicate 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, suggesting that a rough equivalency is: Guanfacine 1 mg = Clonidine 100 mcg.

If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective to reduce and withdraw clonidine first, before initiating guanfacine.

### A guide to the treatment of adults with ADHD [^111vGb2F]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

While child and adolescent physicians are familiar with the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), many adult physicians have had little experience with the disorder. It is difficult to develop clinical skills in the management of residual adult manifestations of developmental disorders without clinical experience with their presentation in childhood. Adult patients are increasingly seeking treatment for the symptoms of ADHD, and physicians need practice guidelines.

Adult ADHD often presents differently from childhood ADHD. Because adult ADHD can be comorbid with other disorders and has symptoms similar to those of other disorders, it is important to understand differential diagnoses. Physicians should work with patients to provide feedback about their symptoms, educate them about ADHD, and set treatment goals. Treatment for ADHD in adults should include a medication trial, restructuring of the patient's environment to make it more compatible with the symptoms of ADHD, and ongoing supportive management to address any residual impairment and facilitate functional and developmental improvements.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^116sm6ra]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Safe and effective medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is available and recommended as first-line treatment for the core symptoms of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness. Despite impaired functioning during adolescence, many discontinue medication treatment. For children, healthcare decisions are usually made by the parent; older youth make their own decisions. Beliefs and attitudes may differ widely. Some families understand that ADHD is a neurobiological condition and accept that medication is indicated; for others, such treatment is unacceptable.

Converging evidence describes negative perceptions of the burden associated with medication use as well as concerns about potential short and long-term adverse effects. Indeed, experiences of adverse effects are a frequent explanation for discontinuation among youth. Improving shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, along with monitoring effectiveness, safety, and the new onset of conditions, is likely to optimize outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially in patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend the consideration of using extended-release formulations when initiating psychostimulant medications in patients with co-occurring ADHD. It is advisable to maintain a level of monitoring that corresponds to the risk profile of the given medication and patient. This may include pill counts, drug testing, increased clinical contact, and more frequent prescription drug monitoring program checks. (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation.)

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder:

Switching to equivalent doses of long-acting formulations of methylphenidate

When switching patients from immediate- or extended-release methylphenidate (which acts by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine) to a long-acting methylphenidate formulation, prescribers should avoid a simple equivalence based on the total dose. Rather, they should use the immediate-release component of each formulation as the reference. For instance, when switching from 20 mg of Medikinet XL® (methylphenidate extended release, ER) (50% immediate release: 10 mg) to OROS Concerta XL®, 45 mg of OROS Concerta XL® (22% immediate release: 9.9 mg) would give the equivalent immediate-release dose. Along the same line of reasoning, 40 mg of Equasym XL® (methylphenidate extended release, ER) (30% immediate release: 12 mg) would be equivalent to OROS Concerta XL® 54 mg and Equasym XL® 50 mg to, roughly, OROS Concerta XL® 72 mg.

### Relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder care and medication continuity [^1113HZak]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

To describe the relationships between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) care practices and subsequent medication use, a retrospective cohort study was conducted from a random sample of medical records in 50 pediatric practices. This study included 188 providers and encompassed 1,352 children who began ADHD medication. Independent variables considered were physician behaviors related to medication titration and monitoring of treatment response. The primary outcomes measured were the number of days covered with ADHD medication during the first year of treatment and the time from starting the medication to the first 30-day gap in the medication supply. Multilevel modeling and Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized.

Children had an average medication supply of 217 days within the first year. Half of the children experienced a 30-day gap in medication supply within the first 3 months. Nearly three-fourths of the sample had a medication adjustment in the first year, with the first adjustment typically being a dosage change. The average time to the first medication adjustment exceeded 3 months. A physician's first contact with parents occurred in the first month of treatment for less than half of the cases, averaging over 2 months. Minimal variation related to ADHD care quality was attributable at the physician level. Early titration and early contact were associated with a greater medication supply and continuity of treatment.

In conclusion, earlier physician-delivered ADHD care, such as contacting parents after initiating medication and making medication adjustments, is associated with improved medication supply and treatment continuity.

Treatment of comorbid conditions:

- **ADHD**: Stimulants may also be used for comorbid ADHD in stable/euthymic youth taking optimal doses of anti-manic medications. Adjunctive mixed amphetamine salts (level 3) and methylphenidate (level 3) have both been shown to be effective in addressing attention symptoms and have been well tolerated overall within the RCTs completed at the time of writing, despite theoretical and epidemiological data regarding risks of induction of mood elevation. Although open trials suggest potential benefits of atomoxetine (level 4), the possibility of inducing mania or hypomania remains, suggesting the need for RCTs before clinical recommendations can be made.

- **Substance use**: Comorbid substance use should be treated concurrently to mood symptoms, with inpatient hospital or community residential treatment employed as clinically indicated. A small study suggests that lithium may be effective for reducing substance use in this population (level 3), and FFT should also be considered. Positive trials of N-acetylcysteine for cannabis use disorders among adolescents, smoking, and bipolar depression among adults suggest that N-acetylcysteine may benefit adolescents with comorbid bipolar and SUDs; however, studies examining this hypothesis have not yet been completed (level 4).

7.3 Management of bipolar disorder in older age:

- **Presentation and course**: Because of the aging population in Canada and many countries around the world, knowledge of pertinent issues related to the management of older adults is becoming increasingly important.

### Managing ADHD and comorbidities in adults [^1114NHUC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidity is common in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) across the lifespan, but the nature of these comorbidities differs in adults and adolescents compared with children. The relationships between and boundaries of ADHD and its comorbidities are still imperfectly understood, but the impairment they cause increases with age. Comorbidity may alter the patient's response to ADHD treatment and often requires treatment that is independent of and distinct from the treatment for ADHD.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^11654fXr]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

In the following chapter, we summarize patterns of medication use for ADHD and describe what is known about factors influencing adherence to ADHD medication. Choices about using medication are complex, with more recent work focusing on beliefs and attitudes that shape patient preferences. In addition, effectiveness and adverse effects are important factors, and we review what is known about the differences among commonly used ADHD medications. We end with a discussion of the challenges and related opportunities facing clinicians who work with young people with ADHD. The field remains under-researched, with much more to learn about how to assist greater numbers of young people with ADHD to maximize their potential.

### Atomoxetine treatment in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid social anxiety disorder [^111SrU75]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). High credibility.

This study evaluates the effect of atomoxetine (ATX) on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid social anxiety disorder in adults.

- **Methods**: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving adults with ADHD and social anxiety disorder. Participants received 40–100 mg of ATX (n = 224) or a placebo (n = 218) for 14 weeks, following a 2-week placebo lead-in period. Efficacy measures included the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale: Investigator-Rated: Screening Version (CAARS:Inv:SV), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Clinical Global Impression-Overall-Severity (CGI-O-S), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS), and Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale-29 (AAQoL). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

- **Results**: The mean change in ATX from baseline on the CAARS:Inv:SV Total ADHD Symptoms score (-8.7 ± 10.0) was significantly greater than the placebo mean change (-5.6 ± 10.2) from baseline, with ATX starting at 29.6 ± 10.4 and the placebo at 31.2 ± 9.4 (p < 0.001). On the LSAS Total score, the mean change for ATX (-22.9 ± 25.3) from baseline (85.3 ± 23.6) was significantly better compared to the placebo mean change (-14.4 ± 20.3) from baseline (82.1 ± 21.3; p < 0.001). Visit-wise analysis indicated greater improvement on CAARS:Inv:SV Total ADHD Symptoms and LSAS Total scores for ATX at every study time point (P values ≤ .012). Mean changes in CGI-O-S, STAI-Trait Anxiety scores, and AAQoL Total score were significantly greater for ATX compared to placebo. However, mean change on STAI-State Anxiety scores was comparable between both groups. ATX showed improvement on the SAS compared to placebo.

Clinicians should be aware that most children and adolescents with ADHD will be diagnosed with additional psychiatric disorders, and that pharmacological treatment may have protective effects on some of these comorbidities. However, although we did not find support for any harmful causal effect of ADHD medication on psychiatric comorbidity for patients on the margin of treatment, both benefits and risks should be monitored carefully in the follow-up of individual patients.

Given the increasing use of ADHD medication worldwide and its impact on cardiometabolic risk and protective factors associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is important to understand the association between ADHD medication use and the risk of T2D. A nationwide population study was conducted to investigate this association by examining the cumulative use of ADHD medications and the risk of T2D in adults. Additionally, the study aimed to test whether the association differs by sex and age at the time of T2D diagnosis.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: An integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^112D6xUU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, these data show that ATX has a statistically significant and clinically relevant response in adults with ADHD, which is maintained over six months. Indirect comparison of the results of these integrated analyses of ATX studies with those from studies of stimulants in adults with ADHD suggests that the effect size may be more similar than previously thought. Not all adult patients are likely to respond or are able to tolerate stimulants, and there are additional advantages of ATX in some cases. The low abuse and diversion potential of ATX, possibility of once or twice daily dosing with enduring efficacy, stable effect throughout the day, and demonstrated effectiveness in reducing ADHD symptoms in patients with comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders make ATX an important medication to consider when treating adult patients with ADHD.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use has dramatically increased in youth worldwide. Recent prevalence data in some European countries show expanded use, with one country now matching US usage. Still, substantial geographic differences by country remain regarding the extent to which children receive ADHD medications. These geographic differences raise research questions about which country's prevalence data represent appropriate medication use. We urgently need country-level studies to contribute to our understanding of an appropriate prevalence of ADHD medication use.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: management [^114GHJ8p]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood and often persists into adulthood. ADHD is a neurophysiologic disorder defined in behavioral terms and is associated with significant morbidity in the realms of social and academic success, as well as self-esteem. ADHD is frequently associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders and learning disabilities, which further impede the successful development of individuals with this condition. It is essential that family physicians are knowledgeable about the presentation and diagnosis of ADHD.

Stimulant medications continue to be the mainstay of treatment, although many other medications, such as antidepressants and alpha blockers, serve as helpful adjuvants to therapy. Recommendations for treatment include an individualized, multimodal approach involving parents, teachers, counselors, and the school system. Treatment follow-up includes monitoring the response to medications in various settings, as well as observing side effects. With time and interest, the family physician can develop the skills needed to treat this disorder effectively.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^116DaeJY]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD for both children and adults. Pharmacological approaches to treatment are the most common and typically consist of stimulant medications such as methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, mixed amphetamine salts, and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX). However, non-stimulants such as atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine have also been found to be efficacious in treating ADHD. Many of the drugs discussed in this section are currently licensed for use in North America, but not in other countries. In addition to medication, there are also non-pharmacological treatments available.

- **Treatment for children**: This includes parent and teacher training in effective behavior-management techniques aimed at reducing the problem behaviors associated with ADHD.

- **CBT for adults**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a skill-based approach commonly used for adults with ADHD, and there are some preliminary data showing its efficacy.

- **Stimulants**: For most patients with ADHD, stimulants remain the first choice for medication management, as meta-analyses of existing research have shown that they are more efficacious than non-stimulant medications. Physicians may choose from various delivery mechanisms for these stimulants, including liquid, sprinkle, tablet, capsule, or patch forms. Additionally, there are options available from active isomers, mixtures of active and less active isomers, or pro-drug formulations. These formulations come in immediate-release, intermediate-release, or extended-release forms, providing a range of choices for both the methylphenidate and amphetamine families.
