## Question

A 15-year-old girl presents to your clinic with a 9-month history of painful menstrual cramps that began about 8 months after her menarche. The pain typically starts on the first day of her period and lasts for 2–3 days. She denies any abnormal vaginal discharge, intermenstrual bleeding, or dyspareunia. She has no significant past medical history. On examination, her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her external genitalia appear normal. You offer her empiric treatment with NSAIDs and combined oral contraceptives. After three months, she returns, reporting no improvement in her symptoms. She continues to have severe pain with each period, which is interfering with her school attendance.

Based on current expert guidelines, what is the next appropriate step in the evaluation or management of this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next appropriate step in the evaluation or management of a 15-year-old with severe, refractory dysmenorrhea after NSAIDs and combined oral contraceptives have failed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the initial diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea was appropriate and whether the treatment trial was adequate. Then, I should verify when to pivot from primary to secondary dysmenorrhea and what the most likely secondary cause is in adolescents. Next, I will review the recommended diagnostic workup, including pelvic examination and imaging. After that, I need to consider alternative medical therapies if endometriosis is suspected. Finally, I should outline indications for referral and surgical evaluation, and ensure I am not missing red flags or contraindications to ongoing therapy.

> Let me first confirm the initial diagnosis and treatment appropriateness. The history of pain starting within 6–12 months of menarche, confined to menses, with a normal exam and no red flags, supports primary dysmenorrhea, and empiric NSAIDs with hormonal suppression is guideline-concordant first-line therapy, so the initial approach was appropriate [^45dd2052] [^d8585717] [^4f57240e].

> Wait, let me verify the adequacy of the treatment trial. NSAIDs are most effective when started 1–2 days before menses and continued through the first 2–3 days, and combined hormonal contraceptives often require 2–3 cycles to achieve maximal benefit. Three months is a reasonable minimum trial, but I should confirm adherence, dosing, and timing before labeling the case as refractory [^02bcb5f2] [^770dfa51].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite NSAIDs and hormonal therapy in an adolescent should trigger evaluation for secondary causes, and endometriosis is the leading secondary etiology in this age group. Importantly, at least two-thirds of adolescents with dysmenorrhea unresponsive to these therapies will have endometriosis at laparoscopy, so the pretest probability is high here [^be498869] [^58f75704] [^fe678efa].

> I need to check the recommended next steps in evaluation. Guidelines advise obtaining a pelvic examination and pelvic ultrasonography when first-line therapy fails or when secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected. Ultrasound is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to assess for obstructive anomalies, endometriomas, and other pelvic pathology, and it should be considered even if the pelvic exam is normal [^11f50930] [^30cd0775] [^50e95ad3].

> Let me consider alternative medical options while awaiting imaging. If endometriosis is suspected, continuous or extended-regimen combined hormonal contraception, progestin-only therapy, or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system are reasonable next-line choices. Continuous norethindrone acetate 5 mg daily has evidence for dysmenorrhea control, and LNG-IUS is particularly effective for endometriosis-associated pain, though I should counsel on bleeding changes and ensure there is no contraindication to progestin therapy [^f8bb352b] [^368016e2] [^9d59cd50].

> But wait, what if symptoms remain refractory after optimized medical therapy and negative imaging? I should confirm indications for surgical evaluation. Diagnostic laparoscopy is appropriate in adolescents with suspected endometriosis when imaging is negative and medical therapy fails, with the added benefit of simultaneous diagnosis and treatment. If laparoscopy is pursued, placing an LNG-IUS at the time of surgery can reduce insertion pain and provide ongoing suppression [^5c96c025] [^2788126a] [^d6e56033].

> I should double-check that I am not missing red flags or contraindications. The absence of intermenstrual bleeding, dyspareunia, or abnormal discharge makes infection, obstructive anomalies, and fibroids less likely, but ultrasound can still identify subtle Müllerian anomalies or endometriomas. I also need to ensure we avoid long-term opioids, which are not recommended for dysmenorrhea or adolescent endometriosis outside specialized pain programs [^11f50930] [^02bcb5f2] [^eb7f9c73].

> Next, I should review the immediate action plan. I will obtain a pelvic examination now if not previously done, order a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for secondary causes, and reassess adherence and dosing of NSAIDs and combined oral contraceptives. If imaging is negative and pain persists, I will escalate to continuous combined hormonal therapy, a progestin-only method, or LNG-IUS, and if still refractory after 3–6 months of optimized therapy, refer to pediatric and adolescent gynecology for consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy [^11f50930] [^30cd0775] [^d8585717].

---

The next best step is to **evaluate for secondary causes**, with **pelvic ultrasound as first-line imaging** [^11f50930] and a **pelvic exam if indicated** [^9ef5fd6f]. Endometriosis is the **most common cause** of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents with persistent pain despite NSAIDs and hormonal therapy [^be498869], and ultrasound can identify structural anomalies or endometriomas [^11f50930]. If ultrasound is normal and pain persists, **refer to pediatric gynecology** for consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy [^5c96c025] and advanced medical therapy [^d3e35b80].

---

## Indications for further evaluation

According to ACOG, adolescents who fail to respond to **first-line therapy** (NSAIDs and hormonal contraceptives) within 3–6 months should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea [^d8585717]. Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain due to identifiable pelvic pathology, such as endometriosis, congenital anomalies, or pelvic inflammatory disease [^80190be0].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Pelvic examination

A pelvic examination is **not routinely required** in adolescents with presumed primary dysmenorrhea [^e752e6a9]; however, it should be considered if:

- First-line therapy fails [^9ef5fd6f].
- Symptoms suggest secondary dysmenorrhea (e.g. abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, or pelvic masses) [^e752e6a9].
- The patient is sexually active or has a history of pelvic infection [^e752e6a9].

---

### Pelvic ultrasound

Pelvic ultrasound is the **first-line imaging modality** for evaluating secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents [^11f50930]. It is non-invasive, well-tolerated, and can identify:

- Endometriomas (ovarian cysts associated with endometriosis) [^11f50930].
- Congenital anomalies (e.g. müllerian anomalies, obstructive reproductive tract anomalies) [^11f50930].
- Other pelvic masses or structural abnormalities [^11f50930].

Ultrasound should be considered regardless of findings on pelvic examination, as many adolescents with endometriosis or other pelvic pathology may have a normal physical examination [^11f50930].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation is **not routinely indicated** but may be considered based on clinical suspicion:

- **Pregnancy test**: If the patient is sexually active or has a history of irregular cycles [^193dff99].
- **STI screening**: If there is a history of sexual activity or symptoms suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease [^864e5c97].
- **CBC**: If there is suspicion of anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding [^b192624b].

---

## Most likely diagnosis: endometriosis

Endometriosis is the **leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea** in adolescents, particularly in those with persistent pain despite NSAIDs and hormonal therapy [^be498869]. Prevalence is significant, with studies indicating that at least two-thirds of adolescent girls with chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhea unresponsive to hormonal therapies and NSAIDs are diagnosed with endometriosis at laparoscopy [^58f75704]. Adolescent endometriosis often presents differently than in adults, with lesions typically appearing clear or red and being more difficult to identify [^a6589510].

---

## Management of suspected endometriosis

If endometriosis is suspected, **management should include**:

- **Hormonal suppression**: Continuous or extended-use combined hormonal contraceptives, progestin-only therapy (e.g. norethindrone acetate), or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists with add-back therapy [^d3e35b80] [^f8bb352b].
- **NSAIDs**: Continued use for pain relief [^d3e35b80].
- **Laparoscopy**: Consider diagnostic laparoscopy if medical therapy fails or if diagnosis remains uncertain [^5c96c025].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Given the patient's persistent dysmenorrhea despite NSAIDs and combined oral contraceptives, the next best step is to **evaluate for secondary causes**, starting with a **pelvic ultrasound** [^11f50930] and a **pelvic examination** if indicated [^9ef5fd6f]. Endometriosis is the most likely diagnosis, and management should include hormonal suppression and consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy if medical therapy fails [^5c96c025].

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults: etiology and management [^6f8cf215]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic complaint among adolescent and young adult females. Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults is usually primary (functional), and is associated with normal ovulatory cycles and with no pelvic pathology. In approximately 10% of adolescents and young adults with severe dysmenorrhea symptoms, pelvic abnormalities such as endometriosis or uterine anomalies may be found. Potent prostaglandins and potent leukotrienes play an important role in generating dysmenorrhea symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the most common pharmacologic treatment for dysmenorrhea. Adolescents and young adults with symptoms that do not respond to treatment with NSAIDs for 3 menstrual periods should be offered combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptive pills for 3 menstrual cycles. Adolescents and young adults with dysmenorrhea who do not respond to this treatment should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. The care provider's role is to explain about pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea to every adolescent and young adult female, address any concern that the patient has about her menstrual period, and review effective treatment options for dysmenorrhea with the patient.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^0117d1ee]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this narrative review, we have highlighted the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options for primary dysmenorrhea. NSAIDs and hormonal contraception are first-line treatments for primary dysmenorrhea. Surgical interventions should be reserved for women who fail medical management or for women who desire definitive treatment. While many non-pharmacologic interventions have minimal data behind their use, low-risk behaviors should be encouraged. Further research with sufficient sample sizes and high-quality methodology is needed measuring the socioeconomic impact primary dysmenorrhea has on the healthcare system. Additionally, given that the treatment of dysmenorrhea is typically multi-modal, further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment methods.

"If a trial of NSAIDs does not provide adequate relief of dysmenorrhea symptoms, consideration should be given to use of hormonal agents, which also are ideally suited as a first-line option". "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be continued or added to hormonal therapy as needed". Options with reported benefit include "combined oral contraceptives, the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring, the single-rod contraceptive progestin implant, intramuscular or subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, and LNG-IUS".

Although nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can alleviate menstrual pain, about 18% of women with dysmenorrhea are unresponsive, leaving them and their physicians to pursue less well-studied strategies. The goal of this review is to provide a background for treating menstrual pain when first-line options fail. Research on menstrual pain and failure of similar drugs in the antiplatelet category suggested potential mechanisms underlying nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug resistance. Based on these mechanisms, alternative options may be helpful for refractory cases. This review also identifies key pathways in need of further study to optimize menstrual pain treatment.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Initial management of suspected primary dysmenorrhea advises that when the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated, and most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal suppression, or both. If a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence, and during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered.

---

### Dysmenorrhea [^193dff99]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is common and usually independent of, rather than secondary to, pelvic pathology. Dysmenorrhea occurs in 50% to 90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age and is a leading cause of absenteeism. Secondary dysmenorrhea as a result of endometriosis, pelvic anatomic abnormalities, or infection may present with progressive worsening of pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, or dyspareunia. Initial workup should include a menstrual history and pregnancy test for patients who are sexually active. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives are first-line medical options that may be used independently or in combination. Because most progestin or estrogen-progestin combinations are effective, secondary indications, such as contraception, should be considered. Good evidence supports the effectiveness of some nonpharmacologic options, including exercise, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, heat therapy, and self-acupressure. If secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapies may be effective, but further workup should include pelvic examination and ultrasonography. Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist may be warranted for further evaluation and treatment.

### Adolescent endometriosis [^5b96d42e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a cause of chronic, pelvic pain in adolescents. Lack of response to NSAIDS and OCPs should prompt further investigation and subsequent treatment. The goal of therapy is to minimize pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea primarily through long-term, medical therapy. Surgical intervention is principally indicated to establish a diagnosis. The poor response to surgical therapy negates the need for repetitive or radical surgery. Much patience and care should be directed toward these patients to provide them with an understanding of their disease and to help enhance the quality of their life.

### Stepwise approach to the management of endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^de978202]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the cost effectiveness of sequential medical and surgical therapy for the treatment of endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea.

Methods

A cost-effectiveness model was created to compare three stepwise medical and surgical treatment strategies compared with immediate surgical management for dysmenorrhea using a health care payor perspective. A theoretical study cohort was derived from the estimated number of reproductive age (18–45) women in the United States with endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea. The treatment strategies modeled were: strategy 1) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) followed by surgery; strategy 2) NSAIDs, then short-acting reversible contraceptives or long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) followed by surgery; strategy 3) NSAIDs, then a short-acting reversible contraceptive or LARC, then a LARC or gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulator followed by surgery; strategy 4) proceeding directly to surgery. Probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived from the literature. Outcomes included cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

In this theoretical cohort of 4,817,894 women with endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea, all medical and surgical treatment strategies were cost effective at a standard willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained when compared with surgery alone. Strategy 2 was associated with the lowest cost per QALY gained ($1,155). Requiring a trial of a third medication before surgery would cost an additional $257 million, compared with proceeding to surgery after failing two medical treatments. The probability of improvement with surgery would need to exceed 83% for this to be the preferred first-line approach.

Conclusion

All sequential medical and surgical management strategies for endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea were cost effective when compared with surgery alone. A trial of hormonal management after NSAIDs, before proceeding to surgery, may provide cost savings. Delaying surgical management in an individual with pain refractory to more than three medications may decrease quality of life and increase cost.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^02bcb5f2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG adolescent primary dysmenorrhea — nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line and patient education and dosing timing are emphasized, while opioids should not be used. "When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated". "Because NSAIDs interrupt cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin production, they are considered a first-line treatment option", and "NSAIDs are significantly better than placebo in providing pain relief from primary dysmenorrhea". "Obstetrician–gynecologists should recommend NSAID dosage on an individual basis", with use "most effective when started 1–2 days before the onset of menses and continued through the first 2–3 days of bleeding", and taking with food and fluids may mitigate adverse effects. If inadequate relief occurs, "a different agent can be tried". Education is key because "patient education is essential" and "a brief educational intervention can result in enhanced medication knowledge and a decrease in pain associated with dysmenorrhea". Given risks, "opioids (including tramadol) should not be used as a treatment for dysmenorrhea", as dependence can occur "for as few as 7 days", hyperalgesia can result from repeated use, and these effects "make opioids an inappropriate treatment for adolescents with dysmenorrhea".

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^a6589510]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Endometriosis in adolescents notes that endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents and should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify, endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated, and the goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician–gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### Dysmenorrhea [^a013b88d]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dysmenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation, characterized by cramping lower abdominal pain that occurs before or during menstruation, and is classified as either primary or secondary based on underlying etiology.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of identifiable pelvic pathology and is associated with increased endometrial production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2α, and leukotrienes, which induce intense uterine contractions, ischemia, and pain. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhea results from structural or inflammatory pelvic disorders that contribute to pain through mechanisms such as nerve infiltration, chronic inflammation, or distortion of pelvic anatomy. Symptom severity in both forms often correlates with prostaglandin levels and other local inflammatory mediators.
- **Epidemiology**: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent and commonly undertreated, affecting 50–90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. It is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism and significantly impacts QoL.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include early menarche, long or heavy menstrual cycles, smoking, alcohol use, high stress levels, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and a family history of dysmenorrhea. Increasing age and increasing parity are protective factors. Secondary dysmenorrhea is associated with identifiable pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, Müllerian anomalies, pelvic adhesions, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
- **Disease course**: Symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea typically begin within a few years of menarche, presenting as cramping suprapubic pain that peaks during the first 1–2 days of menstruation and is often accompanied by nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, and headache. Severe cases may also cause sleep disturbances. Secondary dysmenorrhea tends to present later in reproductive life with progressive or atypical pain patterns and is generally less responsive to first-line therapies. Both forms can become chronic and significantly impact QoL, academic performance, and work productivity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Primary dysmenorrhea often improves with age, childbirth, or hormonal therapy and generally responds well to NSAIDs or hormonal contraceptives. Secondary dysmenorrhea may persist or worsen without appropriate treatment, especially in conditions like endometriosis or adenomyosis. Unless adequately treated and followed, dysmenorrhea may progress to a chronic pain syndrome with significant long-term consequences.

### Primary dysmenorrhea: diagnosis and therapy [^2cb4a852]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as pain during the menstrual cycle in the absence of an identifiable cause. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Dysmenorrhea can negatively affect a woman's quality of life and interfere with daily activities. The pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea is likely a result of the cyclooxygenase pathway producing increased prostanoids, particularly prostaglandins (PGs). The increased PGs cause uterine contractions that restrict blood flow and lead to the production of anaerobic metabolites that stimulate pain receptors. Women with a history typical for primary dysmenorrhea can initiate empiric treatment without additional testing. Shared decision making is key to effective management of dysmenorrhea to maximize patient compliance and satisfaction. After a discussion of their risks and benefits, extremely effective empiric therapies are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and contraceptive hormonal therapy. Other treatments for primary dysmenorrhea can be employed solely or in combination with other modalities, but the literature supporting their use is not as convincing. The physician should initiate an evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea if the patient does not report improved symptomatology after being compliant with their medical regimen.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^ef9693c3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding management — across estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), progestin-only pills (POPs), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, implants, and progestin-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs) — includes counseling and short-course adjustments: for estrogen-containing OCPs, counsel that breakthrough bleeding (BTB) decreases with each successive cycle, and with shared decision making, can consider cyclic cycles for 3–6 months then transition to extended cycles; a hormone-free interval for 3–4 consecutive days may be used; for oral progestins, counsel patients to take POPs at the exact same time each day and consider tapers of 0.7 mg daily for 7 days followed by a return to traditional dosing; for depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, options include NSAIDs (5–7 days of treatment) or, if medically eligible, hormonal treatment with combined OCPs or estrogen (10–20 days of treatment), and administration at more frequent intervals may increase rates of amenorrhea; for implants, options include NSAIDs (5–7 days of treatment) and hormonal treatment with combined OCPs or estrogen (10–20 days of treatment); consider POPs for those with contraindications to estrogen; for progestin-containing IUDs, those using lower-dose devices experience more bleeding or spotting days than those using a levonorgestrel-releasing 52-mg IUD, and expert opinion supports a trial of NSAIDs, doxycycline, POPs, or continuous OCP use.

Figure 1. Approach to the adolescent with dysmenorrhea — When history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment includes Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, Hormonal therapies, and Nonpharmacologic strategies (Exercise, Smoking cessation, Modification of diet, Acupuncture). If the patient responds to therapy, continue treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. If the patient does not respond to therapy or symptoms or history are suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea, consider secondary dysmenorrhea and proceed to evaluation: consider pelvic examination and pelvic ultrasonography. With positive findings, treat etiology of secondary dysmenorrhea (eg, relieve obstruction). With negative findings, consider multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain evaluation, consider laparoscopy, and consider endometriosis.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^89cc8d28]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of endometriosis in adolescents — endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated, and goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility; there is no cure nor a single best treatment option, so therapy must be individualized and obstetrician–gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family; endometriosis is described as an inflammatory-mediated estrogen-dependent disorder in which estrogen from the ovaries and local aromatase activity promotes increased prostaglandin production resulting in pain; the recommended treatment is conservative surgical therapy for diagnosis and treatment combined with ongoing suppressive medical therapies to prevent endometrial proliferation.

Dysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absence in adolescent girls and a common problem in women of reproductive age. Risk factors for dysmenorrhea include nulliparity, heavy menstrual flow, smoking, and depression. Empiric therapy can be initiated based on a typical history of painful menses and a negative physical examination. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial therapy of choice in patients with presumptive primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives and depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate also may be considered. If pain relief is insufficient, prolonged-cycle oral contraceptives or intravaginal use of oral contraceptive pills can be considered. In women who do not desire hormonal contraception, there is some evidence of benefit with the use of topical heat; the Japanese herbal remedy toki-shakuyaku-san; thiamine, vitamin E, and fish oil supplements; a low-fat vegetarian diet; and acupressure. If dysmenorrhea remains uncontrolled with any of these approaches, pelvic ultrasonography should be performed and referral for laparoscopy should be considered to rule out secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. In patients with severe refractory primary dysmenorrhea, additional safe alternatives for women who want to conceive include transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, acupuncture, nifedipine, and terbutaline. Otherwise, the use of danazol or leuprolide may be considered and, rarely, hysterectomy. The effectiveness of surgical interruption of the pelvic nerve pathways has not been established.

### A treatment algorithm for familial mediterranean fever patients with menstruation-associated attacks [^e1b052f3]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

We have proposed a management algorithm for patients with menstruation-associated FMF attacks in this study, for the first time in the literature (Fig. 1). If the patient is diagnosed with the occurrence of menstruation-associated attacks, initiating colchicine treatment will be the first reasonable step. On the other hand, if the patient is already on colchicine, checking the colchicine compliance and trying to improve adherence is essential. When a colchicine-compliant patient is experiencing menstruation-associated attacks, it would be important to clarify whether the patient is also having attacks in times other than the perimenstrual periods. If the patient is only having menstruation-associated attacks in the absence of subclinical inflammation, on-demand therapies could be introduced, which means administering the treatment (NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, or anakinra) for 3–5 days, starting on the first day of menstrual bleeding. On-demand NSAIDs could be the first option, followed by on-demand anakinra. On-demand glucocorticoids could also be tried depending on the balance of risk and benefit, which changes according to the patient's attack frequency. When on-demand therapies do not work or if the patient has a high attack frequency (> 1 attack per month) and attacks also outside the perimenstrual period or subclinical inflammation, increasing the colchicine dose, switching from coated to compressed colchicine tablets or initiating anti-IL-1 drugs should be considered. Oral contraceptives could also be considered after a gynaecologic examination, especially in patients who have other menstrual cycle problems such as dysmenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles. In our study, oral contraceptives were used by two patients and these were not effective for controlling menstruation-associated attacks.

Increasing colchicine dose and oral contraceptives were reported as beneficial interventions in menstruation-associated FMF before. Akar et al. reported that NSAIDs did not improve the symptoms of menstruation-associated attacks. However, in on-demand use, the patients start taking NSAIDs on the first day of menstrual bleeding, before the onset of the FMF attack. This strategy aborted FMF attacks in four patients in our study. An intermittent use of colchicine during only menstruation was also tried in a few patients in the literature and the authors reported symptomatic relief. However, considering the possibility of subclinical inflammation in FMF, a daily continuous colchicine treatment is recommended for all FMF patients. Increasing the colchicine dose only during menstruation is also an acknowledged strategy in the literature, which may work in some patients.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^11f50930]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected secondary dysmenorrhea — Most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal suppression, or both; however, patients who present with symptoms suggesting secondary dysmenorrhea or who fail empiric treatment require further evaluation. Additionally, if a patient has pain for 3–6 months, a more comprehensive evaluation of chronic pelvic pain should be performed with a history and focused physical examination to assess potential gastroenterologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial etiologies of pain. A pelvic examination to evaluate potential etiologies of secondary dysmenorrhea should be considered, and with education and support many adolescents who are not sexually active are able to tolerate a pelvic examination. Pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea, and ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to identify potential etiologies, including obstructive reproductive tract anomalies, uterine myomas, and adnexal masses with endometriomas.

### Combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) as treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea [^794c904a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps and is a common gynaecological complaint. Research as early as 1937 has shown that dysmenorrhoea responds favourably to ovulation inhibition, and that the synthetic hormones in the combined oral contraceptive pill can be used to treat dysmenorrhoea. These hormones act by suppressing ovulation and lessening the endometrial lining of the uterus. Therefore, menstrual fluid volume decreases along with the amount of prostaglandins produced, in turn effectively reducing dysmenorrhoea by decreasing uterine motility, and thus uterine cramping. The use of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) has been advocated as a treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea since their introduction for general use in 1960. There is evidence from epidemiological studies of general populations that combined OCPs can effectively treat dysmenorrhoea.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to determine the efficacy of combined oral contraceptive pills for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of controlled trials, CCTR, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL, were performed. Attempts were also made to identify trials from the National Research Register, the Clinical Trials Register and the citation lists of review articles and included trials.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were RCTs that compared all types of combined oral contraceptives (oestrogen/progestogen) with other combined oral contraceptives, placebo, no treatment, or treatment with nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea. The main outcome measures were pain relief, adverse effects, additional analgesics required and time off work or school.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine trials were identified that appeared to fulfil the initial criteria for this review. Of these nine trials, four were excluded, two at further investigation revealed a lack of randomisation and two included combined oral contraceptives that are now discontinued due to very high oestrogen content. Of the remaining five RCTs, four were included in the meta-analysis (Buttram 1969; Cullberg 1972; GPRG 1968; Nakano 1971). The results of the other trial (Matthews 1968) were included in the text of the review for discussion because data were not available in a form that allowed it to be combined in a meta-analysis. Data for all outcomes were in dichotomous form and the Peto odds ratio was used in the meta-analysis for all comparisons.

Main Results

Combined OCPs with medium dose oestrogen (> 35 mcg) and 1st/2nd generation progestogens were shown to be more effective than placebo for pain relief. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the results from different studies and when data were analysed with a random effects model, the confidence intervals increased and the results became statistically non-significant. For the other outcomes, there was a significant difference in favour of OCPs when compared to placebo for the outcome of absence from work or school, and there was no difference between the treatment groups and placebo in the number of adverse effects experienced.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No conclusions can be made about the efficacy of commonly used modern lower dose combined oral contraceptives for dysmenorrhoea. While there is some evidence from four RCTs that combined OCPs with medium dose oestrogen and 1st/2nd generation progestogens are more effective than placebo it should be emphasised that the studies were small, of poor quality and all included much higher doses of hormones that those commonly prescribed today. Therefore no recommendations can be made regarding the efficacy of modern combined oral contraceptives.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^b59b4b3b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^2788126a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescent endometriosis — diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment considerations include that if a patient is undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy for dysmenorrhea or chronic pain, or both, consideration should be given to placing a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) at the time of laparoscopy to minimize the pain of insertion. Recommended treatment for endometriosis in adolescents is conservative surgical therapy for diagnosis and treatment combined with ongoing suppressive medical therapies to prevent endometrial proliferation. For pain refractory to conservative surgical therapy and suppressive hormonal therapy, patients often benefit from at least 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy with add-back medicine. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be the mainstay of pain relief for adolescents with endometriosis, and adolescents should not be prescribed narcotics long-term to manage endometriosis outside of a specialized pain management team. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman, and in adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^25405f3b]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea is the most common pathology faced by women of childbearing age, regardless of race, age, and/or economic status. The worldwide prevalence of dysmenorrhea ranges from 45% to 95% in females of reproductive age and 2 to 29% of women experience severe pain. Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful uterine cramping associated with menstruation. It has been both underdiagnosed and inadequately treated and can be classified as primary or secondary dysmenorrhea depending on the etiology.

Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful cramping in the lower abdomen during the menstrual cycle that begins before or at the onset of menses in the absence of an organic cause. Pain with primary dysmenorrhea has a specific cyclic pattern — it is usually most severe during the first day of menses and can last for several days. Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain associated with an underlying pelvic pathology. This pathology can include endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, adenomyosis, fibroids, endometrial polyps, ovarian cysts, congenital anomalies, and complications from intrauterine contraceptive devices. Pain caused by secondary dysmenorrhea is typically more diffuse, constant and may not always sync with the onset of menses.

Although dysmenorrhea is widely prevalent among women of childbearing age, many women do not seek treatment. Furthermore, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are well equipped to diagnose dysmenorrhea, and subsequently educate and treat patients in order to improve their quality of life. Here we present an up-to-date, evidence-based perspective on this topic. The goal of this narrative is to educate providers on first-line pharmacologic treatments for dysmenorrhea and discuss the evidence behind non-pharmacologic interventions. We also aim to review the role of surgical interventions in refractory disease.

Pathophysiology

While the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea is not completely understood; current research suggests that prostaglandins play a major role. During menses, endometrial sloughing releases prostaglandins, stimulating myometrial contraction and vasoconstriction. This subsequently causes uterine ischemia, anaerobic metabolite formation, and hypersensitization of nociceptive fibers. Interestingly, women with dysmenorrhea have higher levels of prostaglandin E2 and F2 in menstrual fluid, further supporting the role of prostaglandins in the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea. Additionally, uterine artery dopplers are elevated during menses in women with dysmenorrhea, most likely due to higher resistance blood flow through the uterine arteries.

Pharmacological Treatment

### Scientific knowledge graph of dysmenorrhea: a bibliometric analysis from 2001 to 2021 [^4a5896a5]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea has a direct negative impact on the quality of life of the patients, especially during menstruation. Menstrual pain is not only a sensory experience, but also affects the emotional state of the patients, causing psychological distress or emotional problems; and these psychological stresses can in turn exacerbate the level of pain in dysmenorrhea patients. Also, depression and anxiety are closely associated with menstrual pain. Dysmenorrhea can also have an impact on sleep. Indeed, women who experience severe PDM may have worse sleep quality.

The most prescribed medications for the treatment of dysmenorrhea are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are prostaglandin synthase inhibitors. The efficacy of various formulations of NSAIDs for dysmenorrhea is comparable, with 64–100% of women experiencing successful pain relief. However, 15% of women of all ages with dysmenorrhea do not respond to or are intolerant of PG inhibitors. For these women, oral contraceptives are often used as second-line therapy. The synthetic hormones in oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and reduce endometrial thickness, thereby reducing menstrual flow, PG synthesis, and dysmenorrhea. Other current treatments for dysmenorrhea include percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transdermal nitroglycerin patches, and surgical interventions such as laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation procedures. However, these treatments are not considered effective enough to be widely used in clinical practice. Many women also use other non-pharmacologic therapies to manage menstrual discomfort, including the use of heating pads to relieve cramps, extra bed rest or sleep, physical activity, and so on. However, most non-pharmacologic therapies have been reported to have an average effectiveness rate of less than 40%. The wide variation in the efficacy of various non-pharmacological treatments suggests that the efficacy of these approaches varies from person to person.

Somatization disorders in adolescents — Somatic symptoms, common in children and adolescents, are reported by females more than males, especially after puberty. The gynecologist may be consulted for chronic pelvic pain, severe dysmenorrhea, vulvovaginal pain or itching, ovarian cysts, or painful intercourse, and a patient may request repeated STI testing despite low-risk behavior and previous negative test results. In the extreme, pseudocyesis may present with amenorrhea, abdominal enlargement, and other pregnancy symptoms without confirmatory evidence for pregnancy. Body dysmorphic disorder usually begins during adolescence and is often associated with OCD or social anxiety disorder. Management guidance states the obstetrician–gynecologist should acknowledge the reality of the physical symptoms while emphasizing the normal findings on physical examination and avoiding excessive diagnostic testing; unless the symptom is gynecologic, the patient should be referred to her primary care provider for comprehensive care and close follow-up, and gynecologic symptoms should be managed with appropriate treatments (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or hormonal contraceptives for dysmenorrhea).

The evaluation of endometriosis in an adolescent girl is a challenging topic. The initial stage of the disease and the limited diagnostic instrument appropriate for the youth age and for its typical features can reduce the ability of the gynecologist. At the same time, missing a prompt diagnosis can delay the beginning of specific and punctual management of endometriosis, which could avoid a postponed diagnosis from 6 to 12 years, typical of adolescent girls complaining of dysmenorrhea.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^d3e35b80]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — endometriosis in adolescents — medical management emphasizes continued hormonal suppression and appropriate use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Because endometriosis is a chronic condition, patients should continue hormonal suppression unless they are actively trying to become pregnant, and options include a progestin-only agent or 52 mg of LNG- IUS. For pain refractory to conservative surgical therapy and suppressive hormonal therapy, patients often benefit from at least 6 months of GnRH agonist therapy with add-back medicine. Patients treated with GnRH agonists should begin add-back hormone therapy at the initiation of treatment to prevent bone loss and avoid the onset of menopausal symptoms, and in a 2017 trial in adolescents, add-back therapy using conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg) plus norethindrone acetate (5 mg) daily was superior to norethindrone acetate alone for quality of life and preservation of bone density. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning is not needed before initiation of therapy, during GnRH agonist treatment of less than 12 months in duration, or after treatment; obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel patients on adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake and the benefits of weight-bearing exercise during GnRH agonist therapy. After leuprolide is discontinued, patients should begin continuous hormone-suppression therapy. Although serum CA 125 levels may be increased in patients with endometriosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not endorse using CA 125 to monitor treatment or screen for endometriosis; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be the mainstay of pain relief for adolescents with endometriosis, and adolescents should not be prescribed narcotics long-term outside of a specialized pain management team.

### Efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological therapies for primary dysmenorrhea: a network meta-analysis [^eb76ba2d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary dysmenorrhea (PD), also referred to as functional dysmenorrhea, is marked by cramping pain in the pelvic area during menstruation, often accompanied by dizziness, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and other symptoms. In severe cases, it can lead to cold extremities and fainting. PD is not associated with any apparent pelvic organic disease. The prevalence of PD varies significantly across different regions and age groups, ranging from 31.6% to 89.1%. For instance, the prevalence of PD among female college students in China is 70.3%, while it is 45% in India,83.7% in Arabia,64.7% in Ethiopia,64.0% in Mexico,89.1% in Iranand 91.27% in Indonesian medical students. A Japanese study indicated that the prevalence of dysmenorrhea varies with age, being 31.6% at age 12, 39.5% at age 13, and 50.3% at age 14. These variations may be attributed to differences in ethnicity, socio-cultural factors, and PD assessment methods. Dysmenorrhea symptoms typically begin in adolescence, potentially leading to school absenteeism and limitations in social, academic, and physical activities. Prolonged dysmenorrhea can cause repression, depression, distress, and other negative emotions. These symptoms can affect their quality of life, which is why we are concerned about PD.

According to consensus guidelines, and evidence reviews, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely considered the primary treatment, with combined oral contraceptives often used as a secondary option. However, due to the potential long-term adverse effects on the cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal systems associated with NSAIDs, these treatments are not suitable for prolonged use. Similarly, oral contraceptives can cause vaginal bleeding, weight gain, or venous thrombosis. All of this suggests that we need to move to Non-pharmacological therapies (NPT) that are safe and easy to use and effective in achieving relief for dysmenorrhea symptoms. NPT include acupuncture, exercise therapy, aromatherapy, acupressure, and so on. Recently, NPT yield remarkable efficacy in clinical practice, and are widely proved by previous research. Besides, several clinical studies and systematic reviews have also confirmed the efficacy and safety of NPT for PD. Recent studies suggest that NPT is a viable and effective treatment option for women with PD, particularly for those unsuitable for pharmacologic therapy.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

Introduction

Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a widespread condition distinguished by the recurrent occurrence of menstrual pain in the absence of any detectable pelvic pathology, according to established guidelines. This condition affects a substantial portion of young women, ranging from approximately 71% to 94%, with a notable proportion exceeding 30%, enduring moderate-to-severe menstrual pain. Furthermore, approximately 4.6% of PD cases result in functional disability during the critical period of young adulthood. The repercussions of menstrual pain transcend mere personal discomfort, which significantly impedes the daily routines of approximately 15.5% of working women and disrupts the educational endeavors of over 10–40% of students. Consequently, this translates into an average productivity loss of 33% and an annual cumulative total of 8.9 lost productive days. Moreover, PD-induced central sensitization heightens individuals' susceptibility to functional pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and low back pain. Even more concerning, dysmenorrhea can exacerbate the prevalence of sleep disorders and elevate the risk of mental health issues including anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with extreme cases leading to suicidal behavior.

Currently, Medical treatment remains the mainstream approach for PD, encompassing both non-hormonal pharmacotherapy and hormonal interventions. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) serve as the primary non-hormonal pharmacotherapy for PD. However, despite some authors advocating the use of NSAIDs before the onset of menstrual pain, irregular adherence to medication can result in the development of NSAID-resistant dysmenorrhea, with 18% of women with dysmenorrhea reporting ineffectiveness of these drugs. Furthermore, the gastrointestinal adverse reaction rate associated with NSAIDs can be as high as 32%, significantly hindering their widespread use. Hormone therapy is another medical treatment option; however, due to adverse reaction and cultural factors, fewer patients have reported the use of combined oral contraceptives (COC) for non-contraceptive purposes.COCs act by suppressing ovulation and lessening the endometrial lining of the uterus, which may lead to irregular uterine bleeding. They are also unsuitable for patients with fertility needs. In addition to pharmacological treatments, evidence-based guidelines recommend complementary management including exercise, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), acupoint stimulation, behavioral interventions, topical heat, and dietary supplements, with surgery considered for refractory cases.

### Dysmenorrhea… [^921470af]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Primary dysmenorrhea, which is defined as painful menses in women with normal pelvic anatomy, usually begins during adolescence. It is characterized by crampy pelvic pain beginning shortly before or at the onset of menses and lasting one to three days. Dysmenorrhea also may be secondary to pelvic organ pathology. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea is highest in adolescent women, with estimates ranging from 20 to 90 percent, depending on the measurement method used. 1–3 About 15 percent of adolescent girls report severe dysmenorrhea, 1, 4 and it is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absenteeism in adolescent girls in the United States. 2, 5 A longitudinal study 6 of a representative cohort of Swedish women found a prevalence of dysmenorrhea of 90 percent in women 19 years of age and 67 percent in women 24 years of age. Ten percent of the 24-year-olds reported pain that interfered with daily function.

Most adolescents self-medicate with over-the-counter medicines, and few consult a physician about dysmenorrhea. 1–3. Pathogenesis Dysmenorrhea is thought to be caused by the release of prostaglandins in the menstrual fluid, which causes uterine contractions and pain. Vasopressin also may play a role by increasing uterine contractility and causing ischemic pain as a result of vasoconstriction. Elevated vasopressin levels have been reported in women with primary dysmenorrhea. The relationship between endometriosis and dysmenorrhea is not clear. Endometriosis may be asymptomatic, or it may be associated with pelvic pain that is not limited to the menstrual period and the low anterior pelvis. In one study 7 of women undergoing elective sterilization, no difference was found in the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in women with and women without an incidental finding of endometriosis.

However, an observational study 8 of women undergoing laparoscopy for infertility supported a relationship between dysmenorrhea and the severity of endometriosis. Diagnosis In most patients who present with menstrual pain, empiric therapy may be prescribed with the presumptive diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea, based on a typical history of low anterior pelvic pain beginning in adolescence and associated specifically with menstrual periods. A history that is inconsistent and/or physical findings of a pelvic mass, abnormal vaginal discharge, or pelvic tenderness that is not limited to the time of the menstrual period suggest a diagnosis of secondary dysmenorrhea. It is appropriate to perform only an abdominal examination in young adolescents with a typical history who have never been sexually active. A pelvic examination should be performed in females who have been sexually active to screen for sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydial infection.

When the history and physical examination suggest other pelvic pathology, the evaluation should follow accordingly, usually with pelvic ultrasonography as the initial diagnostic test to rule out anatomic abnormalities such as mass lesions. In patients with severe dysmenorrhea that is unresponsive to initial treatment, ultrasonography is useful to detect ovarian cysts and endometriomas. Complementary and Alternative Medicines SUPPLEMENTS Thiamine at a dosage of 100 mg daily was found to be effective in treating dysmenorrhea in a double-blind RCT of more than 500 East Indian women aged 12 to 21 years with moderate to severe symptoms. 19 It is unclear whether thiamine would be effective in U. S. women, whose diet may be quite different from that of Indian women. A single RCT of vitamin E found that 2, 500 IU taken daily for five days starting two days before menstruation was more effective than placebo in treating dysmenorrhea.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 735: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^6614d473]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Contraceptive implants — adolescent bleeding changes and management — Obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel adolescents who choose an implant for contraception to expect changes in menstrual bleeding patterns throughout the duration of use, and in an analysis of 11 clinical trials including 942 etonogestrel implant users the most common patterns were infrequent bleeding in 33.3% of 90-day cycles, amenorrhea in 21.4% of cycles, prolonged bleeding in 16.9% of cycles, and frequent bleeding in 6.1% of cycles; early discontinuation rates among adolescents are generally low at approximately 10% within the first year, anticipatory guidance may improve satisfaction and continuation, there are no clinical parameters or risk factors that aid in predicting bleeding patterns, and bleeding in the first 3 months is broadly predictive of future patterns. For irregular bleeding, the CDC recommends consideration of two options — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for short-term treatment (5–7 days) and hormonal treatment (if medically eligible) with low-dose combined oral contraceptives or estrogen for short-term treatment (10–20 days); limited clinical trial data suggest mefenamic acid, mifepristone with ethinyl estradiol or with doxycycline, and doxycycline alone decrease the length of bleeding episodes, and new-onset abnormal uterine bleeding not associated with initial placement should be evaluated similarly to non-LARC users and to IUD users with abnormal uterine bleeding.

### Medical management of endometriosis-associated pain [^70fef5d3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In the coming years, basic science research into the mechanisms of endometriosis development and persistence almost certainly will open new avenues for treatment. A wide armamentarium of medical therapies already exists, however. The efficacy of most of these methods in reducing endometriosis-associated pain is well established. The choice of which to use depends largely on patient preference after an appropriate discussion of risks, side effects, and cost. Typically, oral contraceptives and NSAIDs are first-line therapy because of their low cost and mild side effects (Box 6). Because of its greater potential for suppressing endometrial development, consideration should be given to prescribing a low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive continuously. If adequate relief is not obtained or if side effects prove intolerable, consideration should be given to the use of progestins (oral, intramuscular, or IUD) or a GnRH agonist with immediate add-back therapy. Progestins are less expensive, but GnRH agonists with add-back may be better tolerated. If none of these medications proves beneficial or if side effects are too pronounced, then repeat surgery is warranted. The surgery may have analgesic value and serves to reconfirm the diagnosis. Finally, if endometriosis is identified at the time of surgery, then consideration should be given to prescribing medical therapy postoperatively.

### The treatment of dysmenorrhea [^86b34b6b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Menstrual disorders and abnormal uterine bleeding are common concerns of young women. Complaints include menses that are: too painful (dysmenorrhea), absent or occur irregularly (amenorrhea or oligoamenorrhea), or prolonged and heavy (menorrhagia, or excessive uterine bleeding). In providing optimal reproductive care, the medical provider must be able to distinguish between normal developmental patterns or symptoms requiring education and reassurance from pathologic conditions requiring prompt assessment and treatment. This article discusses the normal menstrual patterns seen in adolescent females and provides an evaluation and management approach to primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^b197d2c3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) — management of bleeding irregularities — emphasizes counseling and optional short‑term treatments. If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options during days of bleeding may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs: short‑term treatment, 5–7 days; for heavy or prolonged bleeding, hormonal treatment with low‑dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or estrogen for short‑term treatment, 10–20 days. Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment and reassurance is advised; if a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. Bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use, and amenorrhea is common after ≥ 1 years of continuous use. Enhanced counseling detailing expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that these irregularities generally are not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials. Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among DMPA users taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo; treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period; and in one small study among DMPA users with amenorrhea for 2 months, treatment with COCs alleviated amenorrhea better than placebo; no studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users. If the patient wants to discontinue DMPA at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods and initiate another method if it is desired.

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents [^a1d73580]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies show that between 41% and 91.5% of young women, school-aged and university-aged, are affected by dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins, is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis, and typically lasting 1–3 days and with a negative physical examination. Secondary dysmenorrhea presents with similar signs and symptoms but is a result of underlying pelvic pathology, for example endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Dysmenorrhea most typically presents as abdominal cramping; however, it can also present with headaches, nausea, vomiting or other generalized symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, but other tests such as a pelvic examination, a pregnancy test and STI screening may be helpful in ruling out other sources of pain. Although the mainstay of treatment for dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, lifestyle changes and complementary/alternative medicine can also be helpful approaches. Lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise and stretching, while complementary alternative medicine include peppermint, cinnamon, ginger and other herbs and supplements. Finally, endometriosis must be considered as a potential cause for secondary dysmenorrhea and would warrant a prompt referral to gynecology.

ACOG adolescent dysmenorrhea — evaluation of primary dysmenorrhea should include a focused history and selective examination, with attention to features of secondary causes and known diagnostic delays. Adolescents "may experience a longer time to diagnosis of pelvic pain (up to 5.4 years) compared with the time to diagnosis (1.9 years) in women whose symptoms began in adulthood", and "a delay in presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment is common for patients of all ages with dysmenorrhea". The "initial evaluation for all patients presenting with dysmenorrhea includes a medical, gynecologic, menstrual, family, and psychosocial history to determine whether the patient has primary dysmenorrhea or symptoms suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea". "When a patient presents with symptoms only of primary dysmenorrhea, a pelvic examination is not necessary", but "a pelvic examination should be conducted if symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are present". Clinicians "should suspect secondary dysmenorrhea" with severe dysmenorrhea immediately after menarche, progressive worsening, abnormal uterine bleeding, mid‑cycle or acyclic pain, infertility, lack of response to empiric treatment, family history of endometriosis, renal or other congenital anomalies, or dyspareunia; obstetrician–gynecologists "should be aware of cultural differences" and that "parental modeling also may play an important role" in symptom reporting and pain perception.

### The comorbidities of dysmenorrhea: a clinical survey comparing symptom profile in women with and without endometriosis [^f010a3b8]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study has demonstrated four clinical findings. First is that additional symptoms are common in women with dysmenorrhea. Second is that the symptom profile in our study was generally independent of the presence or absence of endometriosis lesions, and independent of the use or non-use of hormonal therapy in those with confirmed endometriosis. Third is that the presence of stabbing pains in women with endometriosis is highly associated with the severity of dysmenorrhea, days per month of dysmenorrhea, days per month of pelvic pain, and diagnosis of migraine headache. And finally that a past history of distressing sexual events is associated with an increase in the severity and number of pain symptoms.

A woman's experience of dysmenorrhea includes all symptoms experienced at menstruation, both pelvic and extra-pelvic. A major strength of this study is its symptom-based applicability to the management of women presenting with dysmenorrhea and its associated symptoms, regardless of endometriosis status. While our group may represent a more complex subset of women with dysmenorrhea than is found in the general population, it is likely that they are similar to women referred to other gynecologists providing care for women with endometriosis and pelvic pain.

The lack of association between pain severity, presenting symptom profile and the presence of endometriotic lesions

Dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain have traditionally been associated with the presence of laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis lesions. While these conditions commonly coexist, the relationship between the clinical symptoms with which a girl or woman presents to her health practitioner (dysmen-orrhea) and the medical condition that may or may not be found at laparoscopy (endometriosis) remains controversial. A literature review by Janssen et alconsidered laparoscopic outcomes in adolescent girls aged 10–21 years presenting with pain. They found endometriosis lesions to be present in 62% of adolescents overall, in 75% of girls with chronic pelvic pain resistant to treatment with the oral contraceptive pill and anti-inflammatory medications, in 70% of girls with dysmenorrhea alone, and in 49% of girls with chronic pelvic pain not necessarily resistant to treatment. Additional factors affecting the experience of dysmenorrhea appear likely. A consensus paper published in 2013 included majority but not universal support for a statement describing a "philosophical shift to consideration of endometriosis and pelvic pain as a spectrum or continuum of disease". It was recognized that this approach would avoid excluding women who lack laparoscopic confirmation of a diagnosis of endometriosis, yet have similar symptoms and associated diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

### Menstrual disorders in the adolescent: dysmenorrhea and dysfunctional uterine bleeding… [^864e5c97]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, is the most common gynecologic problem that occurs during adolescence. It is estimated that 75% of menstruating women experience dysmenorrhea, making it the leading cause of school and work absenteeism among young women. Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menses with no identifiable pelvic pathology. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses resulting from a pelvic abnormality, such as endometriosis or fibroids. This is an important distinction because treatment is based on the cause of the dysmenorrhea. Evaluation of the adolescent who has dysmenorrhea begins with questioning about the timing, character, and location of the pain as well as the presence of associated systemic symptoms. A history of pelvic infection, menorrhagia, or intermenstrual bleeding suggests that the dysmenorrhea is secondary to pelvic pathology.

Pelvic pain at times other than menstruation may indicate endometriosis. The onset of dysmenorrhea soon after menarche with rapid worsening over several cycles suggests an outlet obstruction, which may result from a partially imperforate hymen or uterine malformation. A pelvic examination should be performed before initiating treatment for dysmenorrhea. Abnormal uterine size, position, or shape suggest uterine malformation rather than fibroids, which are uncommon during adolescence. Cervical cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be performed because chronic pelvic inflammatory disease may appear as dysmenorrhea. Comments.

Adolescent dysmenorrhea — prevalence, definitions, and symptom burden is outlined as the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women, with prevalence rates that range from 50% to 90%. Most adolescents have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology, and it usually begins within 6–12 months of menarche. Secondary dysmenorrhea is due to pelvic pathology, with endometriosis the most common cause, while chronic pelvic pain is defined as pain in the pelvic area that lasts 6 months or longer. Symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea in adolescents may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and muscle cramps, and poor sleep quality has been self-reported by those with severe dysmenorrhea compared with mild disease. Dysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absenteeism for adolescent girls; in one study, 12% of adolescent girls and young women aged 14–20 years lost days of school or work each month because of dysmenorrhea, and almost one in four respondents self-administered pain medication monthly without having seen a physician; notably, nearly two thirds of adolescents with chronic acyclic pain undergoing laparoscopy have endometriosis.

### Early pubertal timing is a risk factor for adolescent dysmenorrhea [^377b74dd]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea (heavy menstrual pain with/without organic cause) onsets at or shortly after menarche, severely impacting quality of life. By most estimates, dysmenorrhea affects over half of female adolescents, negatively impacting daily life; indeed, it is the leading cause of school absenteeism. Many adolescents with dysmenorrhea do not seek treatment, their pain frequently dismissed as a feature of menstruation, despite largely effective treatment options (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives). Left untreated, dysmenorrhea often persists and serves as a harbinger for future, more resistant chronic pelvic or widespread pain, potentially via sensitization of the central nervous system –. Thus, early detection and treatment of dysmenorrhea could significantly improve adolescent well-being, and for some individuals could even prevent the development of chronic pain.

Although dysmenorrhea is associated with pubertal status (or where an adolescent is in the course of pubertal maturation), the timing of pubertal milestones (or when an adolescent develops compared to same-sex peers) has largely been overlooked. Only a few studies have considered one indicator of pubertal timing, namely age at menarche. These studies revealed that earlier age at menarche (relative to peers) increases the likelihood of experiencing the menstrual pain that characterizes dysmenorrhea, especially frequent and intense pain. Yet, menarche is a relatively late event in the ~2-year process of pubertal development, preceded by height spurt, breast growth, skin changes, and body hair growth in most females. If dysmenorrhea is associated with the timing of aspects of puberty other than menarche, then early intervention through routine gynecologic healthcare for early-maturing females could disrupt a prognosis of lifelong pain.

Spotting or Light Bleeding

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued DMPA use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or discontinuation of DMPA. If the patient wants to continue DMPA use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient wants to discontinue DMPA at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option during days of bleeding may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: º NSAIDs: short-term treatment, 5–7 days

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^b192624b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 785 — acute management of heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents — states that the first-line approach to acute bleeding in the adolescent is medical management; surgery should be reserved for those who do not respond to medical therapy. Adolescents who are hemodynamically unstable or actively bleeding heavily should be hospitalized for management. In the absence of contraindications to estrogen, hormonal therapy for acute heavy menstrual bleeding can consist of intravenous conjugated estrogen every 4–6 hours; alternatively, monophasic combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (in 30–50 microgram ethinyl estradiol formulation) can be used every 6–8 hours until cessation of bleeding. Use of antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid in oral and intravenous form may be used to stop bleeding. After correction of acute heavy menstrual bleeding, maintenance hormonal therapy can include combined hormonal contraceptives, oral and injectable progestins, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs). Iron replacement therapy should be provided for all reproductive-aged women with anemia due to bleeding. Nonmedical procedures should be considered when there is a lack of response to medical therapy, if the patient is clinically unstable despite initial measures, or when severe heavy bleeding warrants further investigation, such as an examination under anesthesia. Obstetrician–gynecologists can provide important guidance to premenarchal and postmenarchal girls and should counsel all adolescent patients with a bleeding disorder about safe medication use and future surgical considerations. Adolescents with a bleeding disorder should be reminded that products that prevent platelet adhesion, such as aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, should be used only with the recommendation of a hematologist. In adolescents with known bleeding disorders, preoperative surgical evaluation, choice of hemostatic agents, and need for blood products should be determined in conjunction with a hematologist and an anesthesiologist.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea [^ded038be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological problem consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation, which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Research has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs that act by blocking prostaglandin production. They inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandins. The COX enzyme exists in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. More selective NSAIDs that solely target COX-2 enzymes (COX-2-specific inhibitors) were launched in 1999 with the aim of reducing side effects commonly reported in association with NSAIDs, such as indigestion, headaches and drowsiness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of NSAIDs in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in January 2015: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, November 2014 issue), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We checked the abstracts of major scientific meetings and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of NSAIDs versus placebo, other NSAIDs or paracetamol, when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data, calculating odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used inverse variance methods to combine data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women). They compared 20 different NSAIDs (18 non-selective and two COX-2-specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other. NSAIDs versus placeboAmong women with primary dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I(2) = 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. However, NSAIDs were associated with more adverse effects (overall adverse effects: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51, 25 RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence; gastrointestinal adverse effects: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, 14 RCTs, I(2) = 30%; neurological adverse effects: OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs versus other NSAIDsWhen NSAIDs were compared with each other there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety. However, the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials. Non-selective NSAIDs versus COX-2-specific selectorsOnly two of the included studies utilised COX-2-specific inhibitors (etoricoxib and celecoxib). There was no evidence that COX-2-specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs; however data were very scanty. NSAIDs versus paracetamolNSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43, three RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, though data were very scanty. Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%); a further 31% failed to state their source of funding.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs appear to be a very effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the substantial risk of adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to determine which (if any) individual NSAID is the safest and most effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^770dfa51]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — follow-up for primary dysmenorrhea states that patients with a presumed diagnosis should be monitored for response to treatment, with tools including visual analog scales and numerical rating scales, which are reliable, valid, translated into the most frequently spoken languages, and simple to administer and fulfill; when there is no clinical improvement within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate possible secondary causes and treatment adherence; adolescents may be less adherent to medication schedules, face conflict with parents, and encounter barriers such as forgetfulness, disorganization, financial costs, and pharmacy access; a literature review concluded that social support and peer relations were key themes in evaluating medication adherence and noted concerns about stigma and embarrassment; medication nonadherence can be related to conflicts between adolescents and their parents.

### Endometriosis and pelvic pain for the gastroenterologist [^c8ac27b0]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis, affecting 5–10% of reproductive-age women, is a common contributor to dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain. Diagnosis requires laparoscopic tissue biopsy, but careful pelvic examination, and/or imaging with either ultrasound or MRI, may identify patients who should receive empiric first-line therapy. The presence of dyschezia, particularly with cyclical exacerbation, should raise suspicion for bowel or rectovaginal septum involvement, and a greater need for surgical management. Treatment of dysmenorrhea includes hormonal suppression of the menstrual cycle, and/or analgesics; more severe cases with strong pain and disability may require earlier surgical intervention to excise disease while preserving fertility desires.
