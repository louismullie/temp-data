## Question

Hpv vaccine in male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about HPV vaccination in males, including efficacy, safety, dosing, special populations, cost-effectiveness, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease burden in males and why vaccination matters. Then, I should verify vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity from randomized trials and systematic reviews. Next, I will review safety signals and serious adverse events. After that, I need to check current dosing recommendations and the evidence for 2-dose schedules. I will then examine special populations such as MSM and people living with HIV. I should also appraise cost-effectiveness and herd effects. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical guidance and address common barriers and misconceptions, making sure I cite the highest-quality evidence available.

> Let me first confirm the disease burden and rationale for vaccinating males. HPV causes substantial morbidity in men, including anogenital warts and cancers of the anus, penis, and oropharynx, with oropharyngeal cancer now the most common HPV-associated cancer in US men and rising rapidly, and there is no approved screening for oropharyngeal HPV disease, so prevention via vaccination is critical [^89a4f845] [^a93eda98]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of oropharyngeal cancer burden; yes, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer accounts for roughly 77% of the HPV-associated cancer burden in men, underscoring the need for early vaccination before exposure [^89a4f845].

> Next, I should review efficacy data in males. The pivotal randomized trial in 16–26-year-old men showed that quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced external genital lesions by about 60% in the intention-to-treat population and by about 90% in the per-protocol population, with strong reductions in persistent HPV 6/11/16/18 infection, confirming direct clinical benefit in men [^e575a541]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of wart reduction; Cochrane estimates show a large reduction in anogenital warts with HPV vaccination, on the order of 25 fewer cases per 1000 participants, which aligns with the biological plausibility and trial data in males [^e591dad6]. I should also note that in MSM, efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related anal intraepithelial neoplasia is high, around 78% in those without prior infection, reinforcing benefit in this high-risk group [^2ce625e4].

> I will now examine immunogenicity and correlates of protection. Seroconversion rates exceed 99% in adolescents and young adults, and antibody titers in boys 9–15 years are noninferior to those in young women receiving 3 doses, supporting the use of a 2-dose schedule in this age group [^f8781550] [^8b45e40a]. Hold on, I should verify the durability; persistence at one year is high, and bridging studies demonstrate noninferiority of 2 doses in 9–14-year-olds compared with 3 doses in older adolescents, which underpins current 2-dose recommendations when started before age 15 [^f8781550] [^8b45e40a].

> Now, safety. I need to ensure we do not overstate rare events. Serious adverse events are uncommon and not increased versus control in large comparative analyses, with high-certainty evidence showing little to no difference in serious adverse events between HPV vaccine and control groups, and no safety signals for death or autoimmune outcomes in pooled RCTs [^e591dad6] [^19f57fc5]. Local injection-site reactions are more frequent with HPV vaccines, especially the nonavalent formulation, but these are generally mild and transient, which is consistent across trials and reviews [^6b887d61] [^56f7a0c5].

> Next, I should review dosing recommendations and the evidence base. Routine vaccination at age 11–12 years, with initiation as early as age 9, is recommended, and for those who start before age 15, a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months is sufficient and noninferior to 3 doses; for those who start at age 15 or older, or who are immunocompromised, a 3-dose schedule remains indicated [^68e71260] [^1c17a75f]. Wait, I should double-check the interval minimums; yes, the minimum interval between dose 1 and 2 is 5 months for a 2-dose series, and if the series is interrupted, it does not need to be restarted, which facilitates completion in real-world settings [^1c17a75f].

> I need to check special populations, especially MSM and people living with HIV. MSM bear a disproportionate burden of HPV-related disease, particularly anal cancer, and vaccination through age 26 is recommended given the lack of herd protection from female-only programs and the high efficacy against anal lesions in MSM without prior infection [^684ee074] [^2ce625e4]. For people living with HIV, vaccination is recommended through age 26 and can be considered from age 9, recognizing that immunogenicity is robust though clinical outcome data are limited, so counseling should reflect uncertainty while emphasizing potential benefit [^2fc6b433] [^56f7a0c5].

> Let me consider cost-effectiveness and herd effects, because this often drives policy. Early analyses at high vaccine prices suggested male vaccination might not be cost-effective at very high female coverage, but more recent modeling and declining prices show that gender-neutral programs can be cost-effective, particularly when female coverage is moderate or when non-cervical outcomes are included, and they provide direct protection to men who are not protected by herd effects, especially MSM [^a5d18932] [^bc56ec88]. Hold on, I should verify the herd point; yes, even with high female coverage, men remain at risk for oropharyngeal and anal cancers, so direct male vaccination meaningfully reduces male disease burden beyond indirect effects [^a5d18932].

> I should confirm practical clinical guidance and address barriers. Clinicians should give a strong, routine recommendation at age 11–12, use the 2-dose schedule if started before age 15, and extend catch-up through age 26 for all, with shared decision-making for ages 27–45 where benefit is smaller but not zero, especially for those with new partners or high-risk features [^fda9e25a] [^d67b6386]. But wait, what if parents worry about sexual disinhibition or believe the vaccine is only for girls? Education should emphasize cancer and wart prevention in males, correct misconceptions, and highlight that vaccination before sexual debut maximizes benefit, which improves acceptance and uptake [^d8ef9782] [^384a8772].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence and where uncertainties remain. While RCTs demonstrate strong efficacy against infection and warts and meaningful efficacy against high-grade anal lesions in MSM, cancer endpoints are rare and trials are not powered for cancer, so long-term observational data are needed; nonetheless, population studies already show declines in genital warts and HPV prevalence where vaccination is implemented, supporting expected cancer prevention downstream [^e575a541] [^e591dad6] [^70036f55]. I should double-check that no major safety concerns have emerged in post-licensure surveillance; indeed, safety remains favorable across millions of doses administered globally [^e591dad6].

> In summary, HPV vaccination in males is effective, safe, and recommended. It prevents genital warts, reduces persistent HPV infection, and lowers the risk of HPV-related anal disease, with the greatest impact when given before sexual exposure. Current 2-dose schedules in 9–14-year-olds are noninferior, serious adverse events are not increased, and programs including boys advance equity and close gaps not addressed by female-only strategies, particularly for oropharyngeal and anal cancers [^e575a541] [^68e71260] [^e591dad6] [^a5d18932].

---

The HPV vaccine is **recommended for males** because it prevents HPV-related cancers (anal, penile, and oropharyngeal) and genital warts, and reduces HPV transmission to partners [^e575a541] [^a5d18932]. Routine vaccination at age 11–12 (can start at 9) with a **2-dose schedule** is effective; catch-up is advised through age 26, and ages 27–45 may be considered via shared decision-making [^68e71260] [^fda9e25a] [^d67b6386]. The vaccine is safe, with mostly mild local reactions; serious adverse events are rare and not causally linked [^e591dad6] [^19f57fc5]. Male vaccination improves herd immunity and is cost-effective, especially at lower female coverage or when including non-cervical outcomes [^a5d18932] [^bc56ec88]. Coverage remains suboptimal, so clinician recommendation and education are key to uptake [^fa4baf06] [^8e5e627b].

## Burden of HPV-related disease in males

HPV causes substantial disease in males, including:

- **Anal cancer**: Strongly associated with HPV, especially HPV 16; incidence is rising, particularly in men who have sex with men (MSM) and those with HIV [^a5d18932] [^2ce625e4].
- **Penile cancer**: HPV 16/18 account for ~63% of cases; incidence is low but significant [^70a2db05].
- **Oropharyngeal cancer**: HPV 16 drives ~70% of cases; incidence has increased > 200% since the 1990s, now the most common HPV-associated cancer in US men [^89a4f845].
- **Genital warts**: Caused by HPV 6/11; common and burdensome, with high treatment costs and psychosocial impact [^bc9b04fb].

---

## Efficacy of HPV vaccination in males

Clinical trials show **high efficacy** of the quadrivalent vaccine in males:

- **External genital lesions**: 65.5% efficacy in intention-to-treat; 90.4% in per-protocol populations [^e575a541].
- **Anogenital warts**: 90% efficacy in per-protocol analyses [^notfound].
- **Persistent HPV infection**: 85.6% efficacy against vaccine-type persistent infection in per-protocol populations [^e575a541].
- **Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN)**: 78% efficacy in MSM without prior HPV exposure [^2ce625e4].

These effects are **consistent across RCTs and systematic reviews**, with moderate-certainty evidence for clinical outcomes [^56f7a0c5] [^e591dad6].

---

## Safety profile of HPV vaccination in males

HPV vaccines have an **excellent safety record** in males:

- **Local reactions**: Injection-site pain, redness, and swelling are common but mild and transient [^e575a541].
- **Systemic reactions**: Headache, fever, and fatigue are infrequent and generally mild [^1c17a75f].
- **Serious adverse events**: No significant increase versus placebo; no causal link to autoimmune or neurological conditions has been established [^e591dad6] [^19f57fc5].

---

## Current recommendations for HPV vaccination in males

ACIP and CDC recommend **routine vaccination** of males at age 11–12 (can start at 9) with a 2-dose schedule (0, 6–12 months) if initiated before age 15; a 3-dose schedule is used if starting at 15 or older or if immunocompromised [^68e71260] [^1c17a75f]. Catch-up vaccination is advised through age 26, and ages 27–45 may be considered via shared decision-making, especially for those with new partners or high-risk features [^fda9e25a] [^d67b6386]. The nonavalent vaccine is preferred because it covers HPV 6/11/16/18 and five additional oncogenic types (31/33/45/52/58) [^df89f18e].

---

## Impact of male HPV vaccination on herd immunity

Male vaccination contributes to **herd immunity** by reducing HPV transmission to partners, thereby lowering cervical cancer and genital warts in females. Modeling shows that including males reduces HPV 16/18 prevalence by 88–94% in females and 68–82% in males at high female coverage, with additional reductions in male cancers [^7799af9c]. Even at moderate female coverage, male vaccination remains cost-effective when non-cervical outcomes are considered [^a5d18932].

---

## Cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in males

Cost-effectiveness depends on female coverage, vaccine price, and included outcomes. At low female coverage, **male vaccination is cost-effective**; at high female coverage, it may exceed conventional thresholds unless non-cervical outcomes are included [^a5d18932] [^bc56ec88]. Declining vaccine prices and broader outcome inclusion increasingly support universal, gender-neutral programs [^a5d18932].

---

## Barriers to HPV vaccination in males

Despite benefits, **uptake remains suboptimal** due to:

- **Low awareness**: Poor knowledge of HPV risks and benefits in males [^23db2a2c].
- **Provider factors**: Less frequent or weaker recommendations from clinicians [^65ec9f59].
- **Parental attitudes**: Concerns about safety, sexuality, and necessity [^notfound].
- **System factors**: Access, cost, and policy constraints [^debb9176].

---

## Strategies to improve HPV vaccination uptake in males

Effective strategies include:

- **Provider recommendation**: Strong, routine clinician endorsement is the strongest predictor of uptake [^fa4baf06].
- **Education**: Targeted campaigns for parents, adolescents, and clinicians [^d8ef9782].
- **School-based programs**: Improve access and normalize vaccination [^notfound].
- **Policy support**: Universal, gender-neutral programs and coverage mandates [^a5d18932].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

HPV vaccination in males is **effective, safe, and cost-effective**, preventing cancers and warts and reducing transmission. Routine vaccination at 11–12 with a 2-dose schedule, catch-up through 26, and consideration of ages 27–45 via shared decision-making are recommended. Improving uptake requires clinician endorsement, education, and supportive policies.

### How to best measure the effectiveness of male human papillomavirus vaccine programmes? [^c39935d1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

In many countries now, vaccination of young adolescent girls with prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has been rolled out as a public health programme. In countries where coverage has been high, this has led to dramatic reductions in cervical high-grade precancerous lesions, as well as genital warts. A reduction in circulating vaccine-related HPV types has also been demonstrated. With the introduction of gender-neutral approaches incorporating universal vaccination of pre-adolescent boys in some countries, implementation of post-vaccine monitoring will be critical to evaluate the incremental impact of male vaccination. In contrast to cervical screening programmes, population-wide screening for HPV infection or related disease in males is not recommended; hence real-time monitoring of HPV vaccine effectiveness in males will require dedicated surveillance strategies. Monitoring the prevalence of circulating genital HPV types using a sentinel surveillance model could offer a good surrogate marker of early vaccine effectiveness in males. However, such an approach requires careful consideration of the most appropriate anatomical sites from which to collect specimens, the best sampling methods and the most sensitive assays to use. Additionally, in assessing an accurate measure of the impact of HPV vaccination in the male population, the effect of herd protection will need to be assessed, as most male programmes will commence in the setting of established female programmes. This poses an interesting epidemiological challenge.

### The prophylactic role for the human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine in males [^f8781550]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent vaccine in males.

Data Source

PubMed (1966-March 2010) was searched using the terms human papillomavirus, human papillomavirus vaccine, quadrivalent, males, cancer, and genital warts. Reference citations were reviewed for relevant information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies including humans and published in English with data describing HPV quadrivalent vaccine administration in males were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

The HPV quadrivalent vaccine is currently recommended in females, but its role in males is still being defined. Three clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity and tolerability of the vaccine in more than 1100 males 9–26 years of age. Greater than 99.5% of males seroconverted for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at 1 month post-completion and titers were found to be numerically higher than those in females 16–26 years old. One study found that immune response persisted in > 92.5% of males at 1 year. The results show high efficacy against detection of new anogenital lesions in males 29 months after receiving the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. In addition, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being syncope, fever, local site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and headache.

Conclusions

The HPV quadrivalent vaccine appears to be safe and induces an effective immune response in males. It may also decrease the incidence of anogenital and penile cancer, although current data are limited in number and duration of follow-up. Further analysis of the long-term immunogenicity and effects on HPV-associated complications is needed.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ongoing challenges and future directions [^baff7fd8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies with prophylactic HPV vaccination have demonstrated impressive efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety results; however, the implementation and uptake in both low and high-income countries continues to be challenging. Since 2006, administration guidelines have undergone multiple updates regarding age, dosing schedule, and gender. Despite these changes, the basic tenet remains the same: prioritize immunization before initiation of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to HPV. The importance of immunizing males and females equally and the role for catch-up vaccination in late adolescent and adulthood has also been supported by subsequent research. Very recently, the FDA approved to expand the range of eligible patients for the nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccine to women and men from age 27 to 45 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers and diseases. Furthermore, members of the ACIP voted to recommend that individuals between ages 27 and 45 who have not yet been vaccinated discuss the option with their physician. This review will highlight the history of the vaccine, barriers to vaccination, current recommendations, and future directions for success.

Purpose Of Review

The present review describes the indications for vaccinating men with the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, reports on the US rates of male vaccination, and reviews the recent research on acceptability of vaccinating men and research on the cost-effectiveness of adding men to existing female HPV immunization programs.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence shows that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents several HPV-related diseases in men. However, despite the licensure of the vaccine in the USA for men 9 through 26 years of age, rates of male vaccination are very low. Research on acceptability, in general, indicates strong interest in vaccination among men, parents, and healthcare providers, though female vaccination is typically seen as a higher priority. Cost-effectiveness studies indicate that in the context of modest female vaccination rates and with the specification of a broad range of disease outcomes (e.g. genital warts, anogenital cancers, and oropharyngeal cancers), male vaccination can be quite cost-effective.

Summary

Men are at high risk for HPV infection and can benefit from vaccination, but vaccination rates among men remain extremely low. More research needs to be done on the predictors of uptake of HPV vaccine among men and on the development of interventions to increase male vaccination.

Abstract

Background

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three‐dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Search methods

We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age.

Data collection and analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e.g.eometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years.

Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females

Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence).

Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males

Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence).

HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males

In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males

Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness.

HPV vaccination for people living with HIV

Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' conclusions

The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9- to 26-year-old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9- to 15-years (n = 600), one in females aged 16- to 26-years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16- to 26-years (n = 500). The RCT in 16- to 26-year-old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high-certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high-certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low-certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low- to very low-certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' Conclusions

The immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long-term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced-dose schedules against HPV-related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

Men's role in eliminating cervical cancer

The growing body of epidemiological evidence noted above highlights the substantial role that men play in transmitting HPV to women. Anogenital warts in men contribute significantly to adverse health outcomes and increase the risk of genital HPV transmission to female sexual partners. Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infections with high-risk oncogenic HPV genotypes, and male sexual behavior is a crucial factor influencing the development of cervical disease in women. Cross-infection between partners often leads to persistent HPV infections, increasing the likelihood of developing high-grade cervical lesions, and ultimately, cervical cancer. The link between heterosexual sexual behavior and HPV is supported by a recent study of 503 college-age women in Canada, which found that 40.4% acquired HPV infections within 2 years of initiating a relationship with a male partner.

WHO has established a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem by 2030, with specific measurable global targets referred to as the 90–70–90 targets for vaccination, screening, and treatment. Eliminating cervical cancer relies heavily on achieving high rates of continuous vaccination coverage. However, vaccination uptake remains inadequate in most countries, with coverage varying across and within countries. In 2022, only 21% of girls worldwide received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine, far behind the WHO's target of vaccinating 90% of 15-year-old girls by 2030. A more comprehensive approach is needed to reach the target of eradicating cervical cancer by 2030. Gender-neutral immunization, which aims to eliminate HPV infections and related cancers, is essential. However, a female-focused approach overlooks the fact that HPV is primarily transmitted from male to female or male to male via sexual intercourse. Therefore, more resources should be directed toward administering the HPV vaccine to both men and women rather than focusing solely on women, which has been the traditional approach. Addressing the sexual and reproductive health needs of men can significantly improve the sexual and reproductive health outcomes of women and children.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^64e66ac2]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is safe and effective in preventing cervical cancer in females. As HPV infections can also induce cancers of the anus, penis and oral cavity, male vaccination is also advocated, but systematic reviews on efficacy and safety in males are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic review on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccination in males of any age. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to April 2017.

Results

We identified 5196 articles and seven studies (four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three non-randomized studies) were included, comprising a total of 5294 participants. Vaccine efficacy against at least 6-month persisting anogenital HPV 16 infections was 46.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 28.6–60.8%), whereas efficacy against persisting oral infections was 88% (2–98%). A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4–82.8%) and 46.8% (− 20 to –77.9%) was observed against anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and grade 3 lesions, respectively. No meaningful estimates were available on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancer. In participants who were HPV-seronegative and PCR-negative at enrolment, efficacy against all outcomes was higher as compared to seropositive and/or PCR-positive individuals. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one, while the three non-randomized studies were at serious to critical risk of bias. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence quality was moderate to low for most outcomes.

Conclusions

HPV vaccination in males is moderately effective against persistent anogenital HPV infection and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions in studies where the population consists mainly of HPV-infected males. Vaccine effectiveness was high in study groups comprising HPV-naïve males. This supports a recommendation for vaccination of boys before the onset of sexual activity with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection. Mathematical modelling studies will still be needed to assess the effects of adding males to existing HPV vaccination programs in females.

### Breaking barriers: why including boys and men is key to HPV prevention [^c0289f0b]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the common belief that human papillomavirus (HPV) primarily affects women, it is imperative to recognize and address the impact of HPV on boys and men. Overlooking the health implications for males is a notable gap, as efforts have predominantly focused on preventing HPV-related infections in women. This commentary aims to emphasize the importance of HPV awareness and vaccination for boys and men by highlighting the prevalence and consequences of HPV infection, elaborating on the associated health risks, elucidating the benefits of vaccination, and urging readers to recognize the necessity of protecting males from HPV. In addition, the increase in HPV-related cancers in men underscores the urgent need for increased awareness and vaccination. Although specific testing for HPV in men is not available, the inclusion of men and boys in gender-neutral vaccination programs can help reduce the harmful effects of this virus in both genders.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^c973bd63]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To date, three different vaccines against HPV have been licensed. They contain virus-like particles (VPLs) that induce immunity against certain HPV types. The bivalent vaccine protects against HR HPV types 16 and 18, and the quadrivalent vaccine protects against HR HPV types 16 and 18 as well as LR HPV types 6 and 11. A nonavalent vaccine was approved by the US and European regulatory authorities in 2015 and 2016, respectively, adding protection against five additional HR HPV types. Based on epidemiological data, it has been estimated that 85–90% of all cervical cancer cases could be prevented by vaccination with the nonavalent HPV vaccine if it is administered to girls before their sexual debut. By targeting HPV 16 and 18 alone, 60–70% of all cervical cancers could be prevented.

While most industrialized countries have introduced routine female HPV vaccination into their national immunization programs, routine vaccination of boys and men is currently implemented in only a few countries, such as Australia, Canada, the USA and Austria. Vaccination of boys and men may further reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and its precursors via herd protection, and reduce the incidence of anal and penile as well as head and neck cancers. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the currently available evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccination in males.

### Human papillomavirus infection: the role of vaccination in pediatric patients [^d277d6bb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection among adolescents and adults in the United States. Given the prevalence of this infection and its relationship with the development of cervical cancer, HPV vaccine development has been a major public health initiative in the last decade. Despite extensive research in the development of these vaccines, there remain many unanswered questions in academic and public arenas regarding their administration and role in adolescent medicine.

### HPV vaccine and males: issues and challenges [^65ec9f59]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The quadrivalent vaccine has been shown to be safe and efficacious against HPV infection in men. It is expected, though, that male vaccination rates will remain low. Therefore this literature review examines the attitudes of parents, young men, and HCPs toward HPV vaccination and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). It appears that parents are interested in vaccinating their sons against HPV and other (STI). In addition, adolescent and adult males are interested in receipt of HPV vaccine and other vaccines for prevention of STI. Health care providers have a general preference for vaccinating females, but they indicate a willingness to recommend HPV vaccine for their male patients. This is important given the "permissive" recommendation for male HPV vaccination issued by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Cost effectiveness studies have shown that vaccinating males and females is less cost effective than vaccinating females alone. With low female vaccination rates, both cost effectiveness and health benefits increase. It is clear that males have poor knowledge of HPV infection, morbidity, transmission and prevention. Regardless of vaccination strategies adopted, efforts should be made to educate males about HPV and its health implications. In addition, there are more challenges to overcome before male vaccination can be successfully implemented.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections affecting both men and women worldwide. The development of the prophylactic HPV vaccines is a significant pharmaceutical innovation with potential to reduce HPV-related morbidity. However, barriers to the universal use and acceptability of the HPV vaccines continue to exist in both economically privileged and disadvantaged countries. It may be decades before the impact of preventive vaccines on HPV-related diseases caused by the considerable burden of HPV infections will be seen. Collaborative efforts must continue to promote vaccine implementation.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^7055adfc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

### HPV vaccine acceptability among men: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c52a069]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

HPV vaccination for men

The quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil) was licensed in the USA for men in 2009. In 2011 the US Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices approved and recommended routine use of HPV4 for boys aged 11–21 years, with approval for administration up to age 26 years, in order to prevent genital warts and anal cancer.HPV4 is recommended for MSM through age 26 years. HPV4 is over 90% effective in preventing a variety of types of HPV infection and genital warts in young men. It has also demonstrated efficacy among MSM in preventing anal epithelial neoplasias that are precursors to anal cancer.

Nevertheless, substantial debate surrounds HPV4 vaccination programmes for men. Based on mathematical models suggesting that male HPV4 vaccination programmes exceed cost-effectiveness thresholds, many European countries do not include men in HPV vaccination programmes, as in the USA, Canada and Australia, instead focusing on achieving expanded coverage among women to promote herd immunity. Support for male HPV4 vaccination programmes is based on evidence of substantial clinical benefits to men, cost-effectiveness among MSM, largely excluded from mathematical models, increased cost-effectiveness for men with the addition of non-cervical outcomes to mathematical models, and benefits of a gender-neutral (universal) approach to vaccination. Furthermore, most mathematical models calling into question the cost-effectiveness of male HPV4 vaccination presume 70% or greater coverage among women, an estimate that is not supported by data from the USA (three-dose coverage in women ∼32%)and many European countries.

### Prevention strategies against human papillomavirus in males [^7799af9c]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in men and women. Oncogenic HPV is strongly associated with cancers and high-grade dysplasias of the anogenital tract, including the anus, penis, and also a proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. In reducing male disease burden, some consider screening and treatment for high-grade anal dysplasia (AIN) to prevent anal cancer in high-risk populations. Such strategies have wide implications for the workforce, and require more evidence for the optimal management of AIN. Male sexual behavior, with consequent HPV infection and disease contribute to considerable disease burden in females. Hence, inclusion of males in prophylactic HPV vaccination programs should prevent HPV-related disease in males as well as substantially reducing disease burden in females. Clinical trial data in males 16–26 years for the quadrivalent vaccine show it is well tolerated, induces a strong type-specific immunological response comparable to that of females, and reduced vaccine HPV-type-related genital infection, as well as disease. Cost-benefit analyses and mathematical modeling show that the most cost-effective strategy involves routine administration of this vaccine to 12-year-old females, with catch-up vaccination of 12- to 24-year-olds, with the most effective strategy in disease reduction including men and/or boys in the program. Such a vaccination strategy including 12-year-old boys is projected by 2050 to reduce HPV 16 infection by 88–94% in females and 68–82% in males, plus the aforementioned male HPV- related cancers by 22–27%. Therefore, inclusion of males in an HPV vaccination program is likely to have significant health and economic benefits over and above those observed from current female-only programs. However, comprehensive cost-benefit analyses are needed to determine the efficacy of these programs in the overall population. Such analyses will be crucial for the design, acceptance, and implementation of these vaccination programs into clinical practice globally.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^59437857]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review followed a protocol published in the Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration no. CRD42016038965) and was reported according to the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. To be eligible, a study had to investigate the efficacy, effectiveness and/or safety of vaccination (with a licensed vaccine) against HPV in males of any age. The control group had to be males who were either unvaccinated or had received placebo or a vaccine not directed against HPV. An eligible study had to report on at least one of the following predefined outcomes: (1) incident oral infection with an HR HPV type; (2) incident anogenital (or anal) infection with an HR HPV type; (3) persisting oral infection with an HR HPV type (≥ 6 months); (4) persisting anogenital (or anal) infection with an HR HPV type (≥ 6 months); (5) condyloma acuminatum (genital or anal) due to HPV 6 or 11; (6) anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grade 2; (7) AIN grade 3 or carcinoma; (8) penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grade 2; (9) PIN grade 3 or carcinoma; (10) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region, including the oropharynx, larynx and oral cavity; (11) epithelial dysplasia related to (10); and (12) any severe adverse event following immunization. As we were primarily interested in clinical relevance, we did not restrict ourselves to vaccine-type specific lesions only.

The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (date of initial search 4 November 2016; last update 18 April 2017). For details on the complete search strategy, see Additional file 1. Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was searched systematically for unpublished or ongoing trials. Electronic searches were complemented by manually screening conference abstract books of major international HPV conferences (EUROGIN 2016, International HPV Conference 2017) as well as reference lists of all identified studies and those of identified reviews. Search results (titles, abstracts, full texts) were independently assessed by two investigators (TH, MWP). Differences were discussed until a consensus was reached.

We did not make any restrictions with regard to setting, language or publication status (published/unpublished). Potential indirect effects of male HPV vaccination on the incidence of clinical outcomes in females were not considered in this review.

### HPV and cervical cancer: screening or vaccination? [^ba921b61]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

VACCINATION OR SCREENING, VACCINATION AND SCREENING

It seems plausible that HPV vaccines will be, on the long run, the answer to cervical cancer and likely the answer to most of the other cancers of the female and male external genital tract. Once the extent of the cross protection is understood and/or additional HPV types are incorporated into the vaccines, the requirements for screening will be further reduced and eventually eliminated. In the interim, HPV vaccination should be made available to most women. The reasoning for it is several fold:

Susceptibility by age

At any given point in time, the prevalence of HPV 16 and/or 18 among women participating in screening activities is low (less that 3% in most populations) and of women exposed to both 16 and 18 is less that 1%. The lifetime cumulative exposure to any of these two viral types is in the order of 20% in high-risk populations. Therefore, the vast majority of women remain susceptible to new infections throughout their sexually active life. Vaccines including HPV 6 and 11 will further increase their attraction for the prevention of genital warts (GWs) in sexually active women and possibly among men as well.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: where to now? [^debb9176]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Second, the expensive HPV vaccines pose a problem in affordability for the poorest countries, requiring other mechanisms for funding the setting up of HPV vaccine programmes. One is that of the GAVI Alliance (formerly the 'Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation'), which currently funds vaccines for the 72 poorest nations worldwide. While GAVI has been a mechanism for introducing new vaccines, and the GAVI Board has endorsed the HPV vaccine in principle, funding for this to be implemented is still needed. Recently announced, and perhaps a step towards helping achieve sustainable public sector access in the most resource-scarce areas of the world, is the pledge by Merck to provide the quadrivalent vaccine to the GAVI Alliance at a price of US$5.00 per dose. Although there are tiered prices for both HPV vaccines for some countries, with opportunities for a 'no-profit price', this is still out of the financial reach of many. Other mechanisms include collective buying potential of countries negotiating prices together such the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) revolving fund whereby countries pay for vaccines obtained at very low prices and as negotiated by the PAHO. One could envisage a partnership, a win–win position for all if those in resource-poor countries with expertise in vaccine manufacturing could partner current vaccine manufacturers to ensure that high-quality vaccines can be produced with more efficient pricing structures. This may allow distribution, not only to females but also to males, which could be very appropriate given the morbidity men suffer from HPV, as well as their role in transmission of HPV to and from women.

### Breaking barriers: why including boys and men is key to HPV prevention [^777581a0]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are no approved screening tests for HPV in men. However, healthcare providers may recommend anal pap smears for men at a higher risk of developing anal cancer, such as those who are immunocompromised or engage in anal intercourse. Vaccination remains the most effective preventative measure against HPV infections and related health issues in men, yet global vaccination coverage for males remains low, standing at a mere 4%. The WHO recommends targeting girls aged 9–14 for HPV vaccinations, but only for males and older women when feasible and affordable. HPV vaccination has been recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first prophylactic HPV vaccine in 2007 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) soon recommended it for both females and males (up to age 26). In 2018, the FDA extended the HPV vaccine approval for use in adults aged 27–45. Currently, six prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed: three bivalent, two quadrivalent, and one nonavalent. The 9-valent HPV Gardasil-9® vaccine is particularly effective, serving as a preventive measure against anogenital lesions and oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers resulting from specific HPV types such as 16/18/31/33/45/52/58.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^898ab68b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review reports on evidence about the efficacy, immunogenicity, and adverse events following reduced dose or alternative vaccine schedules in females and males, HPV vaccination compared to control for males, and effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection.

Summary of main results

Immunogenicity, efficacy and adverse events with fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females

In adolescent girls (9 to 15 years) a two‐dose schedule was non‐inferior to a three‐dose schedule of any HPV vaccine. There was some evidence that GMTs decrease over time following both two‐dose and three‐dose schedules, and that a two‐dose schedule is non‐inferior to a three‐dose schedule after five years. There was no difference in seroconversion between two‐dose and three‐dose schedules at all time points reported; almost all participants seroconverted in both intervention groups. We identified no studies that collected data about efficacy against clinical outcomes. There was very low‐certainty evidence of little to no difference in serious adverse events or deaths between dose schedules. No RCTs that evaluated the efficacy or harms of one dose of HPV vaccine were identified.

Immunogenicity, efficacy and adverse events with different intervals between doses of HPV vaccine in females and males

In both females and males, for all HPV vaccines evaluated, a schedule with a longer interval between doses resulted in higher GMTs than a shorter interval. There was very low certainty evidence on the comparative risk of serious adverse events with different intervals between two‐doses of HPV vaccine, owing to the very low number of events and indirectness. Results from single studies were consistent with lower or higher rates of serious adverse events with the different intervals tested in the studies.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine trials and tribulations: clinical perspectives [^98af9396]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide and is associated with both benign and malignant neoplasms in men and women. It is a double-stranded DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. Forty HPV types are known to infect mucosal keratinocytes. If not cured by the immune system, the infection can lead to genital warts, mucosal dysplasia, or cancer. The most common oncogenic types are 16 and 18. The vaccine to prevent HPV and its associated morbidity and mortality has existed since 2006. Several variations protect against an increasing number of HPV types. The recommended vaccination age is before sexual exposure; administration of the vaccine to children has been controversial. This continuing medical education review evaluates the current HPV vaccines available to clinicians. Part I focuses on the debate over who should be vaccinated, at what age, and in which populations.

### Prophylactic HPV vaccines: prospects for eliminating ano-genital cancer [^517851be]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

A question that is currently generating more heat than light is, who and when to vaccinate? HPV L1 VLP vaccines are prophylactic not therapeutic preventing, not treating infection, and the available evidence is clear that immunisation with them will not be effective in individuals with established HPV infections of the types included in the current vaccines. Genital HPV infection is usually, but not always, sexually transmitted and for effective population-based programmes, immunisation should precede the sexual debut and the target population for vaccination, should therefore be eleven to 12-year-old pre-pubertal girls. Immunologically this is the optimal time because the immune system 'ages' after puberty. Immunogenicity bridging studies from the quadrivalent vaccine looking at antibody concentrations achieved after immunisation in 9- to 15-year-old girls and boys have shown that antibody levels after HPV VLP vaccination are higher in 9- to 10-year-old girls than 13- to 15-year-old girls, and higher in 13- to 15-year-old girls than 16 to 23-year-old women. The levels are higher in 9- to 15-year-old boys than in 9- to 15-year-old girls, suggesting that male immunisation will be effective. Certainly if herd immunity against HPV is to be achieved, and virus transmission interrupted effectively, then boys, as well as girls, should be immunised. However, all the efficacy trials have included women only and there is no efficacy data in men available although trials are ongoing. The arguments against vaccinating boys against the oncogenic HPVs are based on health economic considerations and cost effectiveness. In a heterosexual population, the spread of HPV infection can be stopped entirely by complete protection of one sex alone and dynamic simulation models of HPV transmission show that if high coverage of females can be achieved, there is little to be gained in the additional reduction of cervical cancer by vaccinating males.

### Direct benefit of vaccinating boys along with girls against oncogenic human papillomavirus: Bayesian evidence synthesis [^a5d18932]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implemented in many countries with the specific aim of protecting women against cervical cancer. Inclusion of boys into vaccination programmes for girls is expected to provide some benefit to women, although the benefit will be small if programmes already achieve high coverage among girls. Protection of women should, however, not be the sole public health objective of HPV vaccination because men are also at risk of vaccine preventable cancers. Accumulation of evidence for the role of HPV in the aetiology of cancer in non-cervical sites, and demonstration that HPV vaccine is also effective in preventing non-cervical lesions in men as well as women, have prompted initiatives to vaccinate not only girls but also boys against HPV. Currently, Australia is the only country with a publicly funded HPV immunisation campaign for men.

An often cited obstacle to male HPV vaccination is the prohibitive cost. An economic assessment based on market introduction prices concluded that inclusion of boys in the immunisation programme in the United States exceeded conventional thresholds of cost effective interventions. Vaccine prices, however, have declined since market introduction, and cost requirements need not deter universal vaccination today, even though HPV vaccines are still expensive relative to other vaccines. To decide whether boys should be offered HPV vaccination, we need to assess the burden of HPV associated disease in men and how much of this will be prevented by vaccination of girls. Unless vaccination of girls will eliminate vaccine-type HPV infection from the population, men will remain vulnerable to vaccine preventable cancers, especially men who have sex with men, who are disproportionately affected by HPV related cancer.

The burden of HPV associated cancer in men derives primarily from neoplasms in the anogenital and head and neck regions. The connection between an anogenital or oral HPV infection and history of sexual behaviour is well established in epidemiological studies. In particular, men who have sex with men are, compared with heterosexual men, at high risk for oral and anal HPV infections, though not for penile HPV infections. Hence, men who have sex with men are at increased risk particularly for anal cancer, especially when they also have HIV.

Data extraction

From the eligible studies, two independent reviewers (TH, MWP) used standardized forms to extract study characteristics and assess methodological quality. In case of disagreement, a final decision was made by consensus. The corresponding authors or principal investigators of three studies were contacted for additional data and information. The following data were extracted: study location, study design, study period, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, age at enrolment, duration of follow-up, vaccine used, comparator, study sponsorship, conflict of interests, number (proportion) of vaccinated participants with outcome, number (proportion) of control participants with outcome, unadjusted estimates, adjusted estimates, confounders.

Assessment of risk of bias and quality of evidence

For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, other bias. Studies were categorized as being at "high risk", "low risk" or "unclear risk" of bias. For non-randomized studies, the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used, comprising the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes, bias in selection of the reported results. Risk of bias was categorized as being "low risk", "moderate risk", "serious risk" or "critical risk".

The methodology of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Statistical analysis

Abstracted data were aggregated in tables. Risk ratios, odds ratios, risk differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were either calculated or extracted from the publications. Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness were either extracted from the publications or calculated as [1-(risk ratio or rate ratio comparing vaccine and control recipients)] × 100. Since only one study per outcome and study design was identified in this review, no meta-analyses were performed. According to the review protocol, analyses were performed in two subgroups: (1) all study participants, irrespective of HPV infection at enrolment, and (2) study participants who were seronegative and PCR-negative for the relevant HPV types at enrolment.

### Efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against HPV infection and disease in males [^e575a541]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and diseases caused by HPV are common in boys and men. We report on the safety of a quadrivalent vaccine (active against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and on its efficacy in preventing the development of external genital lesions and anogenital HPV infection in boys and men.

Methods

We enrolled 4065 healthy boys and men 16 to 26 years of age, from 18 countries in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The primary efficacy objective was to show that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced the incidence of external genital lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. Efficacy analyses were conducted in a per-protocol population, in which subjects received all three vaccinations and were negative for relevant HPV types at enrollment, and in an intention-to-treat population, in which subjects received vaccine or placebo, regardless of baseline HPV status.

Results

In the intention-to-treat population, 36 external genital lesions were seen in the vaccine group as compared with 89 in the placebo group, for an observed efficacy of 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40.8 to 73.8); the efficacy was 65.5% (95% CI, 45.8 to 78.6) for lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. In the per-protocol population, efficacy against lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was 90.4% (95% CI, 69.2 to 98.1). Efficacy with respect to persistent infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 and detection of related DNA at any time was 47.8% (95% CI, 36.0 to 57.6) and 27.1% (95% CI, 16.6 to 36.3), respectively, in the intention-to-treat population and 85.6% (97.5% CI, 73.4 to 92.9) and 44.7% (95% CI, 31.5 to 55.6) in the per-protocol population. Injection-site pain was significantly more frequent among subjects receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine than among those receiving placebo (57% vs. 51%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 and the development of related external genital lesions in males 16 to 26 years of age. (Funded by Merck and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090285.).

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^8b45e40a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The focus of this review was on clinical outcomes and harms. Immunogenicity is the primary outcome for many trials of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, however, as noted in the Background, randomised efficacy trials of HPV vaccines were first conducted in women aged 15 to 25 or 26 years (Arbyn 2018). Once efficacy, immunogenicity and safety were established in this age group, non‐randomised bridging studies assessed non‐inferiority of immunogenicity outcomes in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old girls (e.g. Block 2006, Dobson 2013). The International Agency for Research on Cancer regards bridging studies that demonstrate non‐inferiority as a sufficient endpoint for individuals under 16 years of age (IARC 2014). Bridging studies have also demonstrated non‐inferiority of immunogenicity outcomes of a two‐dose schedule in boys aged 9‐ to 14‐years compared to three doses in young women aged 15 to 26 years (Iversen 2016). Use of immunogenicity outcomes has limitations because the immunological correlate of protection and the duration of protection remain unknown (Donken 2015). These studies provide lower certainty of evidence, because estimates of clinical outcomes are imprecise and indirect.

The nonavalent HPV vaccine was introduced more recently than the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. This review included all studies that compared the nonavalent HPV vaccine with other HPV vaccines; two RCTs were identified in females (Joura 2015; Vesikari 2015), and one in males (van Damme 2016). A separate Cochrane Review of completed RCTs of three‐dose schedules with bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines in women aged 16 to 26 years shows protection against lesions of grade CIN3, but not invasive cervical cancer (Arbyn 2018). Further comparisons between the different HPV vaccines in women will be included in an update of the Arbyn 2018 review. Observational studies in countries that have licensed more than one HPV vaccine will also provide important information on the comparative efficacy and harms of the different HPV vaccines.

### FDA licensure of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4, gardasil) for use in males and guidance from the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^7b7b6eba]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

On October 16, 2009, the Food and Drug Administration licensed quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co. Inc.) for use in males aged 9 through 26 years for prevention of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. HPV4 had been licensed previously for use in females aged 9 through 26 years for prevention of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18-related outcomes (i.e., vaginal, vulvar, and cervical precancers and cancers and genital warts). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of females at age 11 or 12 years and catch-up vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years. On October 21, 2009, ACIP provided guidance that HPV4 may be given to males aged 9 through 26 years to reduce their likelihood of acquiring genital warts; ACIP does not recommend HPV4 for routine use among males. This report presents the ACIP policy statement and summarizes background data. Issues reviewed by ACIP included efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the HPV4 vaccine in males, epidemiology of HPV and burden of HPV-associated diseases and cancers in males, cost-effectiveness of male vaccination, and programmatic considerations.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^6b887d61]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Efficacy, immunogenicity and adverse events with HPV vaccines in males

Three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced the incidence of external genital lesions, anogenital warts, and persistent infection by HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18 compared with control among 16‐ to 26‐year‐old males over a median follow‐up of 2.9 years (moderate‐certainty evidence). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (high‐certainty evidence). There was very low certainty evidence on the comparative risk of serious adverse events and low certainty evidence on the comparative risk of deaths between quadrivalent vaccine and control among 10‐ to 26‐year old males. Limited data were available regarding the efficacy and adverse events with bivalent HPV vaccine in males. We identified no RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of nonavalent vaccine compared with control in males.

Efficacy, immunogenicity and adverse events with the nonavalent HPV vaccine compared with other HPV vaccines in females and males

Among 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, three doses of nonavalent vaccine or of quadrivalent vaccine resulted in a similar incidence of clinical outcomes regardless of HPV genotype at up to 4.5‐year follow‐up (one RCT, high certainty evidence). The nonavalent vaccine resulted in reduced incidence of persistent HPV infections, CIN1, CIN 2/3, vulval or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 1) related to the HPV genotypes unique to the nonavalent vaccine (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) compared with the quadrivalent vaccine. Immunogenicity outcomes for nonavalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines were similar for males and females. There was high‐certainty evidence that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in slightly more local or injection site events but little to no difference in overall systemic events. The evidence comparing serious adverse events was of low‐certainty. There was low‐certainty evidence of no difference in mortality between these vaccines. There were few vaccine‐related serious adverse events reported (seven participants in total) in the included studies.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination in males [^bc9b04fb]. Gynecologic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and is frequently presented clinically as anogenital warts in both males and females. There is a high rate of transmission of HPV in female partners of men with pre-existing penile warts, and HPV infection in men has been shown to contribute to HPV infection and subsequent cervical disease in women. HPV is associated with significant morbidity and represents a substantial healthcare burden. Data indicate that males experienced a longer duration of genital warts and incurred greater treatment costs than women. The quadrivalent vaccine, the first vaccine to be approved for use in adolescent and young women aged 9 to 26 years for the prevention of cervical cancer and genital warts, targets HPV types -6, and -11 (responsible for genital warts), and HPV types-16 and -18 (involved in cervical cancer). Pharmacoeconomic data determined that routine administration of a prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine to 12-year-old males and females in addition to catch-up vaccination of 12- to 24-year-old males and females, within the setting of organized cervical cancer screening within the US, was the most cost-effective strategy. It is also anticipated that widespread use of vaccines that offer protection against HPV-6 and -11 could potentially reduce the workload at STD clinics by approximately 10% without a substantial impact on the diagnosis and treatment of other STDs. To optimally control transmission of HPV, consideration should be given to vaccinating males as well as females.

### Naturally acquired genotype-specific HPV seroreactivity and subsequent HPV detection among heterosexual partners [^33f796e2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is among the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. While up to 90% of HPV infections clear within 2 years, persistent infection with high‐risk HPV genotypes (i.e. HPVs 16 and 18) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer and an important cause of other anogenital and head‐and‐neck cancers. Studies on prophylactic HPV vaccination demonstrated its ability to provide strong, long‐term protection against vaccine‐targeted HPV‐genotype infections and related genital diseases for vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, a previous study investigating HPV transmission dynamics in couples reported that, among sexually active females who were vaccinated before study enrollment, transmission of vaccine‐targeted HPV genotypes to their male partners was reduced relative to couples with unvaccinated females. Since virtually all (> 90%) HPV‐vaccinated young adults seroconvert and develop high peak antibody titers postvaccination, serum antibodies likely play an important role in the control and transmission of HPV infections by preventing host cell entry.

Natural HPV infections can likewise induce humoral immune responses; however, seroconversion rates following genital infection with high‐risk HPV are in the range of 40%–60% in females and 4%–36% in males. Among those who seroconvert, antibody titers are often much lower than the levels induced by vaccination. Research on the effect of naturally developed antibodies on subsequent HPV detection at the individual level is inconclusive; several studies have reported that such antibodies have no effect in both females and males, while a recent meta‐analysis found they provide partial protection for genital HPV16 among females. Nevertheless, given that the level of protection provided by naturally developed serum antibodies is suggested to be much lower than the one induced by vaccination, it is unclear whether protection conferred by naturally developed antibodies extends beyond the individual, that is, does it help prevent infection in their sexual partners?

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^59bf6877]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

When pooling was considered feasible, we employed a random‐effects meta‐analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method (DerSimonian 1986), as it was assumed that effect size might vary across studies and settings. We used data from the last available follow‐up for clinical and adverse event outcomes, with the number of participants (rather than the number of events) used in the analysis. For immunological outcomes, we extracted data from one month after the last HPV dose and at the longest‐term follow‐up.

To assess the harms associated with the HPV vaccine comparisons in this review, we recorded the methods used in each included study to collect adverse event data, and extracted data on common events that we determined a priori as: pain, swelling, redness at the injection site and overall systemic adverse events. For all serious adverse events reported in the included studies, we extracted the number of participants, participants with events and a description of the events. We also extracted information on whether the serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccines. We did not conduct statistical hypothesis testing because our protocol did not prespecify hypotheses about differences in the occurrence of any specific serious adverse event.

### Current and future vaccine clinical research with the licensed 2-, 4-, and 9-valent VLP HPV vaccines: what's ongoing, what's needed? [^186c9610]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic HPV vaccination has been a great public health success. For > 20 years, clinical trials were conducted with the 2-, 4-, and/or 9-valent vaccines in young-adult females, mid-adult women, males, and adolescents. In all studies, the vaccines were highly efficacious, immunogenic, and well tolerated. Following vaccine licensure and utilization in national vaccine programs globally (real-world settings primarily in high income countries), numerous studies demonstrated that the vaccines continue to have an excellent safety profile and have dramatically reduced the incidence of genital warts, HPV vaccine-type prevalence, and precancerous lesions. Thirty-eight clinical trials with the currently licensed HPV vaccines are ongoing. Key questions being addressed in new trials include: efficacy against persistent infection and immunogenicity of a 1-dose regimen; efficacy of 3 doses in 20-45-year-old females; use in postpartum women and immunocompromised individuals (HIV, liver and kidney transplants); dose sparing via intradermal administration; use in combination with a PD1 monoclonal antibody in patients with cervical cancer; impact on recurrent disease in women undergoing cervical conization; persistence of protection; and use to prevent oropharyngeal cancer. Additional clinical research that should be conducted includes: long-term follow-up, particularly of 1- and 2-dose regimens; further evaluation of flexible 2-dose regimens; immunogenicity of 1- or 2-dose regimens in persons ≥ 15 years old and immunocompromised populations; safety and immunogenicity of 1 or 2 doses in children < 9 years old; assessment of the vaccine in the prevention of transmission; interchangeability with newer HPV vaccines; additional concomitant use studies; and prevention of penile cancer and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

### HPV vaccine acceptability among men: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7ec2ff8]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), causing a substantial burden of disease in men and women. In the USA, half of sexually active men and women contract HPV at some point in their lives. The prevalence of anal HPV infection is estimated at around 15% in heterosexual men, 60% in men who have sex with men (MSM) who are HIV negative, and 95% in HIV positive MSM.

Worldwide, the majority of anal and penile cancers among men are associated with HPV infection. The high prevalence of anal HPV among MSM is associated with 44 times higher incidence of anal cancer, and among HIV positive MSM approximately 60 times higher incidence of anal cancer than that of the general population. Heterosexual men infected with HPV, in addition to increasing their own risks of anal and penile cancers, may contribute to increasing female sexual partners' risks of developing cervical cancer.

Clinical Question

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^fa4baf06]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision. Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

Adverse events

Appendix 4 lists the methods used to collect adverse event data. The mode of data collection was reported in 16 of the 20 studies and was passive in two studies (e.g. patients recording symptoms on diary cards); proactive in three (e.g. investigators observing participants after vaccine administration, or field workers visiting or calling participants in their homes); both passive and proactive in nine studies; and in two studies, the details were insufficient for us to categorise as passive or proactive. Time frame (duration of follow‐up) was reported for all but three studies; for two studies it was unclear, and one study did not report on adverse events (NCT00941889 2016). Methods to determine the relationship between vaccination and adverse events were reported by 10 studies: attribution was done by study investigators in nine studies and by a study co‐ordinator in one study. Where the attribution method was not reported, we assumed this role was performed by study investigators. Fourteen studies (74%) provided definitions for the adverse events outcomes. Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported in 14 (70%) studies, but most studies (95%) did not report on how withdrawals would be handled in the analysis. Only one study reported harms‐related monitoring and stopping rules (Hidalgo‐Tenorio 2017). Seventeen studies reported on all adverse events regardless of frequency (i.e. they did not use a frequency‐based filter); NCT01862874 2018 used a 5% threshold for other adverse events; it was unclear whether Dobson 2013 used a filter, and one study did not report on adverse events (NCT00941889 2016).

The length of follow‐up for serious adverse events in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Table 2 lists the serious adverse events reported in each study. In all studies, the individual serious events were listed for each study arm. In five of the 20 RCTs, 50 or more serious adverse events were reported (Joura 2015, Lehtinen 2018; Puthanakit 2016; Romanowski 2011; Wilkin 2018). Information on whether serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccine is reported in the section Effects of interventions.

### Parent-son decision-making about human papillomavirus vaccination: a qualitative analysis [^384a8772]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Licensed for use in males in 2009, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in adolescent males are extremely low. Literature on HPV vaccination focuses on females, adult males, or parents of adolescent males, without including adolescent males or the dynamics of the parent-son interaction that may influence vaccine decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to examine the decision-making process of parent-son dyads when deciding whether or not to get vaccinated against HPV.

Methods

Twenty-one adolescent males (ages 13–17), with no previous HPV vaccination, and their parents/guardians were recruited from adolescent primary care clinics serving low to middle income families in a large Midwestern city. Dyad members participated in separate semi-structured interviews assessing the relative role of the parent and son in the decision regarding HPV vaccination. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded using inductive content analysis.

Results

Parents and sons focused on protection as a reason for vaccination; parents felt a need to protect their child, while sons wanted to protect their own health. Parents and sons commonly misinterpreted the information about the vaccine. Sons were concerned about an injection in the penis, while some parents and sons thought the vaccine would protect them against other sexually transmitted infections including Herpes, Gonorrhea, and HIV. Parents and sons recalled that the vaccine prevented genital warts rather than cancer. The vaccine decision-making process was rapid and dynamic, including an initial reaction to the recommendation for HPV vaccine, discussion between parent and son, and the final vaccine decision. Provider input was weighed in instances of initial disagreement. Many boys felt that this was the first health care decision that they had been involved in. Dyads which reported shared decision-making were more likely to openly communicate about sexual issues than those that agreed the son made the decision.

Conclusion

Parents and sons play an active role in the decision-making process, with an individual's role being influenced by many factors. The results of this study may be used to guide the messages presented by clinicians when recommending the HPV vaccine, and future vaccine uptake interventions.

### Committee opinion no. 588: human papillomavirus vaccination [^cdff8250]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination routinely be targeted to females and males aged 11 years or 12 years as part of the adolescent immunization platform to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers and genital warts associated with HPV infection. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use in males and females, whereas the bivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use only in females. For those not vaccinated at the target age, catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many patients in the initial HPV vaccination target group, they have the opportunity to educate mothers about the importance of vaccinating their children at the recommended age and are critical to vaccinating adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period. Obstetrician-gynecologists should advise patients and parents that HPV vaccines are most effective in preventing genital cancers when administered before the onset of sexual activity. However, sexually active individuals can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in persons aged 13 years through 26 years. Although HPV vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended, neither is routine pregnancy testing before vaccination. Lactating women can receive either HPV vaccine. The need for ongoing cervical cytology screening should be emphasized in all women aged 21 years and older, even those who received HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included RCTs with no language restrictions. We included unpublished studies, studies in press, and abstracts without a full‐text publication, if they met the inclusion criteria.

Types of participants

Females or males aged 9 to 26 years, including MSM. For the comparisons among people living with HIV, we included all age groups.

Types of interventions

Prophylactic administration of licensed bivalent (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline), quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), or nonavalent (Gardasil 9, Merck) HPV vaccines. We excluded studies if they assessed monovalent or plasmid vaccines, or assessed non‐prophylactic uses of bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccines. In addition, we considered for inclusion any trials reporting on the efficacy, immunogenicity, or adverse events in vaccines currently in phase 2 or 3 development. Studies comparing bivalent versus quadrivalent vaccines were excluded, as these will be included in an update of a separate Cochrane Review (Arbyn 2018).

For males and people living with HIV, we included comparisons of HPV vaccines to placebo containing no adjuvant or only the adjuvant of the HPV vaccine, or another HPV vaccine.

In this review, we use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products that contain another vaccine or only vaccine adjuvants, regardless of the terminology used in individual study reports. We use the term 'placebo' only to refer to comparator products containing no adjuvant or active vaccine. In Characteristics of included studies we have reported full details of the type of comparison group compound.

The focus of the review was on different dose schedules and comparisons between different types of HPV vaccine. Where possible we stratified data by participant characteristics of age, gender, and HIV status. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of:

fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females and males;
different intervals between doses in a two‐dose schedule in females and males;
HPV vaccination compared to control for males (a Cochrane Review for females has been published (Arbyn 2018));
nonavalent HPV vaccine compared to the other HPV vaccines in females and males;
HPV vaccination in people living with HIV.

### Primary immunization of human papillomavirus vaccine in the pediatric population: what is the verdict now? [^6771d1c0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of a 2-dose series for the human papillomavirus vaccines rather than a 3-dose series in older children has not been well defined. This article reviews the literature summarizing the use of all 3 HPV vaccines (2vHPV, 4vHPV, 9vHPV) as a 2-dose series for females and 4vHPV and 9vHPV for males younger than 15 years. Six prospective trials evaluating immunogenicity of a 2-dose series of 2vHPV and/or 4vHPV, as well as an ongoing prospective clinical trial for 9vHPV, are discussed. The 2-dose series with Gardasil 9 ® in both males and females ages 9 to 14 years appears to be the most widely accepted recommendation. The exact time schedule between the 2 vaccines varies among studies, but it seems that they should be separated by 6 to 12 months. Federal and world-wide organizations' (ie, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and World Health Organization) opinions and recommendations on the appropriate scheduling of the vaccines are also highlighted.

### Parent-son decision-making about human papillomavirus vaccination: a qualitative analysis [^8ddfc01b]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There were many perceived benefits and few perceived risks associated with HPV vaccination of males. Decision-making about vaccination was an activeprocess involving both parents and sons. The health care provider was seen as playing an essential role in providing information and correcting misperceptions about HPV vaccination. Furthermore, this particular decision may provide an opportunity for the adolescents to become involved with decisions about their health care. Clinicians may use the results of this study to inform the way they present information on HPV vaccine to adolescent male patients and their parents.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — catch-up through age 26 years: ACIP states that catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. The ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. The document notes that before the June 2019 ACIP update, recommendations for men ages 22 to 26 years differed from those for women, and that catch-up vaccination recommendations are now harmonized for all persons through age 26 years.

Background

Description of the condition

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract in women and men (WHO 2017). Although most HPV infections resolve spontaneously, persistent infections can lead to precancerous lesions and cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and head and neck. HPV‐related cancers accounted for an estimated 4.5% of all cancers worldwide in 2012 (de Martel 2017). When stratified by sex, these represent 8.6% of cancers in women and 0.8% of cancers in men, and by development status, 6.7% of all cancers in low‐ and middle‐income countries and 2.8% in high‐income countries (de Martel 2017). In 2012, of an estimated 636,000 HPV‐related cancers worldwide, 530,000 were cervical cancer, 35,000 anal cancer, 8500 vulval cancer, 13,000 penile cancer, and 37,000 head and neck cancers (de Martel 2017).

Amongst women with normal cytological findings, the worldwide prevalence of infection with any HPV genotype has been estimated in a meta‐analysis to be 11.7%, with higher prevalence in sub‐Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, south‐east Asia and eastern Europe (Bruni 2010). Amongst heterosexual men assessed at baseline in a multicentre trial in 18 countries in Africa, Asia‐Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America, penile infection with any HPV genotype was found in 18.7%, scrotal infection in 13.1%, perianal infection in 7.9% and infection at any site in 21.0%. Prevalence was highest in Africa and lowest in the Asia‐Pacific region (Vardas 2011). Prevalence of HPV infections in general is higher in men with HIV infection, men who have sex with men (MSM), and highest in MSM with HIV infection (Schim van der Loeff 2014; Smith 2011).

### Trends in human papillomavirus-associated cancers-United States, 1999–2015 [^78500c1f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Measures to prevent HPV-associated diseases in the United States include both females and males; HPV vaccination was included in the routine immunization program for females in 2006 and for males in 2011. Although it might be too soon for effects on invasive cancers from HPV vaccination in the United States, studies have reported reductions in cervical HPV infection, genital warts, and cervical precancers. Most cervical cancers are preventable with both HPV vaccination and regular and timely screening among women aged 21–65 years with follow-up for abnormal test results. Routine HPV vaccination is recommended at age 11 or 12 years; currently, the 9-valent HPV vaccine, which targets oncogenic types attributed to 73% of HPV-associated cancers, is being used in the United States. Further research to understand the progression from HPV infection to oropharyngeal cancer would be beneficial. Continued surveillance through high-quality registries is important to monitor changes in HPV-associated cancer incidence.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^3c1748ef]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Adults (27–45 years) — the HPV vaccine is licensed in the United States for women and men through age 45 years. Although administration is safe in patients aged 27–45 and can prevent new infections in women not previously exposed, most women in this age range will already have been exposed to HPV, and the overall public health benefit in women aged 27–45 years is markedly diminished compared with use in the target age range. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d67b6386]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^f03e4b62]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

We prepared 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison for which data were available for the following outcomes that were assessed as critical or important according to GRADE guidelines (Guyatt 2011d):

for females: high‐grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer; high‐grade vulval and vaginal disease;
for males: invasive anal or penile cancer, external genital lesions;
for all populations: anogenital warts, overall local/injection site adverse events, overall systemic events and general symptoms, serious adverse events, deaths;
for comparisons of dose schedules (i.e. number of doses and longer or shorter interval between doses): immunological outcomes.

We assessed the certainty of evidence in the review through discussion between review authors using the GRADE approach using GRADEpro online software (GRADEpro GDT). We assessed only the primary outcomes reported in the 'Summary of findings' tables and appendices using GRADE. We considered the following factors for downgrading: limitations in the study design (risk of bias); inconsistency of results (heterogeneity); indirectness of evidence (applicability); imprecision (few events and wide confidence intervals); and publication bias (Guyatt 2011a). When evidence was downgraded, we detailed the reasons in footnotes of the 'Summary of findings' tables and summarised these in the Quality of the evidence section. Depending on whether evidence was downgraded or not, we rated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as follows:

high‐certainty evidence indicates that we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect (evidence was not downgraded);
moderate‐certainty evidence indicates that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different (evidence was downgraded one step for any of the factors described above);
low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect (evidence was downgraded two steps for any of the factors described above);
very low‐certainty evidence indicates that we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect (evidence was downgraded three steps for any of the factors described above).

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^2a79f560]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to serious adverse events, there is a large degree of uncertainty in the evidence comparing different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules. The 'Summary of findings' tables show low numbers of serious adverse events and deaths in most included studies. Even when the total number of events is high (e.g. Joura 2015), specific events of clinical relevance are still too rare for meaningful comparative analyses. In this review, we used a composite outcome, that is, the overall frequency of serious adverse events, for each comparison, however, analyses based on a composite outcome can produce results that are difficult to interpret for several reasons. This outcome can include events that are not clinically relevant or are not biologically related to the vaccine (Lineberry 2016), occur outside a plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure (Huang 2011), or are not based on standardised definitions (Bonhoeffer 2002). In addition, trials measure serious adverse events at different time points and there is a large variation in duration of follow‐up, which could produce misleading summary estimates (Huang 2011). Finally, there is heterogeneity among trials with regard to the age and gender of participants and clinical measurements of serious adverse events (Appendix 4). Meta‐analyses of serious adverse events, such as those presented in this review, should be considered exploratory rather than confirmatory as the analyses are not planned in advance (i.e. when the included studies were designed) (Huang 2011). Despite the uncertainty in the evidence about harms when comparing different HPV vaccines and dose schedules, a previous systematic review reported similar rates of serious adverse events when HPV vaccines were compared to control (Arbyn 2018).

Quality of the evidence

The risk of bias of the included studies in this review is generally low. We rated studies that received funding from the vaccine manufacturer as 'unclear' for the 'other risk of bias' domain. This judgement was based on the results of a systematic review which showed more favourable efficacy results and conclusions in studies sponsored by manufacturing companies (Lundh 2017). It has been suggested that industry sponsorship of studies results in overly positive results through a variety of choices in the design and conduct of the trials that leads to bias. Based on the low risk of bias in other methodological domains and adequate reporting in the trials, we did not downgrade the certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this factor. In accordance with Higgins 2017, information on industry sponsorship and other funding sources is captured in the Characteristics of included studies tables.

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases: a network meta-analysis [^e591dad6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer‐related death amongst females worldwide. Persistent infection with high‐risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the key factor in cervical cancer development. HPV vaccines aim to prevent cancer by generating antibodies against HPV infection.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines, in females and males, to prevent cervical cancer and other HPV‐related diseases, in standard (pairwise) and network meta‐analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials.

Search methods

On 10 January 2022, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase. We searched Epistemonikos, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Health Technology Assessment database and vaccine manufacturer websites, and we checked reference lists from other relevant systematic reviews. We applied for Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) from the European Medicines Agency. An update search of electronic databases was done on 18 September 2024.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regardless of language or publication status, assessing HPV vaccines pre‐qualified by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Cervarix, Gardasil, Gardasil‐9 and Cecolin).

Data collection and analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We primarily used CSRs to collect data, and we included outcome data irrespective of participants' baseline HPV infection or serostatus. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool (RoB 2). All outcomes were dichotomous, and we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used pairwise analysis for all outcomes. Where data were available, we carried out NMA for critical outcomes for networks in females and males in three age groups, ranking the vaccines using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and mean ranks. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included 60 individual studies with 157,414 participants ranging in follow‐up from seven months to 11 years. Few participants were under 15. There were no studies for males under 15 years and males over 25 years. We obtained CSRs for 33 of the included studies. We assessed the risk of bias as low to 'some concerns' for the critical outcomes.

Cancer and pre‐cancer outcomes

The studies were not of sufficient duration for cancers to develop. Four studies reported on cancer. No cancers were detected.

Critical pre‐cancer outcomes were reported in 15‐ to 25‐year‐old populations by 11 studies and in > 25‐year‐old females by three studies with up to seven years follow‐up. None were reported in the under 15 years age group.

In 15‐ to 25‐year‐old females, there was a reduction in CIN2+ irrespective of HPV type after six years (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88) (moderate‐certainty) and a larger reduction in CIN2+ from vaccine‐matched HPV types after six years (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54) (moderate‐certainty). In females over 25 years old, there was little to no difference between Cervarix and Gardasil compared with control (moderate‐certainty). There was no evidence on CIN2+ irrespective of HPV type from studies assessing Cecolin, or from studies assessing different dose schedules.

In 15‐ to 25‐year‐old females, there was a slight reduction in vaccine‐matched HPV‐type high‐grade vulval (VIN) or vaginal (VaIN) intraepithelial neoplasia following vaccination with Gardasil or Gardasil‐9 (moderate‐certainty). The NMA found a slight reduction of 1 case per 1000 following Gardasil (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.45) and 0 cases per 1000 following Gardasil‐9 (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.51). Little to no difference was found in the NMA for Cervarix compared with control (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.37), or for Cervarix, Gardasil and Gardasil‐9 compared to each other.

There was a reduction in high‐grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) irrespective of HPV type in the Gardasil group in one study in men who have sex with men (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.07) (low‐certainty).

For both high‐grade penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN) irrespective of HPV type and vaccine‐matched HPV‐type high‐grade PeIN, little to no difference per 1000 participants was reported in the Gardasil group in one study with 3880 participants at 36 months follow‐up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.93) (low‐certainty).

Serious adverse events

In a pairwise analysis of serious adverse events in 39 studies across all vaccine types with 97,272 participants, there was little to no difference in the HPV vaccine groups compared with the control group at up to 72 months follow‐up (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04) (high‐certainty).

Treatment rates for HPV‐related pre‐invasive disease

In pairwise analysis of five studies with 38,606 participants, there were 12 fewer people that needed to seek treatment per 1000 participants (95% CI 5 to 17 fewer per 1000) in the HPV vaccine groups compared with the control group rate at up to 84 months follow‐up (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89) (moderate‐certainty).

Anogenital warts

In pairwise analysis of three studies with 21,271 participants, there were 25 fewer cases of anogenital warts irrespective of HPV type per 1000 participants (95% CI 22 to 28 fewer per 1000) in the HPV vaccine groups compared with the control group rate at up to 48 months follow‐up (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.46) (high‐certainty). In the NMA for females 15 to 25 years old, Gardasil‐9 was most likely to reduce the risk of developing anogenital warts.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence in this network meta‐analysis of HPV vaccines is based on extensive searches and analyses. There is evidence from randomised controlled trials that HPV vaccination reduces the risk of pre‐cancerous outcomes such as CIN2+ and anogenital warts. No data were available for cervical cancer or other cancer outcomes, and no data on pre‐cancer outcomes were available for vaccination under age 15 years. There were no safety concerns noted in the studies.

Ongoing studies

We identified 15 potentially relevant ongoing studies that have not been completed, but might be relevant for inclusion in future updates of this review. All studies are RCTs and studies may appear in more than one category of the list below:

eight include healthy females (NCT01735006; NCT02009800; NCT02405520; NCT02562508; NCT02733068; NCT02740777; NCT02834637; NCT03180034);
four include healthy males and females (NCT01824537; NCT02567955; NCT02710851; NCT02888418);
one includes HIV‐positive MSM (NCT02087384);
one includes males and females cured of genital warts (NCT03296397);
one includes females with genital warts (NCT02750202);
seven are evaluating new vaccines in development in China (NCT01735006; NCT02405520; NCT02562508; NCT02710851; NCT02733068; NCT02740777; NCT02888418);
four are evaluating the quadrivalent vaccine (NCT02009800; NCT02087384; NCT02750202; NCT03296397);
one is evaluating the nonavalent vaccine (NCT01824537); and
three are comparing the bivalent to the nonavalent vaccine (NCT02567955; NCT02834637; NCT03180034).

In addition to the seven studies ongoing in China, three of these studies are ongoing in Canada, and one study each in Costa Rica, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and Tanzania. See Characteristics of ongoing studies for further details.

Excluded studies

We excluded 438 full texts. Twenty‐two of these were potentially relevant studies, and the reasons for their exclusion are included in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. We excluded six studies because they were not RCTs, and two studies because they included females over 26 years of age. Most of the excluded studies contained no comparison of relevance to the review: seven studies compared HPV‐vaccinated to HPV‐unvaccinated females, five compared different intervals in three‐dose schedules in females, one compared three‐dose schedules of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccine in young females, and one evaluated the effect of a booster dose of HPV vaccine.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^b2c3bf31]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for Use of HPV Vaccines

ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. † Vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV.

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^dbc9f0d9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

Primary outcomes

Unless otherwise stated, primary outcomes were assessed at the longest follow‐up time reported by the included studies.

Invasive cervical, vaginal, vulval, anal, or penile cancer
In females, histologically‐confirmed high‐grade cervical (CIN2, CIN3, and adenocarcinoma in situ), vaginal, vulval, or anal intraepithelial neoplasia, irrespective of HPV genotype, or any lesions associated with the HPV genotypes included in the vaccine
In males, histologically‐confirmed anal, or penile, perianal or perineal intraepithelial neoplasia of any grade, irrespective of HPV genotype, or any lesions associated with the HPV genotypes included in the vaccine
Anogenital warts
Adverse events related to the vaccines: local adverse events (overall local/injection site adverse events, redness, swelling, pain at the injection site), assessed at the follow‐up times reported in the trials (usually up to seven days); overall systemic events and general symptoms assessed at the follow‐up times reported in the trials (usually up to 15 days)
Serious adverse events and mortality: any events that are fatal, life‐threatening, or result in hospitalisation and mortality. We collected information from each trial about whether these events were considered to be vaccine‐related and the methods of adverse events data monitoring and collection, including mode of data collection, timing, attribution methods, intensity of ascertainment, harms‐related monitoring and stopping rules, and reporting based on event frequency (i.e. frequency‐based filter), based on the CONSORT statement extension for reporting harms (Ioannidis 2004; Lineberry 2016).

HPV-associated disease burden in the United States — HPV is associated with cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer in females, penile cancer in males, and anal cancer and oropharyngeal cancer in both females and males, and the burden also includes cervical precancers such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (≥ CIN2). In the United States, approximately 64% of invasive HPV-associated cancers are attributable to HPV 16 or 18 (65% for females; 63% for males; approximately 21,300 cases annually) and 10% are attributable to the five additional types in 9vHPV: HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 (14% for females; 4% for males; approximately 3,400 cases annually). HPV 16 or 18 account for 66% and the five additional types for about 15% of cervical cancers, and approximately 50% of ≥ CIN2 are caused by HPV 16 or 18 and 25% by the five additional types.

Introduction

There are some 30–40 genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) that cause anogenital lesions in humans, primarily cervical, vaginal, and vulvar dysplasias and cancer in women, anal dysplasias in some men, and genital warts in both sexes.

Methods

Both GlaxoSmithKline and Merck companies are developing vaccines for the prevention of HPV infection.

Results

Both vaccines stimulate an antibody response against HPV types 16 and 18; the Merck vaccine also include HPV types 6 and 11.

Conclusions

This report focuses on progress with both prophylactic vaccines and introduces strategies for global immunization.

### Direct benefit of vaccinating boys along with girls against oncogenic human papillomavirus: Bayesian evidence synthesis [^5d1e0fe4]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Our study pinpoints which parameters govern the incremental benefit of male HPV vaccination. At moderate uptake among girls, the key parameters are related to reductions in heterosexual transmission from vaccination of girls and the aetiologic fraction of HPV in oropharyngeal cancer. If vaccine uptake among girls approaches 90%, the key parameters will be predominantly related to men who have sex with men, who are not protected by reduced heterosexual transmission. As of now, anal carcinomas contribute less to the burden of vaccine preventable cancers in men than might be expected on the basis of their large HPV attributable risk, but they will constitute the major burden of HPV related cancer if vaccine uptake among preadolescent girls continues to rise.

Implications and considerations for HPV vaccination campaigns

The causal relation of HPV with cervical cancer was recognised before HPV was implied in the aetiology of cancer in non-cervical sites. The decision to offer vaccination freely to preadolescent girls was motivated by considerations of burden of disease and cost effectiveness. The burden of cervical cancer before HPV vaccination had been estimated at 50–60 QALYs per 1000 women, up to four times the burden of anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer in men combined. In the Netherlands the number of girls that needed to be vaccinated to gain one QALY from cervical disease prevention was about 25 and around 200 to prevent one case of cervical cancer. At the current 60% vaccine uptake among preadolescent girls in the Netherlands, 109 boys would need to be vaccinated to gain one male QALY and around 800 to prevent one case of cancer among men. These numbers are substantially higher than those that motivated vaccination of girls to protect women against cervical cancer, even if we consider all tumours that have an acknowledged link with HPV. Provision of HPV vaccine to women thus constitutes equitable policy if one adheres to the view that those most affected by disease should be considered first in a rational resource allocation scheme. The burden of HPV related cancer among men is nonetheless substantial, even after herd immunity from vaccination of girls is taken into account.

### Human papillomavirus DNA in men who have sex with men: type-specific prevalence, risk factors and implications for vaccination strategies [^2ce625e4]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Quadrivalent vaccine trials show efficacy against anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) in men. In participants with no evidence of prior infection receiving three doses, vaccination was 78% (95% CI 40–93) efficacious against HPV 6/11/16/18-related AIN and 95% (95% CI 80–99) against persistent anal HPV infection (6/11/16/18) in 16–26 year old MSM, and 90% (95% CI 69–98) efficacious against 6/11/16/18-related external genital lesions (principally genital warts;). In the intention-to-treat analyses, including those with prior HPV infection, efficacy was lower, but still substantial, at 50% (95% CI 26–67) against AIN and 66% (95% CI 41–74) against genital warts. Given the efficacy against cervical, vulval, vaginal and now anal disease, it is expected that vaccines will protect against other HPV16/18-related cancers for example penile and oropharyngeal. Vaccination may also benefit previously exposed individuals.

Prevalence of HPV DNA in genital specimens does not measure cumulative exposure as 70% of genital high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections in men clear by 12 months. Nevertheless, age-specific DNA prevalence, linked to behavioural data, gives valuable insights into the epidemiology of HPV. A systematic review of HPV in MSM reported a pooled anal prevalence estimate of 64% for any HPV and 37% for any HR-HPV in HIV-negative MSM.

Given the relatively high rates of HPV-related ano-genital disease, lack of herd immunity, and the increasing recognition of the burden of other HPV-related disease, the question arises: is it worthwhile to vaccinate MSM? Sexual health clinics (SHC) may offer a convenient setting to vaccinate MSM. In the absence of evidence of any therapeutic benefits (in clearing or preventing disease owing to prevalent HPV infections;), the expected benefit of HPV vaccination in this setting is maximised when the prior exposure level is low but the future risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable infections and disease remains high.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^cd759357]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — regulatory scope and core recommendations — notes that three vaccines covering 2, 4, or 9 HPV serotypes have been approved, with bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines approved for women and men aged 9–26 years, the 9‑valent vaccine approved for women and men aged 9–45 years, and the 9‑valent vaccine currently the only HPV vaccine available in the United States. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys at 11–12 years, but it may be given from the age of 9 years. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch‑up period (ages 13–26 years) regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation if they were not vaccinated at 11–12 years. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccines [^6499a257]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are among the most effective vaccines available, the first to prevent infection by a mucosatropic sexually transmitted infectious agent and to do so without specific induction of mucosal immunity. Currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines are based on virus-like particles that self-assemble spontaneously from the L1 major capsid protein. The first HPV vaccine was licensed in 2006. All vaccines target HPV-16 and HPV-18, types which cause the majority of HPV-attributable cancers. As of 2020, HPV vaccines had been introduced into national immunization programs in more than 100 countries. Vaccination polices have evolved; most programs target vaccination of young adolescent girls, with an increasing number also including boys. The efficacy and safety found in prelicensure trials have been confirmed by data from national immunization programs. The dramatic impact and effectiveness observed has stimulated interest in ambitious disease reduction goals.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^684ee074]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations — ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years; the vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years; vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3‑dose series, and males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated; vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV, and vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV; 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers, 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types which account for about 15% of cervical cancers, and 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11; vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^c1543ab4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Unless otherwise stated, secondary outcomes were assessed at the longest follow‐up time reported by the included studies.

Incident infection with vaccine HPV genotypes (HPV 16 and HPV 18 jointly; HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16 and HPV 18 jointly; and HPV 31, HPV 33, HPV 45, HPV 52, and HPV 58 jointly)
Persistent infection (persisting for at least six months or at least 12 months) with vaccine HPV genotypes
Immunological outcomes (geometric mean titre (GMT) and seropositivity), assessed at one month following the last dose and at the longest‐term follow‐up

For the comparisons of dose schedules (i.e. number of doses and longer or shorter interval(s) between doses) we considered immunological outcomes as primary outcomes because these trials were designed to show non‐inferiority of immunogenicity. While these trials were not designed to evaluate efficacy or safety of the vaccines, we have included clinical outcomes when reported and comparative estimates of harms associated with the different dose schedules.

### Epidemiology and pathology of HPV disease in males [^23db2a2c]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

It is currently recognized that besides the significant impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in females, HPV causes substantial disease in men as well. Genital warts are a common manifestation of male infection with HPV. Genital warts are highly infectious and approximately 65% of people who have sex with an infected partner will develop warts themselves. More than 90% of genital warts are caused by non-oncogenic HPV types 6 and 11. In addition, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a rare disease most often associated with HPV types 6 and 11. Several cancers of the anogenital tract and upper aero-digestive tract, and their precursor lesions in men are now understood to be caused by infection with sexually transmitted HPV. For example, there is increasing incidence of anal cancer in western countries; however, there are limited data on its primary cause, anal canal HPV infection. Genital HPV infection is very common in men with an ongoing international study estimating a prevalence of 65.2% in asymptomatic males aged 18–70 years. Lifetime number of sexual partners was the most significant risk factor for the acquisition of HPV infection (P < 0.05), and circumcision has been associated with reduced detection of HPV infection in men. HPV infections may be less likely to persist in men than in women. In men, the median time to clearance of any HPV infection was 5.9 months, with 75% of infections clearing within 12 months. More data are needed to better understand the natural history of HPV infection. Although the quadrivalent HPV vaccine has been shown to be effective and safe in men, low awareness of HPV in males may be a barrier to its use for the prevention of HPV infection.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^8e5e627b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — disease burden and coverage impact: Of the more than 150 HPV genotypes, 13 genotypes have been shown to cause cervical cancer. Despite the success of cervical cancer screening in the United States, each year cervical cancer is diagnosed in more than 13,000 women and nearly 4,000 die from the disease. Approximately 90% of cases of genital warts are caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11. Despite the benefits of HPV vaccines, only 54% of women and 49% of men in the recommended age groups have received all recommended doses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if health care professionals increase HPV vaccination rates in eligible recipients to 80% in the target age range, it is estimated that an additional 53,000 cases of cervical cancer could be prevented during the lifetimes of those younger than 12. Furthermore, for every year that HPV vaccination rates do not increase, an additional 4,400 women will develop cervical cancer.

### Ten years of human papillomavirus vaccination in the United States [^04909f33]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Since human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was first introduced for females in the United States in 2006, vaccination policy has evolved as additional HPV vaccines were licensed and new data became available. The United States adopted a gender neutral routine HPV immunization policy in 2011, the first country to do so. Vaccination coverage is increasing, although it remains lower than for other vaccines recommended for adolescents. There are various reasons for low coverage, and efforts are ongoing to increase vaccine uptake. The safety profile of HPV vaccine has been well established from 10 years of postlicensure monitoring. Despite low coverage, the early effects of the HPV vaccination program have exceeded expectations.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^70036f55]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine efficacy — HPV vaccines are among the most effective vaccines worldwide, with unequivocal data demonstrating greater than 99% efficacy when administered to women who have not been exposed to that particular type of HPV, and the HPV vaccine significantly reduces anogenital cancer and genital warts in women and in men and may decrease the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer. In the United States, the prevalence of vaccine-type HPV infection decreased 71% among women aged 14–19 years between 2006 and 2014, and countries with high HPV vaccine coverage have had a marked reduction in genital warts. The 9-valent HPV vaccine protects against more than 99% of HPV disease related to genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 and up to 96.7% for HPV disease related to genotypes 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, including prevention of cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal disease; the HPV vaccine is a prophylactic vaccine used to prevent disease, and current data does not support its use as a therapeutic vaccine.

### Risk factors for and prevention of human papillomaviruses (HPV), genital warts and cervical cancer [^500166bc]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Genital HPV infection is associated with development of cervical cancer, cervical neoplasia, anogenital warts, and other anogenital cancers. A number of reviews have primarily addressed the role of HPV infection in cervical carcinogenesis, and differences in human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes found in cervical cancer cases by histology and geographical region. This review provides an informative summary of the broad body of literature on the burden of HPV, the risk factors for HPV infection, genital warts and cervical cancer, and preventive measures against these conditions in females. Studies have identified the main risk factors for genital HPV infection in females as follows: acquisition of new male partners; an increasing number of lifetime sexual partners both in females and their male partners; and having non-monogamous male partners. Cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination are the primary measures currently recommended to prevent cervical cancer. There is also an ongoing debate and conflicting findings on whether male circumcision and condom use protect against HPV infection and subsequent development of HPV-related illnesses in females.

### Use of a 2-dose schedule for human papillomavirus vaccination-updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^68e71260]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases: a network meta-analysis [^19f57fc5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Serious adverse events

We did not carry out NMA due to concerns about transitivity. Thirty‐nine trials reported 1 fewer case per 1000 participants (95% CI 3 fewer to 2 more) in the HPV vaccine groups compared with the control groups at up to 72 months follow‐up (high‐certainty evidence; Table 1). The results in females 14 years or younger, females 15 to 25 years old, females over 25 years and in males were consistent with the overall effect (Table 7; Table 8), but the certainty of the evidence for the different comparisons within these population groups ranged from high to very low.

Completeness

We have performed an extensive review of the literature and engaged with clinicians and experts in this area to perform a rigorous and comprehensive search for the literature in this field. We also obtained information identified by Jorgensen et al. (Jørgensen 2018a; Jørgensen 2018c), included open access clinical study reports (CSRs) from pharmaceutical companies and made applications to the European Medicines Agency for CSRs for other studies. Despite our extensive efforts, there may be missing data (see Potential biases in the review process), but whether this would make a material difference to the main results, as we have included studies with 157,414 participants, is a moot point. Ideally, we would have longer‐term follow‐up data of more than 10 years from previous studies, but it is unlikely that these data will be forthcoming due to challenges in successfully obtaining follow‐up and funding for such studies.

Applicability

This review demonstrates the limitations of RCTs in examining important long‐term and/or rare outcomes, be they harms or benefits, of an intervention for disease with a long natural history. In addition, RCTs are unable to estimate the effects of vaccination strategies at a population level, where reducing the level of infection within a population can benefit both those vaccinated and those unvaccinated, if coverage is sufficient to induce a degree of herd immunity, so the magnitude of effect of vaccination may be underestimated at an individual level. There are, of course, well‐recognised concerns regarding the applicability of results that arise from selected participants in research settings, and whether similar findings could be obtained across diverse communities and healthcare systems. This review should therefore be read in conjunction with its partner review (Henschke 2025), which examines the population‐level effects of HPV vaccination in a variety of different non‐RCT types.

### Factors affecting transmission of mucosal human papillomavirus [^5435bd10]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The effect of HPV on public health is especially related to the burden of anogenital cancers, most notably cervical cancer. Determinants of exposure to HPV are similar to those for most sexually transmitted infections, but determinants of susceptibility and infectivity are much less well established. Gaps exist in understanding of interactions between HPV, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections. The roles of mucosal immunology, human microbiota at mucosal surfaces, host genetic factors and hormonal concentrations on HPV susceptibility and infectivity are poorly understood, as are the level of effectiveness of some primary or secondary preventive measures other than HPV vaccination (such as condoms, male circumcision, and combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV). Prospective couples studies, studies focusing on mucosal immunology, and in-vitro raft culture studies mimicking HPV infection might increase understanding of the dynamics of HPV transmission.

### Upper age limits for US male human papillomavirus vaccination for oropharyngeal cancer prevention: a microsimulation-based modeling study [^89a4f845]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are highly (> 95%) efficacious in preventing infections at the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oral cavity and oropharynx; anogenital warts; anogenital precancers; and cervical cancers and have led to population-level declines in many of these outcomes in several countries. HPV vaccination was introduced for US females and males in 2006 and 2011, respectively. For both sexes, routine vaccination is recommended for ages 9–12 years and catch-up vaccination for ages 13–26 years and through shared decision making for ages 27–45 years.

A key question is the value of HPV vaccination at ages 27–45 years. This question is particularly important for US men. First, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer incidence has increased more than 200% since the 1990s in US men. Today, more than 70% of oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV, primarily HPV16 (approximately 90%). HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is the most common HPV-associated cancer in the United States, accounting for approximately 77% of the burden of HPV-associated cancers in men. Second, current recommendations for US men aged 27–45 years are based on microsimulation models that consider HPV infection at the person level rather than the anatomic site level. This is notable because the natural history of HPV infections differs across sites. Third, vaccination is the only prevention tool for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers because there are no screening methods. Fourth, a low proportion (< 5%) of US men aged 27–45 years in 2021 have been vaccinated.

We developed a microsimulation-based natural history model for oral HPV16 acquisition and progression to HPV16-positive oropharyngeal cancer for US men to estimate the ages at acquisition of causal oral HPV16 infections in the absence of vaccination. Then, across vaccination scenarios, we evaluated the benefit of vaccination of US men aged 27–45 years for prevention of oropharyngeal cancers.

United States human papillomavirus (HPV)–attributable cancer burden and vaccine uptake — For the period from 2012 to 2016, an average of 34,800 cancers annually in the United States were attributable to HPV infection, and ninety-two percent of these cases (32,100) were attributable to the types targeted by the 9-valent HPV vaccine, the only vaccine formulation distributed in the United States since 2016. According to the National Immunization Survey-Teen, in 2018, 68.1% of adolescents (male and female) aged 13 to 17 years had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and 51.1% were up to date with the HPV vaccine series.

### Awareness of oral and genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in young adolescents prior to gender-neutral vaccination [^d8ef9782]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) and oropharyngeal cancer prevalence are increasing, particularly in men. Raising greater awareness of male HPV disease is perceived as an important intervention strategy. This study investigated the effectiveness of HPV education on adolescents' perception of HPV disease and the impact of HPV vaccination on their sexual health.

Methods

An HPV questionnaire was completed by 357 UK-based adolescents, aged 12–13 years.

Results

Most adolescents knew HPV causes cervical cancer and HPV vaccination prevents this. A minority acknowledged HPV causes other genital cancers, with under one-fifth knowing HPV causes genital warts. Adolescents' awareness of HPV transmission activities were limited. There was very poor awareness of oral HPV infection or HPV-induced oropharyngeal cancer. Half of the participants stated HPV vaccination reduced their concerns about sexually transmitted infection contraction. Over half the males said they may take more sexual risks following vaccination, while a similar proportion of females did not expect their partner to take more risks.

Conclusions

Adolescents had little awareness of male HPV infection and the role HPV vaccination can play in preventing these diseases. With variable rates of HPV vaccination uptake in males reported worldwide, this study indicates that in the UK greater emphasis on male HPV disease within educational information is required, to raise better awareness of how HPV affects both genders. As both genders preferred to receive education via healthcare professionals, educating a wider range of healthcare professionals on oral HPV could help facilitate awareness of HPV's role in head and neck cancer.

### Quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine induces HPV-specific antibodies in the oral cavity: results from the mid-adult male vaccine trial [^680d456e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause approximately 70% of oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs), with the majority due to HPV-16. US incidence rates of HPV-positive OPCs are increasing, with a concomitant increase in the proportion of OPCs attributable to HPV. The incidence of OPC is significantly higher among males, compared with females, and to date, there is not a routine screening method available to detect HPV-related OPCs at early stages.

The quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) is highly efficacious in reducing anogenital HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 infections, subsequent development of HPV-related external genital lesions, and anal diseases in young males (ages 16–26 years). These findings led to the licensure of Gardasil for use in males ages 9–26 years for the prevention of HPV-6– and HPV-11–related genital warts and HPV-16– and HPV-18–related anal cancers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that mid-adult-aged men, who are more likely than males of other ages to develop HPV-related cancer, develop a strong antibody response to Gardasil. Successful prevention of HPV-related cancers depends on local, long-term protection against acquisition of infection. Currently licensed HPV L1 vaccines induce strong systemic antibody responses to the HPV types that are included in these vaccines, and antibodies are believed to be responsible for providing the high efficacy against HPV infection observed in vaccinated individuals.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f4cb7a8a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

### Cost effectiveness analysis of including boys in a human papillomavirus vaccination programme in the United States [^bc56ec88]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Persistent infection with high risk oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been established as a necessary factor in causing cervical cancer. Two types, HPV 16 and HPV 18, are responsible for about 70% of the cases of cervical cancer worldwide and contribute to over 80% of anal cancers; 30% of vulvar, vaginal, and oropharyngeal cancers; and 20% of oral cancers. Furthermore, two low risk non-oncogenic types, HPV 6 and HPV 11, are associated with most cases of anogenital warts and juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a rare yet severe respiratory condition.

Vaccines that target HPV 16 and HPV 18 have shown high, sustained efficacy against persistent type specific infections and precancerous cervical, vulvar, and vaginal lesions among females without previous exposure to these HPV types. The quadrivalent vaccine also targets HPV 6 and HPV 11 and has high efficacy against incident genital warts among females. Because the vaccine is most efficacious before exposure to HPV, current guidelines prioritise girls aged 11 to 12 as the primary target group for HPV vaccination; previous cost effectiveness analyses have consistently reported that HPV vaccination of preadolescent girls provides good value for money. Opinions on the optimal age limit for a catch-up vaccination programme in girls are more varied, extending to age 18 or 26 in the United States.

Recent data on the use of the HPV vaccine in males suggest high efficacy against vaccine type infections and external genital lesions. Despite limited data, the HPV vaccine is licensed and recommended for boys in several countries. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved the HPV vaccine for boys but is expected to consider it in the near future; agencies responsible for guidelines, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Cancer Society, will need to advise whether or not HPV vaccination should be recommended for boys. Because HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, vaccinating boys may lead not only to direct health benefits (for themselves) but also to indirect health benefits (for sexual partners) through reduced transmission of HPV. To assess the value of adding boys to an HPV vaccination programme, both the incremental health benefits that may accrue to men and women and the economic costs of the programme should be compared with those associated with vaccinating girls alone. In particular in the US, as discussions about health reform proceed, there has been a call for analyses to compare the value of different health interventions.

Moreover, although initial registration of HPV vaccines in Australia allowed vaccination of boys 10–15 years of age, there is currently no government or health insurance subsidy for males: consequently only a very small proportion of males have received vaccination. Yet, with the high coverage in young women of around 70%, a significant reduction (28%) in genital warts in males has also been seen — a herd immunity effect. Perhaps with the recent phase 3 clinical trial data showing effectiveness of a quadrivalent vaccine in reducing genital warts in males, as well as HPV16/18-related anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the precursor lesion to anal cancer, a case for vaccinating boys as well as girls could ultimately translate into true declines in genital warts, as well as other HPV-related diseases worldwide. In addition, such an approach would take the stigma away from just vaccinating girls and would ultimately decrease HPV-related diseases in men who have sex with men, as well as reducing any potential influence that genital warts and/or HPV infection may have on HIV transmission.

Next in the time sequence of HPV-related diseases, one expects to see a reduction in incidence of abnormal Pap cytology in a vaccinated cohort. In a review of cervical Pap smear abnormalities recorded on the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry, one of Australia's population-based Pap test registers, a modest and significant decrease in high-grade abnormalities was demonstrated in women aged < 18 years (< 16 years at vaccination), during 2007–2009 when the HPV vaccination programme was delivered, compared with the pre-vaccination period. We expect to see similar reduced changes in Pap abnormalities in those countries with high coverage of school-based programmes with the bivalent vaccine, such as the UK. Such changes will bring along other challenges, as, ultimately, reduction in cytology screening abnormalities will translate into a reduced positive predictive value for Pap cytology for abnormalities, requiring more sensitive assays for screening such as HPV DNA assays, with triage to cytology for those found positive for HPV infection. As the success of Pap screening programmes has relied on extensive education of clinicians as well as consumers, such potential changes in practice will need to be well articulated at all levels, reinforced, audited and modified to ensure effective outcomes.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^149c124d]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for anogenital warts, more specifically with respect to HPV vaccination, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to offer early HPV vaccination in boys with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection before the onset of sexual activity.
