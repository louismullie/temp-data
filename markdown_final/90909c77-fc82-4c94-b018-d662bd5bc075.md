## Question

arachnoid cyst and possible symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how arachnoid cysts cause symptoms, which symptoms map to which anatomic locations, what complications matter, how to stratify risk, what to expect from treatment, and how to make decisions about intervention versus observation based on the evidence provided here and elsewhere as appropriate to support counseling and management guidance [^112UAjCN] [^114j8cRR].

> Let me first confirm the baseline: most arachnoid cysts are incidental and asymptomatic, with population data showing a prevalence around 1.4–2.3% and no excess of headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, depression, or mortality among those with cysts, which means the mere presence of a cyst rarely explains nonfocal symptoms without corroborating imaging-pathophysiology such as hydrocephalus or mass effect [^112UAjCN] [^114j8cRR].

> Wait, let me verify the core mechanisms of symptom production before mapping locations: symptoms arise from mass effect on adjacent brain or cranial nerves, acute decompensation from rupture or hemorrhage into subdural or the cyst cavity, and obstructed CSF pathways causing hydrocephalus; supporting pathophysiology includes one-way slit valves enabling cyst enlargement and variable communication with CSF demonstrable by MR cisternography, which can help predict who benefits from fenestration versus observation [^115Vqfrz] [^111eXcXj] [^115SLAxv].

> Next, I should review intracranial location–symptom correlations; for middle cranial fossa/temporal cysts, headache, seizures, focal weakness, and cognitive or behavioral change predominate, whereas suprasellar lesions often produce visual field deficits, endocrine dysfunction, and obstructive hydrocephalus by compressing the chiasm, stalk, or third ventricular floor; posterior fossa cysts can mimic Meniere's disease with vertigo, tinnitus, and sometimes sensorineural hearing loss, which in rare cases improves after fenestration; intraventricular cysts tend to present with obstructive hydrocephalus and headache; sellar or parasellar cysts present with headache, visual field defects, and pituitary dysfunction; internal auditory canal arachnoid cysts correlate with ipsilateral SNHL, vertigo, and tinnitus when there is demonstrable nerve compression on multiplanar MRI [^116WJAYJ] [^111mcCQL] [^114untLY] [^116tJweR] [^114es97N] [^111yqNj6].

> I will now examine spinal cysts by compartment because the clinical picture differs; intradural arachnoid cysts commonly cause myelopathy with gait disturbance, paraparesis or tetraparesis, and frequent association with syringomyelia due to CSF flow perturbation, while extradural cysts more often cause back pain, radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication, and sphincter dysfunction; rare craniocervical junction cysts obstruct fourth ventricular outflow producing hydrocephalus and papilledema; selected sacral extradural cysts can even drive holocord syrinx physiology, with neurological improvement after fenestration restoring CSF dynamics [^114VjR7L] [^113S3wsu] [^111VXTic] [^116sGVCm] [^114Rq4NU].

> Hold on, I should verify which complications mandate urgent attention; rupture with chronic subdural hematoma or hygroma is most often linked to middle fossa cysts, reported around 4.6–6.5% in referred cohorts of temporal cysts — wait, that is not a population risk but a treatment-referred series, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize to all incidentally found cysts; still, head trauma and large size (> 5 cm) markedly increase odds of hemorrhage or rupture in pediatric case-control data, and optic nerve edema appears tightly linked to rupture in middle fossa cysts; infection is exceedingly rare but has been described with vasospasm and stroke, so fever or meningitic signs with a known cyst should not be dismissed [^1127gwK8] [^116aLuFB] [^114BXMzY] [^114A2Umy].

> Let me consider risk stratification pragmatically; larger diameter cysts and recent head trauma increase the odds of rupture or hemorrhage in children, while temporal location seems particularly prone to subdural collections, likely due to dural interface mechanics; pediatric patients have higher rates of macrocrania and hydrocephalus than adults, whereas adults more often declare with focal deficits; spinal intradural cysts are frequently associated with syrinx formation that worsens myelopathy, and although I initially thought size alone would predict surgery, hold on, I should verify — size can predict selection for surgery in institutional series, but size alone is not a stand-alone indication in the absence of mechanism-linked pathology; for counseling on activity, prospective data suggest sports participation is generally safe, with low rates of concussion and very rare cyst rupture or hemorrhage not requiring surgery [^116aLuFB] [^1127gwK8] [^116FfY8c] [^111zCkJv] [^116KLABA].

> Next, I should review how symptoms respond to treatment by mechanism; hydrocephalus-related symptoms from suprasellar cysts reliably improve after fenestration or shunting, though endocrine disturbances often persist or can emerge later and require long-term follow-up; focal motor deficits from mass effect frequently improve after decompression; cognitive and language deficits associated with left temporal cysts can improve after cyst decompression on neuropsychologic testing; sensorineural hearing loss may rarely recover after posterior fossa cyst fenestration; neuropathic pain responds least well in spinal series; seizure outcomes are variable and should not be overpromised preoperatively [^113F16RZ] [^117RnhGj] [^111v5Hfi] [^116tJweR] [^114VjR7L] [^111jCHTw] [^112BEYrc] [^1147TSBo].

> I need to ensure the management framework aligns with mechanism and urgency; emergencies include ruptured cysts with mass effect or elevated intracranial pressure, progressive hydrocephalus, and papilledema, which warrant urgent neurosurgical intervention; urgent but not emergent scenarios include progressive myelopathy, intractable pain with documented compression, or worsening focal deficits; elective considerations include stable but bothersome headaches or seizures after excluding other causes; truly asymptomatic cysts are best observed with reassurance, as size alone does not mandate surgery and long-term pediatric data for large sylvian cysts show no outcome advantage for surgery over observation when hydrocephalus or papilledema are absent; when operating, endoscopic fenestration, microsurgical fenestration, or shunting are options, with decompression generally beneficial but not risk-free, and cyst–CSF communication studies can refine selection for intervention [^1178yBG5] [^1128nZsR] [^116WJAYJ] [^111eXcXj] [^115SLAxv].

> But wait, what if the lesion isn't a classic arachnoid cyst; let me reconsider the pathological heterogeneity because it can shape counseling and expectations; a meaningful subset of "arachnoid-appearing" benign cysts in surgical series are glioependymal (neuroglial) cysts with distinct cellular profiles and potential for fluid production via aquaporins and transporters, which may explain progressive enlargement and mass effect despite CSF-like fluid and could account for variable responses to purely mechanical fenestration; appreciating this heterogeneity helps avoid overgeneralization from arachnoid cyst natural history to all benign cystic lesions [^117MECSU] [^113FUEAm].

> Final synthesis — let me double-check coherence before concluding; symptoms are location-dependent and mechanism-specific, with most cysts incidental and asymptomatic, and complications like rupture or CSF obstruction, rather than static size, driving actionable pathology; counseling should emphasize that nonfocal symptoms such as headache or dizziness require imaging evidence of compression, rupture, or CSF flow obstruction to attribute causality, that observation is appropriate for asymptomatic lesions, that activity restrictions are generally unnecessary, and that suprasellar cysts warrant long-term endocrine follow-up even after successful CSF diversion or fenestration; where uncertainty about communication or mechanism exists, targeted imaging such as MR/CT cisternography and neuro-ophthalmologic or neuropsychologic assessments can help align treatment with pathophysiology [^112UAjCN] [^116KLABA] [^113F16RZ] [^111eXcXj].

Arachnoid cysts are CSF-filled sacs between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane [^111mcCQL]; most are asymptomatic and found incidentally [^112UAjCN], but symptoms can occur from mass effect, CSF flow obstruction [^114j8cRR], or rupture [^1127gwK8]. The most common symptoms are **headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances** from increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus [^114j8cRR] [^111mcCQL]. Other possible symptoms include seizures, focal neurological deficits, cognitive or behavioral changes, and, in spinal cysts, back pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy [^114j8cRR] [^114VjR7L]. Rare complications include subdural hematoma or hygroma after minor trauma, and **symptoms depend on cyst size and location** [^111mcCQL] [^116aLuFB].

## Common symptoms of arachnoid cysts

### General symptoms

- **Headache**: Most frequent symptom [^111mcCQL], often from increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus [^115eyKft].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common with elevated intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus [^115eyKft].
- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred vision, double vision, or visual field defects from optic pathway or cranial nerve compression [^113F16RZ].
- **Seizures**: May occur with cortical irritation or compression [^116WJAYJ].
- **Focal neurological deficits**: Weakness, sensory changes, or cranial nerve palsies from localized compression [^114j8cRR].

---

### Location-specific symptoms

Symptoms **vary by cyst location**:

| **Location** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Middle cranial fossa | - Headache [^114j8cRR] <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Cognitive impairment <br/> - Language deficits [^111v5Hfi] |
| Posterior fossa | - Headache <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Vertigo [^114untLY] <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Sensorineural hearing loss [^116tJweR] |
| Suprasellar region | - Visual disturbances [^111mcCQL] <br/> - Endocrine dysfunction [^113F16RZ] <br/> - Hydrocephalus |
| Spinal arachnoid cysts | - Back pain <br/> - Radiculopathy <br/> - Myelopathy [^114VjR7L] <br/> - Gait disturbances <br/> - Sphincter dysfunction [^114SD3Wn] |

## Factors influencing symptom development

Symptom development is influenced by **cyst size**, with larger cysts more likely to cause mass effect or CSF obstruction [^114j8cRR]. Proximity to critical structures — such as the optic pathways, cranial nerves, or spinal cord — increases the risk of symptoms [^111mcCQL]. Progressive enlargement can lead to new or worsening symptoms [^114j8cRR]. Minor head trauma can precipitate cyst rupture or hemorrhage, producing acute symptoms [^1127gwK8].

---

## Complications associated with arachnoid cysts

Although generally benign, arachnoid cysts can cause **significant complications**, such as subdural hematoma or hygroma due to rupture or hemorrhage — often after minor trauma [^1127gwK8]. CSF flow obstruction can lead to hydrocephalus with increased intracranial pressure [^114j8cRR]. Rarely, cyst infection results in severe neurological complications [^114A2Umy].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis **relies on imaging**:

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Gold standard; shows CSF-like signal, no enhancement, and defines size/location [^111mcCQL].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful for initial assessment, especially in acute settings [^111mcCQL].
- **CT cisternography or MR cisternography**: Assesses cyst communication with CSF pathways, aiding management decisions [^111eXcXj].

---

## Management strategies

Management **depends on symptoms**, cyst size and location, and any complications:

- **Observation**: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cysts are monitored with periodic imaging [^114j8cRR].
- **Surgical intervention**: Symptomatic cysts or those with complications may require endoscopic fenestration, microsurgical fenestration, or cyst-peritoneal shunting [^114j8cRR] [^111jCHTw].
- **Minimally invasive techniques**: Endoscopic fenestration is effective with lower morbidity than open surgery [^114j8cRR].

---

Arachnoid cysts are usually incidental, but can cause symptoms from mass effect, CSF obstruction, or rupture; symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, and focal deficits, with presentation shaped by size and location. Management is **individualized**, ranging from observation to surgery, with generally favorable outcomes.

### Risk factors for pediatric arachnoid cyst rupture/hemorrhage: a case-control study [^116aLuFB]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

As the availability of imaging modalities has increased, the detection of arachnoid cysts has become common. Accurate patient counseling regarding physical activity or risk factors for cyst rupture or hemorrhage is challenging due to a lack of definitive association studies.

- **Objective**: This case-control study evaluated factors associated with arachnoid cyst rupture (intracystic hemorrhage, adjacent subdural hematoma, or adjacent subdural hygroma) in pediatric patients with previously asymptomatic arachnoid cysts.

- **Methods**: Patients with arachnoid cysts and intracystic hemorrhage, adjacent subdural hygroma, or adjacent subdural hematoma treated at a single institution from 2005 to 2010 were retrospectively identified. Two unruptured/nonhemorrhagic controls were matched to each case based on patient age, sex, anatomical cyst location, and side. Risk factors evaluated included arachnoid cyst size, recent history of head trauma, and altitude at residence.

- **Results**: The proportion of imaged arachnoid cysts that presented either originally or subsequently with a rupture or hemorrhage was 6.0%. Larger cyst size, defined by maximal cyst diameter, was significantly associated with cyst rupture/hemorrhage (P < .001). When dichotomized with a 5-cm cutoff, 9 of 13 larger cysts ruptured and/or hemorrhaged, whereas only 5 of 29 smaller cysts ruptured/hemorrhaged, with an odds ratio of 16.5 (confidence interval [2.5, ∞]). A recent history of head trauma was also significantly associated with the outcome (P < .001; odds ratio = 25.1 [confidence interval 4.0, ∞]). Altitude was not significantly associated with the outcome.

### Spinal cord compression caused by idiopathic intradural arachnoid cysts of the spine: Review of the literature and illustrated case [^114VjR7L]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Intradural spinal arachnoid cysts with cord compression are rare. When symptomatic, they cause variable symptoms involving gait disturbance, paraparesis or tetraparesis, and neuropathic pain, significantly decreasing the patients' quality of life. The extension of such cysts averages 3.7 vertebral bodies. Diagnosis is clinical and radiological, using MRI, CT myelography, or a combination of both. The best treatment option is complete removal of the cyst. However, even when paresis is regressing, there is no good recovery from neuropathic pain.

Laminectomy can cause postoperative complications, especially when the cyst(s) expand(s) over more than one level. Alternatively, a cyst fenestration may be performed, including the levels of maximal spinal cord compression. The clinical outcome is as good as after complete cyst resection, enabling the patient to walk again. Nevertheless, neuropathic pain may persist and require medication.

A clinical case is presented, and the literature is reviewed. In this case, we report a patient with intradural arachnoid cysts extending from T6 to L2, causing severe gait ataxia, neuropathic pain, and hypaesthesia. The spinal cord was compressed at T8 and T12. Surgical treatment with partial cyst resection at the compressed levels, using an interlaminar approach, yielded results similar to complete resection. The patient was able to walk without assistance, which was not possible before surgery. The cysts' extension is impressive, as is the minimal operative procedure.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^114j8cRR]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Adult non-neoplastic intracranial cysts constitute a heterogeneous group of disorders that include a variety of distinct pathologies. Intracranial cysts that follow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have historically been described as arachnoid cysts. The incidence of arachnoid cysts is estimated to be 1.4%, yet over 94% of these patients are asymptomatic. Thus, most patients are diagnosed incidentally on neuroimaging. The standard of care for asymptomatic patients is observation and close follow-up with imaging. However, if neurological signs and symptoms, such as headache, seizures, hydrocephalus, or focal neurological deficits, are present, neurosurgical intervention is warranted.

- **Surgical treatment options**: Microscopic fenestration to adjacent CSF spaces, endoscopic fenestration, stereotactic aspiration, and cystoperitoneal shunting are all surgical treatment options, with endoscopic fenestration being the most common. Reported patient outcomes postoperatively are generally strong, with symptom improvement reported between 72% and 90.5% across three cohort studies of intracranial arachnoid cysts.

Given favorable postoperative outcomes for patients with decompression of intracranial cysts, the etiology of these cysts is poorly studied. Cysts have long been thought to be congenital, but they can also develop later in adulthood. While in large retrospective imaging studies on intracranial cysts, most do not grow or become symptomatic, there is clear clinical evidence of growing intracranial cysts that lead to the development of mass effect and neurological symptoms.

### Neoplasms and tumor-like lesions of the sellar region: Imaging findings with correlation to pathology and 2021 who classification [^111mcCQL]. Neuroradiology (2023). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (ACs) represent the most common off-midline extra-axial cysts and are usually located within the subarachnoid spaces, including the suprasellar cistern. Also known as meningeal cysts, they are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled lesions lined by a layer of flattened arachnoid cells. ACs are sometimes in communication with subarachnoid cisterns.

Most ACs are primary, resulting from meningeal development anomalies where embryonic endomeninges fail to merge and remain separated. In contrast, secondary ACs may arise due to inflammation, tumor, trauma, or hemorrhage.

Although ACs are generally asymptomatic, some patients may experience a wide variety of symptoms related to the location and size of the lesion. Nevertheless, the most frequent clinical presentation is a headache. Subdural hematoma may represent a rare complication of ACs after minor trauma.

On computed tomography (CT), uncomplicated ACs show CSF density and do not enhance. Intrathecal instillation of a contrast agent (CT cisternography) may be helpful in documenting communication with the subarachnoid space. ACs also follow the CSF signal on all magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. They do not present diffusion restriction nor contrast enhancement. Suprasellar ACs may compress the chiasm, pituitary stalk, and/or the third ventricle floor.

Arachnoid cysts are illustrated in Fig. 15, where sagittal (A) and coronal (B) T2-, sagittal (C), and coronal (D) contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images demonstrate the presence of an intrasellar cystic lesion (arrows), displacing the pituitary gland to the left (dotted arrow). Histological examination shows delicate fibrous tissue.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^111e94Wi]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Glioependymal cysts (also known as neuroglial cysts) are a rare, unique entity with an imaging appearance indistinguishable from that of arachnoid cysts. The difference between these two is the presence of an ependymal and glial inner lining of cells within the wall of glioependymal cysts. In a 2018 systematic review, Robles et al. identified 26 pathologically confirmed glioependymal cysts in adults, each of which caused a mass effect. Radiological findings were indistinguishable from those of arachnoid cysts, but glioependymal cysts were often found in supratentorial intraparenchymal regions. Furthermore, each of these cysts had an internal ependymal layer on pathological examination, which may suggest a mechanism of growth different from the hypothesized "ball-valve" mechanism of arachnoid cysts.

In this study, we investigated whether intracranial cysts that required surgery have a shared underlying pathological diagnosis. Furthermore, we use molecular techniques to investigate potential mechanisms for cyst growth and mass effect.

### Recovery of sensorineural hearing loss following operative management of a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. Case report [^116tJweR]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are benign, intraarachnoid cysts filled with cerebrospinal fluid that are usually encountered in the middle cranial fossa. If present in the posterior fossa, they usually produce nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and vertigo. We report the rare presentation of a young girl with right-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus secondary to a right cerebellopontomedullary arachnoid cyst. The patient underwent a suboccipital retrosigmoid (retromastoid) craniectomy with fenestration of the arachnoid cyst. Subsequently, the patient experienced improvement in hearing with near-complete resolution of sensorineural hearing loss. To the authors' knowledge, postoperative near-complete resolution of hearing loss secondary to posterior fossa arachnoid cysts in a pediatric patient has not been previously reported. The authors also review the literature with respect to posterior fossa arachnoid cysts and discuss their clinical features, diagnosis, and management.

### Pediatric orbital multifocal cavernous hemangiomas associated with bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa. Case report and review of the literature [^112K5yno]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Cavernous hemangiomas of the orbit are benign vascular growths that commonly occur in adults and account for 6% of all intraorbital tumors. Multifocal intraorbital cavernous hemangiomas are quite rare. The reported incidence of arachnoid cysts accounts for only 1% of lesions that occupy intracranial space, and they are nearly always sporadic and single. So far, the authors have not encountered any study reporting the coexistence of bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa and orbital multifocal cavernous hemangiomas.

In this report, they describe a 10-year-old boy with such a hemangioma that included the eyelid, conjunctiva, and retrobulbar space. His was the first case of a surgically treated pediatric orbital multifocal cavernous hemangioma associated with bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa. An association between arachnoid cysts, intracranial cavernous malformations, and bilateral arachnoid cysts and metabolic disorders has been reported. The authors report on the coexistence of orbital multifocal cavernous hemangiomas and bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa.

Based on these observations, they believe that all patients with bilateral temporal arachnoid cysts should be screened for genetic disorders. In addition, the possibility of orbital cavernous malformations should be kept in mind for the follow-up period, and patients should be evaluated for possible symptoms of this condition.

### How often do chronic extra-cerebral haematomas occur in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts [^1127gwK8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural (CSDH) or intracystic haematomas may occur as a complication in patients with arachnoid cysts, even in children and young adults. The aim of this study was to investigate how often an arachnoid cyst is complicated by such haematomas, as this information may be of importance when considering decompressive cyst surgery.

- **Materials and methods**: This study includes a total of 241 consecutive, adult and paediatric patients (157 males and 84 females) that were referred to our department for treatment for an arachnoid cyst during the period January 1987-September 2004. Our department is the only neurosurgical department in a well-defined geographical region, with a population of 930,000.

- **Results**: A chronic haematoma was found in a total of 11 patients (4.6%), all harbouring a temporal cyst. For the temporal cysts, the haematoma frequency was 6.5%. Haematomas occurred equally frequently in individuals with small, middle-sized, and large temporal cysts, and in the age groups studied and in both genders.

- **Conclusion**: As also reflected in a literature review, intracranial chronic haematomas occur most frequently as a complication of middle fossa cysts. Possible mechanisms behind the formation of haematomas and the strong associations with temporal fossa cysts are discussed, with emphasis on the loose attachment of the membrane of the arachnoid cyst to the dura in the middle fossa and its possible role as an "extra wall" covering easy-bleeding vascular structures in the dura.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^112Sznss]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Benign-appearing intracranial cysts may become symptomatic due to mass effect and require surgical treatment. Mechanisms underlying cyst formation and growth remain poorly understood. This study identified 16 patients who underwent surgical treatment for benign intracranial cysts. Cyst wall pathologic samples (n = 8) were characterized as arachnoid or glioependymal cysts using H&E and immunofluorescence staining. Five samples (62.5%) were found to be glioependymal while three (37.5%) were arachnoid cysts. Cyst fluid examined in four cases resembled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and showed no significant differences in composition between pathological subtypes. Single-cell sequencing and RNA expression profile comparisons between glioependymal and arachnoid cysts revealed distinct cellular profiles.

- **Analyses of cell layers**: Analyses of the innermost cell layer (ependymal cells versus arachnoid cells) suggested differing mechanisms of pathogenesis. Glioependymal cysts harbored upregulated expression of sodium transporters and aquaporin channels, which suggests possible CSF-like fluid production, whereas arachnoid cysts may be associated with mechanical fluid accumulation. Thus, intracranial cysts represent multiple unique pathologic entities with differing cell types and RNA expression profiles. Further study into mechanisms of glioependymal cyst formation may allow for targeted interventions to reduce fluid production and avoid surgery.

### Arachnoid cysts: Case series and review of the literature [^116WJAYJ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are commonly encountered fluid collections in the central nervous system. Recent advances in neuroimaging have led to increased detection of these cysts; diagnoses can now be made more frequently and at earlier stages. Significant advances have also been made in the surgical management of these lesions. The authors report on a case series illustrating the diverse forms of presentation and treatment modalities commonly used for arachnoid cysts.

- **Methods**: Between January 2002 and December 2006, 20 patients with arachnoid cysts underwent surgery performed by the senior author at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Seventy percent of the cysts were supratentorial, 5% infratentorial, and 25% spinal. All diagnoses were confirmed through neuroimaging, surgery, and histological examination. The study included 12 male (60%) and eight female (40%) patients, ranging in age from 2 weeks to 39 years (mean age 10.9 years) at the time of surgery. Symptoms at presentation included headache (41%), weakness (23%), seizure (14%), hydrocephalus (9%), scoliosis (4%), cognitive decline (4%), and visual loss (4%).

- **Findings**: Twenty-five percent of the cysts were sylvian, 20% intraventricular, and 20% suprasellar. Supratentorial cysts were treated endoscopically in 73% of patients and with open resection in the remaining 27%. Complications included spasticity, hemiparesis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, hydrocephalus, and subdural hygroma. In the follow-up evaluation, 60% of patients had stable cysts with improved symptoms, 13% experienced complete symptom resolution, and 13% had stable symptoms.

### Spinal arachnoid cysts in adults: Diagnosis and management. A single-center experience [^114SD3Wn]. Journal of Neurosurgery. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Adult spinal arachnoid cysts (SACs) are rare entities of indistinct etiology that present with pain or myelopathy. Diagnosis is made on imaging studies with varying degrees of specificity. In symptomatic cases, the standard treatment involves surgical exploration and relief of neural tissue compression. This study aims to illustrate features of SACs in adults, surgical management, and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The authors searched medical records for all adult SAC cases in the 10-year period ending in December 2016. Radiology and pathology reports were reviewed to exclude other spinal cystic disorders. Previously treated patients were excluded. Demographic variables, including age, sex, and clinical presentation (symptoms, duration, history of infection or trauma, and examination findings), were extracted. Radiological features were collected from radiology reports and direct interpretation of imaging studies. Operative reports and media were reviewed to accurately describe the surgical technique. Finally, patient-reported outcomes were collected at every clinic visit using the SF-36.

- **Results**: The authors' search identified 22 patients with SACs (mean age at presentation 53.5 years). Seventeen patients were women, representing an almost 3:1 sex distribution. Symptoms comprised back pain (n = 16, 73%), weakness (n = 10, 45%), gait ataxia (n = 11, 50%), and sphincter dysfunction (n = 4, 18%). The mean duration of symptoms was 15 months. Seven patients (32%) exhibited signs of myelopathy. All patients underwent preoperative MRI; in addition, six underwent CT myelography.

### Optic nerve edema in pediatric middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts: Report of 51 patients from a single institution [^114BXMzY]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Middle fossa arachnoid cysts (MFACs) are rare, congenital lesions that may rupture and cause symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. We sought to describe the presence of and factors associated with optic nerve edema in MFACs, focusing on the utility of ophthalmologic evaluations for guiding cyst management.

- **Methods**: We reviewed clinical and radiographic information for all patients with MFACs with ophthalmologic evaluations at our institution. Headache, cranial nerve palsy, emesis, altered mental status, fatigue, and seizures were considered MFAC-related symptoms. Univariate and multivariable analyses evaluated factors associated with optic edema.

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients between 2003 and 2022 were included. Cysts were a median volume of 169.9 cm³ (interquartile range: 70.5, 647.7). Evidence of rupture with subdural hematoma/hygroma occurred in 19 (37.3%) patients. Eighteen (35.3%) patients underwent surgery for their cyst and/or rupture-associated intracranial bleed. Eleven (21.6%) patients had optic edema; all were symptomatic and experienced cyst rupture. Ten of these patients received surgery. Postoperatively, optic edema resolved in 80% of cases. Cyst volume and symptoms were not associated with optic edema; however, patients with ruptured cysts, particularly those with traumatic rupture, were more likely to have optic edema and receive surgery (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: We found optic edema in 21.6% of evaluated MFACs, and this comprised 57.9% of ruptured cases. Optic edema was not found in unruptured cysts. Cyst fenestration improved optic edema in most cases.

### Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts: Clinical, radiological, and surgical features [^113S3wsu]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Extradural arachnoid cysts in the spine are rare and seldom cause spinal cord compression. These cysts are thought to arise from congenital defects in the dura mater and almost always communicate with the intrathecal subarachnoid space through a small defect in the dura. The primary treatment for patients with neurological symptoms is surgical removal of the cyst, along with ligation of the communicating pedicle and closure of the dural defect. This paper reviews the literature and discusses the clinical and pathological features, mechanisms of pathogenesis, neuroimaging characteristics, and surgical management of spinal extradural arachnoid cysts. The surgical technique for removing these lesions is illustrated in a patient with a large thoracolumbar spinal extradural arachnoid cyst causing neurogenic claudication.

### Infection of arachnoid cyst associated with vasospasm and stroke in a pediatric patient: Case report [^114A2Umy]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are relatively common, benign intraarachnoid membrane outpouchings containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-like fluid. The majority of arachnoid cysts remain stable and asymptomatic, requiring no intervention in the pediatric population. Here, the authors present the first reported case of an infected arachnoid cyst in a pediatric patient, resulting in severe vasospasm of the left terminal internal carotid artery, left A1 segment, and left M1 branches, along with a left middle cerebral artery infarct. Their experience suggests that close monitoring is warranted for this condition and that the pediatric population may be at higher risk for vasospasm.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^114x7KiF]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Given the potential heterogeneity in benign cyst pathologic diagnoses, we reviewed our institution's historical surgical pathological diagnoses with modern diagnostic criteria. Only 8 of 16 patients receiving surgical intervention for a benign intracranial cyst had tissue collected for pathological review [Figure 1A, Table 2]. Historically, pathological diagnoses were commonly described as "cyst wall" or "benign cyst". Therefore, our goal was to evaluate whether any of these cysts were in fact glioependymal in nature. A blinded board-certified neuropathologist (F.R.) reviewed all available pathological slides from a total of 8 patients [Figure 1A].

Glioependymal cysts were confirmed by the presence of an EMA-negative simple cuboidal ependymal inner wall and a surrounding layer of GFAP-positive glial cells [Figure 1B]. Upon review, 5 cysts were determined to be glioependymal cysts (62.5%), and 3 were described as arachnoid cysts (37.5%). Of these pathologically classified cysts, there were no significant demographic differences [Table 2], but all supratentorial intraparenchymal cysts (4/4) were glioependymal, while arachnoid cysts were found in the suprasellar space and pineal region. Of the 2 CPA cysts available for pathologic analysis, 1 was described as glioependymal and the other was classified as arachnoid.

Cyst fluid was aspirated prior to cyst resection and collected in 4 patients [Table 3]. Each sample had a cell and ion profile similar to CSF. There were no significant differences in fluid obtained between cysts diagnosed as glioependymal and those diagnosed as arachnoid.

### Arachnoid cysts cause cognitive deficits that improve after surgery [^117RnhGj]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The authors investigated cognition in patients with arachnoid cysts by assessing 55 patients and 32 control subjects on four different cognitive tests preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The patients improved their performance from preoperative to postoperative testing, whereas the control subjects did not show a similar improvement.

### Syringomyelia associated with intradural arachnoid cysts [^111VXTic]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Intradural arachnoid cysts are relatively uncommon pouches of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) found within the subarachnoid space. The authors present a series of eight symptomatic patients in whom syrinx cavities were associated with arachnoid cysts, and they discuss treatment strategies for this entity.

- **Methods**: The population comprised eight men whose mean age was 50 years (range 35–81 years). All patients experienced gait difficulty, which was the chief complaint in seven, while arm pain was the primary complaint in one. No patient had a history of spinal trauma, meningitis, or previous spinal surgery at the level of the syrinx cavity or arachnoid cyst. Imaging revealed a syrinx cavity affecting two to 10 vertebral levels in each patient. Posterior thoracic arachnoid cysts were found in proximity to the syrinx cavity in each case. There was no evidence of cavity enhancement, Chiari malformation, tethered cord, or hydrocephalus. All patients underwent thoracic laminectomy and resection of the arachnoid cyst wall. Postoperative neurological improvement was documented in each case. The mean follow-up duration was 19 months (range 4–37 months). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the disappearance of the arachnoid cyst and a significant decrease in syrinx cavity size in each patient.

- **Conclusions**: Spinal arachnoid cysts can be associated with syringomyelia, likely due to alterations in normal CSF dynamics. In symptomatic patients, these cysts should be resected and normal CSF flow restored. The results of the present series indicate that neurological improvement is achievable with this approach.

### Prevalence and symptoms of intracranial arachnoid cysts: a population-based study [^112UAjCN]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a large population-based sample and assess the association between arachnoid cysts and various conditions, including cognitive impairment, depression, epilepsy, headache, dizziness, previous head trauma, hip fractures, and mortality.

This was a population-based cohort and nested case-control study. The sample comprised representative populations (n = 1235) aged ≥ 70 years. All participants underwent baseline neuropsychiatric examinations, including computed tomography (CT) of the brain, between 1986 and 2000. All CT scans were examined for arachnoid cysts.

Headache, dizziness, history of head trauma, dementia, depression, epilepsy, and hip fracture were assessed using data from clinical examinations, interviews, and the Swedish hospital discharge register. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination, and depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Date of death was obtained from the National Swedish Death Registry.

The prevalence of arachnoid cysts was 2.3% (n = 29), with no significant difference between men and women. Probands with and without cysts had the same frequency of headache, dizziness, previous head trauma, cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were no differences regarding the prevalence of dementia, depression, epilepsy, or previous hip fracture. Arachnoid cysts were not associated with increased mortality.

In conclusion, arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding, occurring at the same rate in men and women, and are probably asymptomatic.

### Posterior fossa arachnoid cysts can mimic Meniere's disease [^114untLY]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts constitute 1% of all intracranial space-occupying lesions. In the posterior fossa, they typically produce vague, nonspecific symptoms. However, a subset of these lesions can produce signs and symptoms indistinguishable from those of Meniere's disease. We discuss the clinical and laboratory features of two cases of posterior fossa arachnoid cysts mimicking Meniere's disease, as well as the substantial resolution of symptoms in one patient following a cysto-peritoneal shunt. Posterior fossa arachnoid cysts must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of Meniere's disease.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: A single center experiences [^1147TSBo]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (AC) are intra-arachnoid, cerebrospinal fluid sacs located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane. They are not due to the division or proliferation of the arachnoid membrane but are typically congenital, arising from separations within the arachnoid membrane. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SAC) are believed to result from abnormal Lilliquist's membrane or cystic dilatation of the interpeduncular cisterna. Intracranial arachnoid cysts account for around 1% of all intracranial lesions.

The apparent increase in incidence is likely due to improved detection capabilities of modern imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) rather than an actual increase in the occurrence of these cysts. Some SAC symptoms include macrocrania, obstructive hydrocephalus, and visual and endocrine dysfunctions, such as hormone deficiency and precocious puberty.

Treating arachnoid cysts typically involves resection, shunting, or fenestration of the cyst. With the advancement of neuroendoscopy, the use of purely endoscopic fenestration for arachnoid cysts has gained popularity. This technique, favored for its minimally invasive nature, allows for the precise and comfortable management of these cysts. Technological improvements in neuroendoscopy have facilitated these less invasive approaches, making the procedures more patient-friendly and potentially reducing recovery times.

This study offers the most extensive findings on suprasellar arachnoid cysts and aims to enhance the literature with insights into minimally invasive interventions.

### Arachnoid cyst with associated arachnoiditis developing after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report [^111AkxEW]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The authors report the case of a 53-year-old woman in whom a T1-T2 spinal arachnoid cyst with associated arachnoiditis developed, compressing the thoracic spinal cord one year after the patient had suffered a Hunt and Hess Grade IV subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Development of spinal arachnoiditis, with or without an arachnoid cyst, is a rare complication of aneurysmal SAH. Risk factors may include posterior circulation aneurysms, the extent and severity of the hemorrhage, and the need for cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Surgical drainage, shunt placement, or cyst excision, when possible, is the mainstay of treatment.

### Intrathecal gadolinium (gadopentetate dimeglumine)-enhanced MR cisternography used to determine potential communication between the cerebrospinal fluid pathways and intracranial arachnoid cysts [^111eXcXj]. Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess the feasibility of intrathecal gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance cisternography (MRC) for evaluating the presence or absence of communication of cranial arachnoid cysts with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways of the central nervous system (CNS).

This prospective study included 20 patients (12 males and 8 females) with a mean age of 37 years, who had, as a group, 22 intracranial arachnoid cysts identified on prior CT and/or MR examinations. Routine pre-contrast cranial MR imaging was followed by the intrathecal administration of 0.5 cc gadopentetate dimeglumine (GD) (Magnevist, Schering, Germany). Immediate and delayed (24-hour) MR cisternography was then carried out.

- **Clinical results**: Eleven of 22 arachnoid cysts showed immediate CSF communication, demonstrated by GD-contrast enhancement of the cyst fluid on the immediate post-injection scan. Contrast enhancement of the cyst was observed only on delayed MRC in six patients. MR imaging in five patients demonstrated no contrast enhancement of the arachnoid cysts on either immediate or delayed imaging.

- **Patient outcomes**: Six patients had mild transient post-procedure headache, which was relieved by oral analgesics within 24 hours. No serious immediate or chronic adverse effects or complications relating to the intrathecal contrast administration were observed.

This study demonstrated the relative safety, feasibility, and reliability of low-dose intrathecal GD MR imaging in demonstrating the communication or non-communication of intracranial arachnoid cysts with the CSF pathways of the CNS. In the future, this may have implications for diagnosis and treatment planning.

### What provokes a disappearing arachnoid cyst? - Case study and literature review [^116pPpvA]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The primary focus of this study is on intracranial arachnoid cysts (AC), which are stable cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)-filled sacs that can occasionally undergo progressive shrinkage or disappearance throughout life. This manuscript presents a case of post-traumatic complete resolution of an AC, reviews the potential triggers of this phenomenon, and discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these occurrences.

- **Methods**: Following the presentation of our case, we conducted a literature review using the PubMed Database, focusing on reported cases of AC reduction or resolution (updated in February 2021). Spontaneous cases were excluded. The analysis covered remaining cases from 1985 to 2021, examining their inciting events, demographic, and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: A total of 58 patients were identified, with 33 cases of spontaneous resolution. The remaining 25 cases were included in our analysis, alongside the case we presented. The mean age was 20.2 years, with an average resolution time of 25.3 months. Only two-thirds of the cases demonstrated complete disappearance of the AC. Among these, a central nervous system infection triggered resolution in one infant (4%), head trauma in 16 patients (62%), and an intracranial procedure in 9 patients (35%).

- **Discussion**: AC disappearance is a rare phenomenon that can occur spontaneously or following an inciting event. The theories of cyst wall rupture and CSF flow perturbation appear to be the most applicable mechanisms explaining triggered AC resolution.

### Arachnoid cysts of the internal auditory canal: Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging with audio-vestibular correlates [^114es97N]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

The statistical analysis assumed the null hypothesis that arachnoid cysts (AC) of the internal auditory canal (IAC) had no effects on hearing, balance, or tinnitus, with symptoms equally distributed on sides with and without arachnoid cysts. Using clinical and radiological data, the prevalence of each symptom was calculated. The Chi-square (χ²) test was used to assess the association between IAC arachnoid cysts and ipsilateral symptoms. Point-biserial correlation (PBC) was then calculated to measure the association between the measured arachnoid cyst diameter and the presence of symptoms. The criteria for the presence of arachnoid cyst versus non-existent or indeterminate status was designated as a binary variable. Symptoms were also defined as binary variables, regarded as present if the patient reported one or more symptoms. Arachnoid cyst diameter was considered a continuous variable. The Chi-square (χ²) test was also used to assess the association between arachnoid cyst location along the length of the IAC and symptoms. Arachnoid cyst location (proximal, middle, or fundus) and symptoms (presence or absence) were categorized as categorical variables. The Chi-square (χ²) test was further used to compare the frequency of nerve compression detection by radiologists in axial versus sagittal views on MRI.

Spearman correlations were calculated to analyze whether radiological findings of nerve compression in sagittal view analysis (involving paired cochlear-facial nerves or paired inferior/superior vestibular nerves) were correlated with reported auditory or vestibular impairments. Presence or absence of nerve compression and symptoms of auditory or vestibular impairment were considered in this analysis.

### Cyst-ventricle stent as primary or salvage treatment for posterior fossa arachnoid cysts [^113FErRg]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment of symptomatic posterior fossa arachnoid cysts is controversial. Options include open or endoscopic resection, fenestration, or cyst-peritoneal shunt placement. There are potential drawbacks with all options. Previous authors have described stenting a cyst into the ventricular system for supratentorial lesions. The authors have used a similar strategy for posterior fossa cysts.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a retrospective review of 79 consecutive patients (1993–2010) with surgically treated intracranial arachnoid cysts.

- **Results**: The authors identified 3 patients who underwent placement of a stent from a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst to a supratentorial ventricle. In 2 patients, the stent construct consisted of a catheter placed into a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst and connecting to a lateral ventricle catheter. Both patients underwent stent placement as a salvage procedure after failure of open surgical fenestration. In the third patient, a single-catheter cyst-ventricle stent was stereotactically placed. All 3 patients improved clinically. Two patients remained asymptomatic, with radiographic stability in a follow-up period of 1 and 5 years, respectively. The third patient experienced initial symptom resolution with a demonstrable reduction of intracystic pressure; however, he developed recurrent headaches after 2 years.

- **Conclusions**: Posterior fossa cyst-ventricle stenting offers the benefits of ease of surgical technique and a low morbidity rate. It may also potentially reduce the incidence of shunt-related headaches.

### Arachnoid cysts of the internal auditory canal: Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging with audio-vestibular correlates [^111yqNj6]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Symptoms in relation to arachnoid cyst radiological findings

Among the 24 patients with an arachnoid cyst of the internal auditory canal (IAC), 21 patients reported one or more symptoms ipsilateral to the lesion (Fig. 9). The breakdown of symptoms included sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in 6 patients (25%), vertigo in 6 patients (25%), and tinnitus (12.5%) in 3 patients. Additionally, 2 patients experienced both vertigo and SNHL (8.3%), while vertigo and ataxia were noted in 1 patient (4.2%). Two patients reported tinnitus and vertigo (8.3%), and tinnitus and SNHL were present in 1 patient (4.2%) [Fig. 5A]. Two patients exhibited auditory or vestibular symptoms contralateral to the arachnoid cyst, and one patient exhibited no symptoms despite having a bilateral arachnoid cyst.

### Arachnoid cyst slit valves: The mechanism for arachnoid cyst enlargement [^115Vqfrz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are common, accounting for approximately 1% of intracranial mass lesions. Most are congenital, clinically silent, and remain static in size. Occasionally, they increase in size and produce symptoms due to mass effect or obstruction. The mechanism of enlargement of arachnoid cysts is controversial. One-way slit valves are often hypothesized as the mechanism for enlargement.

The authors present four cases of suprasellar prepontine arachnoid cysts in which a slit valve was identified. The patients presented with hydrocephalus due to enlargement of the cyst. The valve was located in the arachnoid wall of the cyst directly over the basilar artery. The authors believe this slit valve was responsible for the net influx of CSF into the cyst and for its enlargement.

They also present one case of an arachnoid cyst in the middle cranial fossa that had a small circular opening but lacked a slit valve. This cyst did not enlarge, but surgery was required because of rupture and the development of a subdural hygroma.

- **One-way slit valves**: These exist and are a possible mechanism for the enlargement of suprasellar prepontine arachnoid cysts. The valve was located directly over the basilar artery in each of these cases. The caudad-to-cephalad CSF flow during the cardiac cycle increased the opening of the valve, whereas the cephalad-to-caudad CSF flow during the remainder of the cardiac cycle pushed the slit opening against the basilar artery and decreased the size of the opening.

Arachnoid cysts that communicate CSF via circular, nonslit valves are probably more likely to remain stable.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^111jBLPV]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

**Clinical characteristics of patients with surgical intracranial cysts**: A total of 16 adult patients with intracranial cysts were operated on at our institution between 2014 and 2024. Ages ranged from 26 to 78 years old, with a mean age of 55.0. Nine patients were women (56.3%), and seven patients were men (43.7%). Cyst locations included 5 suprasellar (31.3%), 5 supratentorial intraparenchymal (31.3%), 3 pineal (18.8%), 2 cerebellopontine angle (CPA) (12.5%), and 1 infratentorial intraparenchymal (6.3%). All patients presented with mass effect leading to compression of the adjacent brain, cranial nerves, or obstructive hydrocephalus. Primary pre-operative neurological symptoms included 6 patients with focal cranial nerve dysfunction (37.5%), 5 with headache (31.2%), 2 with seizure (12.5%), 1 with motor deficits (6.3%), 1 with cognitive changes (6.3%), and 1 with memory changes (6.3%). The mean maximal diameter of cysts was 3.9 cm (ranging from 1.8 to 7.2 cm). All cases were treated with maximal safe cyst resection followed by fenestration to adjacent CSF spaces. All patients had an improvement in neurologic symptoms postoperatively. One patient (6.3%) continued to experience seizures postoperatively, while the remaining 15 patients had complete symptom resolution (93.7%).

### Language impairment associated with arachnoid cysts: Recovery after surgical treatment [^111v5Hfi]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Supporting data from the literature indicate that large arachnoid cysts may affect cognitive function. Neuropsychologic assessment, combined with magnetic resonance imaging, has documented associations between left temporal arachnoid cysts, language impairment, and other cognitive dysfunctions. Significant cognitive improvements were evident soon after cysto-peritoneal shunting. These observations reinforce the rationale for neuropsychologic assessments of patients with developmental delay and arachnoid cysts. They support the potential benefit of surgical decompression for arachnoid cysts associated with neurologic deficits, even if surgery is performed well after the occurrence of neurologic deficits.

### A form of dysplasia or a fortuitous association? A cerebral aneurysm inside an arachnoid cyst: case report [^113bLpp3]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Although arachnoid cysts and intracranial aneurysms are very common lesions, their association in the same patient is rare. We present a case of a middle cerebral artery aneurysm ruptured into an arachnoid cyst. We found only six cases with intracystic hemorrhage reported in the literature. The presence of an arachnoid cyst can mislead clinical presentation. The patient presented a paradoxically small temporal fossa and thickening of the temporal and sphenoid bone. The authors suggest that this uncommon association (arachnoid cyst, atypical cranial vault, and "mirror-like" cerebral aneurysm) could represent a form of dysplasia.

A 46-year-old patient presented with a 3-week history of slight headaches, which had worsened in the last 3 days before presentation. Computed tomographic scans showed a cystic lesion located in the middle cranial fossa and sylvian fissure with suspected aneurysm dilation inside. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed an intracystic hemorrhage but not subarachnoid hemorrhage. Paradoxically, changes in the cranial vault around the cyst were noted. Digital subtraction angiography showed bilateral "mirror" middle cerebral artery aneurysms.

A large right pterional craniotomy was performed with full microsurgical removal of the arachnoid cyst walls and aneurysm clipping. The aneurysm was in the medial wall of the arachnoid cyst with its dome inside the cyst. The contralateral aneurysm was clipped 2 weeks later. The follow-up period was uneventful, and the patient returned to normal life.

### Arachnoid cysts of the internal auditory canal: Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging with audio-vestibular correlates [^1153QiWU]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (AC) are cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs, covered by a membrane of arachnoidal cells, thought to arise from a congenital split of the arachnoid layer or trauma. AC have received surprisingly little attention in otolaryngology — head and neck surgery; yet, they represent the most common type of brain cyst, and approximately 11% of AC occur in the cerebellopontine angle. Although many AC are asymptomatic, cysts that occur within bony confines, such as the internal auditory canal (IAC), may have an increased risk of compressive symptoms.

Literature investigating AC of the IAC is scarce, but available data have suggested associations with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), unilateral tinnitus, vertigo, or temporary facial palsy, similar to cystic variants of schwannoma. Diagnosis most commonly follows abnormal auditory or vestibular testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IAC protocol. Gadolinium-based contrast agents facilitate differentiation of AC from tumors, although gadolinium may induce allergic reactions in predisposed individuals.

Radiological assessment of AC is challenging due to the thin arachnoid membrane and the small, complex anatomy of the IAC. Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) may increase spatial resolution. MPR is particularly useful for delineating compressive phenomena, such as mass effects exerted on adjacent neural structures. We previously reported on this approach, demonstrating the utility of MPR for characterizing vascular loops features (e.g. position, contact with nerve, and vessel caliber).

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^117MECSU]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In a recent systematic review of 26 glioependymal cysts, these lesions were mostly identified in intra-axial intraparenchymal and CPA locations, similar to what we found in our study. All surgical glioependymal cysts were operated on for neurological symptoms attributed to mass effect and were commonly found to have clear fluid (although there are descriptions of hemorrhage into the cyst). The neurologic outcomes were almost always an improvement in symptoms. Overall, our findings mirror those of previous case reports of glioependymal cysts, which have likely been limited by attempts at pathologically distinguishing these cysts from arachnoid cysts.

If glioependymal cysts make up a meaningful portion of symptomatic benign-appearing intracranial cysts, then understanding the mechanism of progression and development of mass effect is important. Classically, intracranial cysts have been theorized to progress through a "ball-valve" mechanism, as aquaporin expression has never been identified in arachnoid cysts. Fluid flow into arachnoid cysts was investigated by Tali et al. to determine whether intracranial cyst fluid had communication with surrounding CSF spaces. Through intrathecal contrast administration and MR cisternography, they found that 77% of cysts filled with contrast, suggesting a majority of these cysts had a connection to the CSF pathways of the brain. However, 5 patients in their cohort required surgical intervention; 3 of these cysts had no communication between the cyst lumen and surrounding CSF spaces on MR cisternography.

### Endonasal management of sellar arachnoid cysts: simple cyst obliteration technique [^1112y2bD]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Symptomatic sellar arachnoid cysts (ACs) have typically been treated via the transsphenoidal route. After sellar cyst wall fenestration, some authors have advocated cyst wall resection and increasing communication between the AC and the suprasellar subarachnoid space (SAS). This study reports the authors' experience using a simplified approach to reinforce a defective diaphragma sellae or unseen arachnoid diverticulum by deliberately not enlarging the AC-SAS communication and obliterating the cyst cavity with adipose tissue followed by skull base reconstruction.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who underwent endonasal transsphenoidal obliteration of symptomatic ACs with a fat graft and skull base repair.

- **Results**: Between July 1998 and September 2010, 8 patients with a sellar AC were identified (6 women and 2 men, mean age 57 years). Clinical presentation included headache, pituitary dysfunction, and visual dysfunction (4 patients each group). Maximal cyst diameter averaged 22 mm (range 15–32 mm). In all cases, the sellar communication to the SAS was deliberately not enlarged. The endoscope was used for visualization in 8 of 9 procedures. Postoperatively, headache improved in all 4 patients, and vision in all 4 patients, with partial resolution of endocrine dysfunction (hyperprolactinemia and/or hyponatremia) in 3 (75%) of 4 patients. No new endocrinopathy, CSF leak, meningitis, or neurological deficits occurred. Two patients experienced cyst reaccumulation: 1 symptomatic recurrence was treated with reoperation at 43 months.

### Haemorrhage into an arachnoid cyst: A serious complication of minor head trauma [^111cpzD8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are infra-arachnoidal cerebrospinal fluid collections that are usually asymptomatic. However, they can become acutely symptomatic because of haemorrhage and cyst enlargement, which may result from minor head trauma. The range of symptoms is wide, and many are considered "soft" signs. Diagnosis is important as cysts causing mass effect require surgery. A case is reported of a child presenting with localized headaches after minor head trauma. Computed tomography demonstrated an arachnoid cyst with evidence of haemorrhage, which required surgical intervention. Other cases of arachnoid cyst presenting to our hospital or reported in the literature are reviewed with respect to presenting symptoms and signs. Localized headaches, behavioral or cognitive changes, and ataxia are more commonly associated with this disorder than nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, or seizures. This range of symptomatology following minor head trauma may warrant computed tomography when other criteria for this investigation are not met.

### Long-term outcome of large sylvian arachnoid cysts: The role of surgery has been exaggerated [^1178yBG5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The surgical indications for some arachnoid cysts (ACs) are controversial. While surgical procedures can be effective when an AC is a definite cause of hydrocephalus or papilledema, most ACs do not cause any symptoms or signs. Some surgeons perform several procedures to treat ACs because of their large size. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of Galassi type III ACs between surgery and nonsurgery groups.

The medical records of 60 patients diagnosed with sylvian ACs (Galassi type III) who visited Seoul National University Children's Hospital from July 1990 to March 2018 were analyzed. The authors compared the outcomes between those treated with surgery and those not treated with surgery.

Of the 60 patients, 27 had no symptoms, 19 had vague symptoms and signs associated with ACs, and the remaining 14 had definite AC-related symptoms and signs. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgery, and 22 underwent observation. Some operations were accompanied by complications. Among the 33 patients in the surgery group, excluding 5 with hydrocephalus or papilledema, 8 needed 18 additional operations. However, there were no patients in the nonsurgery group who needed surgical intervention during the follow-up period (mean 67.5 months), although the size of the AC increased in 2 patients. Changes in AC size were not correlated with symptom relief.

When patients with hydrocephalus or papilledema were excluded, there was no difference in the outcomes between the surgery and nonsurgery groups.

### A population based study of intracranial arachnoid cysts: Clinical and neuroimaging outcomes following surgical cyst decompression in adults [^1128nZsR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

We have gradually adopted a liberal attitude towards surgical decompression of arachnoid cysts, and this study describes the results from our institution.

- **Methods**: Long-term clinical and neuroimaging results of 156 adult patients (aged ≥ 16 years) operated on for arachnoid cysts in our department from January 1987 to September 2004 were assessed based on their medical and neuroimaging records, and on a questionnaire.

- **Results**: The clinical and/or neuroimaging results indicated that the cyst was successfully decompressed in all patients. A total of 82% of patients were asymptomatic or had insignificant complaints at follow-up. Meanwhile, 12% reported no symptom relief and 6% experienced worsening of symptoms. The cyst disappeared, or was reduced to less than 50% of the preoperative volume, in 66% of cases. In another 24%, the postoperative volume was reduced, but remained larger than 50% of the original cyst volume. No reduction in fluid volume was observed in 10% of cases. There was no association between volume reduction and clinical improvement. Complications occurred in 26 patients (17%), all with temporal cysts, necessitating reoperation in 11 patients (7.1%). In only two patients did the complication result in a permanent slight disability.

- **Conclusion**: Decompression of arachnoid cysts yields substantial clinical benefit with a low risk of severe complications.

### Intrasellar arachnoid cysts [^114kK37Y]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical, endocrinological, and radiological presentation of nine cases of surgically verified intrasellar arachnoid cysts and to discuss the physiopathological mechanisms of their formation.

- **Methods**: Among 1540 patients presenting with pituitary lesions, nine presented with an intrasellar arachnoid cyst. Their charts were retrospectively reviewed.

- **Results**: Presenting symptoms included headache (n = 2), visual symptoms (n = 3), menstrual irregularities (n = 2), rapid weight gain (n = 1), vertigo (n = 1), and/or confusion (n = 1). Two cysts were discovered incidentally. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed an intrasellar cystic lesion in all cases, with a huge suprasellar extension in six cases. The cyst was of the same intensity as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in only two patients. A transsphenoidal approach allowed the transdural aspiration of fluid and injection of a water-soluble contrast agent under mild pressure. In three patients, the contrast infiltrated along the pituitary stalk toward the subarachnoid spaces; in the other patients, it remained in the intrasellar compartment. Cyst membranes were removed as completely as possible with fenestration toward the subarachnoid spaces in communicating cysts. In spite of tight packing of the sella and sphenoid sinus, CSF fistulae requiring reoperation developed in two patients.

- **Conclusion**: The clinical picture of an intrasellar arachnoid cyst resembles that of a nonfunctional pituitary adenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging scans typically show a cystic intrasellar lesion.

### Infection of a sylvian Galassi II arachnoid cyst after craniotomy for resection of a parasagittal meningioma [^114a412C]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-containing entities that rarely are symptomatic or warrant neurosurgical intervention. In addition, infection of these lesions is an even rarer event, with only four reports in the literature capturing this.

In this report, we present the case of a 79-year-old man presenting with paraparesis, secondary to a right parasagittal meningioma, with an incidental asymptomatic right sylvian arachnoid cyst (Galassi type II). The initially planned surgery was postponed for 3 months due to COVID-19 restrictions, and he was kept on a high dose of steroids. Following tumor resection, the patient developed bilateral subdural empyemas with involvement of the arachnoid cyst, requiring bilateral craniotomies for evacuation of the empyemas and drainage of the arachnoid cyst.

Suppuration of central nervous system arachnoid cysts is a very rare complication following cranial surgery. The main working hypotheses include direct inoculation from surrounding inflamed meninges or haematogenous spread secondary to systemic bacteraemia, potentiated by steroid-induced immunosuppression. Even though being a rarity, infection of arachnoid cysts should be considered in immunosuppressed patients in the presence of risk factors such as previous craniotomy.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: A single center experiences [^112BEYrc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The arachnoid cyst was first described in 1831 in Bright's Medical Case Reports and supported by Krawchenko and Collins in 1979 on postmortem examination. In 1935, Barlow published the first case of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst. Arachnoid cysts are congenital lesions formed when the arachnoid membrane breaks during development. The mechanism by which these cysts form is still unknown; poor development of the cortical layers of the arachnoid membrane may occur during fetal migration. Some researchers suggest that CSF infiltration causes the cyst to expand, while others propose that vibrations through one-way valve mechanisms in arterial communication may be another possible mechanism. The intracystic fluid may be formed by cells secreted by the arachnoid directly into the cyst or by ectopic choroid-like structures. Martinez-Lage et al. suggested that the origin of intraventricular arachnoid cysts may be due to the replacement of arachnoid cells by vascular mesenchyme during choroid plexus development. Others have argued that arachnoid cells have an active secretion in the cyst wall.

While most arachnoid cysts remain stable throughout the patient's life, some may enlarge and cause complications such as spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage. However, most usually become symptomatic and are diagnosed early in childhood.

The most common intracranial arachnoid cysts were temporal cysts (30.2%), suprasellar (14.3%), quadrigeminal (12.7%), cerebellopontine angle (CPA) (11.1% each), and hemispheric cysts (7.9%). Rengachary and Watanabe detected the local

### Arachnoid granulations: Dynamic nature and review [^115FpeUB]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Arachnoid granulations have been known for centuries yet remain incompletely understood. While traditionally associated with cerebrospinal fluid transport, the precise mechanism remains uncertain. This manuscript reviews the literature on the anatomy, histology, and imaging findings of arachnoid granulations and their mimickers and anomalous variations. We highlight variations in incidence, size, and characteristics of arachnoid granulations on imaging and hypothesize that these variations may be explained by arachnoid granulations being dynamic due to varying functionality. We review the pathophysiologic role of arachnoid granulations in pathologies related to hydrocephalus, neurodegenerative disorders, and intracranial hypertension and hypotension. A further understanding of arachnoid granulations, their mechanism in cerebrospinal fluid transport, and change over time may provide a basis for future imaging markers and therapies.

### A new classification for pathologies of spinal meninges-part 2: Primary and secondary intradural arachnoid cysts [^116FfY8c]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts are rare causes of radiculopathy or myelopathy. Treatment options include resection, fenestration, or cyst drainage.

- **Objective**: To classify intradural spinal arachnoid cysts and present results of their treatment.

- **Methods**: Among 1,519 patients with spinal space-occupying lesions, 130 patients demonstrated intradural arachnoid cysts. Neuroradiological and surgical features were reviewed, and clinical data were analyzed.

- **Results**: Twenty-one patients presented arachnoid cysts as a result of an inflammatory leptomeningeal reaction related to meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intrathecal injections, intradural surgery, or trauma, i.e. secondary cysts. For the remaining 109 patients, no such history could be elucidated, i.e. primary cysts. Forty-six percent of primary and 86% of secondary cysts were associated with syringomyelia. Patients presented after an average history of 53 ± 88 months. There were 122 thoracic and 7 lumbar cysts, plus 1 cervical cyst. Fifty-nine patients with primary cysts and 15 patients with secondary cysts underwent laminotomies with complete or partial cyst resection and duraplasty. The mean follow-up was 57 ± 52 months. In the first postoperative year, profound improvements for primary cysts were noted, in contrast to marginal changes for secondary cysts. Progression-free survival for 10 years following surgery was determined as 83% for primary compared to 15% for secondary cysts. Despite differences in clinical presentation, progression-free survival was almost identical for patients with or without syringomyelia.

### Arachnoid cyst of the craniocervical junction: Case report [^116sGVCm]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

An arachnoid cyst at the craniocervical junction presenting with obstructive hydrocephalus as a result of blockage of the outflow of the fourth ventricle is described. This is a very rare anatomic site, with only five other cases described in the literature.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 37-year-old woman presented with a 9-month history of severe neck pain, persistent vomiting, visual disturbances, and numbness of the nose, cheek, and lips. She had severe bilateral papilledema on ophthalmoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a midline cystic lesion extending down to C2.

- **Intervention**: The patient underwent posterior fossa craniectomy and excision of the arachnoid cyst. She made a full recovery and was asymptomatic at follow-up examination.

The symptomatology of these rare craniocervical arachnoid cysts and their development are discussed.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^113FUEAm]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In some cases, benign-appearing intracranial cysts may become symptomatic through the mass effect of cranial nerves or functional parenchymal tissue. Despite this documented association, the mechanism by which intracranial cysts generate mass effect is unclear. Benign cysts that follow CSF signal intensity on MR imaging have classically been categorized as arachnoid cysts; however, it has become clear that there are multiple possible etiologies for benign intracranial cysts. In this study, we highlight glioependymal cysts, also called neuroglial cysts, which are pathologically identified by a simple cuboidal inner wall of EMA-negative ependymal cells, as well as a surrounding layer of GFAP-positive glial cells. These immunofluorescence characteristics align with previous studies, which report that glioependymal cysts are EMA-negative and GFAP-positive, whereas arachnoid cysts are EMA-positive and GFAP-negative.

### Supratentorial arachnoid cyst located in the brain parenchyma: Case report [^112MmfmG]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts have not been reported to be located within the brain parenchyma. We present a case of an arachnoid cyst that was contained entirely within the right frontal lobe, devoid of communication with the subarachnoid space and ventricle.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 65-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of progressive headache and nausea. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a well-defined, non-enhancing mass measuring 5 × 5 × 3.5 cm in the right frontal lobe. The mass appeared to be contained entirely within the brain parenchyma. The patient underwent a right frontal craniotomy, at which time the cystic mass was identified in the brain parenchyma without any communication with the arachnoid space. The cyst contained a clear fluid, and its wall was excised. The fluid contents demonstrated a composition similar to that of normal cerebrospinal fluid. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations of the cyst wall were compatible with the diagnosis of an arachnoid cyst. Postoperatively, the symptoms of the patient resolved, and no recurrence was observed up to 6 months after removal.

- **Conclusion**: The present case showed an intraparenchymal arachnoid cyst arising in the frontal lobe. Although the etiology is not known, an arachnoid cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis of primary intracerebral cysts.

### Atypical presentation of arachnoid web causing paraparesis with absence of sensory symptoms [^113yq6sm]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Arachnoid webs are thought to be the remnants of collapsed arachnoid cysts or potentially the result of trauma, such as from repeated falls. They compress the spinal cord, resulting in myelopathic symptoms that may be permanent if they persist untreated. Furthermore, new theories suggest that webs disrupt the pressure gradient of the spinal cord, creating a suction effect at the region of the web, which obstructs the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Arachnoid webs are notoriously subtle on imaging and, as they are a rare condition, often go undetected for a prolonged period during which patients experience progressive deterioration and profound reduction in quality of life.

An MRI of a patient with suspected arachnoid web characteristically shows dorsal indentation of the spinal cord, primarily in the thoracic spine. A comprehensive review by Nisson et al. supports that webs are preferentially present in the thoracic spine, with 100% of their 43 patients having webs in this region. This study additionally reports that webs more commonly affect males, with approximately two-thirds of cases presenting with a concomitant syrinx. Regardless of their etiology, arachnoid webs can cause devastating neurological dysfunction and necessitate evaluation for neurosurgical intervention.

### Symptomatic spinal arachnoid cysts: Report of two cases with review of the literature [^115cks8c]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Two unusual cases of intradural extramedullary noncommunicating arachnoid cysts are presented, along with a review of the literature.

- **Objective**: To assess the results of surgical excision in reversing symptoms and neurologic deficits.

- **Summary of background data**: Most patients with arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic. Noncommunicating intradural extramedullary arachnoid cysts are more rare than communicating ones and are an exceptionally rare cause of spinal cord compression. These cysts can rarely present with unusual symptoms such as angina.

- **Materials and methods**: The first case involved a 75-year-old woman with progressive paraparesis. The second case involved a 40-year-old man with signs and symptoms of angina and mild spasticity in the lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging in both cases revealed spinal cord compression as the cause of symptoms. The first patient is noted as the second oldest in the literature with an idiopathic spinal arachnoid cyst. The second case represents an atypical presentation not previously reported in literature.

- **Results**: Both patients underwent surgical excision of the arachnoid cyst, leading to resolution of symptoms and a reversal of the neurologic deficit.

- **Conclusions**: Complete recovery from an arachnoid cyst is possible after surgical excision, even in cases with prolonged symptoms and even among elderly patients.

### Rare intrasellar arachnoid cyst distinguishing from other benign cystic lesions and its surgical strategies [^111FZpqe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The study reported a case of an intrasellar arachnoid cyst with visual disturbances as the main symptom. An arachnoid cyst is a common intracranial benign space-occupying lesion, but it is rarely seen in the intrasellar region with fewer than 100 cases reported in English-language literature. Therefore, there is still controversy regarding the diagnosis and treatment of such patients. This article reviewed previous literature and discussed the differential diagnosis and surgical strategies for intrasellar arachnoid cysts in combination with our own case.

### Unexplained paraparesis following subarachnoid haemorrhage [^111mrt29]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Spinal arachnoid cysts (SAC) are rare in isolation, and the exact aetiology is still debated. Primary (congenital) cysts result from structural abnormalities in the arachnoid layer and primarily affect the thoracic region. Secondary cysts are induced by a multitude of factors, including infection, trauma, or iatrogenic response, and can affect any level of the spinal cord. While subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a relatively common condition with significant repercussions, its association with SAC is extremely rare.

When SAC is present, it may develop in the months and years following the original bleed, giving rise to new neurological symptoms. Prompt treatment is required to halt or reverse the worsening of symptoms, and questions are still being asked about the optimal approach to this condition.

A 42-year-old man presented with chronic back pain, severe worsening ataxia, and numbness below the umbilicus, seven months after treatment for a World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade five (WFNS V) SAH. Imaging revealed a SAC extending from T12 to L4, causing thecal compression. This was treated with an L3 laminectomy and marsupialization. An improvement in neurological function was observed at 6 months.

The aetiology of the SAC and its association with SAH are discussed, and a review of the relevant literature is provided.

### CT cisternography in intracranial symptomatic arachnoid cysts: classification and treatment [^115SLAxv]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study highlight that the symptom and neuroimaging indications for treating arachnoid cysts (ACs) are inadequate. Understanding the communication between the cyst and the subarachnoid space can aid in decision-making processes. This study conducted a dynamic examination of ACs using CT cisternography (CTC) and proposed a classification for arachnoid cysts.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 52 symptomatic patients with ACs were enrolled in this prospective study. CTC images were ordered for all enrolled patients at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after intrathecal Omnipaque administration. Enhancement in cysts was quantitatively measured and compared with neighboring subarachnoid spaces. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. For the CTC group, CTC results were considered before treatment, while the surgical group was treated without considering CTC results.

- **Results**: ACs in the study were classified into three types: complete (cyst filling time at 1 hour), incomplete (filling time began at 3 hours), and noncommunicating cysts (no or slight filling after 24 hours). In the CTC group, 22 patients with incomplete or noncommunicating cysts underwent surgeries, while 6 patients with complete communicating cysts were closely observed. Among the surgical patients in the CTC group, all experienced symptom relief, and 5 out of 6 observational patients showed clinical improvement or no deterioration during follow-up. In the surgical group, 18 out of 24 patients showed clinical improvement after surgeries, while 6 patients exhibited no difference before and after surgery.

### Sports participation and sports-related neurologic injuries in pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts [^116KLABA]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus recommendation regarding the safety of sports participation for pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts (ACs).

- **Objective**: To prospectively survey patients with ACs to define the risk of sports-associated neurologic injury in untreated and treated patients.

- **Methods**: A prospectively administered survey was given to all patients diagnosed with an AC who presented to a single pediatric neurosurgery clinic between December 2010 and December 2021. Data were recorded on demographic information, imaging characteristics, treatment, sports participation, and presence of sports-related neurologic injury. The type and date of surgery for the AC were noted if surgery was performed.

- **Results**: Of the 303 patients with completed surveys, 189 patients participated in sports, and 94 patients had prospective data available. There was no significant difference in cyst location or Galassi score between patients who did and did not participate in contact vs. noncontact sports and those who did and did not experience a concussion. A cumulative total of 2700.5 seasons of sports were played (2499.7 in untreated and 200.8 in treated patients). There were 44 sports-related concussions among 34 patients: 43 in untreated patients and 1 in a treated patient. For all participants, the concussion rate was 16.3 per 1000 seasons of all sports and 14.8 per 1000 seasons of contact sports. The concussion rate after AC treatment was 4.9 per 1000 seasons of all sports. Three patients experienced sports-related AC rupture or hemorrhage, none of which required surgery.

### Giant anterior cervicothoracic arachnoid cyst [^117XVP2u]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

A case report with a review of the literature demonstrates the imaging findings of a patient with recent onset, progressive spinal cord compression at T6 caused by a giant arachnoid cyst that was successfully treated.

- **Objective**: To present the imaging findings of a giant anterior cervicothoracic intradural arachnoid cyst using several methods before and after treatment.

- **Summary of background data**: This case demonstrates the imaging findings of the largest described anterior cervical arachnoid cyst straddling the cervicothoracic junction. It presented with spinal cord compression in a 26-year-old diagnosed by MRI and successfully treated surgically.

- **Methods**: The patient experienced progressive left-sided sensory and motor deficits below T6. Pain and temperature sensation were decreased. Reflexes were increased in both lower extremities with clonus. Preoperative MRI was followed by laminectomy and cyst fenestration with subsequent postoperative myelogram and CT.

- **Results**: Imaging confirmed the presence of a giant arachnoid cyst straddling the cervicothoracic junction. Postoperative imaging documented relief of spinal cord compression. Symptoms improved progressively after surgery. By the time of discharge, all residual neurologic deficits had resolved.

- **Conclusion**: Anterior arachnoid cysts straddling the cervicothoracic junction have yet to be reported, and arachnoid cysts involving the cervical region are extremely rare. Imaging demonstrated the cyst and its response to treatment. This patient responded well to surgery and was discharged without residual deficits.

### Exploring predictors of surgery and comparing operative treatment approaches for pediatric intracranial arachnoid cysts: a case series of 83 patients [^111zCkJv]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Although intracranial arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding on pediatric brain imaging, only a subset of patients require surgery for them. For the minority who undergo surgery, the comparative effectiveness of various surgical approaches is debated. The authors explored predictors of surgery and compared operative techniques for pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst seen at a tertiary care center.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed records of pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst. For each patient, data on baseline characteristics, the method of intervention, and surgical outcomes for the initial surgery were extracted, and cyst size at diagnosis was calculated (anteroposterior × craniocaudal × mediolateral). Baseline variables were analyzed as predictors of surgery using logistic regression modeling, excluding patients whose surgery was not related to cyst size, such as those with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to the cyst compressing a narrow CSF flow pathway or cyst rupture/hemorrhage. Data collected regarding surgical outcomes were analyzed descriptively.

- **Results**: Among 83 pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst seen over a 25-year period (1989–2013), 27 (33%) underwent surgery; all had at least one cyst-attributed symptom or finding. In the multivariate model, age at presentation and cyst size at diagnosis were independent predictors of surgery. Cyst size had greater predictive value; specifically, the area under the curve for the receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% CI 0.82–0.97).

### A sacral arachnoid cyst causing holocord syringomyelia [^114Rq4NU]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts (ACs) have an infrequent predilection for the sacrum. As with their counterparts in other regions of the spine, cysts in this location are mostly asymptomatic. Common presentations in symptomatic cases include pain in the low back or perineum, radiculopathy, and sphincteric dysfunction.

The authors report a hitherto undescribed presentation in which the predominant symptoms are those related to an associated holocord syrinx. This 15-year-old boy presented with fluctuating, spastic paraparesis and a dissociated sensory loss in the trunk. Admission MR imaging of the spine showed an extradural AC from S-2 to S-4 and a holocord, nonenhancing syrinx.

The patient underwent S-2 laminectomy, fenestration of the cyst, and partial excision of its wall. Intradural exploration revealed a normal-looking filum terminale and the absence of any dural communication with the cyst. At a follow-up visit 6 months after surgery, his motor and sensory deficits had resolved. Follow-up MR imaging showed complete resolution of the syrinx in the absence of the sacral AC.

This is the first report of a sacral extradural AC causing holocord syringomyelia. Because conventional theories of syrinx formation were not helpful in elucidating this case, a hypothesis is postulated to explain the clinicoradiological oddity.

### Symptomatic increased intracranial pressure due to arachnoid cysts [^115eyKft]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are typically benign lesions, but rarely, they may cause signs and symptoms relating to increased intracranial pressure. We report four pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts who received successful surgical treatment after failing to respond to conservative medical therapies. After undergoing a shunting procedure, each patient experienced improvement in symptoms, resolution of optic disc swelling, and reduction or elimination of medications necessary to manage the condition. These cases illustrate the potential for arachnoid cysts to outstrip compensatory mechanisms and cause signs and symptoms requiring definitive surgical intervention.

### Microsurgical keyhole approach for middle fossa arachnoid cyst fenestration [^111jCHTw]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal surgical treatment for symptomatic temporal arachnoid cysts is controversial. Therapeutic options include cyst shunting, endoscopic fenestration, and craniotomy for fenestration. We reviewed the results for patients treated primarily with craniotomy and fenestration at our institution to provide a baseline for comparisons of the efficacies of other treatment modalities.

A retrospective review of data for 50 children who underwent keyhole craniotomy for fenestration of temporal arachnoid cysts between 1994 and 2001 was performed after institutional review board approval. During that period, the first-line treatment for all symptomatic middle fossa arachnoid cysts was microcraniotomy for fenestration. Microsurgical dissection to create communications between the cyst cavity and basal cisterns was the goal. All patient records were reviewed, and numerous variables related to presentation, cyst size and classification, treatment, cyst resolution, symptom resolution, follow-up periods, and cyst outcomes were recorded.

Fifty temporal arachnoid cysts in 50 treated patients were identified. The average age at the time of surgery was 68 ± 57.2 months. The follow-up periods averaged 36 months. There were 34 male and 16 female patients in the series. Twenty-six cysts were on the left side. Indications for surgery included intractable headaches (45%), increasing cyst size (21%), seizures (25%), and hemiparesis (8%). The symptoms most likely to improve were hemiparesis (100%) and abducens nerve palsies. Headaches improved in 67% of cases, while seizures showed variable improvement.

### Long-term endocrine outcome of suprasellar arachnoid cysts [^113F16RZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Due to their distinct location, suprasellar arachnoid cysts are known to cause a wide variety of problems, such as hydrocephalus, endocrine symptoms, and visual abnormalities. However, the long-term outcome of these cysts has not been elucidated. To find out the long-term outcome of suprasellar arachnoid cysts, a retrospective review of the patients was performed. The neurological and endocrine symptoms were thoroughly reviewed.

- **Methods**: Forty-five patients with suprasellar arachnoid cysts, with an average follow-up duration of 9.7 years, were enrolled in the study. A comprehensive review was performed of the results of follow-up regarding not only neurological symptoms but also endocrine status. The outcomes of eight patients who did not undergo operations and were asymptomatic or had symptoms unrelated to the cyst were included in the series.

- **Results**: Surgery was most effective for the symptoms related to hydrocephalus, with improvement noted in all 32 patients. However, endocrine symptoms persisted after surgery in four out of four patients and required further medical management. More surprisingly, a fairly large number of patients (14 out of 40; one was excluded because no pre- or postoperative endocrine evaluation was available) who had not shown endocrine symptoms at the time of the initial diagnosis and treatment later developed endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and growth hormone deficiency. The patients with endocrine symptoms detected during follow-up included those in both the operated (12 out of 32) and nonoperated (2 out of 8) groups, who had been stable during follow-up since the initial diagnosis.
