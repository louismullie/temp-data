## Question

evidence for aspirin in pre-eclampsia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for aspirin in pre-eclampsia, including efficacy, dose, timing, safety, and guideline alignment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why aspirin might work mechanistically. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base, especially randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine dose and timing effects, followed by safety signals. After that, I need to check how major guidelines translate this into practice. Finally, I will consider controversies, implementation gaps, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and mechanism. Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and its pathophysiology includes failed trophoblastic invasion, placental ischemia, and a prostacyclin–thromboxane imbalance with platelet activation, which provides a rationale for low-dose aspirin to shift the balance toward vasodilation and anti-thrombosis, particularly when started early in gestation [^73544591] [^441b4387].

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials consistently show that low-dose aspirin reduces preeclampsia, with the most robust data from the 2019 Cochrane review of 77 trials and 40,249 women showing an 18% relative risk reduction in proteinuric preeclampsia and meaningful reductions in preterm birth and perinatal mortality, with high-quality evidence overall [^97186287]. The 2021 USPSTF update, informed by 23 RCTs and 26,952 participants, corroborates a 15% reduction in preeclampsia and significant reductions in preterm birth, SGA/IUGR, and perinatal mortality, again with high-quality evidence and a Grade B recommendation [^ca1261bb] [^ff2e1a0d].

> Wait, let me verify dose and timing nuances because these are often misunderstood. Aggregate and subgroup analyses suggest greater benefit when aspirin is initiated at or before 16 weeks and at doses of 100–150 mg/day, particularly for preterm preeclampsia, whereas standard 81 mg dosing still shows benefit but may be less potent for early-onset disease; the ASPRE trial using 150 mg from 11–14 weeks demonstrated a 62% reduction in preterm preeclampsia, and meta-analytic syntheses report the clearest signal with ≥ 100 mg and early initiation, though head-to-head dose comparisons remain limited [^715d1697] [^3b59fb81] [^3a628681]. Hold on, I should double-check the counterargument: an individual participant data meta-analysis found no interaction by timing, suggesting benefit regardless of starting before or after 16 weeks, but this analysis did not isolate the preterm phenotype and may dilute timing effects, so I should be cautious not to overstate uniformity across subtypes [^66c79357].

> Next, I should review safety. Across large RCTs and meta-analyses, low-dose aspirin in pregnancy appears safe, with no significant increase in major maternal or neonatal bleeding, placental abruption, or congenital anomalies; the Cochrane review notes a small, clinically modest increase in postpartum hemorrhage > 500 mL and a possible slight increase in placental abruption, but pooled estimates are not statistically significant and must be weighed against benefits, especially in higher-risk populations [^97186287] [^9f7ff333]. I need to ensure I note that rare harms cannot be fully excluded, but observed absolute risks are low and generally acceptable in risk–benefit analyses [^ca1261bb].

> I should confirm how guidelines translate this into practice. USPSTF recommends 81 mg/day after 12 weeks in those at high risk, with consideration in those with more than one moderate risk factor, and emphasizes that most trials initiated before 20 weeks, aligning with early initiation for maximal benefit [^ff2e1a0d] [^460bef48]. ACOG/SMFM similarly endorse 81 mg/day from 12–28 weeks, optimally before 16 weeks, for high risk or multiple moderate risks, and explicitly do not recommend universal prophylaxis outside risk-based criteria [^3a5b1fe8] [^3b59fb81]. International guidance varies: RCOG/NICE endorse 75–150 mg from 12 weeks based on risk, WHO suggests 75 mg before 20 weeks, and FIGO supports 150 mg from 11–14+6 weeks in screened high-risk patients, reflecting evolving but convergent themes of early initiation and dose optimization [^2fa33656] [^636b486e].

> But wait, what about universal aspirin versus risk-based strategies. Universal prophylaxis has been proposed given low cost and safety, yet modeling and implementation data suggest that risk-based approaches yield higher net benefit when balancing bleeding trade-offs and false positives, and older universal trials showed low adherence without clear preeclampsia reduction; thus, current consensus favors targeted therapy rather than universal use pending stronger population-level evidence [^d139b6c4] [^02a913e9] [^11f6f6c2]. I should double-check that this remains an area of active debate, and indeed, ongoing and recently funded dose-comparison trials may refine the threshold for broader use if benefits clearly outweigh harms at the population level [^7b6b583b].

> I need to ensure I address implementation and equity. Real-world uptake of aspirin remains suboptimal, with barriers including complex risk scoring, counseling demands, and adherence issues; qualitative work highlights knowledge gaps, access, and side-effect concerns, while first-trimester combined screening algorithms can improve detection of preterm preeclampsia and linkage to early aspirin, though rollout has been uneven and resource-dependent [^93c20127] [^24ed7d57]. Hold on, I should verify that disparities in preeclampsia burden, particularly among Black patients, are recognized by USPSTF as a research and implementation priority, which they are, underscoring the need for equitable screening and access to prophylaxis [^cf49f19a].

> Let me reconsider the dose question one more time. While 81 mg is guideline-concordant and evidence-based, emerging syntheses suggest that 150 mg initiated before 16 weeks may confer greater protection against preterm preeclampsia, but I should caution that direct comparative trials are limited and ongoing; clinicians may reasonably individualize within the 75–162 mg range when early initiation is feasible, especially in very high-risk patients, while acknowledging the evidence gap and discussing uncertainties with patients [^3a628681] [^7b6b583b]. I should confirm that ACOG still advises 81 mg pending stronger comparative data, which it does, while noting that bedtime dosing and continuation until delivery are reasonable and supported by physiologic and trial patterns [^3a5b1fe8] [^9c262fcd].

> In summary, I should synthesize a practical approach. For patients at high risk of preeclampsia, initiate low-dose aspirin, typically 81 mg/day, after 12 weeks and ideally before 16 weeks, continuing until delivery, with consideration of 150 mg in select very-high-risk patients when early initiation is assured and shared decision-making supports it; for those with more than one moderate risk factor, consider aspirin after weighing modest absolute benefit and minimal risk, and avoid routine use in low-risk patients absent other indications [^ff2e1a0d] [^3a5b1fe8] [^3b59fb81]. I should double-check that this aligns with the strength of evidence and guidelines, and yes, the net benefit is substantial in high-risk populations, with favorable safety and cost profiles supporting implementation where risk stratification is feasible [^ca1261bb] [^97186287].

---

Low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of preeclampsia by about 10–20% in high-risk pregnancies [^97186287] [^051e8486], with the greatest benefit for preterm preeclampsia when started before 16 weeks [^715d1697] [^3b59fb81]. The optimal dose is **75–162 mg/day**, typically 81 mg in the US, initiated between 12 and 28 weeks (ideally before 16 weeks) and continued until delivery [^3a5b1fe8] [^9c262fcd]. Benefits include fewer preterm births, less fetal growth restriction, and lower perinatal mortality, with no significant increase in major bleeding or placental abruption [^ca1261bb] [^9f7ff333]. Major guidelines (USPSTF, ACOG, WHO) recommend risk-based use in high-risk patients, not universal prophylaxis [^ff2e1a0d] [^3a5b1fe8].

---

## Mechanism of action

Aspirin's benefit in preeclampsia is thought to reflect selective COX-1 inhibition, reducing thromboxane A2 (a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor) while sparing prostacyclin (a vasodilator), thereby improving uteroplacental perfusion and reducing endothelial dysfunction [^441b4387] [^73544591].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting aspirin use

Multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate that low-dose aspirin reduces preeclampsia risk and improves perinatal outcomes:

- **Cochrane review (2019)**: 77 trials, 40,249 women; 18% reduction in preeclampsia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77–0.88); NNT 61 [^97186287].
- **Individual patient data meta-analysis (2007)**: 32,217 women; 10% reduction in preeclampsia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84–0.97) [^051e8486].
- **ASPREE trial**: 1,776 high-risk women; 150 mg aspirin from 11–14 weeks reduced preterm preeclampsia by 62% (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20–0.74) [^3b59fb81] [^ad96ec48].

---

## Optimal dosage and timing

- **Dosage**: 75–162 mg/day; 81 mg is standard in the US; 150 mg is used in some guidelines and trials [^3a5b1fe8] [^9c262fcd] [^636b486e].
- **Timing**: start at 12–28 weeks, ideally before 16 weeks; earlier initiation enhances benefit, especially for preterm preeclampsia [^3a5b1fe8] [^715d1697].
- **Duration**: continue until delivery or 36–37 weeks [^3a5b1fe8] [^9c262fcd].

---

## Safety profile

Low-dose aspirin in pregnancy is **generally safe**, with no significant increase in major maternal or neonatal bleeding, placental abruption, or congenital anomalies [^ca1261bb] [^9f7ff333]. Minor increases in postpartum hemorrhage are possible but clinically modest [^97186287].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | 81 mg/day after 12 weeks in high-risk pregnancies; consider if ≥ 2 moderate risk factors [^ff2e1a0d] [^460bef48] |
| ACOG | 81 mg/day from 12–28 weeks (ideally < 16 weeks) until delivery in high-risk pregnancies [^3a5b1fe8] [^3b59fb81] |
| WHO | 75 mg/day before 20 weeks in high-risk pregnancies [^ea224e5b] |
| RCOG | 75–150 mg/day from 12 weeks in high-risk pregnancies [^2fa33656] |

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Universal prophylaxis**: not supported; benefits are risk-dependent and universal use may increase unnecessary exposure [^d139b6c4] [^02a913e9].
- **Dose optimization**: 150 mg may be superior to 81 mg for preterm preeclampsia, but head-to-head trials are limited [^3a628681] [^7b6b583b].
- **Adherence**: critical for efficacy; late initiation or poor adherence reduces benefit [^bc377a62].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Low-dose aspirin is a **cost-effective, safe, and evidence-based** strategy to reduce preeclampsia risk in high-risk pregnancies, with the greatest impact on preterm disease when started early. Clinicians should use risk-based screening to identify candidates and initiate therapy before 16 weeks when possible.

### Low-dose aspirin therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia: time to reconsider our recommendations? [^2fa33656]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiation of 81 mg of aspirin daily for women at risk of preeclampsia between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation, optimally before 16 weeks, with continuation until delivery. The World Health Organization recommends that 75 mg of aspirin should be initiated before 20 weeks of gestation for women at high risk of preeclampsia. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence quality statement on "Antenatal Assessment of Pre-eclampsia Risk" request that healthcare providers prescribe low-dose aspirin to pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia daily from 12 weeks of gestation. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends 150 mg of aspirin daily, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines suggest risk stratification with a dosage of 75 mg for those at moderate risk of preeclampsia and 150 mg for those at high risk of preeclampsia. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics initiative on preeclampsia recommends 150 mg of aspirin to be initiated at 11 to 14+6 week's gestation and also proposes that 2 tablets of 81 mg is an acceptable alternative. Review of the available evidence suggests that both the dosage and timing of aspirin initiation is key to its effectiveness at reducing the risk of preeclampsia. Doses of > 100 mg of aspirin daily initiated before 16 weeks' gestation seem to be most effective at reducing the risk of preeclampsia and thus dosages recommended by most major societies and organizations may not be effective. Randomized control trials examining 81 mg vs 162 mg of aspirin daily for the prevention of preeclampsia are required to assess the safety and efficacy of aspirin dosages available in the United States.

### Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^97186287]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and dipyridamole, when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 March 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search in September 2019 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent were included. Studies only published in abstract format were eligible for inclusion if sufficient information was available. We would have included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials, if any had been identified in our search strategy. Quasi-random studies were excluded. Participants were pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were administration of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole), comparisons were either placebo or no antiplatelet.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For this update we incorporated individual participant data (IPD) from trials with this available, alongside aggregate data (AD) from trials where it was not, in order to enable reliable subgroup analyses and inclusion of two key new outcomes. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

Seventy-seven trials (40,249 women, and their babies) were included, although three trials (relating to 233 women) did not contribute data to the meta-analysis. Nine of the trials contributing data were large (> 1000 women recruited), accounting for 80% of women recruited. Although the trials took place in a wide range of countries, all of the nine large trials involved only women in high-income and/or upper middle-income countries. IPD were available for 36 trials (34,514 women), including all but one of the large trials. Low-dose aspirin alone was the intervention in all the large trials, and most trials overall. Dose in the large trials was 50 mg (1 trial, 1106 women), 60 mg (5 trials, 22,322 women), 75mg (1 trial, 3697 women) 100 mg (1 trial, 3294 women) and 150 mg (1 trial, 1776 women). Most studies were either low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias; and the large trials were all low risk of bas. Antiplatelet agents versus placebo/no treatment The use of antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of proteinuric pre-eclampsia by 18% (36,716 women, 60 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88; high-quality evidence), number needed to treat for one women to benefit (NNTB) 61 (95% CI 45 to 92). There was a small (9%) reduction in the RR for preterm birth < 37 weeks (35,212 women, 47 trials; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95, high-quality evidence), NNTB 61 (95% CI 42 to 114), and a 14% reduction infetal deaths, neonatal deaths or death before hospital discharge (35,391 babies, 52 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; high-quality evidence), NNTB 197 (95% CI 115 to 681). Antiplatelet agents slightly reduced the risk of small-for-gestational age babies (35,761 babies, 50 trials; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; high-quality evidence), NNTB 146 (95% CI 90 to 386), and pregnancies with serious adverse outcome (a composite outcome including maternal death, baby death, pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; 17,382 women; 13 trials, high-quality evidence), NNTB 54 (95% CI 34 to 132). Antiplatelet agents probably slightly increase postpartum haemorrhage > 500 mL (23,769 women, 19 trials; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; moderate-quality evidence due to clinical heterogeneity), and they probably marginally increase the risk of placental abruption, although for this outcome the evidence was downgraded due to a wide confidence interval including the possibility of no effect (30,775 women; 29 trials; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54; moderate-quality evidence). Data from two large trials which assessed children at aged 18 months (including results from over 5000 children), did not identify clear differences in development between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Administering low-dose aspirin to pregnant women led to small-to-moderate benefits, including reductions in pre-eclampsia (16 fewer per 1000 women treated), preterm birth (16 fewer per 1000 treated), the baby being born small-for-gestational age (seven fewer per 1000 treated) and fetal or neonatal death (five fewer per 1000 treated). Overall, administering antiplatelet agents to 1000 women led to 20 fewer pregnancies with serious adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence for all these outcomes was high. Aspirin probably slightly increased the risk of postpartum haemorrhage of more than 500 mL, however, the quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded to moderate, due to concerns of clinical heterogeneity in measurements of blood loss. Antiplatelet agents probably marginally increase placental abruption, but the quality of the evidence was downgraded to moderate due to low event numbers and thus wide 95% CI. Overall, antiplatelet agents improved outcomes, and at these doses appear to be safe. Identifying women who are most likely to respond to low-dose aspirin would improve targeting of treatment. As almost all the women in this review were recruited to the trials after 12 weeks' gestation, it is unclear whether starting treatment before 12 weeks' would have additional benefits without any increase in adverse effects. While there was some indication that higher doses of aspirin would be more effective, further studies would be warranted to examine this.

### Utility of the USPSTF for preeclampsia risk assessment and aspirin… [^dee2bd84]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that USPSTF guidelines provide little utility for estimating preeclampsia risk and subsequent AP recommendation among individuals at moderate risk for preeclampsia, which constitute the majority of the population. Importance The US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on preeclampsia risk assessment and aspirin prophylaxis have not been evaluated for clinical utility. Among individuals with 2 or more moderate risk factors but without any high risk factor, nulliparity was associated with significantly increased risk of preeclampsia, while AMA was associated with decreased risk. Conclusions and Relevance In this prospective cohort study of 5684 singleton pregnancies, 89% of the population was assessed as having increased risk of preeclampsia by USPSTF criteria.

These findings suggest that moderate risk factors in the absence of high risk factors show no or low value for estimating the risk of developing preeclampsia, leading to nonspecific recommendations of AP in the moderate risk category. While the majority of preeclampsia was diagnosed at term, 276 participants received a diagnosis of preeclampsia prior to 37 weeks. AP was recommended for 2438 individuals. a potential solution to this deficit. 43 An alternative approach would be to provide all pregnant patients with AP. 44–47 This strategy does not account for the potential trade-offs of risk involved in aspirin prophylaxis, given there is an evolving literature on the possible risks of aspirin administration. 48, 49 This risk-benefit calculus might be acceptable only for those at high risk of preeclampsia, particularly when higher doses are considered, 50 but may be excessive for those at lower risk levels.

Additionally, while the USPSTF guidelines focus on AP, there are other known interventions that reduce the risk of preeclampsia in those at high risk, making it all the more important to effectively identify the right patients. 51 Finally, the potential for aspirin nonresponders has been demonstrated in other aspects of medical prophylaxis52, 53 but remains unexplored in obstetrics.

### Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^64e80665]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003), EMBASE (1994 to 2003) and we handsearched the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi-random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trials for inclusion in the review and extracted data. We entered data into the Review Manager software and double checked.

Main Results

Fifty-one trials involving 36,500 women are included in this review. There is a 19% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents ((43 trials, 33,439 women; relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.88); number needed to treat (NNT) 69 (51, 109)). Twenty-eight trials (31,845 women) reported preterm birth. There is a small (7%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks ((RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98); NNT 83 (50, 238)). Fetal or neonatal deaths were reported in 38 trials (34,010 women). Overall there is a 16% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96); NNT 227 (128, 909)). Small-for-gestational age babies were reported in 32 trials (24,310 women), with an 8% reduction in risk (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low-dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment is best started, and at what dose.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^27f6af49]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: There is now good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) prevent pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their babies. A Cochrane Review identified moderate, but clinically important, reductions in the relative risks of pre-eclampsia (19%), preterm birth (7%) and perinatal mortality (16%) in women allocated antiplatelets, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet. Uncertainty remains, however, about whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, what dose of aspirin is best and when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start. Rather than undertake new trials, the best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from women enrolled in each trial. METHODS/DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis based on individual patient data. This involves the central collection, validation and re-analysis of thoroughly checked data from individual women in all the available randomised trials. The objective is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, will reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets delay the onset of pre-eclampsia or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile; when commenced during pregnancy; and/or by dose. DISCUSSION: The PARIS (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies) Collaboration has been formed to undertake the review. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Final results should be available by 2006–7.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^051e8486]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of mortality and morbidity during pregnancy and childbirth. Antiplatelet agents, especially low-dose aspirin, might prevent or delay pre-eclampsia, and thereby improve outcome. Our aim was to assess the use of antiplatelet agents for the primary prevention of pre-eclampsia, and to explore which women are likely to benefit most.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 32,217 women, and their 32,819 babies, recruited to 31 randomised trials of pre-eclampsia primary prevention.

Findings

For women assigned to receive antiplatelet agents rather than control, the relative risk of developing pre-eclampsia was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84–0.97), of delivering before 34 weeks was 0.90 (0.83–0.98), and of having a pregnancy with a serious adverse outcome was 0.90 (0.85–0.96). Antiplatelet agents had no significant effect on the risk of death of the fetus or baby, having a small for gestational age infant, or bleeding events for either the women or their babies. No particular subgroup of women was substantially more or less likely to benefit from antiplatelet agents than any other.

Interpretation

Antiplatelet agents during pregnancy are associated with moderate but consistent reductions in the relative risk of pre-eclampsia, of birth before 34 weeks' gestation, and of having a pregnancy with a serious adverse outcome.

### Prevention of pre-eclampsia with aspirin: a systematic review of guidelines and evaluation of the quality of recommendation evidence [^81e41706]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence has shown significant benefits of aspirin for preventing pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to systematically review recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and other recommendation documents on aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

Ten databases were searched for statements from December 1, 2013, to January 1, 2022.

Selection Criteria

Without language restrictions, the most recent version of documents was considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted recommendations. Guideline quality was assessed using a modified AGREE-II instrument and the AGREE-REX tool.

Main Results

Out of 48 statements on the prevention of pre-eclampsia, 46 had recommendations on use of aspirin. Of them, 39 were supported by evidence from systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials. Three statements reported aspirin's significant reductions in preterm pre-eclampsia and one in perinatal death. Concerning quality, 41% of statements were rated as high quality in all domains of the AGREE-II tool, 15% were rated high quality in all domains of the AGREE-REX tool, and 11% were rated high quality in all domains on both tools.

Conclusions

While 96% of statements advocated for use of aspirin, only 9% reported a significant reduction in preterm pre-eclampsia or perinatal death. Based on the AGREE tools, future statements could use methodological improvement.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the types of study designs, participants, interventions and data completeness to be included in the review are listed below. Each potentially eligible study will be assessed independently by two members of the Secretariat, unblinded to the trial's identity. Any differences of opinion regarding the assessment of the inclusion criteria will be resolved by discussion between the two assessors. If differences cannot be resolved, a third member of the Secretariat will be asked to assess the study. If individual patient data are unavailable from an eligible trial, the trial will remain included in the review and aggregate data will be used.

a. Study design

Studies will be included in the review if they were randomised trials. Quasi-random study designs, such as those using alternate allocation, will be excluded. The level of allocation concealment within each trial will be assessed according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook, and classified as either adequate, unclear or clearly inadequate. These assessments will be made together with the outcomes of thorough data checking procedures.

b. Participants

Participants will be pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Women who started treatment postpartum will be excluded, as will those who already have a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia at trial entry (defined as hypertension with new onset proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation, not due to renal disease).

c. Interventions

The interventions will be any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole), or any combination of antiplatelet agents, compared with placebo or no antiplatelet agent. This is regardless of dose, mode of administration and irrespective of whether the antiplatelet is in combination with another drug. Trials that assessed only physiological outcomes following a short duration of intended therapy will be excluded.

d. Completeness of follow-up

The main analyses will include all trials that fulfill the previous inclusion criteria, regardless of completeness of follow-up. Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the effect of the inclusion of data from trials where only small numbers of enrolled participants have available outcome data. The threshold for an acceptable level of data completeness may vary by outcome. For example, for long-term follow-up of women and children, data may be included if follow-up was less than 80% provided that substantive bias between the groups was unlikely. Other outcomes from each trial may only be included in the analysis if available for 80% or more of women.

Methods/design

Objectives

The objective of this review is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets reduce the severity of pre-eclampsia and/or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile, when commenced during pregnancy, and/or by dose.

The main questions to be addressed in this review are:

- Do antiplatelet agents, primarily low dose aspirin, have clinically important benefits for women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia and their babies?

Investigation of this hypothesis will also explore whether the treatment effect differs, in a clinically meaningful way, between women with different risk factors such as those with a history of early onset pre-eclampsia, renal disease, diabetes, chronic hypertension, or autoimmune disease.

- Does the planned dose of aspirin affect outcome in terms of preventing or delaying the onset of pre-eclampsia or other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth or perinatal death?

- Do the effects of aspirin differ according to gestation at onset of treatment?

Identifying studies

The search strategy to identify potentially eligible studies will include a search of the register of trials developed and maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group. Details of how this register is maintained are available elsewhere, but it involves extensive searching of bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and hand searching of relevant journals. Trialists will be asked if they know of any further studies. [See Additional file 1] for the list of trials potentially eligible for inclusion. In addition, all members of the Collaborative Group will be asked to notify any unpublished trials of which they are aware.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^3daaf0e9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Summary of systematic review of aggregate data in 2004

The updated Cochrane Review identified 51 trials with over 36,500 pregnant women evaluating antiplatelet agents, principally low dose aspirin, for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Nine of these trials included over 1000 women, and 15 involved less than 50 women. Fifty-one studies were excluded, mostly due to the non-availability of clinically relevant data. Aggregate data from the included trials demonstrated a 19% reduction (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.88) in the risk of developing pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet. There was also a small (7%) reduction in the risk of pre-term birth (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89–0.98) and a 16% reduction in the risk of the baby dying (RR 0.84 95% CI 0.74–0.96). Based on the average risk of women included in these trials, about 70 women would have to be treated to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia, and 240 to prevent one baby death.

These effects are much smaller than had initially been hoped for but, nevertheless, potentially they have considerable public health importance. The conclusion from this aggregate data review was that for most low-risk women large numbers of women would need to be treated with antiplatelets agents to prevent one episode of either pre-eclampsia or perinatal death. Whether there are specific high risk sub-groups of pregnant women for whom there might be greater benefits, remains unclear, as does the best time to initiate treatment, and at what dose. The aim is now to extend this review based on aggregate data, to utilise the available data for every individual woman in each trial to help address these remaining questions. The use of individual data for each woman will allow for more powerful and flexible analysis of both subgroups and outcomes. This review will therefore provide more specific information to guide the care of women at risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^094bfa4a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia and its consequences, such as preterm birth and perinatal mortality, uncertainty remains regarding whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start, and whether treatment effectiveness is dependent on antiplatelet dose.

The best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from all women enrolled in trials that have addressed this question. This approach has been described as the 'gold standard' of systematic review methodology as it allows for more powerful and flexible analysis of both subgroups and outcomes.

The PARIS Collaboration has been formed to undertake a systematic review of all available trials, with meta-analysis based on individual patient data, to answer these important clinical questions. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Provision of data by the participating Collaborators commenced in 2004, and results will be ready for presentation in 2006. Following consultation and discussion with the Collaborative Group, the main publication is expected in early 2007.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^cb7eb984]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There is now good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) prevent pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their babies. A Cochrane Review identified moderate, but clinically important, reductions in the relative risks of pre-eclampsia (19%), preterm birth (7%) and perinatal mortality (16%) in women allocated antiplatelets, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet.

Uncertainty remains, however, about whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, what dose of aspirin is best and when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start. Rather than undertake new trials, the best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from women enrolled in each trial.

Methods/Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis based on individual patient data. This involves the central collection, validation and re-analysis of thoroughly checked data from individual women in all the available randomised trials.

The objective is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, will reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets delay the onset of pre-eclampsia or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile; when commenced during pregnancy; and/or by dose.

Discussion

The PARIS (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies) Collaboration has been formed to undertake the review. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Final results should be available by 2006–7.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^202ce1ec]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a common condition of pregnancy, marked by the onset of hypertension and proteinuria. At least 75 randomized controlled trials have shown that antiplatelet agents — especially aspirin — effectively and safely prevent pre-eclampsia among women at moderate or high risk of developing the condition. Meta-analyses have shown a 53% (95% confidence interval 35% to 66%) reduction in relative risk for pre-eclampsia when aspirin is started at 12–16 weeks' gestation among high risk women. Internationally published clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that physicians and midwives use aspirin to treat women at high risk of pre-eclampsia. These guidelines suggest choosing from a list of single risk factors to identify women at high risk or from a combination of moderate risk factors, but the derivation of this partial list was neither systematic nor based on clinical risk factors that are available up to 16 weeks' gestation. Focus on those at high risk of pre-eclampsia avoids the treatment of healthy women, who gain little or no benefit from aspirin prophylaxis.

Pre-eclampsia prophylaxis

Guideline 4.3.1

We recommend women with CKD are offered low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg) in pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (1B).

Guideline 4.3.2

We suggest kidney donors are offered low dose aspirin (75 mg–150 mg) to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (2D).

Rationale

Women with CKD have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia compared to women without CKD and should be offered pre-eclampsia prophylaxis with aspirin. This recommendation is generalised from high-quality evidence that low dose aspirin is associated with a reduced incidence of pre-eclampsia in other high-risk cohorts, although there is limited definitive evidence as to the optimal gestation and dose for women with CKD. A recent subgroup analysis of women with chronic hypertension from a randomised-controlled trial of 150 mg aspirin (150 mg) failed to show a reduction in the risk of subsequent pre-eclampsia, although these data are difficult to interpret in the absence of standardised diagnostic criteria for superimposed pre-eclampsia. Current national guidance recommends prescribing 75–150 mg of aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation onwards, but future research may elucidate optimisation of prophylaxis in women with CKD.

Women who have donated a kidney are at increased risk of pre-eclampsia (odds ratio 2.4; 95% confidence intervals 1.0–5.6). Pre-eclampsia prophylaxis with aspirin should be discussed with these women, particularly in the presence of other known risk factors as outlined in national guidelines.

The benefit of calcium supplementation in reducing the prevalence of pre-eclampsia remains unclear. A Cochrane systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed that supplementation of a least 1 g calcium per day was associated with a 55% reduction in pre-eclampsia, although the effect was mostly shown in smaller trials, with possible confounding by low dietary calcium intake. In contrast, large randomised controlled trials of calcium supplementation starting both before and after 20 weeks' gestation have failed to show a benefit in reducing the incidence of pre-eclampsia. In the absence of evidence specific to women with CKD, and given the potential cardiovascular sequelae of a positive calcium balance in women with CKD, it was the consensus opinion of the guideline committee that calcium supplementation to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia cannot be recommended for women with CKD, based on current evidence.

### WITHDRAWN: antiplatelet agents for preventing and treating pre-eclampsia [^5912d7eb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and to those with established pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was also searched, The Cochrane Library 1999 Issue 1, Embase was searched from 1994–1999 and hand searches were performed of the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and those with pre-eclampsia before delivery. Women treated postpartum were excluded. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trials for inclusion in the review and extraction of data was performed independently and unblinded by two reviewers. Data were entered into the Review Manager software and double checked.

Main Results

Forty two trials involving over 32,000 women were included in this review, with 30,563 women in the prevention trials. There is a 15% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents [32 trials with 29,331 women; relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.78, 0.92); Number needed to treat (NNT) 89, (59, 167)]. This reduction is regardless of risk status at trial entry or whether a placebo was used, and irrespective of the dose of aspirin or gestation at randomisation. Twenty three trials (28,268 women) reported preterm delivery. There is a small (8%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks [RR 0.92, (0.88, 0.97); NNT 72 (44, 200)]. Baby deaths were reported in 30 trials (30,093 women). Overall there is a 14% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group [RR 0.86, (0.75, 0.98); NNT 250 (125, > 10000)]. Small for gestational age babies were reported in 25 trials (20,349 women), with no overall difference between the groups, RR 0.92, (0.84, 1.01). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome. Five trials compared antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agent for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. There are insufficient data for any firm conclusions about the possible effects of these agents when used for treatment of pre-eclampsia.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment should be started, and at what dose.

Planned analyses

This section contains a summary of the planned analyses. The full, detailed analysis plan will be discussed and agreed upon by the Collaborators before any data have been analysed.

Analysis will aim to be of all women ever randomised and will be based on intention to treat. In the main analyses a two stage approach will be taken. Outcomes will be analysed in their original trial and then these separate results will be combined to give an overall measure of effect. A fixed effect model will be used and the assumption of homogeneity of treatment effects will be tested using the chi squared test. The I² statistic will also be used to assess consistency of results.

1. Outcomes to be analysed

The main analyses comparing the effect of antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agents will be undertaken for all outcomes listed below, for the woman and any fetus/baby. The planned sub-group and sensitivity analyses will be restricted to the designated main outcomes listed as follows:

a. Main outcomes

- pre-eclampsia

- pregnancy loss / neonatal death

- pre-term birth

- small for gestational age infant

- pregnancy with serious adverse outcome

b. Other outcomes

- early onset pre-eclampsia

- maternal death

- severe maternal morbidity

- antepartum haemorrhage

- placental abruption

- induction of labour

- Caesarean section delivery

- postpartum haemorrhage

- gestation at delivery

- infant admission to special care or neonatal intensive care unit

- infant required assisted ventilation

- neonatal bleeding

- infant death

2. Planned sub-group analyses

The planned sub-group analyses will be restricted to the designated main outcomes unless there are clear indications for expanding the analyses further.

a. Trial-level characteristics

The effect of antiplatelet therapy may vary across the trials in the meta-analysis because they have used different agents in different ways. To explore this further, analyses are planned whereby trials will be grouped according to the agent used and by dose. These analyses will focus on the main outcomes. Trials will be classified into subsets based on the following:

(i) type of antiplatelet(s)

Trials will be grouped by the type of antiplatelet agent (trials that used aspirin alone, trials that used other antiplatelet agents, trials that used both aspirin and other antiplatelets agents) given as the active treatment.

(ii) daily dose of aspirin

In trials that used aspirin alone, trials will be grouped by planned aspirin dose (< 75 mg, 75–149 mg, ≥ 150 mg).

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^3a02027d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Although it is known that pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder, the relationship between the placental pathology and maternal endothelial response is not fully understood. Numerous maternal factors can predispose to the disorder, such as previous pre-eclampsia, diabetes, renal disease, chronic hypertension or other risk factors. The syndrome known as pre-eclampsia may also be more than one disease, each with distinct origins, pathologic characteristics and natural history, rather than one fundamental process with varying degrees of clinical severity. Hence, the ability to assess the affect of antiplatelets on women with individual risk factors, or a series of risk factors, is of great relevance to clinicians and women. A meta-analysis based on data from individual women will enable the exploration of these hypotheses.

Randomised trials of antiplatelet agents

The effects of antiplatelet agents were first evaluated in small randomised trials, which reported striking reductions in the risk of hypertension and proteinuria. These trials were too small to provide reliable information about other more substantive outcomes, such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth. Also, there was no information about the potential hazards of antiplatelet therapy, such as a possible increased risk of bleeding for both the woman and her baby, or possible effects on infant and child development. The promising results of these early trials led to several large studies around the world. Before these could be completed, however, the use of low dose aspirin had already become relatively widespread for women considered at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Results of the larger trials were disappointing, as they failed to confirm any statistically significant reductions in substantive outcomes. Nevertheless, the first Cochrane Review of these trials demonstrated that, when taken together, there are modest, but clinically important benefits.

### Preventing pre-eclampsia-are dietary factors the key? [^15a1b30c]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Strategies to prevent pre-eclampsia: are dietary strategies the key?

The recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Schoenaker and colleagues reports an association between gestational hypertensive conditions, including pre-eclampsia, and dietary factors, based on observational studies. The review inclusion criteria were studies where energy intake, nutrient intake, food groups, or overall dietary patterns, either alone or in combination with dietary supplements, were reported, but excluded purely supplement-based studies. The findings of the review indicated that women with a low dietary calcium intake were more likely to be diagnosed with gestational hypertension, and while there were no significant associations between dietary content of vitamins C and E, vitamin D and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with pre-eclampsia, there was a suggestion (although not statistically significant) of a beneficial effect of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables on risk of pre-eclampsia.

How do these findings compare with the randomised trial literature evaluating strategies for the prevention of pre-eclampsia?

In general terms, the development of effective strategies for the prevention of pre-eclampsia has proven exceedingly difficult, related in part to the uncertainty of the precise 'cause' of the condition, and its likely multifactorial and complex nature. Many interventions have been proposed and evaluated in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, although low-dose aspirin and calcium supplementation remain the only strategies associated with a definitive reduction in risk. The use of antiplatelet agents has been associated with a 17% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia, and a modest 8% and 10% reduction in both preterm birth and small for gestational age infants, respectively. While calcium supplementation has been associated with a relative risk reduction of 55% in pre-eclampsia, this appears to be largely confined to women with low dietary calcium intake. Furthermore, the effects of calcium supplementation on improving measures of infant health are less clear.

The review by Schoenaker and colleagues demonstrated no significant associations between dietary content of vitamins C and E, vitamin D and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with pre-eclampsia. However, there was a suggested potential beneficial effect from a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, foods well recognised to be a rich source of vitamin C in particular. There has been considerable research interest in supplementation with anti-oxidant vitamins C and E as a potential strategy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Unfortunately, however, well conducted randomised trials and subsequent meta-analyses have demonstrated no beneficial effect of anti-oxidant vitamin supplementation in reducing a woman's risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

### Low-dose aspirin use for the prevention of preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality [^ed63d2f1]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis — risk-based offering and potential universal use are outlined as follows: "Evidence supports the use of a risk-based approach to determine whether low-dose aspirin should be offered to a pregnant individual", and "It is therefore imperative that obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric clinicians implement adequate screening processes to determine the appropriate risk category for a pregnant individual". The document notes that "for some institutions and practices, the majority of patients may be at high or moderate risk for preeclampsia and would therefore be candidates for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis", and "In these instances, universal implementation (eg, offering low-dose aspirin to all patients within such practices or institutions) may be medically reasonable". It further states, "This Practice Advisory serves as an interim update to all of ACOG's and SMFM's guidance and materials regarding low-dose aspirin prophylaxis for the prevention of preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality".

Update of previous USPSTF recommendation — the 2014 recommendation advised low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia (B recommendation), and the current recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation and is strengthened by new evidence from additional trials supporting reduced risks of perinatal mortality with low-dose aspirin use.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^cf49f19a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps — aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia: There are several critical evidence gaps, including the need for research on how to improve identifying persons at increased risk for preeclampsia and for comparative effectiveness trials to identify the specific aspirin protocol likely to have the greatest benefit. Further research is needed in populations that have the highest rates of preeclampsia, including Black persons, and studies are needed to more fully understand the populations most likely to benefit and what risk thresholds and factors should be used to identify eligible patient populations. Research is also needed on aspirin effectiveness for all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and to improve effective and equitable implementation of clinical guidelines for aspirin use in pregnancy.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^ad96ec48]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — Low-dose aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia — the 2017 Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial randomized 1,776 women at high risk of preeclampsia to 150-mg aspirin or placebo and found a decrease in preterm preeclampsia (4.3% versus 1.6%; odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20–0.74). Although the 150-mg dose was used, there are no available studies comparing 60–80 mg versus 150 mg, and therefore a higher dose or doubling of the available 81-mg dose cannot be recommended at this time. Meta-analyses reported a modest effect with RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97 from pooled individual patient data from 31 RCTs, a 17% relative reduction in preeclampsia from a Cochrane review pooling 59 trials, and a 24% reduction in preeclampsia (RR, 0.76; CI, 0.62–0.95) in the 2014 USPSTF systematic review pooling data from 15 high-quality RCTs, 13 of which reported incidence among women considered at highest risk.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia [^76e7b8bc]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Pre-eclampsia remains one of the major obstetrical problems in less-developed countries. The causes of this condition are still unknown, thus effective primary prevention is not possible at this stage. Research in the past decade has identified some major risk factors for pre-eclampsia, and manipulation of these factors might result in a decrease in its frequency. In the early 1990s aspirin was thought to be the wonder drug in secondary prevention of pre-eclampsia. Results of large trials have shown that this is not the case: if there is an indication for using aspirin it is in the patient at a very high risk of developing severe early-onset disease. The calcium story followed a more or less similar pattern, with the difference that existing evidence shows that women with a low dietary calcium intake are likely to benefit from calcium supplementation. Proper antenatal care and timed delivery are of utmost importance in tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia. There is evidence to suggest that the intrinsic direct effect of moderate degrees of maternal hypertension is beneficial to the fetus. Severe hypertension needs treatment. If antihypertensive is indicated, there is no clear choice of a drug. Hydralazine should no longer be thought of as the primary drug, most studies show a preference for calcium channel blockers.

### Aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^742254a6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Low-dose aspirin is used for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis during pregnancy, but a study that comprehensively investigates both maternal and perinatal outcomes from aspirin administration utilizing stratification methods is lacking. The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate the maternal and neonatal outcomes related to aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy in relation to dose and therapy initiation by utilizing a stratification method.

Evidence Acquisition

Placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating the effect of low-dose aspirin on maternal or perinatal outcomes with sufficient raw data and published in English from inception to August 2020 were searched for from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Review articles, editorials, case reports, conference abstracts, and nonplacebo-controlled studies were excluded.

Evidence Synthesis

A total of 35 placebo-controlled randomized trials with 46,568 pregnant women were included in this meta-analysis. Aspirin prophylaxis substantially lowered the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, perinatal mortality, and intrauterine growth retardation without elevated bleeding risks. Low-dose aspirin considerably enhanced neonatal birth weight but did not decrease the risk of gestational hypertension. The subgroup analysis revealed substantially reduced pre-eclampsia risk and enhanced birth weight and gestational age at delivery in women who initiated aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation (RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64, 0.90, p = 0.001). However, the effect of aspirin dose on pregnancy outcomes was insignificant and requires further evaluation.

Conclusions

Initiation of low-dose aspirin administration before 20 weeks of gestation considerably decreases the incidence of pre-eclampsia and related neonatal outcomes without increasing bleeding risk.

### Reducing stillbirths: prevention and management of medical disorders and infections during pregnancy [^eba7c7cb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The overall evidence of anti-platelet agents for pre-eclampsia is Grade B. Among high-risk women, there is some evidence from the Cochrane meta-analysis by Duley et al. that use of low-dose aspirin reduces risk of PIH, but more research is needed to determine those women for whom aspirin therapy would be effective. There is strong evidence that anti-platelet treatment for high-risk women reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia, though the number needed to treat is high. The optimal choice and dosage of anti-platelet agent is unclear, but dosages of low-dose aspirin appear to be important, and higher doses in the low-dose range may be more efficacious. In the Cochrane meta-analysis, dosages of low-dose aspirin of 75 mg/day or more were associated with greater reductions in risk of pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and small-for-gestational age babies than preparations with 75 mg/day or less. The safety of dosages of aspirin exceeding this low-dose range remains unproven and requires further research.

The impact of anti-platelet agents on risk of stillbirths is less convincing, although the analysis shows a slight trend in the direction of benefit. Combination treatment with aspirin and heparin leads to a higher live birth rate among women with recurrent miscarriage and anti-phospholipid antibodies, but the results are statistically non-significant. Given the many small studies with poor allocation concealment and inadequate blinding, there is a need for more well-designed RCTs in varied settings and populations to assess the true effectiveness of aspirin in preventing fetal loss.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^441b4387]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a multi-factorial condition. Although its aetiology remains unclear, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder. The primary lesion is thought to be deficient trophoblast invasion of the maternal spiral arteries in the second trimester, leading to underperfusion of the uteroplacental circulation and placental ischaemia. The resulting placental damage is thought to lead to release of factors into the maternal circulation, which are responsible for the maternal syndrome. Activation of platelets and the clotting system may occur early in the course of the disease, before clinical symptoms develop. Deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, with excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation, have also been demonstrated to occur in pre-eclampsia. These observations have led to the hypothesis that antiplatelet agents, low dose aspirin (< 300 mg/day) in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia or reduce its severity and the risk of adverse events.

It is further hypothesised that the effect of antiplatelets may be different if treatment is started before placental implantation is complete. If this hypothesis were correct, the greatest benefit should be seen in women who started treatment before 16 weeks gestation, with the effect attenuating with later onset of treatment. Similarly, it remains unclear as to the most appropriate dose of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in order to maximise benefits whilst minimising harms. It has been suggested that low doses of aspirin may selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase pathway in platelet production but not in vessel wall endothelium thereby diminishing the synthesis of thromboxane but not of prostacycline. A higher dose may inhibit both thromboxane and prostacycline thereby neutralising the effect of the intervention. However, there is also limited evidence from randomised trials that a higher dose of aspirin may effect a greater reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Stillbirth: prevention and supportive bereavement care [^bc377a62]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Aspirin: to reduce pre-eclampsia risk

Crandon and Isherwood's seminal 1979 paper documented the efficacy of prophylactic aspirin in reducing pre-eclampsia. Subsequent systematic reviews have synthesised large randomised controlled trials, examining the benefits, optimal timing, and dosage of aspirin given antenatally, as well as in target populations for prophylaxis.

A 2013 systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed reduced pre-eclampsia, perinatal death, and fetal growth restriction among individuals at high risk commenced on aspirin before 16 weeks. A subsequent 2017 systematic review of 45 randomised clinical trials identified increased benefits with more than 100 mg aspirin daily, without increasing adverse effects. A 2018 systematic reviewthat examined stillbirth prevention identified only one study of 24 patients who had had previous miscarriage, comparing 75 mg aspirin with placebo. This study found no benefit, and the findings were severely limited by its small size and homogenous population.

Few studies examining aspirin use in pregnancy are powered to detect stillbirth risk reduction. The ASPRE trialrandomly assigned 2971 participants at high risk of pre-eclampsia to 150 mg aspirin or placebo; the results suggested a possible lower rate of stillbirth and neonatal death among those receiving aspirin versus placebo (8 (1.0%) of 798 v 14 (1.7%) of 822, odds ratio 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.85)).

Risk stratification is undergoing debate, and international guidelines inconsistently describe target populations for prophylactic aspirin. A prospective, multicentre study compared a composite screen of maternal factors and objective investigations with current screening advised by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)guidelines, for which the results are shown in table 1. Both pre-eclampsia detection rates and false positive rates varied widely between guidelines. Given the relative safety of aspirin administration, an argument could be made for universal low dose aspirin in pregnancy.

Comparison of screening strategies for identifying women in early pregnancy who are at risk of developing pre-eclampsia

Recent evidence suggests that aspirin might be much more effective than previously thought, with high compliance preceding 16 weeks; note, the effectiveness of aspirin on pre-eclampsia greatly reduced with decreasing compliance.

### Aspirin in pregnancy [^257ffc46]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Aspirin has been long purported and extensively studied for prevention of preeclampsia. For this reason, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend its use in pregnancy for preeclampsia prevention in those at high risk. Yet, much controversy exists regarding optimal use in pregnancy with guidelines across global organizations varying. In this narrative review, we summarize the published literature related to the safety, optimal dose, and timing and duration of use of aspirin, as well as other indications for which aspirin has been studied in pregnancy.

### Low-dose aspirin use for the prevention of morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^a1ed0488]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, and assessed the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant women who are at increased risk for preeclampsia and who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^ca1261bb]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that poses serious maternal and infant health risks. Previous systematic reviews have established benefits of low-dose aspirin taken during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia and its sequelae.

Objective

To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on effectiveness of aspirin use in preventing preeclampsia in individuals at increased risk based on clinical risk factors or measurements associated with higher disease incidence than in the general population.

Data Sources

Studies from previous USPSTF review (2014), literature published January 2013 through May 15, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed (for publisher-supplied records only), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Ongoing surveillance through January 22, 2021.

Study Selection

Good- and fair-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia among individuals at increased risk; studies conducted in general populations to evaluate potential harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual article screening and risk-of-bias assessment. Study data abstracted into prespecified forms, checked for accuracy. Random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnosis of preeclampsia; adverse pregnancy health outcomes and complications including eclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and potential bleeding harms or infant/child harms from aspirin exposure.

Results

A total of 23 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 26 952) were included; 18 were conducted among participants at increased preeclampsia risk. Aspirin dosages ranged from 50 mg/d to 150 mg/d. Most trials enrolled majority White populations selected based on a range of risk factors. The incidence of preeclampsia among the trials of participants at increased risk ranged from 4% to 30%. Aspirin use was significantly associated with lower risk of preeclampsia (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.95]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 093]; I² = 0%), perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.96]; 11 RCTs [n = 13 860]; I² = 0%), preterm birth (pooled RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67–0.95]; 13 RCTs [n = 13 619]; I² = 49%), and intrauterine growth restriction (pooled RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 385]; I² = 41%). There were no significant associations of aspirin use with risk of postpartum hemorrhage (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.94–1.12]; 9 RCTs [n = 23 133]; I² = 0%) and other bleeding-related harms, or with rare perinatal or longer-term harms. Absolute risk reductions for preeclampsia associated with aspirin use ranged from -1% to -6% across larger trials (n > 300) and were greater in smaller trials. For perinatal mortality, absolute risk reductions ranged from 0.5% to 1.1% in the 3 largest trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Daily low-dose aspirin during pregnancy was associated with lower risks of serious perinatal outcomes for individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia, without evident harms.

### Low-dose aspirin for prevention of morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^e7e53300]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To systematically review benefits and harms of low-dose aspirin for preventing morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2006 to June 2013); previous systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and surveillance searches for large studies (June 2013 to February 2014).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) to assess benefits among women at high preeclampsia risk and RCTs or large cohort studies of harms among women at any risk level. English-language studies of fair or good quality were included.

Data Extraction

Dual quality assessment and abstraction of studies.

Data Synthesis

Two large, multisite RCTs and 13 smaller RCTs of high-risk women (8 good-quality) were included, in addition to 6 RCTs and 2 observational studies of average-risk women to assess harms (7 good-quality). Depending on baseline risk, aspirin use was associated with absolute risk reductions of 2% to 5% for preeclampsia (relative risk [RR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95]), 1% to 5% for intrauterine growth restriction (RR, 0.80 [CI, 0.65 to 0.99]), and 2% to 4% for preterm birth (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). No significant perinatal or maternal harms were identified, but rare harms could not be ruled out. Evidence on long-term outcomes was sparse, but 18-month follow-up from the largest trial found no developmental harms.

Limitations

Benefits may have been overestimated due to small-study effects. Predictive intervals were not statistically significant. Future studies could shift findings toward the null.

Conclusion

Daily low-dose aspirin beginning as early as the second trimester prevented clinically important health outcomes. No harms were identified, but long-term evidence was limited.

### Aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia: the conundrum of how, who and when [^96ee8644]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is widely used in preventing early onset preeclampsia in women who are identified as being high risk. Although the benefit of aspirin is increasingly evident and acknowledged, there remains many unanswered questions with regards to its optimal application in pregnancy. The issues mainly centre around the relatively modest risk reduction that is observed with the use of aspirin prophylactically. We aim to explore the reasons behind the conservative rate of benefit and aim to explore factors that are likely to influence the outcomes with the use of aspirin.

### Prophylactic aspirin dose and preeclampsia [^7b6b583b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Research Implications

Ideally, large, randomized trials comparing different doses should be done to validate our conclusions. Any large trials examining different doses should include both efficacy and safety as primary outcomes to ensure that the risk-benefit ratio can be examined. Trials should include low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage is greatest. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded a large trialin low and middle income country settings comparing 75 and 150 mg of aspirin, including both preeclampsia and hemorrhage outcomes. In addition, a US-based studywas recently funded and plans to investigate the effects of different doses in a population of 10 000 women at increased risk of preeclampsia. Together with our study that included almost 14 000 women, the results from these trials will hopefully provide robust evidence on the appropriate aspirin dosage for preventing preeclampsia.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^99a2cb6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 743 — low-dose aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy recommendations state that low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended solely for the indication of prior unexplained stillbirth, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended for prevention of fetal growth restriction, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of early pregnancy loss.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^3a5b1fe8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 743 — conclusions and recommendations: Daily low‑dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. Low‑dose aspirin (81 mg/d) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low‑dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high‑risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than one moderate‑risk factor (first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). In the absence of high‑risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low‑dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth.

USPSTF implementation — pregnant persons with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin, and those with 2 or more moderate-risk factors may also benefit, but the evidence is less certain for this approach; aspirin is available in the US as 81-mg tablets and low-dose aspirin use should be initiated after 12 weeks of gestation (studies most often initiated before 20 weeks of gestation); regarding the FDA warning about nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs around 20 weeks of gestation, an exception is the use of an 81-mg dose of aspirin for certain pregnancy-related conditions under the direction of a health care clinician.

Benefits of risk assessment and preventive medication — randomized trials of low-dose aspirin in persons at increased risk for preeclampsia showed reduced risks for preterm birth (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67–0.95]; 13 studies; I² = 49%) among individuals receiving low-dose aspirin (n = 13 619), small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction (RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; 16 studies; I² = 41.0%) (n = 14 385), perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.96]; 11 studies; I² = 0%) (n = 13 860), and preeclampsia (pooled RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.95]; 16 studies; I² = 0%) (n = 14 093); the USPSTF considered 18 randomized clinical trials (n = 19 500) for maternal and perinatal outcomes and 16 RCTs (n = 15 767; 10 good-quality) for preeclampsia prevention, with aspirin dosages ranging from 50 to 150 mg/d, most trials using 60 mg/d (6 RCTs) or 100 mg/d (8 RCTs), and initiation most often before 20 weeks of gestation but ranging from 11 to 32 weeks, and stratified comparisons did not show consistent evidence for effect differences related to the timing of aspirin initiation (< 16 weeks of gestation), the dosage used, or participant characteristics.

### Molecular actions of heparin and their implications in preventing pre-eclampsia [^1b55ae9f]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, continues to be a significant cause of global maternal morbidity. Low-dose aspirin remains the only standard-of-care prophylactic therapy for preventing pre-eclampsia, but is limited in efficacy. Heparin and its derivatives may further enhance the efficacy of aspirin therapy to prevent pre-eclampsia, but the mechanisms mediating this augmentative effect are not known. Although heparin is an anticoagulant agent, it also possesses many anticoagulant-independent properties that may be relevant in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, including effects on placental, vascular and inflammatory function. This review summarizes the non-anticoagulant properties of heparin, and extrapolates how these actions may influence the trajectory of pre-eclampsia pathogenesis as a means of pathway-specific therapy.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^c7796ff5]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The main goal of our meta-analysis was to identify those clinical risk factors that serve as potential determinants of pre-eclampsia. Schnohr and colleagues used a similar approach in ranking the top 10 risk factors for coronary heart disease. They found that their prioritization of risk factors differed at the individual patient level (based on the relative risk) from that at the population level (based on the population attributable fraction). This dual approach is attractive, as a woman with a rare risk factor like antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is certainly at high risk of pre-eclampsia in the presence of that risk factor (fig 2), even though the rarity of that risk factor makes it less of a consideration in the reduction of risk of pre-eclampsia within the entire population (fig 3). Moreover, they used a multivariable approach in their analysis of risk factors for coronary heart disease, something to be considered in the comparison of the influence of risk factors for pre-eclampsia.

Conclusion

We identified the extent to which various clinical risk factors in early pregnancy heighten a woman's absolute and relative risk for pre-eclampsia. Some of the major risk factors evaluated produced event rates that were either similar to, or lower than, the rates seen in randomized controlled trials of aspirin prophylaxis among women at risk of pre-eclampsia(appendix 5). Accordingly, evaluation of whether the efficacy (that is, relative risk reduction) of aspirin prophylaxis differs across risk factors can clarify whether they are equally responsive to that intervention, or others. Additionally, evaluation of the effectiveness of aspirin in the prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia and severe forms of pre-eclampsia, by individual risk factors and their combination, is needed. Separately, there is evidence that clinical decisions are viewed differently by a woman and her healthcare provider, as is their perception of risk. Thus, data should be obtained from the woman and practitioner on the threshold number needed to prevent at which they are comfortable initiating aspirin prophylaxis.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^f640370d]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Many randomized controlled trials of aspirin prophylaxis did not describe the criteria they used to define a woman as high risk, and others used abnormal findings on uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography, which has limited sensitivity, is rarely done before 16 weeks, and has limited availability among midwives and family practitioners. Other studies have proposed several risk factors to characterize women at high risk of pre-eclampsia, including nulliparity, older age, chronic hypertension, and prepregnancy diabetes mellitus. Yet again, the absolute and relative importance of one risk factor over another has not been systematically assessed.

Given the limitations and variability in the current criteria used to identify women at high risk of pre-eclampsia, there is a need for a clear, concise, and evidence based list of indicators to estimate a woman's risk. These indicators should consider events in any previous pregnancy as well as current pregnancy factors that can be efficiently gathered at an early prenatal visit. To generate this list, we completed a meta-analysis of large cohort studies of one or more risk factors for pre-eclampsia. To generate three practical estimates, we determined the absolute risk of developing pre-eclampsia in the presence versus absence of a given risk factor; the relative risk of developing pre-eclampsia in the presence versus absence of a given risk factor; and the population attributable fraction for pre-eclampsia in relation to each risk factor. The first two metrics are useful to clinicians, and the third metric can help guide public health policy at the population level. Finally, we outlined how our generated list of individual risk factors might be applied to identify "high risk" women, such as those who could benefit from aspirin prophylaxis.

### Should we recommend universal aspirin for all pregnant women? [^11f6f6c2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in at-risk populations. Its role in low-risk populations is as yet unknown. Novel preeclampsia screening tests are emerging that can predict the risk of the development of preeclampsia from as early as 11 weeks of gestation. It may be more efficacious, acceptable, and cost-effective to prescribe low-dose aspirin to all pregnant women from the first trimester as opposed to performing a screening test in the first instance. There is variation in opinion: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests the use of aspirin only in women who are at risk of preeclampsia, based on patient history; the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, UK, and the US Preventative Services Task Force recommend the use of low-dose aspirin if there is 1 major or 2 moderate risk factors. This point-counterpoint discussion shall address (1) controversies regarding the real impact of low-dose aspirin; (2) controversies in the actual guidelines among the different national societies; (3) controversies regarding emerging preeclampsia screening tests in terms of cost-effectiveness and efficacy, and (4) points in favor of the provision of universal vs screened-positive women.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^ff2e1a0d]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preeclampsia is one of the most serious health problems that affect pregnant persons. It is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia also accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US. There are racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic Black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia.

Population

Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^3032c019]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy — indications, timing, safety, and risk definition are summarized as follows: Low-dose aspirin has been used during pregnancy, most commonly to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia, and daily low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors or more than one of several moderate-risk factors, including first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, and a body mass index greater than 30. In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth. Prior guidance recommended daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia.

### When to give aspirin to prevent preeclampsia: application of Bayesian decision theory [^d139b6c4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is good evidence that first-trimester assessment of the risk for preterm preeclampsia and treatment of the high-risk group with aspirin reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia. Furthermore, there is evidence that aspirin is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal hemorrhagic complications. Against this background, there are ongoing debates whether aspirin should be recommended for all women or to a subpopulation of women predicted to be at increased risk of developing preeclampsia. Moreover, if a strategy of the prediction and prevention of preterm preeclampsia is to be used, what method should be used for the prediction, and what risk cutoff should be used to decide on who to treat?

Objective

This study aimed to compare the policies of universal treatment, stratified treatment, and no treatment with aspirin.

Study Design

Decisions about aspirin prophylaxis were considered from the perspective of the Bayesian decision theory. Using this approach, the treatment policies were evaluated for risks of preterm preeclampsia, effects of aspirin, and trade-offs between the harms and benefits of the treatment. Evidence on the risk of preterm preeclampsia was taken from the Screening programme for pre-eclampsia study, which was a first-trimester screening study for the prediction of preeclampsia. Evidence of the effect of aspirin was taken from the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial, which was a trial of aspirin vs placebo in the prevention of preterm preeclampsia. The trade-off between the benefits and harms of aspirin was specified by addressing the question, "What is the maximum number of women that should be treated to prevent 1 case of preterm preeclampsia?" The number can be considered as an exchange rate between the harms and benefits of using aspirin to prevent preterm PE. Given the uncertainty about the harms associated with aspirin, the treatment policies were compared across a wide range of exchange rates.

Results

For exchange rates between 10 and 1000 women treated with aspirin to prevent 1 case of preterm preeclampsia, the net benefit achieved from the risk assessment and targeted treatment of women at high risk of preterm preeclampsia was higher than that from women with no treatment or women with universal treatment with aspirin.

Conclusion

Universal treatment with aspirin should be avoided. Risk-based screening should be used, and the cutoff for taking aspirin should be determined from the consideration of the trade-off between the benefits and harms and detection, false-positive, and screen-positive rates.

Objective

This study aimed to compare 2 aspirin dosage regimens for the prevention of preterm preeclampsia (PE): 75 to 81 mg vs 150 to 162 mg taken daily starting in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Data Sources

A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1985 to April 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of 2 aspirin dosage regimens during pregnancy for the prevention of PE initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy. The intervention was an aspirin dosage between 150 and 162 mg daily, and the control was an aspirin dosage between 75 and 81 mg daily.

Methods

Of note, 2 reviewers independently screened all citations, selected studies, and evaluated the risk of bias. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and applied the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The corresponding authors of the included studies were contacted to validate each of the collected results. The primary outcome was the risk of preterm preeclampsia, and the secondary outcomes included term preeclampsia, any preeclampsia regardless of gestational age, and severe preeclampsia. Relative risks with their 95% confidence interval were calculated for each study and pooled for global analysis.

Results

Of note, 4 randomized controlled trials were retrieved involving 552 participants. Moreover, 2 randomized controlled trials were at unclear risk of bias, 1 trial at low risk of bias and 1 trial at high risk of bias, which did not have the information for the primary outcome. The pooled analysis demonstrated that an aspirin dosage of 150 to 162 mg was associated with a significant reduction of preterm preeclampsia, compared with an aspirin dosage of 75 to 81 mg (3 studies; 472 participants; relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.79; P = 0.01; I² = 0%). There was no significant effect on the risk of term preeclampsia (3 studies; 472 participants; relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–2.64; P = 0.48; I² = 64%) and all preeclampsia (4 studies; 552 participants; relative risk, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–1.05; P = 0.06; I² = 58%), but there was a reduction of severe preeclampsia (3 studies; 472 participantst; RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09–0.62; P = 0.003; I² = 0%).

Conclusion

When initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy, an aspirin dosage of 150 to 162 mg daily was associated with a lower risk of preterm PE than an aspirin dosage of 75 to 81 mg daily. However, the lack of large, high-quality studies limited the clinical scope of the current results taken alone.

### Do first-trimester screening algorithms for preeclampsia aligned to use of preventative therapies reduce the prevalence of pre-term preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^24ed7d57]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Traditional obstetric practice relies upon history-based assessment to screen for preeclampsia and guide preventative therapies but is hampered by low sensitivity, high false-positive rates and low treatment rates. First-trimester screening algorithms represent the most efficacious approach for risk prediction and could target early initiation of aspirin to well-defined high-risk populations. A large randomised controlled trial has demonstrated the clinical benefits of this approach, but widespread practice implementation has remained elusive.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis summarising studies linking first-trimester preeclampsia screening algorithms with the initiation of preventative therapy and examined their effect on pre-term preeclampsia rates compared with standard maternity care. Odds ratios were calculated together with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

7 studies with a total of 377,790 participants were included. Within singleton populations, early initiation of aspirin in response to a high-risk screening algorithm result reduced the prevalence of pre-term preeclampsia by 39% compared with routine antenatal care (odds ratio 0.61; 95% CI: 0.52–0.70). There were significant reductions in the prevalence of preeclampsia at < 32–34 weeks, preeclampsia at any gestation and stillbirth.

Conclusion

First-trimester screening algorithms for preeclampsia aligned with early initiation of preventative therapy with aspirin reduce the prevalence of pre-term preeclampsia.

Conclusions

In this large population-based study, we found no difference in either preeclampsia or bleeding complications when comparing 150 to 160 mg and 75 mg of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia. Large, randomized trials comparing aspirin doses must include both efficacy and safety as primary outcomes to ensure that any additional benefit of higher doses does not come at the risk of maternal bleeding.

Objective

To discuss the points that still challenge low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and strategies that have been studied to help them overcome these issues.

Methods

Narrative review addressing 20years of articles concerning pre-eclampsia morbidity and mortality in LMICs. We summarized evidence-based strategies to overcome the challenges in order to reduce the pre-eclampsia impact on perinatal outcomes.

Results

Pre-eclampsia is the first or second leading cause in the ranking of avoidable causes of maternal death, and approximately 16% of all maternal deaths are attributable to eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. Considering the social and economic contexts, it represents a major public health concern, and prevention and early detection of pre-eclampsia seem to be a major challenge. Reducing maternal mortality related to hypertensive disturbances depends on public policies to manage these preventable conditions. Early and continuous recognition of signs of severity related to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and childbirth, self-monitoring of symptoms and blood pressure, as well as preventive approaches such as aspirin and calcium, and magnesium sulfate, are lifesaving procedures that have not yet reached a universal scale.

Conclusion

This review provides a vision of relevant points to support pregnant women in overcoming the constraints to healthcare access in LMICs, and strategies that can be applied in primary prenatal care units.

### A nudge toward universal aspirin for preeclampsia prevention [^a319d496]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The July 2018 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' guidelines for aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention represent a departure from prior, more stringent guidelines and extend eligibility for aspirin prophylaxis to a large proportion of pregnant women in the United States. However, these latest guidelines are predicated on a complex, risk-factor-based screening algorithm and ignore the reality that, outside of the setting of clinical research, effective implementation of risk-factor-based approaches consistently falls short. Herein we argue for transitioning to universal aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention using the concept of libertarian paternalism, knowing that altering the choice architecture from an "opt-in" to an "opt-out" system will greatly increase the number of patients who receive the advantage of this inexpensive, safe, and beneficial preventative intervention.

### Early administration of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of severe and mild preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^37f7aca4]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early administration of aspirin prevents severe and mild preeclampsia.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Studies in which women were randomized at or before 16 weeks' gestation to low-dose aspirin versus placebo or no treatment were included. The outcomes of interest were severe preeclampsia and mild preeclampsia. Pooled relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Among 7941 citations retrieved, 352 were completely reviewed and four studies (392 women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. When compared with controls, aspirin started at ≤ 16 weeks was associated with a significant reduction in severe (relative risk: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.57) but not mild (relative risk: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.96) preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin initiated at or before 16 weeks reduces the risk of severe preeclampsia, but not mild preeclampsia.

### Low-dose aspirin for prevention of adverse outcomes related to abnormal placentation [^4e67a4e1]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis of randomized studies on the use of low-dose aspirin in women at high risk of preeclampsia (PE) has demonstrated that if treatment is initiated at ≤ 16weeks' gestation, there is significant reduction in the risk of PE [relative risk (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36–0.62], fetal growth restriction (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33–0.64), preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22–0.57) and perinatal death (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19–0.92), whereas the effect of treatment after 16weeks is substantially less (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.08; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97; and RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73–1.19, respectively). Moreover, the decrease in the risk of PE from early onset treatment seems to be related to the dose of aspirin, and a dose of > 80mg daily should be considered for optimal benefits.

11 CONSIDERATIONS FOR UNIVERSAL ASPIRIN IN PRE‐ECLAMPSIA PREVENTION

Considering the clear benefit of aspirin in reducing the risk of preterm pre‐eclampsia, its low cost, and safety profile, some investigators advocate for universal aspirin prophylaxis for pre‐eclampsia prevention. It has been suggested that this would be a more cost‐effective strategy compared to using aspirin prophylaxis in women determined to be at high risk through a process of screening, which has been considered rather complex for implementation. Nevertheless, possible benefits of a preventive strategy need to be balanced with potential harm due to hemorrhagic and other adverse events. Benefits of universal aspirin and long‐term safety of this strategy have not been adequately studied in randomized trials. Additionally, good adherence to treatment is paramount to successful prevention. Compliance is likely to be lower when aspirin is given to the whole population than when recommended to a selected high‐risk group of women counselled based on individual risk. Earlier trials in which pregnant women received aspirin on the sole basis of being pregnant or nulliparous demonstrated an increased frequency of bleeding episodes, low compliance with aspirin at only about 50%, and no reduction in the incidence of pre‐eclampsia. Analogously, universal aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in healthy older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^8d41b71a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

b. Patient-level characteristics

One of the strengths of individual patient data reviews is that it allows us to assess eligibility and outcome using individual women's characteristics. Subgroup analyses will explore whether any particular risk factors act as effect modifiers. That is, are there any particular types of women who benefit more or less from antiplatelet agents? These analyses will take account each individual woman's own characteristics, rather than relying on summary measures of the 'average' risk profile of all participants in an individual trial.

Analyses will be undertaken to explore whether there are any particular types of women who benefit more or less from antiplatelet agents based on the following criteria:

(i) risk factor profile for pre-eclampsia at trial entry

Women normotensive at trial entry:

- **Previous hypertensive disorders of pregnancy**: previous early onset (≤ 33 weeks + 6 days gestation) pre-eclampsia or eclampsia / previous pre-eclampsia / previous gestational hypertension / no previous hypertensive disorders of pregnancy / no previous pregnancy but family history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy / no previous pregnancy and no family history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

- **Diabetes**: pre-existing diabetes at enrolment / no pre-existing diabetes at enrolment

- **Renal disease**: pre-existing renal disease / no pre-existing renal disease

- **Autoimmune disease**: autoimmune disease / no autoimmune disease

- **Multiple pregnancy**: multiple pregnancy / singleton pregnancy

- **Maternal age**: < 20 years / 20–35 years / > 35 years. Maternal age may also be analysed as a continuous variable.

- **Diagnostic test results**: abnormal uterine artery Doppler scan / other diagnostic test abnormalities / no abnormal diagnostic test results

- **previous SGA**: previous small for gestational age infant / previous infant not small for gestational age / no previous infant

- **Primigravida**: first pregnancy with no other risk factors / first pregnancy with one or more risk factors / second or subsequent pregnancy with one or more risk factors / second or subsequent pregnancy with no risk factors

Women with hypertension at trial entry:

- **Hypertension**: gestational hypertension / chronic hypertension

(ii) gestation at trial entry

To determine whether antiplatelet agents are differentially effective if given earlier in pregnancy and to determine the magnitude of any difference, gestational age at randomisation will be primarily analysed as a continuous variable in regression analyses. However, a subgroup analysis with women classified according to the following categories may also be performed: < 16 weeks, 16–19 completed weeks, 20–23 completed weeks, 24–27 completed weeks, ≥ 28 weeks gestation. If numbers are insufficient for any category, categories will be combined.

Low-dose aspirin during pregnancy — preeclampsia prevention is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which support the USPSTF guideline criteria for prevention of preeclampsia: low-dose aspirin prophylaxis (81 mg/day) after 12 weeks of gestation modestly reduces the risk of preeclampsia without resulting in adverse fetal effects, increased maternal bleeding, or placental abruption; low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery; the USPSTF recommends giving low-dose aspirin after 12 weeks of gestation to women with an absolute risk of preeclampsia of at least 8%; number needed to treat considerations include that in low-risk groups (disease prevalence of 2%), the number needed to treat is approximately 500, compared with a number needed to treat of 50 women in a high-risk group with a disease prevalence of 20%; low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered in women with more than one of several moderate risk factors; and women who were receiving medically-indicated low-dose aspirin for other established medical indications before 12–28 weeks may continue with low-dose aspirin treatment.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^7cd1a587]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — Low-dose aspirin timing in pregnancy — most trials initiated treatment between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation, with some reporting optimal results when started before 16 weeks. A meta-analysis of aggregate data from 45 randomized trials reported a modest reduction in preeclampsia when started after 16 weeks (RR, 0.81; CI, 0.66–0.99), but significant reductions in severe preeclampsia (RR, 0.47; CI, 0.26–0.83) and fetal growth restriction (RR, 0.56; CI, 0.44–0.70) when started before 16 weeks. Another meta-analysis reported reduced preterm preeclampsia only when aspirin was initiated before 16 weeks at a daily dose of 100 mg or more (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19–0.57), whereas pooled individual data from 31 high-quality randomized trials found benefits whether started before or after 16 weeks. There is no apparent benefit to stopping low-dose aspirin before delivery; protocols vary from discontinuation at 36 weeks of gestation to continuation until delivery. Discontinuation timing has not been related to excessive maternal or fetal bleeding, and use in the absence of other anticoagulants is not a contraindication to neuraxial blockade. For first-trimester exposure, whether effects on adverse fetal outcomes or maternal benefit are present is not known.

### Aspirin discontinuation at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation in pregnancies at high risk of preterm preeclampsia… [^bb543d48]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Aspirin reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62% in pregnant individuals at high risk of preeclampsia. However, aspirin might be associated with an increased risk of peripartum bleeding, which could be mitigated by discontinuing aspirin before term and by an accurate selection of individuals at higher risk of preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. Aspirin has been proven to reduce the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62%. 6 Although the exact etiology of preeclampsia is unknown, aspirin inactivates the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, suppressing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane.

The Detection of False Positives From First-trimester Preeclampsia Screening at the Second-trimester of Pregnancy Trial was designed to test the hypothesis that discontinuing aspirin in pregnancies at high risk of preterm preeclampsia in the first trimester and with an sFlt-1: PlGF ratio of 38 or less between 24 weeks 0 days and 27 weeks 6 days of gestation is noninferior to prevent preterm preeclampsia as compared with a control group treated with aspirin until 36 weeks of gestation. Two meta-analyses have shown that the highest prevention of preeclampsia is achieved with a daily dose of aspirin of 100 mg or more initiated before 16 weeks of gestation. 11, 30 However, a daily dose of aspirin of 100 mg or more initiated after 16 weeks of gestation may be associated with an increased relative risk of placental abruption and other bleeding complications.

16, 17, 29 For this reason, most guidelines recommend to discontinue aspirin at term and before onset of labor, 15, 31 which is the time where the risk of bleeding is greatest in pregnant individuals. In the present study, aspirin at a dose of 150 mg was used. Because this is one of the highest doses recommended for preventing preeclampsia, discontinuing aspirin in this trial may have led to a significant reduction in severe bleeding complications. However, an association between earlier discontinuation of aspirin treatment and a reduction in rarer bleeding complications, such as placental abruption, maternal intracranial hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, and/or neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, was not observed.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and… [^a9273041]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia. In the 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF recommended the use of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia. 14 The current recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation. It is strengthened by new evidence from additional trials supporting reduced risks of perinatal mortality with low-dose aspirin use. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review1, 15 to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia.

The current review included evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in pregnant persons at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as assessing the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy. The USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preterm birth among individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin. USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin use in individuals at increased risk. Maternal complications of preeclampsia rarely occurred in studies and could not be evaluated.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine19 recommend low-dose aspirin prophylaxis for persons at high risk of preeclampsia; the regimen should be initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation and continued daily until delivery. 1 Additionally, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for individuals with more than 1 of several moderate-risk factors for preeclampsia.

### Aspirin for the prevention of preterm and term preeclampsia: systematic review and metaanalysis [^715d1697]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective Data

Metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials have reported contradictory results about the effect of aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia, both in terms of the gestational age at the onset of treatment and the dose of the drug. The controversy may be resolved by a metaanalysis that includes several recently published trials and particularly the large Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-based Preeclampsia Prevention trial and by examination of whether there is a difference of the effect of aspirin on preterm vs term preeclampsia.

Study

We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis that evaluated the prophylactic effect of aspirin during pregnancy.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

We completed a literature search through PubMed, Cinhal, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library from 1985 to June 2017. Relative risks with random effect were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Sixteen trials that included 18,907 participants provided data for preterm and term preeclampsia. Eight of the included studies were evaluated as being of good quality, and the other 8 studies were deemed to be of poor or uncertain quality. There was high heterogeneity within studies (I² > 50%) for preterm and term preeclampsia, but no heterogeneity was found in the subgroup of preterm preeclampsia when the onset of treatment was ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and the daily dose of aspirin was ≥ 100 mg (I² = 0%). Administration of aspirin was associated with reduction in the risk of preterm preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.87), but there was no significant effect on term preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.21). The reduction in preterm preeclampsia was confined to the subgroup in which aspirin was initiated at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and at a daily dose of ≥ 100 mg (relative risk, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.57). This effect was also observed in the high-quality studies. The reduction in preterm preeclampsia that was observed in the largest trial (Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-based Preeclampsia Prevention; n = 1620; relative risk, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–0.72) was similar to that in the 5 smaller trials in which aspirin was initiated at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and at a daily dose of ≥ 100 mg (n = 639; relative risk, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.66).

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk of preterm preeclampsia, but not term preeclampsia, and only when it is initiated at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and at a daily dose of ≥ 100 mg.

Aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia — risk-based indication, timing, dose, and evidence are as follows: Women with any high-risk factors or with more than one moderate-risk factor "should receive low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks of gestation) and continuing until delivery". When started after 16 weeks, a meta-analysis showed a modest reduction in preeclampsia (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66–0.99), whereas starting before 16 weeks was associated with greater reductions in severe preeclampsia (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26–0.83) and fetal growth restriction (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.44–0.70). In a multicenter randomized trial of high-risk women, aspirin 150 mg/day from 11–14 to 36 weeks reduced preterm preeclampsia to 1.6% versus 4.3% (odds ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.20–0.74; P = 0.004).

We will draw on those approaches by applying the COM‐B and TDF frameworks to understand, structure, and interpret factors affecting the prevention, identification, and management of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia.

In addition to intervention efficacy, developing recommendations according to evidence‐to‐decision frameworks requires consideration of acceptability and feasibility domains. This qualitative evidence synthesis will provide a valuable evidence base to inform the development of recommendations relating to pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia in guideline updates by the WHO and other guideline organisations. In particular, the timing of this review aligns with two large trials of different dosing regimens for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia in pregnant women screened as high risk in South Africa, Ghana and Kenya, and the USA. If the trials' results are conclusive regarding the optimal dose, this review will help inform subsequent implementation efforts and an updated WHO guideline recommendation.

Our qualitative evidence synthesis will explore and identify reasons why interventions known to be effective for the prevention and treatment of pre‐eclampsia and eclampsia are not available to all women in all contexts. Maternal mortality and severe morbidity disproportionately impact women in low‐ and lower‐ middle income countries, as well as socioeconomically marginalised women in upper‐middle and high‐income countries (e.g. Black women in the USA and the UK). Even where evidence‐based guidelines are in place, gaps in knowledge translation persist, particularly in low‐resource settings. Low‐cost interventions that are known to be effective, such as low‐dose aspirin for women at high risk of developing pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia, and magnesium sulphate to prevent and treat seizures, are underutilised. Findings from this review will help inform future implementation research for these and other interventions, and the development of strategies to resolve current evidence‐to‐practice gaps.

### Aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction [^3bfc8736]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

For the past decades, growing attention has been given to aspirin use during pregnancy. It favors placentation by its proangiogenic, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, low doses of aspirin are prescribed in the prevention of placenta-mediated complications, mainly preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, questions regarding its clinical application are still debated. Aspirin is effective in preventing preeclampsia in a high-risk population. Most guidelines recommend that risk stratification should rely on medical history. Nevertheless, screening performances dramatically improve if biochemical and biophysical markers are included. Concerning the appropriate timing and dose, latest studies suggest aspirin should be started before 16weeks of pregnancy and at a daily dose of 100mg or more. Further studies are needed to improve the identification of patients likely to benefit from prophylactic aspirin. Besides, the role of aspirin in the prevention of fetal growth restriction is still questioned.

### Aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia in women with historical risk factors: a systematic review [^09ba16f5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing perinatal death and preeclampsia in women with predisposing historical risk factors, such as previous history of preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease.

Data Sources

Searches were conductes in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, National Research Register, SCISEARCH, AND ISI Conference Proceedings without any language restrictions, using the following medical subject headings and text words: "aspirin", "antiplatelet", "salicyl", "acetylsalicyl", "platelet aggregation inhibitors", "pre-eclamp", "preeclamp", and "hypertens*.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included all randomized trials that evaluated the effectiveness of aspirin compared with placebo or no treatment in women with predisposing historical risk factors and reported clinically relevant perinatal or maternal outcomes. Study selection, quality appraisal, and data extractions were performed independently and in duplicate. We identified 14 relevant trials, including a total of 12,416 women. Meta-analysis showed a significant benefit of aspirin therapy in reducing perinatal death (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.96) and preeclampsia (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76, 0.96). Aspirin was also associated with a reduction in rates of spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79, 0.94), and an increase of 215 g in mean birth weight (weighted mean difference 215, 95% CI 90, 341). There was no increase in the risk of placental abruption with aspirin (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79, 1.21). Funnel plot analysis indicated that publication and related biases were unlikely (Egger test, P = 0.84).

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk of perinatal death and preeclampsia in women with historical risk factors. Given the importance of these outcomes and the safety and low cost of aspirin, aspirin therapy should be considered in women with historical risk factors.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^f5126633]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been used during pregnancy, most commonly to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued the Hypertension in Pregnancy Task Force Report recommending daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published a similar guideline, although the list of indications for low-dose aspirin use was more expansive. Daily low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline criteria for prevention of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than one of several moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth.

### Prevention of preeclampsia with aspirin [^73544591]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension arising after 20 weeks of gestational age with proteinuria or other signs of end-organ damage and is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, particularly when of early onset. Although a significant amount of research has been dedicated in identifying preventive measures for preeclampsia, the incidence of the condition has been relatively unchanged in the last decades. This could be attributed to the fact that the underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia is not entirely understood. There is increasing evidence suggesting that suboptimal trophoblastic invasion leads to an imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins, ultimately causing widespread inflammation and endothelial damage, increased platelet aggregation, and thrombotic events with placental infarcts. Aspirin at doses below 300 mg selectively and irreversibly inactivates the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, suppressing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane and inhibiting inflammation and platelet aggregation. Such an effect has led to the hypothesis that aspirin could be useful for preventing preeclampsia. The first possible link between the use of aspirin and the prevention of preeclampsia was suggested by a case report published in 1978, followed by the first randomized controlled trial published in 1985. Since then, numerous randomized trials have been published, reporting the safety of the use of aspirin in pregnancy and the inconsistent effects of aspirin on the rates of preeclampsia. These inconsistencies, however, can be largely explained by a high degree of heterogeneity regarding the selection of trial participants, baseline risk of the included women, dosage of aspirin, gestational age of prophylaxis initiation, and preeclampsia definition. An individual patient data meta-analysis has indicated a modest 10% reduction in preeclampsia rates with the use of aspirin, but later meta-analyses of aggregate data have revealed a dose-response effect of aspirin on preeclampsia rates, which is maximized when the medication is initiated before 16 weeks of gestational age. Recently, the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial has revealed that aspirin at a daily dosage of 150 mg, initiated before 16 weeks of gestational age, and given at night to a high-risk population, identified by a combined first trimester screening test, reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62%. A secondary analysis of the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial data also indicated a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit by 68% compared with placebo, mainly because of a reduction in births before 32 weeks of gestational age with preeclampsia. The beneficial effect of aspirin has been found to be similar in subgroups according to different maternal characteristics, except for the presence of chronic hypertension, where no beneficial effect is evident. In addition, the effect size of aspirin has been found to be more pronounced in women with good compliance to treatment. In general, randomized trials are underpowered to investigate the treatment effect of aspirin on the rates of other placental-associated adverse outcomes such as fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. This article summarizes the evidence around aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^8f409714]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 743 — preterm birth and low‑dose aspirin: Low‑dose aspirin prophylaxis for prevention of spontaneous preterm birth, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia, is not recommended. Among women at risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth reductions have been reported (8–14%). A meta‑analysis of individual patient data from 17 trials (28,797 participants) found a 7% reduction in spontaneous preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–0.99) and a 14% reduction < 34 weeks (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.99), while < 28 weeks was reduced by 19% but not statistically significant (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59–1.1). In a randomized trial among women with a history of pregnancy loss, low‑dose aspirin started before and continued through pregnancy was not associated with reduced overall preterm birth (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.42–1.23), spontaneous preterm birth (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.19–1.34), or medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.44–1.80).

### Perceptions and experiences of the prevention, identification and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^93c20127]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia

Prevention strategies include screening women to identify those at high risk of developing pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia and prescribing low‐dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or diet‐/exercise‐based measures. Calcium supplementation is also recommended for women with low dietary intake of calcium.

Primary qualitative studies have explored women's attitudes to risk screening, but no systematic review to date has synthesised this evidence. A qualitative evidence synthesis of six studies on adherence to low‐dose aspirin during pregnancy found a range of barriers to and facilitators of the initiation, implementation, and discontinuation of aspirin. All studies included in the review were from high‐income country settings, and barriers reported by women included insufficient knowledge and advice, feeling overwhelmed, lack of access to medication, feeling nauseous, and feeling tired. Facilitators included receiving consistent messaging and easy‐to‐understand information, trusting in the healthcare provider, believing in the concept of prevention, and developing strategies to remember to take the medication. The review focused on women's perspectives on adherence to aspirin but did not consider health worker or community perspectives.

A 2023 mixed‐methods systematic review of 16 studies (six of which included qualitative data) explored factors affecting the implementation of calcium supplementation for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia, finding a range of barriers and facilitators for women consuming calcium supplements and healthcare providers promoting calcium. Barriers to women taking calcium included limited knowledge about pre‐eclampsia, inadequate information about calcium, fear of adverse effects, and perceptions that taking calcium was inconvenient or over‐medicalising pregnancy. Facilitators for women taking calcium included improved knowledge through adequate information and counselling, assurance about safety, positive perception of tablet characteristics, and family support. While this review focused on women's and health workers' experiences with calcium supplementation, in practice calcium supplementation should be experienced within a comprehensive approach to pre‐eclampsia prevention, including education, screening, and aspirin prophylaxis if indicated. To date, no review has explored the package of related prevention activities in its entirety.

### Antiplatelet therapy before or after 16 weeks' gestation for preventing preeclampsia: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^66c79357]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The optimum time for commencing antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications is unclear. Aggregate data meta-analyses suggest that aspirin is more effective if given prior to 16 weeks' gestation, but data are limited because of an inability to place women in the correct gestational age subgroup from relevant trials.

Objective

The objective of the study was to use the large existing individual participant data set from the Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies Collaboration to assess whether the treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on preeclampsia and its complications vary based on whether treatment is started before or after 16 weeks' gestation.

Study Design

A meta-analysis of individual participant data including 32,217 women and 32,819 babies recruited to 31 randomized trials comparing low-dose aspirin or other antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment for the prevention of preeclampsia has been published previously. Using this existing data set, we performed a prespecified subgroup analysis based on gestation at randomization to antiplatelet agents before 16 weeks, compared with at or after 16 weeks, for 4 of the main outcomes prespecified in the Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies protocol: preeclampsia, death of baby, preterm birth before 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age baby. Individual participant data for the subgroups were combined in a meta-analysis using RevMan software. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. The χ² test for interaction was used to assess statistically significant (P < .05) differences in treatment effect between subgroups.

Results

There was no significant difference in the effects of antiplatelet therapy for women randomized before 16 weeks' gestation compared with those randomized at or after 16 weeks for any of the 4 prespecified outcomes: preeclampsia, relative risk, 0.90, (95% confidence interval, 0.79–1.03; 17 trials, 9241 women) for < 16 weeks and relative risk, 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.98; 22 trials, 21,429 women) for ≥ 16 weeks (interaction test, P = 0.98); death of baby, relative risk, 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.73–1.09; 15 trials, 8626 women) for < 16 weeks and relative risk, 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.79–1.07; 21 trials, 22,336 women) for ≥ 16 weeks (interaction test, P = 0.80); preterm birth prior to 34 weeks, relative risk, 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.77–1.04; 19 trials, 9155 women) for < 16 weeks and relative risk, 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.00; 25 trials, 22,117 women) for ≥ 16 weeks (interaction test, P = 0.91); and small-for-gestational-age baby, relative risk, 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.94; 13 trials, 6393 women) for < 16 weeks and relative risk, 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.84–1.08; 18 trials, 14,996 women) for ≥ 16 weeks (interaction test, P = 0.08).

Conclusion

The effect of low-dose aspirin and other antiplatelet agents on preeclampsia and its complications is consistent, regardless of whether treatment is started before or after 16 weeks' gestation. Women at an increased risk of preeclampsia should be offered antiplatelet therapy, regardless of whether they are first seen before or after 16 weeks' gestation.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9ac3e0a6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy — preeclampsia and perinatal outcomes — shows that daily low-dose aspirin taken after 12 weeks' gestation significantly reduced preeclampsia risk in moderate- or high-risk individuals versus placebo (pooled relative risk: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75–0.95]). Aspirin use was also associated with significantly reduced risk for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at increased risk for preeclampsia without increases in risk of postpartum hemorrhage, and only individuals with no prior adverse events or allergy to aspirin should be advised to take low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^7541a7f5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Low-dose aspirin during pregnancy — fetal growth restriction: low-dose aspirin prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent fetal growth restriction is similarly not currently recommended in women without other risk factors for preeclampsia because of insufficient evidence in women with an isolated history of fetal growth restriction; however, in women at risk of preeclampsia, prophylaxis with low-dose aspirin (particularly when initiated less than 16 weeks of gestation) may reduce the risk of fetal growth restriction; there are currently no well-powered randomized controlled trials evaluating prevention of recurrent fetal growth restriction in otherwise low-risk women; systematic reviews when used for preeclampsia prevention have consistently reported a 10–20% reduction in fetal growth restriction or infants who were small for gestational age; evidence as to whether starting low-dose aspirin before 16 weeks of gestation influences benefit is inconclusive; currently, because supporting data largely come from women who were also at risk of preeclampsia, there is insufficient evidence to support low-dose aspirin for fetal growth restriction prophylaxis in the absence of other risk factors for preeclampsia.
