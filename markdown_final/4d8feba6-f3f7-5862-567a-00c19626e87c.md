## Question

what is foraminal pneumonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "foraminal pneumonitis" means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "foraminal pneumonitis" appears in the provided sources at all. Then, I should verify if there are near-miss terms or synonyms that could explain the phrase. Next, I will consider anatomical plausibility and whether "foraminal" makes sense in a pulmonary context. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and suggest what the user might have meant instead, with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology in the corpus. I systematically scanned the documents for exact matches to "foraminal pneumonitis" and found zero occurrences, which strongly suggests this is not a standard medical term in the provided literature set.

> Wait, let me verify near-miss terms that could be confused with this. I see "aspiration pneumonitis" multiple times, which refers to lung inflammation from aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal contents and is a recognized entity in barium labeling and case reports, but that is not the same as "foraminal" anything. I also see "radiation pneumonitis", "drug-related pneumonitis", and "hypersensitivity pneumonitis", none of which incorporate "foraminal" in their nomenclature or descriptions.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider anatomy. "Foraminal" pertains to foramina, which are openings — classically in bone, such as cranial or vertebral foramina — and is not a term used to describe lung parenchyma or airways; by contrast, pneumonitis denotes inflammation of the lung tissue, so "foraminal pneumonitis" is anatomically incongruent in standard pulmonary usage, reinforcing that this is likely a misnomer or a typographical error.

> Hmm, wait a minute, could "foraminal" reflect a regional descriptor or a radiology shorthand I'm missing? I double-checked the imaging and pneumonitis literature in the set, and there are no instances where "foraminal" is used to qualify pneumonitis patterns, distributions, or etiologies, which makes that interpretation unlikely here.

> I will now examine what the user might have intended. Given the frequency of "aspiration pneumonitis" in the sources and its clinical relevance, that is the most plausible intended term; aspiration pneumonitis is a recognized inflammatory lung injury from aspiration and carries management implications distinct from other pneumonitides, which aligns with the documents' content. Alternatively, if the context involves oncology or immunotherapy, "drug-related pneumonitis" or "immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis" would fit the corpus, but again, none of these carry a "foraminal" qualifier [^116hBrdu].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant something else entirely? I should confirm that I'm not overlooking a niche entity. Given the absence of "foraminal pneumonitis" and the anatomical mismatch, I conclude that "foraminal pneumonitis" is not a defined medical diagnosis in the provided sources, and I recommend clarifying the intended term — most likely aspiration pneumonitis — so I can provide a precise, reference-aligned explanation and management guidance [^1157dNuW] [^112RauFV].

I can't find a medical entity called "foraminal pneumonitis". Please confirm the exact term you meant. Did you mean one of the following?

- **Aspiration pneumonitis**: lung injury from inhaling gastric or oropharyngeal contents, often with chemical injury and secondary infection.
- **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis**: an immune-mediated ILD from repeated antigen exposure, with fibrotic and nonfibrotic phenotypes.
- **Immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis**: an irAE with variable CT patterns and steroid-responsive inflammation [^1113b1Aq] [^115MZhh5].
- **Radiation pneumonitis**: lung injury within or near prior radiation fields, sometimes overlapping with ICI pneumonitis [^112R7SjS] [^112ejzYy].

If you meant something else, please clarify the term or the clinical context so I can provide a precise definition and management guidance.

Purpose Of Review

A recent international collaboration has updated the clinical definition and diagnostic recommendations for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, focusing on fibrotic and non-fibrotic phenotypes. However, how these transfer to clinical practice and their impact upon clinical management and prognosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is unclear. This review will focus on recent advances in the understanding of the clinical aspects of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, predominantly its epidemiology, diagnosis, classification and treatment.

Recent Findings

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a rare disease within the general population, with variable geographical incidence because of environmental, cultural and occupational factors. Confidence in diagnosis relies upon the presence of clinical features with a temporal relationship to an associated exposure, radiological and histopathological features, bronchiolo-alveolar lavage lymphocytosis and precipitating antibodies/specific immunoglobulin G to antigens. Although emerging evidence regarding nintedanib use in progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease is promising, the majority of therapies (corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents) used traditionally in hypersensitivity pneumonitis lack a robust evidence base.

Summary

With a clear definition of fibrotic and nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis phenotypes now established, clinical research trials (predominantly randomized controlled trials) should clarify and resolve the discussion regarding antigen avoidance, corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive therapy and antifibrotic therapy in fibrotic and nonfibrotic subtypes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1119WYea]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Identification of inciting antigens in suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — Recommendation 3 states, in patients with suspected HP, "we suggest classifying patients based on the likelihood of an occupational or environmental inciting antigen exposure (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence)". Voting results were "definitely agree, 11; probably agree, 3; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 1; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 0; abstained from voting, 0". Remarks emphasize that "Correct identification of the IA and the subsequent elimination of that exposure facilitate the management and helps determine the prognosis of HP", that "Unless a thorough exposure history is performed, the IA may go unrecognized, with resultant ongoing exposure possibly adversely impacting disease progression and survival", and that "surveillance for exposure and patient education focused on antigen avoidance at every visit is the highest priority", with "additional investigative strategies to identify a potential exposure (eg, workplace inspection) may support the diagnosis and help guide management decisions".

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114inesN]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular analysis recommendation: For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Voting results were: definitely agree, 10; probably agree, 3; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 1; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 1; abstained from voting, 0. Remarks note that BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP, but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and adds little diagnostic information; lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in fibrotic HP and BAL lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out fibrotic HP, although it may increase confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT is compatible, should be considered when exposure history and imaging are discordant, and may exclude alternatives such as IPF when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114CqQy6]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — role of clinical improvement with medical therapy: For patients with suspected HP, we suggest not relying solely on clinical improvement with medical therapy to confirm a diagnosis of HP or on the lack of clinical improvement with medical therapy alone to rule out the diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Clinical improvement refers to improvement in physiologic and radiologic features, and failure to respond to medical treatment (eg, systemic corticosteroids) alone does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of HP as the response rate to medical therapy can be highly variable. Clinical improvement with medical treatment appears to occur more frequently in nonfibrotic HP, while the lack of clinical improvement, regardless of therapy, is common in fibrotic HP, and clinical improvement with medical therapy supports but does not confirm the diagnosis of HP as other ILDs with similar presentations, such as idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, may also improve with immunosuppressive treatment. Voting results: definitely agree, 11; probably agree, 4; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 0; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 0; abstained from voting, 0.

Combination therapy and radiation context for ICI-pneumonitis risk — Whether treatment with antineoplastic and/or other drugs and/or radiation therapy increases the incidence of ICI-pneumonitis is unknown. Pneumonitis after thoracic radiation is well described, raising particular concern for increased risk with concomitant or sequential ICI and thoracic radiation. In a study comparing adjuvant durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) to placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation, pneumonitis was highest in the durvalumab group (34%) compared with placebo (25%). Although the risk of pneumonitis is probably increased, retrospective and subgroup analyses so far support a likely favorable risk-to-benefit ratio in patients receiving both ICI and chest radiation. These data are limited by different treatment timing, dosing, and tumor heterogeneity and lower-than-expected irAEs in those treated with ICI alone. Recently, combination of EGFR-TKIs and ICIs has been recognized to increase the risk of pneumonitis.

### Asymptomatic COVID-19: what the neuroradiologist needs to know about pulmonary manifestations [^117Dsrs3]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with a high asymptomatic incidence. Asymptomatic infections within a population will inevitably lead to diagnosis via unrelated medical imaging. We report the case of an asymptomatic patient undergoing a spine CT examination for trauma who was incidentally found to have lung abnormalities later confirmed to be COVID-19. We aim to familiarize neuroradiologists with the spectrum of COVID-19 pulmonary manifestations that are likely to be observed on neck and spine CT imaging.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^111Ar9Zn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of methotrexate does not always result in complete recovery. A transient acute neurologic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with high dose regimens. Manifestations of this stroke-like encephalopathy may include confusion, hemiparesis, transient blindness, seizures and coma. The exact cause is unknown. After the intrathecal use of methotrexate, the central nervous system toxicity which may occur can be classified as follows: acute chemical arachnoiditis manifested by such symptoms as headache, back pain, nuchal rigidity, and fever; sub-acute myelopathy characterized by paraparesis/paraplegia associated with involvement with one or more spinal nerve roots; chronic leukoencephalopathy manifested by confusion, irritability, somnolence, ataxia, dementia, seizures and coma. This condition can be progressive and even fatal.

Pulmonary:

Methotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses. It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported.

Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry nonproductive cough) or a non-specific pneumonitis occurring during Otrexup therapy may be indicative of a potentially dangerous lesion and require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. Although clinically variable, the typical patient with methotrexate induced lung disease presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray; infection (including pneumonia) needs to be excluded. This lesion can occur at all dosages.

High-resolution CT pattern — For patients with suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), "we suggest the integration of HRCT findings characteristic of HP with clinical findings to support the diagnosis of HP, but not using the CT findings in isolation to make a definite diagnosis (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence)". Voting results were "definitely agree, 15; probably agree, 0; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 0; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 0; abstained from voting, 0". Characteristic HRCT findings "include profuse centrilobular nodules of ground-glass attenuation, inspiratory mosaic attenuation and air-trapping, and the three-density sign", and assessment of overall probability should consider disease prevalence in the setting, clinical context, exposure history, and information contributed by HRCT.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1124EFHz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement — immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis — states that ICIs are associated with unique adverse events including potentially life-threatening pneumonitis, that the diagnosis of ICI-pneumonitis is increasing, and that biological mechanisms, clinical and radiologic features, diagnosis, and management have not been well defined. The objectives are to summarize evidence, identify knowledge and research gaps, and prioritize topics and propose methods for future research on ICI-pneumonitis, using a multidisciplinary review by international clinical researchers of available data to develop and refine research questions. The statement identifies gaps in knowledge and develops potential research questions across risk, biologic mechanisms, clinical and radiologic presentation, and management of ICI-pneumonitis, concluding that gaps in basic biological mechanisms and a precipitous increase in the use of ICIs alone or combined with other therapies highlight the importance in triaging research priorities; keywords include lung cancer, immunotherapy, interstitial lung disease, and NSCLC.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^115MZhh5]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Pulmonary toxicity — immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonitis — includes variable presentations, risk factors, and incidence. For the purposes of this manuscript, pneumonitis is defined broadly as lung tissue inflammation. Pneumonitis is a relatively common irAE that is associated with lower rates of patient survival; symptoms include dyspnea, persistent cough, chest pain, fever, and hypoxia (potentially leading to respiratory failure), though patients may also be asymptomatic with detectable inflammation on CT scan. In published meta-analyses, patients with NSCLC or renal cell carcinoma have a higher risk of developing pneumonitis compared with melanoma following PD-(L)1 inhibitors, and recent literature indicates that a history of asthma and/or smoking may predispose to higher grade pneumonitis; other factors include prior curative-intent radiotherapy and squamous tumor histology, and lack of improvement with corticosteroid treatment may be more common in former or active smokers or those with underlying lung conditions. Pneumonitis occurs in 4% of patients receiving PD-(L)1 inhibitors (1% grade ≥ 3) and 1% of patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 therapy (1% grade ≥ 3), with higher rates for combination ICIs at 7% (2% grade ≥ 3).

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113wuVbs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer care but are associated with unique adverse events, including potentially life-threatening pneumonitis. The diagnosis of ICI-pneumonitis is increasing; however, the biological mechanisms, clinical and radiologic features, and the diagnosis and management have not been well defined. Objectives: To summarize evidence, identify knowledge and research gaps, and prioritize topics and propose methods for future research on ICI-pneumonitis. Methods: A multidisciplinary group of international clinical researchers reviewed available data on ICI-pneumonitis to develop and refine research questions pertaining to ICI-pneumonitis. Results: This statement identifies gaps in knowledge and develops potential research questions to further expand knowledge regarding risk, biologic mechanisms, clinical and radiologic presentation, and management of ICI-pneumonitis. Conclusions: Gaps in knowledge of the basic biological mechanisms of ICI-pneumonitis, coupled with a precipitous increase in the use of ICIs alone or combined with other therapies, highlight the importance in triaging research priorities for ICI-pneumonitis.

### Duvelisib (Copiktra) [^114LbpVT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Pneumonitis

Serious, including fatal (1/442; 0.2%), pneumonitis without an apparent infectious cause occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). Median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis was 4 months (range: 9 days to 27 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 9 months). The median event duration was 1 month, with 75% of cases resolving by 2 months.

Withhold COPIKTRA in patients who present with new or progressive pulmonary signs and symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation and evaluate for etiology. If the pneumonitis is infectious, patients may be restarted on COPIKTRA at the previous dose once the infection, pulmonary signs and symptoms resolve. For moderate non-infectious pneumonitis (Grade 2), treat with systemic corticosteroids, and resume COPIKTRA at a reduced dose upon resolution. If non-infectious pneumonitis recurs or does not respond to steroid therapy, discontinue COPIKTRA. For severe or life-threatening non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue COPIKTRA and treat with systemic steroids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Radiation therapy in the management of leptomeningeal disease from solid tumors [^114M6aoH]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for target volume delineation and dose constraints for proton CSI have been previously published. Although proximal spinal nerve roots are generally part of the target for proton CSI, routine coverage of the optic nerves remains a topic of debate. Coverage of the optic nerves and retina may increase risk of toxicity in patients receiving what has historically been considered a palliative treatment, perhaps most notably elevating the risk of retinopathy in patients receiving systemic therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, we have observed an anecdotal case of late (3 year) bilateral, retina-only relapse in a patient treated with optic-nerve sparing proton CSI, highlighting how changes in prognosis and treatments for these patients may increase the importance of comprehensive radiation coverage to at-risk structures in patients with disease that is otherwise well-controlled. The cribriform plate is often contoured as a separate target volume to ensure coverage. Cranial foramina are generally also included in the clinical target volume as well as the spinal neural foramina, and sagittal T2 sequence on MRI spine helps to define the termination of the thecal sac. Before start of therapy, all patients should undergo a thorough neurologic examination, complete neuroaxis MRI imaging, and lumbar puncture. At the start of treatment, we generally prescribe memantine to reduce risks for neurocognitive deficits, dexamethasone (typically 2 mg twice daily with adjustment as needed during CSI and taper after CSI) if not already on glucocorticoid steroids, proton pump inhibitor, and pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. Systemic therapies are typically held during CSI. One should consider evaluating blood counts either in the last week or the week after CSI, and more frequently in patients with clinical need. After completion of RT, we repeat clinical examination, neuroaxis imaging, and lumbar puncture every 2 to 3 months.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)–exposure–BAL/histopathology confidence matrix for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Figure 6) indicates that HRCT categories "Typical for HP", "Compatible with HP", and "Indeterminate for HP" are crossed with "Exposure +" or "Exposure –" under "History of exposure and/or serum IgG testing" and with rows for "No BAL or BAL without lymphocytosis and either no histopathology or indeterminate histopathology", "BAL lymphocytosis without histopathology sampling", "BAL lymphocytosis with indeterminate histopathology", "Probable HP histopathology", and "Typical HP histopathology"; cells display diagnostic certainty levels including "Definite", "High confidence", "Moderate confidence", "Low confidence", and "Not excluded". The caption states that "All confidence levels are subject to multidisciplinary discussion", and adds, "Confidence may increase to "definite" if the pathologist's conclusion persists after reevaluation in the context of additional clinical information or an expert second opinion on histopathology".

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation testing (LPT) recommendation: For patients with suspected HP, we suggest not performing antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation testing to support the diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Voting results were: definitely agree, 9; probably agree, 2; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 1; probably disagree, 1; definitely disagree, 0; abstained from voting, 2. Remarks cite major limitations including the lack of standardized and validated antigen preparations for most IAs, lack of standardized lymphocyte proliferation techniques, absence of validated criteria for defining a positive response, and the absence of studies evaluating the additional value of antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation testing in modifying the likelihood of HP during the diagnostic process.

Immune-related pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease in lung cancer — timing and risk are described: While most immune-related adverse events occur during or shortly after the period of treatment, they may also occur months after treatment has concluded, with two analyses of ICI-treated patients who developed pneumonitis showing median times to onset at 2.8 months and 82 days. A meta-analysis of anti-PD-1 trials found higher pneumonitis rates in NSCLC than melanoma for all-grade pneumonitis (4.1% vs 1.6%; p = 0.002) and for grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis (1.8% vs 0.2%; p < 0.001), and combination regimens including ICIs had higher odds for all-grade (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.50; p < 0.001) and grade ≥ 3 (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.79 to 4.35; p < 0.001) pneumonitis compared with ICI monotherapy. Additional risk factors for ICI-induced pneumonitis include prior radiotherapy (curative-intent, chest) and squamous histology for patients with NSCLC, and steroid-refractory pneumonitis may be more common in patients with other lung conditions or smoking; another concern is ICI-associated interstitial lung disease, where in 83 NSCLC patients, pre-existing interstitial lung abnormalities (specifically ground-glass attenuation) were associated with significantly higher (p < 0.001) incidence.

HRCT evaluation — CT image quality and diagnostic categories explains that "high-resolution CT imaging using standardized techniques including expiratory imaging is far more accurate than chest radiographs in assessing the extent, distribution, and pattern of disease and can be critical for making the diagnosis of HP". It specifies that "images should be obtained on full inspiration and expiration and should be free of respiratory motion", that "expiratory imaging is critical to show geographic air-trapping", and that "coronal reconstructions should be included to show the craniocaudal and axial distributions of abnormality". It adds, "Examples of technical recommendations for performing high-resolution chest CT imaging may be found at https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Practice-Parameters/HRCT-Lungs.pdf)". After assessing image quality and CT features, the authors state, "we suggest classification of chest imaging patterns into nonfibrotic".

1 Treatment can be compromised in that pneumonitis may present as completely asymptomatic in some patients, while in others it may present with variable pulmonary symptoms. The onset can be acute or more insidious, including after treatment completion. Common symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and low-grade fever. Severe cases may involve hypoxemia with respiratory failure and congestive heart failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- Chest x-ray to assess for radiographic changes consistent with pneumonitis
- Pulse oximetry arterial blood gases and pulmonary function tests
- Complete blood count, sputum, and blood cultures to rule out infectious causes
- High-resolution chest CT scan with respirology consultation Clinicians should recommend follow-up imaging in 1 to 2 weeks or as clinically indicated, and monitor the patient until there is resolution of symptoms and/or radiographic imaging.

Recommended Treatments for Drug-Induced Pneumonitis Upon detection of pneumonitis 4, 5, cease prescribing T-DXd and consider corticosteroid treatment at onset. If the patient has asymptomatic, grade 1 DIP, take the following steps: For symptomatic/grade ≥ 2 DIP, permanently discontinue T-DXd and begin corticosteroid treatment for ≥ 14 days or until complete resolution of clinical and radiographic findings. Taper gradually over ≥ 4 weeks. If there is no improvement or clinically indicated, reimage and consider increasing dose of corticosteroids to 2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent and switching administration to intravenous. Escalate care as required and consider alternative diagnoses. In cases of Grade 3 or 4 DIP, hospitalization is required. Permanently discontinue T-DXd.

Begin corticosteroid treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone IV, then ≥ 1 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 14 days or until complete resolution of clinical and radiographic findings. Taper gradually over ≥ 4 weeks. If there is no improvement within 3 to 5 days, rule out other etiologies and consider other immunosuppressants.

TABLE 8.
Risk Factors for Late (> 365 Days After Primary Operation) Reoperation on all the Patients Operated for Degenerative Cervical Spine Disease in Finland Between 1999 and 2015 (Adjusted Cox Regression Analysis)

In the multivariate analysis, operation for foraminal stenosis, ACDF technique, a younger age, male gender, pulmonary comorbidity, an operation in a public hospital, and the use of weak opiates or muscle relaxants were all independent risk factors for reoperation (Table 8, Figure 5 A- 5E). The risk of reoperation was approximately 50% higher when ACDF was utilized for foraminal or spinal canal stenosis compared with decompression (Figure 6 A- 6C). Within the ACDF group, the risk of reoperation was significantly higher in foraminal and spinal canal stenosis patients compared to disc protrusion patients (Figure 7 A and 7B). The only risk factors affecting the time to reoperation were the diagnosis group, the patient age group, and operation years (Figure 8 A- 8C).

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114f9w1n]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) histopathology is characterized by a bronchiolocentric pattern of fibrosis with extensive subpleural fibrosis reminiscent of a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, with fibroblastic foci at the edge of dense fibrotic scars. Bronchioles may be surrounded by fibrosis with mild chronic inflammation, and scattered poorly formed granulomas can be present; low power bronchiolocentricity and subtle granulomas are key features in suspecting fibrotic HP. Biopsies can show patchy dense interstitial fibrosis with a bronchiolocentric distribution, including bands of fibrosis bridging between bronchioles and the pleura. Bronchiolar fibrosis may consist of widespread peribronchiolar metaplasia with bronchiolar remodeling due to fibrosis extending beyond bronchiolar lumens into the surrounding interstitium of alveolar walls, where thickened alveolar walls are lined by bronchiolar epithelium, and a poorly formed noncaseating granuloma may be present.

5.3 Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)

Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD occurred in patients treated with PADCEV.

When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 10% of the 564 patients treated with combination therapy had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 4% had Grade 3–4. A fatal event of pneumonitis/ILD occurred in two patients (0.4%). The incidence of pneumonitis/ILD, including severe events, occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab compared to PADCEV as a single agent. The median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis/ILD was 4 months (range: 0.3 to 26 months).

In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 3% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 0.8% had Grade 3–4. The median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis/ILD was 2.9 months (range: 0.6 to 6 months).

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis/ILD such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Evaluate and exclude infectious, neoplastic and other causes for such signs and symptoms through appropriate investigations.

Withhold PADCEV for patients who develop Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis/ILD [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.4 Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis

KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] who received single-agent KRAZATI, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.1% of patients, 1.4% were Grade 3 or 4, and one case was fatal. The median time to first onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 12 weeks (range: 5 to 31 weeks). Adagrasib was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.8% of patients.

In patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], Grade 1 ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.1% of patients. The time to first onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 38 weeks.

Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI. Withhold KRAZATI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue KRAZATI if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Imaging of oncologic treatment-related pneumonitis: a focused review on emerging issues of immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis, from theSpecial series on inflammation [^1113b1Aq]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment-related pneumonitis represents a major challenge in oncology patients undergoing therapy, and imaging plays an essential role in detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of pneumonitis in these patients. Among various types of pneumonitis from different kinds of cancer treatments, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis has been recognized as an important topic in the radiology and oncology communities since 2015, given the increasing clinical indications for ICI therapy in patients with cancer. Moreover, clinical applications of ICIs continue to advance rapidly with novel combination approaches, leading to further emerging challenges. This focused review describes the current knowledge about ICI pneumonitis and discusses several newly emerging issues involving recurrence and flare of ICI pneumonitis, as well as involving pneumonitis from new combination approaches including ICI with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ICI with radiotherapy. The article concludes with a summary of unmet needs in the care of patients with ICI pneumonitis as well as of future directions in the advancement of knowledge about ICI pneumonitis and patient care for ICI pneumonitis. Given the proven multifaceted value of imaging in ICI pneumonitis, radiologists will remain central in the ongoing multidisciplinary journey to further understand and overcome this challenging toxicity for patients with cancer.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which is defined as requiring use of steroids and no clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

OPDIVO as a Single Agent

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, including Grade 4 (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 1.1% and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.8% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (61/61) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 61 patients. Of the 15 patients in whom OPDIVO was withheld for pneumonitis, 14 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement; of these, 4 (29%) had recurrence of pneumonitis.

OPDIVO with Ipilimumab

OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg: In NSCLC, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 5% of patients and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.6% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 72% of the patients. Approximately 13% (2/16) of patients had recurrence of pneumonitis after reinitiation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

Leflunomide — interstitial pneumonitis: Interstitial pneumonitis with leflunomide has been reported in case series, especially in Japan, and fatalities have occurred. Whether preexisting lung disease from rheumatoid arthritis confers a higher risk of pneumonitis compared with methotrexate therapy is unclear. The largest data set, using a cohort of 62,734 patients treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, suggested that any increased incidence of pneumonitis in leflunomide-treated patients was likely a result of clinician preference to treat patients with underlying interstitial lung disease with leflunomide rather than methotrexate.

### Barium sulfate (ENTERO Vu 24%) [^111fzA4U]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity
Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients, including
natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity
reactions. The manifestations include hypotension, bronchospasm and
other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions including rashes,
urticaria and itching. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, food
allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase
the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment and
trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment of
a hypersensitivity reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal
Barium Leakage

The use of ENTERO VU 24% is contraindicated in patients at high risk
of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications (4)]. Administration of ENTERO VU
24% may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence
of conditions that increase the risk of perforation such as known
carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal
ulcer, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe
stenosis at any level of the GI tract, especially if it is distal
to the stomach. Barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis
and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed Gastrointestinal
Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate
proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction
or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated
with feces) and may cause abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction,
or perforation. Patients with the following conditions are at higher
risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis at
any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility, electrolyte imbalance,
dehydration, on a low residue diet, on medications that delay GI motility,
constipation, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations
(8.5)]. To reduce the risk
of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain adequate
hydration after the barium sulfate procedure.

5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis

The use of ENTERO VU 24% is
contraindicated in patients with trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications (4)]. Oral administration of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis,
especially in patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised
swallowing mechanism. Vomiting following oral administration of barium
sulfate may lead to aspiration pneumonitis. In patients at risk for
aspiration, begin the procedure with a small ingested volume of ENTERO
VU 24%. Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration
of ENTERO VU 24% if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for development
of aspiration pneumonitis.

In a study of 117 HP patients grouped as honeycombing (n = 12), non-honeycomb fibrosis (n = 45), or nonfibrotic HP (n = 60), patients with nonfibrotic HP survived longer than those with non-honeycomb fibrosis (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10–0.51) or honeycombing (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02–0.15), and non-honeycomb fibrosis survived longer than honeycombing (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12–0.54). Symptom duration was not associated with unadjusted survival time (HR 1.0 per additional month of symptoms; 95% CI, 0.99–1.01), and was similar across radiologic groups; two excluded studies also revealed no association between mortality and symptom duration.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115cLxED]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — computed tomography (CT) distribution and associated findings include that sparse thin-walled cysts may be seen in about 15% of HP cases, and on long-term follow-up emphysema may be seen in 20% to 30% of never smokers; overall the distribution of CT features is variable and often not diagnostically helpful in fibrotic HP. A mid-lung predominance of fibrosis is highly suggestive of HP since it is rarely found in other fibrotic lung diseases, upper lung predominance is seen in 10% to 20% of cases, lower lung predominance occurs in about 30% of cases of fibrotic HP, and in the axial plane findings may be diffuse or subpleural predominant; when present, upper or mid-lung predominance can help distinguish fibrotic HP from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1171zyyb]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia clarifying statements define qualifying conditions and risks, stating that "The host immune defense disorder is present at the time of infection", that "Transient impairment of immune function, as may occur in the setting of severe sepsis, is not sufficient for the patient to be considered inherently immunocompromised", and that "Patients who have a history of immunocompromising conditions that have resolved should not be considered ICHs". They add that "Systemic conditions with known metabolic effects on immune function should be considered comorbidities but not immunocompromise-defining conditions", and "Persons of advanced age, a population at increased risk for pneumonia, would not be considered ICH under the proposed definition, as increased susceptibility to pneumonia is not synonymous with immunocompromise". Non-immune conditions are excluded because "Mechanical and structural lung diseases that increase the risk for pneumonia are not included in this definition of ICHP", and "Although these conditions add additional risk for pneumonia, they are not systemic immune defects". Regarding infection patterns, "The host immune defense disorder increases the individual's risk for more frequent or severe disease caused by common community pathogens", and "CAP in ICHs with typical organisms, such as S. pneumoniae, can present with more frequent, severe, prolonged, or recurrent manifestations compared with immunocompetent persons". They also note that "The host immune defense disorder increases the risk of pneumonia because of uncommon or opportunistic pathogens", and that an ICH with pneumonia "warrants consideration of additional diagnostic and/or alternative therapeutic strategies beyond those recommended in pneumonia guidelines", with the reminder that "Opportunistic and multiorganism infections can occur… pursuing the identification of a specific etiology is important while considering empiric coverage for patients who are ICHs on the basis of the underlying immune impairment".

### Tepotinib hydrochloride (Tepmetko) [^112phTkm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis

ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2% patients treated with TEPMETKO, with one patient experiencing a Grade 3 or higher event; this event resulted in death. Five patients (1%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to ILD/pneumonitis.

Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TEPMETKO in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2	Hepatotoxicity

Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 18% of patients treated with TEPMETKO. Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT/AST occurred in 4.7% of patients. A fatal adverse reaction of hepatic failure occurred in one patient (0.2%). Four patients (0.8%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to increased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST was 47 days (range 1 to 262).

Monitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of TEPMETKO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased transaminases or bilirubin.

### An uncommon etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: a case report [^1157dNuW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration pneumonitis is an infectious disease of the lungs caused by large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal or upper gastrointestinal contents, which is more likely to occur in patients with risk factors such as impaired swallowing, consciousness, and cough reflex, etc. However, aspiration pneumonitis is sometimes difficult to diagnose in the first place due to atypical clinical features and uncertain etiology. We described such a case of aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The definition of immune-mediated pneumonitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% (33/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.6%), and Grade 2 (1.6%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1.3% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.4% of the patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 61% of the 33 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for pneumonitis, 10 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 4/10 (40%) had recurrence of pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated colitis. The definition of immune-mediated colitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. The primary component of the immune-mediated colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2% (25/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (0.9%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 0.4% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.2% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with colitis. Colitis resolved in 56% of the 25 patients. Of the 16 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for colitis, 6 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 4/6 (67%) had recurrence of colitis.

### Chronic immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^116BN1qJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonitis from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a potentially fatal immune-related adverse event (irAE) from antiprogrammed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 immunotherapy. Most cases of ICI pneumonitis improve or resolve with 4–6 weeks of corticosteroid therapy. Herein, we report the incidence, clinicopathological features and management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis that warrants ≥ 12 weeks of immunosuppression.

Methods

Patients with ICI pneumonitis were identified from institutional databases of ICI-treated patients with advanced melanoma and NSCLC between January 2011 and July 2018. ICI pneumonitis was defined as clinical/radiographic evidence of lung inflammation without alternative diagnoses, adjudicated by a multidisciplinary team. Chronic ICI pneumonitis was defined as pneumonitis that persists or worsens with steroid tapering, and necessitates ≥ 12 weeks of immunosuppression, after ICI discontinuation. Serial chest CT was used to assess radiological features, and tumor response by Response EvaluationCriteria for Solid Tumors V.1.1. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were assessed by cell differential. Lung biopsy samples were evaluated by H&E staining and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), where available.

Results

Among 299 patients, 44 developed ICI pneumonitis (NSCLC: 5/205; melanoma: 1/94), and of these, 6 experienced chronic ICI pneumonitis. The overall incidence of chronic ICI pneumonitis was thus 2%. Of those who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis: the majority had NSCLC (5/6), all sustained disease control from ICIs, and none had other concurrent irAEs. Timing of chronic ICI pneumonitis development was variable (range: 0–50 months), and occurred at a median of 12 months post ICI start. Recrudescence of ICI pneumonitis occurred at a median of 6 weeks after initial steroid start (range: 3–12 weeks), with all patients requiring steroid reintroduction when tapered to ≤ 10 mg prednisone/equivalent. The median total duration of steroids was 37 weeks (range: 16–43+weeks). Re-emergence of radiographic ICI pneumonitis occurred in the same locations on chest CT, in most cases (5/6). All patients who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis had BALF lymphocytosis on cell differential and organising pneumonia on lung biopsy at initial ICI pneumonitis presentation, with persistent BALF lymphocytosis and brisk CD8+ infiltration on mIF at pneumonitis re-emergence during steroid taper.

Conclusions

A subset of patients who develop pneumonitis from ICIs will develop chronic ICI pneumonitis, that warrants long-term immunosuppression of ≥ 12 weeks, and has distinct clinicopathological features.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^114YynFC]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis may closely mimic other interstitial lung diseases, and the disease onset is usually insidious. High-resolution computed tomography and bronchoalveolar lavage are the sensitive and characteristic diagnostic tests for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The relevant antigen to hypersensitivity pneumonitis cannot be identified in up to 20% to 30% of patients. Clinicians should be aware that hypersensitivity pneumonitis must be considered in all cases of interstitial lung disease, and a detailed environmental exposure history is mandatory.

### Steroid-refractory PD-(L) 1 pneumonitis: incidence, clinical features, treatment, and outcomes [^117BEvdp]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

While our study has several strengths, there were also important limitations. First, the retrospective nature of this study may limit its generalizability to other centers and clinical situations. Second, there is no standard definition for steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis, therefore, our study may have included patients whose ICI-pneumonitis was either steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant. This highlights the need to elucidate clearer definitions for these terms. Our estimate of the incidence of steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis is derived from those referred for multidisciplinary care, who likely represent more complex cases of ICI-pneumonitis, and thus may be an overestimation of the true incidence of this phenomenon. Improvement in steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis was assessed clinically, and in some cases, without imaging, therefore, some patients did not have CT imaging after receiving steroid therapy. Importantly, the conclusions of this study are limited by small patient numbers and the clinical status of patients at the time of immunosuppressive treatment. That is, patients treated with IVIG may have had less severe steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis at baseline (having less need for invasive oxygen supplementation), which may have contributed to the overall improved clinical findings for this group. Finally, since there are multiple guideline-based treatment options for this phenomenon, there was a lack of an established paradigm for patients being treated with either IVIG, infliximab, or the combination. This limits our ability to identify an immunosuppressive treatment that is truly preferable. The poorer outcomes faced by those who received infliximab (either as monotherapy or combination) may thus be due to confounding by indication and reflect timing of therapy or severity of steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis rather than a lack of efficacy of infliximab itself. We attempt to address some of these limitations by assessing the functional impact of ICI-pneumonitis through evaluation of oxygen requirement and level-of-care across all cases. A prospective trial is currently underway in order to evaluate these therapies for steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis (NCT04438382).

### Radiation versus immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonitis: distinct radiologic morphologies [^112R7SjS]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a cohort of patients with NSCLC treated with definitive dose of thoracic RT and/or ICIs, RT‐pneumonitis is more likely to be unilateral, involve fewer lobes of the lung, and have sharp border, whereas ICI‐pneumonitis tends to be bilateral and involve more lobes and is less likely to have sharp border. Patients who develop pneumonitis after both RT and ICI have heterogeneous morphologic presentations, with features overlapping with both RT‐ and ICI‐pneumonitis. Poor performance status, greater smoking history, lower pretreatment lung function, and bilateral and multifocal involvement on CT are risk factors associated with severe pneumonitis. Lastly, an exploratory radiomics‐based ML model can identify the predominant pneumonitis etiology in patients who received RT + ICI with good concordance with the clinical impression of a multidisciplinary group of physicians. Future studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to validate these findings.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1112GDfv]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

Oligometastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) systemic–local therapy coordination — In the 2 RCTs, definitive radiation therapy (RT) doses were used, with stereotactic techniques if possible, and in the context of oligometastatic NSCLC, symptomatic brain metastases are treated with up-front definitive local therapy according to current guidelines. No RCT investigated the need to pause systemic treatment during definitive RT; however, data from 6 trials suggest it may be safe to continue systemic therapy during RT in select circumstances, and the potential need to temporarily pause systemic therapy during the definitive treatment of OMD versus continuation of systemic therapy concomitantly during definitive local therapy should be discussed among the multidisciplinary team, primarily with the treating medical oncologist, the provider facilitating the local therapy, and with the patient. Maintenance systemic treatment after definitive local therapy is conditionally recommended, after discussion of the risk-benefit ratio with the patient; the 2 RCTs allowed or mandated maintenance systemic therapy after definitive local treatment of OMD, respectively, patients may be offered maintenance therapy posttreatment of OMD per standard of care recommendations for patients with stage IV NSCLC, and patients receiving a targeted therapy for an actionable genomic alteration may resume the therapy after definitive local treatment, unless there are concerns about toxicity such as pneumonitis.

### An uncommon etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: a case report [^112RauFV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Aspiration pneumonitis accounts for 5–24% of community-acquired pneumonitis and about 5–15% of hospitalized pneumonitis. A meta-analysis showed that in-hospital and 30-day mortality was significantly increased in patients with aspiration pneumonitis compared to those with non-aspiration pneumonitis. Therefore, it is very important to find out relevant etiological factors for aspiration in time for early diagnosis and treatment of aspiration pneumonitis.

The patient was not initially diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis. One of the main reasons was similar clinical symptoms and chest CT imaging features with viral pneumonitis. Runny nose and dry cough, as common symptoms of respiratory tract infection, did not cause enough attention of the patient at the beginning. Most of the imaging findings of viral pneumonitis, including COVID-19, are manifested as multiple ground-glass density shadows in both lungs, which is similar to imaging features of aspiration pneumonitis. In addition, lack of identified etiological factors of aspiration was another major cause. We usually think that patients with esophageal diseases, neurological diseases or other chronic degenerative diseases are more likely to be exposed to the risk of aspiration. Moreover, the extent of exposure to persistent postnasal drip of CSF leading to macroaspiration is difficult to be witnessed directly in this case. These factors mentioned above delayed the awareness of etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis.

### Incidence and risk factors for pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a single center experience [^112EduwR]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Definitions

A multidisciplinary adjudication team was assembled to assess whether respiratory alterations, both in symptoms or imaging, were due to pneumonitis, pneumonia, or other causes (such as disease progression). This committee was comprised of pulmonologists (A.S. V.S.), infectious disease specialists (F.K.), thoracic radiologists (M.G. G.S.), and thoracic oncologist (M. A.). The committee met at regular intervals to discuss each case, starting with the history and aided by relevant imaging, laboratory results, microbiological data, and response to treatment (particularly steroids and/or antibiotics).

Cases were classified as drug-related pneumonitis, infectious pneumonia, or other (eg, progression, pulmonary edema). Pneumonia was defined as (1) congruous symptoms (eg cough, shortness of breath) and congruous imaging (eg lobar consolidation with air bronchograms) and (2) a distinct response to antibiotic therapy that could not be attributed to corticosteroids or isolation of an organism known to cause pneumonia. Pneumonia was deemed definite if microbiological confirmation was available and probable if there was a plausible and temporal association between the administration of antibiotics and improvement of the patient. Pneumonitis was defined as (1) congruous symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) and congruous imaging and (2) had a distinct response to corticosteroids that could not be attributed to antibiotics. With regard to imaging, cases of pneumonitis were classified as per prior research and position papers as either nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), or indeterminate (ie, nonspecific patchy ground-glass or consolidative opacities without clear dominant pattern) based on the dominant pattern of abnormality at CTRadiation-related pneumonitis (RP) was diagnosed when lung opacities were located within the radiation portal. Pneumonitis cases were deemed to be definite in cases of clear response to corticosteroids and probable in cases with compatible clinical features and imaging with no evidence of lower respiratory infection. Pneumonitis was graded according to the latest Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease were diagnosed by pulmonary experts based upon pulmonary function testing, imaging, and clinical presentation.

5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis

TAGRISSO can cause severe and fatal ILD/pneumonitis.

Across clinical trials, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 4% of the 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy who had not received recent definitive chemoradiation therapy; 0.4% of cases were fatal.

ILD/Pneumonitis with TAGRISSO in Combination with Pemetrexed and Platinum-based Chemotherapy

In the FLAURA2 study, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of the 276 patients who received TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy; 0.4% of cases were fatal.

ILD/Pneumonitis Following Definitive Platinum-based Chemoradiation Therapy

In the LAURA study, following definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, ILD/pneumonitis, including radiation pneumonitis, occurred in 80 of the 143 patients (56%) who received TAGRISSO monotherapy and 28 of the 73 patients (38%) who received placebo. There was one fatal case (0.7%), 3.5% Grade 3, 34% Grade 2, and 18% Grade 1 adverse reactions of ILD/pneumonitis in TAGRISSO-treated patients. For TAGRISSO-treated patients, ILD/pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO in 7% of patients and dosage interruptions of TAGRISSO in 35% of patients. Among the 46 patients who were rechallenged with TAGRISSO, 11% had recurrence of ILD/pneumonitis. In the 80 TAGRISSO-treated patients, ILD/pneumonitis resolved in 40%, resolved with sequelae in 1.3%, were resolving in 16%, did not resolve in 41%, and resulted in death in 1.3%.

### Management of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^1113e9SQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent guidelines have updated the classification of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, stratifying by the presence or absence of fibrosis as either fibrotic or nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis represents up to 10% of interstitial lung disease in large cohort studies, and is occasionally even more common in some regions; however, there are many unknown aspects to the diagnosis and management. The goal of this review article is to summarize the management of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Recent Findings

Historically, the only treatment options for patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis were antigen avoidance and corticosteroids, although other immunosuppressive therapies are increasingly endorsed by experts in the field. There is accumulating evidence that antifibrotic medications can be useful as a second-line therapy in some patients with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis who have progression despite immunosuppression. There remains no direct comparison of immunosuppressive vs. antifibrotic medication for the management of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but some clinical, radiological and pathological features may suggest greater likelihood of benefit from one option or the other.

Summary

We anticipate that future treatment of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis will consider a variety of patient features to suggest the most prominent underlying biology that will then be used to guide initial pharmacotherapy; however, additional data are still needed.

Coccidioidomycosis — lumbar puncture indications for newly diagnosed infection — In patients with recently diagnosed coccidioidal infection, we recommend lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis only in patients with unusual, worsening, or persistent headaches, or with other focal or new local neurologic deficits (strong, moderate). Headache is nearly always produced by coccidioidal meningitis (CM), but it is also a common (21%) symptom in uncomplicated primary coccidioidal pneumonic disease; if the headache is modest in severity and dissipates in approximately a week, a lumbar puncture is not required, whereas if the headache is the predominant symptom or is consistent, persistent, and progressive, lumbar puncture is required. In contrast, unless signs or symptoms of central nervous system involvement are present, routine analysis of CSF is unnecessary, and in the absence of symptoms, CM is unlikely.

5.19	Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis

LEMTRADA may increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis. In controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of LEMTRADA-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with interferon beta-1a. During postmarketing use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Time to onset of symptoms ranged from less than 24 hours to 2 months after LEMTRADA infusion. Typical risk or predisposing factors such as concurrent critical illness was often not reported. Abnormal ultrasound or computed tomography was used to support the diagnosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis in some cases. Some patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics and recovered without surgical intervention, whereas others underwent cholecystectomy.

Symptoms of acute acalculous cholecystitis include abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Leukocytosis and abnormal liver enzymes are also commonly observed. Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a condition that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not diagnosed early and treated. If acute acalculous cholecystitis is suspected, evaluate and treat promptly.

5.20 Pneumonitis

In clinical studies, 6 of 1217 (0.5%) LEMTRADA-treated patients had pneumonitis of varying severity. Cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pneumonitis with fibrosis occurred in clinical studies. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of pneumonitis, which may include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness, and hemoptysis.

5.21 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient

LEMTRADA contains the same active ingredient (alemtuzumab) found in CAMPATH®. If LEMTRADA is considered for use in a patient who has previously received CAMPATH, exercise increased vigilance for additive and long-lasting effects on the immune system.

### Radiation versus immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonitis: distinct radiologic morphologies [^112ejzYy]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study in which pneumonitis due to different etiologies, including RT, ICI, and potentially combination of the two in patients who received both, are systematically compared. Our findings have potential implications in directing the treatment for pneumonitis in patients with NSCLC, as well as in understanding the pathogenesis of pneumonitis in patients who receive both RT and ICI. First, RT‐ and ICI‐pneumonitis share similar CT elements (both commonly presenting as GGOs and/or consolidations) and patterns (often AIP/ARDS or COP) but differ in their spatial distribution in that ICI‐pneumonitis tends to be bilateral, more likely to involve more lobes of the lung, and less likely to have sharp borders. Second, as a group, patients who develop pneumonitis after receipt of both RT and ICI exhibit an intermediate phenotype between RT‐ and ICI‐pneumonitis in both morphologic and radiomic features, suggesting that both RT and ICI may contribute to the development of pneumonitis in this group. However, it should be noted that this is a heterogeneous group with some patients more closely resembling RT‐pneumonitis and others ICI‐pneumonitis (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, one etiology may play a more significant role in the development of pneumonitis than the other in a particular patient. The biologic underpinning of such differences in pneumonitis pathogenesis remains to be determined. Nevertheless, treatment of pneumonitis after RT + ICI may need to be individualized to take into account of the predominant etiology.

### Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a Fleischner society white paper [^115Tytvq]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis evaluation in fibrosing ILD — exposure history, test utility, and multidisciplinary review are detailed: in every patient with fibrosing ILD, identification of exposure to antigens that might result in hypersensitivity pneumonitis is important. In general, antigen exposure is more likely to be clinically significant if the exposure coincides with or precedes the onset of symptoms, if symptoms fluctuate temporally in relation to the exposure, and if other imaging, histological, or laboratory features are suggestive of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The clinical significance of histological findings suggesting hypersensitivity pneumonitis without known exposure (which accounts for as many as 50–60% of cases of histological chronic fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis) remains unclear; the clinical usefulness of serum precipitins in the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is uncertain, but showing lymphocytosis on cellular analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can be helpful in supporting a diagnosis. Some patients with a UIP pattern of pulmonary fibrosis have a history of occupational or medication exposures and these patients should be discussed at a multi-disciplinary conference to review the relevance of these exposures.

high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications
(4)]. Administration of VARIBAR
THIN LIQUID may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the
presence of conditions such as carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory
bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis, or diverticulitis.
and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract,
especially if it is distal to the stomach. The barium leakage has
been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed
Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate
proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction
or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated
with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction,
or rarely perforation. Patients with the following conditions are
at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis
at any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility, electrolyte imbalance,
dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking medications that delay
GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis
or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific
Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the risk of delayed
GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain adequate hydration
after the barium sulfate procedure.

5.4 Aspiration
Pneumonitis

The use of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID is contraindicated in patients with
trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications (4)]. Oral administration of barium
is associated with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in patients
with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing mechanism.
Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead
to aspiration pneumonitis.

In patients at risk for aspiration, begin
the procedure with a small ingested volume of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID.
Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration
of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for
development of aspiration pneumonitis.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117GH5hk]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis — transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC) vs surgical lung biopsy (SLB) diagnostic performance is described with chronic HP diagnoses of 15% (10/65) and 23% (15/65) vs 23% (15/65) and 28% (18/65) after incorporating findings by TBC compared with SLB, respectively, and high-confidence or definite TBC-supported multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) diagnoses were concordant with SLB-supported MDD in 37 (95%) of 39 cases. In 26 unclassifiable or low-confidence TBC-supported MDD diagnoses, six (23%) were reclassified into high confidence or definite diagnoses by SLB-supported MDD; within these six cases, TBC-supported MDD favored IPF in three cases but SLB-supported MDD favored HP with high confidence, and of the other three cases, HP was favored with TBC-supported MDD but SLB-supported MDD favored IPF in one case.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in workers exposed to metalworking fluids [^115ydtei]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This study used data from a large UK outbreak investigation, to develop and validate a new case definition for hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to metalworking fluid exposure (MWF-HP).

Methods

The clinical data from all workers with suspected MWF-HP were reviewed by an experienced panel of clinicians. A new MWF-HP Score was then developed to match the "gold standard" clinical opinion as closely as possible, using standard diagnostic criteria that were relatively weighted by their positive predictive value.

Results

The new case definition was reproducible, and agreed with expert panel opinion in 30/37 cases. This level of agreement was greater than with any of the three previously utilized case definitions (agreement in 16–24 cases). Where it was possible to calculate, the MWF-HP Score also performed well when applied to 50 unrelated MWF-HP cases.

Conclusions

The MWF-HP Score offers a new case definition for use in future outbreaks. Am. J. Ind. Med. 57:872–880, 2014. © 2014 The Authors. American Journal of Industrial Medicine Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Incidence and risk factors for pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a single center experience [^112YrKL6]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features of Pneumonitis

The cumulative incidence of pneumonitis was 9.5% (40/419) with one patient experiencing more than one episode of pneumonitis. Of these 40 cases, 23 were adjudicated as definite pneumonitis and 17 as probable pneumonitis (clinicopathologic characteristics of pneumonitis cases are summarized in Supplementary Table S1). The median time from start date of treatment with ICI to pneumonitis was 215 days after ICI initiation (interquartile range 120–330 days, range 6–879 days). Thirty-five patients had grade 2 (n = 21) or grade 3 (n = 14) pneumonitis, while 5 patients died due to pneumonitis. Fig. 1 illustrates representative patterns of pneumonitis, and Figs 1C and 2 show imaging in patients with grade 5 pneumonitis. Seven patients experienced pneumonitis concurrent with other irAEs, including rash, colitis, and hypophysitis. Among pneumonitis survivors (n = 29), 48% had only partial resolution (n = 14), implying post-pneumonitis fibrosis. Complete radiologic resolution was observed in 61% and 13% of grade 2 and grade 3 pneumonitis events, respectively. The median time to resolution of pneumonitis was 90 days (interquartile range, 75–108). Among all pneumonitis cases (n = 40), 31 received steroids for toxicity management. The median initial dose of prednisone was 60 mg/d (IQR 60–70 mg/d) with a median duration of treatment of 45 days (IQR 8–74 days) (therapy and outcome of pneumonitis summarized in Supplementary Table S2). No pneumonitis cases received nonsteroidal immunosuppression for treatment of pneumonitis, and 11 were rechallenged with ICI after resolution of pneumonitis. Of these, 7 patients discontinued after progression, 3 patients completed treatment, and one patient experienced 2 episodes of pneumonitis before progressing (Fig. 3). No patients experienced recurrent pneumonitis in the absence of ICI rechallenge.

Radiation recall pneumonitis

Radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) is a rare reaction occurring in previously irradiated pulmonary tissue following exposure to 'triggering agents' (Fig. 6), where areas of pneumonitis, characterized by consolidation or GGOs, are limited to the prior field(s) of radiation. RRP has been observed following radiation and treatment with the ADC T-DXd, the anti-PD-1 drugs nivolumab and sintilimab, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs, and various classes of chemotherapeutic agents. A retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients with advanced non-small lung cancer who had received EGFR-TKIs within 5 years of radiotherapy and found that the RRP pattern was present in 6/20 (30.0%) patients who developed SACT-related ILD. A Japanese nationwide post-marketing surveillance study found that, among 130 cases adjudicated as T-DXd-related ILD/pneumonitis in patients with breast and gastric cancer, 3/130 (2.3%) cases had 'other' imaging patterns, including RRP pattern, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema pattern and cases where a definitive diagnosis of ILD/pneumonitis could not be made because of very light shadows.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1129oQWf]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids and biologics — pneumonia risk is dose dependent in steroid-treated patients, with increased risk generally occurring when exposed to at least 20 mg equivalent of prednisone daily for more than 2–4 weeks; lower doses (i.e., 10 mg/d) taken for prolonged periods can also confer an increased risk, and the infectious spectrum includes Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, and typical causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Blockade of TNFα increases susceptibility to tuberculosis, IL-6 inhibitors and JAK kinase inhibitors have been associated with higher TB risk, other cytokine blockers (anti–IL-12/IL-23, anti–IL-23, anti–IL-17) carry TB warnings but an elevated TB risk has not been demonstrated to date, and additional risk accrues with diabetes, cigarette smoking, advanced age, and concomitant immunosuppressants.

### Organizing pneumonia: the many morphological faces [^1156wC4g]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Organizing pneumonia is a non-specific response to various forms of lung injury and is the pathological hallmark of the distinct clinical entity termed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The typical imaging features of this syndrome have been widely documented and consist of patchy air-space consolidation, often subpleural, with or without ground-glass opacities. The purpose of this article is to highlight the less familiar imaging patterns of organizing pneumonia which include focal organizing pneumonia, a variety of nodular patterns, a bronchocentric distribution, band-like opacities, a perilobular pattern and a progressive fibrotic form of organizing pneumonia.

### Barium sulfate (varibar thin honey) [^112MWpTj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number
of excipients, including natural and artificial flavors and may induce
serious hypersensitivity reactions. The manifestations include hypotension,
bronchospasm and other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions
including rashes, urticaria and itching. A history of bronchial asthma,
atopy, food allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent
may increase the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment
and trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment
of a hypersensitivity reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal Barium Leakage

The use of VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated
in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see
Contraindications (4)]. Administration
of VARIBAR THIN HONEY may result in leakage of barium from the GI
tract in the presence of conditions such as carcinomas, GI fistula,
inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis,
or diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level
of the GI tract, especially if it is distal to the stomach. The barium
leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate
may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing
obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated
barium associated with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis,
bowel obstruction, or rarely perforation. Patients with the following
conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths:
severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility,
electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking
medications that delay GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients
with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the
risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain
adequate hydration after the barium sulfate procedure.

5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis

The use of VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated
in patients with trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications
(4)]. Oral administration
of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in
patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing
mechanism. Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate
may lead to aspiration pneumonitis.

In patients at risk for aspiration, begin
the procedure with a small ingested volume of VARIBAR THIN HONEY.
Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration
of VARIBAR THIN HONEY if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for
development of aspiration pneumonitis.

### Anti-VEGF antibody protects against alveolar exudate leakage caused by vascular hyperpermeability, resulting in mitigation of pneumonitis induced by immunotherapy [^114NNLvB]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Immune-related pneumonitis is an important toxicity associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, often necessitating discontinuation of treatment. Development of methods to mitigate checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis is required. The contributions of PD-L1, PD-L2, and VEGF to the pathogenesis of pneumonitis were examined in an IL2- plus IL18-induced mouse pneumonitis model (IL pneumonitis model). Furthermore, the incidences of pneumonitis were retrospectively examined in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with the anti-PD-L1 mAb atezolizumab plus chemotherapy, with or without the anti-VEGF mAb bevacizumab, in the phase III IMpower150 trial. PD-1 signal blockade by anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 antibodies aggravated pneumonitis in the IL pneumonitis model. An anti-VEGF antibody prevented PD-1 signal blockade from aggravating pneumonitis in this model. PD-1 signal blockade induced interstitial T-cell infiltration in the lungs, but VEGF blockade did not affect this T-cell infiltration. The anti-VEGF antibody protected against vascular-to-alveolar leakage of protein and fluid due to PD-1 signal blockade in a murine model. In the IMpower150 trial, incidence rates of pneumonitis of any grade were 4.3% in the group without bevacizumab and 2.8% in the group with bevacizumab. In patients with pneumonitis, outcomes of "Not recovered/Not resolved" were reported for 29.4% in the group without bevacizumab compared with 9.1% in the group with bevacizumab. Our findings suggest that anti-VEGF antibodies in combination with checkpoint inhibitors may be a treatment method that can control checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis.

5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis

RYBREVANT can cause severe and fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis.

RYBREVANT with Lazertinib

In MARIPOSA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib, including Grade 3 in 1% and Grade 4 in 0.2% of patients. There was one fatal case of ILD/pneumonitis and 2.9% of patients permanently discontinued RYBREVANT and lazertinib due to ILD/pneumonitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

RYBREVANT with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed

Based on the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2.1% treated with RYBREVANT in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed with 1.8% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. 2.1% discontinued RYBREVANT due to ILD/pneumonitis.

RYBREVANT as a Single Agent

In CHRYSALIS, [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT as a single agent, with 0.7% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) permanently discontinued RYBREVANT due to ILD/pneumonitis.

Monitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.2 Severe Neuropathy

Sensory neuropathy is dose- and schedule-dependent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If ≥ Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, withhold ABRAXANE treatment until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 for metastatic breast cancer or until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 for NSCLC and pancreatic cancer followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of ABRAXANE [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.3	Sepsis

Sepsis occurred in 5% of patients with or without neutropenia who received ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine. Biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent were risk factors for severe or fatal sepsis. If a patient becomes febrile (regardless of ANC) initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4	Pneumonitis

Pneumonitis, including some cases that were fatal, occurred in 4% of patients receiving ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine during evaluation of suspected pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with ABRAXANE and gemcitabine.

5.5 Severe Hypersensitivity

Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported. Do not rechallenge patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE with this drug [see Contraindications (4)].

Cross-hypersensitivity between ABRAXANE and other taxane products has been reported and may include severe reactions such as anaphylaxis. Closely monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to other taxanes during initiation of ABRAXANE therapy.
