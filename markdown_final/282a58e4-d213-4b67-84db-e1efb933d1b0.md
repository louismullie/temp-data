## Question

lab monitoring for noac

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laboratory monitoring of NOACs/DOACs: when not to test, when to test, which assays to order, how to interpret results, and how to integrate organ function and systems-level safeguards. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that routine pharmacodynamic monitoring is not required. Then, I should differentiate clinical monitoring from pharmacologic testing. Next, I will identify the special scenarios where drug-effect assessment is justified, choose the right assay by drug, interpret results within clinical context, consider reversal strategies, and ensure renal/hepatic surveillance. Finally, I will address point-of-care testing limits, system-level management, documentation, and summarize a practical algorithm to guide decisions.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't overcall testing. DOACs were explicitly designed for fixed dosing without routine laboratory dose-adjustment because of predictable PK/PD, wide therapeutic indices, and trial-proven efficacy with lower life-threatening bleeding versus VKAs, so default practice is no routine drug-level monitoring for apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban unless a specific clinical trigger arises [^1155dUxX] [^115bHMvq] [^114Cu5Ue] [^113QqZGj].

> Wait, let me verify the difference between "no routine monitoring" and "no monitoring at all". Clinical monitoring is mandatory: baseline CBC, hepatic panel, and serum creatinine/eGFR, then reassessment at 1–3 months after initiation and every 6–12 months, with more frequent checks in higher-risk patients, plus visits focused on adherence, interactions, intercurrent illness, and bleeding/thrombotic symptoms; this is not optional even if pharmacologic monitoring is deferred [^113njy2S] [^113QqZGj].

> Next, I should review when measuring anticoagulant effect is justified, because we should not jump to conclusions that drug-level testing is never useful. I need to check for major bleeding, emergent or urgent surgery/procedures, suspected accumulation from renal or hepatic impairment, extremes of body weight or altered absorption, suspected nonadherence, significant drug–drug interactions (notably P‑gp/CYP3A4 modulators), thrombosis on therapy, unknown timing of last dose before procedures, or overdose; in these settings, measuring anticoagulant effect can inform reversal, peri-procedural timing, or safety of interventions [^112psHL9] [^112Fp2To] [^116pTTH9].

> Hold on, I should verify assay selection by drug, because relying on PT/INR or aPTT can be dangerously misleading. PT/INR and aPTT are not reliable surrogates for DOAC activity across agents; dabigatran may show near-normal INR at therapeutic levels, and FXa inhibitors produce variable, reagent-dependent PT effects, so global tests cannot be used for quantitative assessment or precise clinical decisions [^1136kfi4] [^116w9xNv]. I initially thought "avoid standard TT due to insensitivity" for dabigatran — wait, that's backwards; standard thrombin time is actually too sensitive and not linear, so the recommended tests for dabigatran are dilute thrombin time or ecarin-based assays, which correlate linearly with drug concentration and better support decision-making [^112Fp2To] [^111WocP4].

> Let me now match FXa inhibitors to the right method. For rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, calibrated chromogenic anti‑Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators provide linear relationships across clinically relevant ranges; PT may provide only a qualitative suggestion for rivaroxaban exposure when anti‑Xa is unavailable, and apixaban in particular correlates poorly with PT/INR, so I should avoid using PT to "rule out" apixaban effect [^112Fp2To] [^111WocP4] [^1145HRZB] [^113fsTi6].

> I should double-check how to interpret results, because unlike warfarin there are no validated therapeutic targets for ongoing dose titration. Interpretation is contextual — based on timing of last dose, renal/hepatic function, bleeding risk of the procedure, and urgency; a commonly cited "safe-for-procedure" threshold is a drug level below about 30 ng/mL for low bleeding-risk procedures, but sensitivity/specificity around this threshold vary by assay and drug, with particular caution for apixaban misclassification near 30 ng/mL, so results must be integrated with clinical judgment [^113fsTi6] [^116gToSn] [^112Fp2To]. Let me also verify reversal implications: idarucizumab is specific for dabigatran, while andexanet alfa is available for apixaban/rivaroxaban; levels can help avoid unnecessary reversal, yet radiologic and clinical severity often drive reversal decisions more than a number alone, and observational data show drug-level availability can avert reversal in about half of urgent cases [^116pTTH9] [^114zopEs].

> Now, I need to ensure organ function surveillance is embedded since clearance is organ-dependent. Renal function must be monitored at least annually for all, and every 3–6 months if eGFR is 30–60 mL/min, in patients over 75, on nephrotoxic agents, or with unstable renal function; dabigatran has the highest renal clearance and is particularly sensitive to GFR changes, and Cockcroft–Gault should guide dose criteria used in PI and trials [^1132Atef] [^112EPnKr]. I should confirm hepatic considerations too: baseline hepatic assessment and Child–Pugh classification are required, apixaban and rivaroxaban rely more heavily on hepatic metabolism, and all DOACs are contraindicated in severe hepatic disease, so agent selection and follow-up labs must reflect that biology [^111PcRDm].

> But wait, what if only a bedside test is available in an emergency. Point-of-care testing can offer rough triage information but has important limitations: ACT‑LR correlates moderately with dabigatran and may identify very low or very high levels, POC INR may help exclude high rivaroxaban levels, and there is no reliable POC approach for apixaban; these tools should only be used when lab assays are unavailable and interpreted with extreme caution [^1145HRZB].

> Next, I should review the systems-level layer so we don't miss preventable errors. Anticoagulation Management Services can optimize agent selection, dose appropriateness, interaction screening, peri-procedural planning, adherence support, and transitions, addressing safety concerns highlighted by regulators; importantly, access to calibrated assays and reversal agents, coupled with context-aware protocols, reduces unnecessary reversal and improves timing of procedures [^113QqZGj] [^1138h2jj] [^114zopEs].

> I will now examine documentation standards, because clear reasoning supports safe care and future decisions. For each testing episode, I should record the clinical indication for testing, the specific assay and rationale, the timing of the last dose, renal/hepatic function, the interpreted result in context, and the action taken (reversal, delay or proceed with procedure, dose hold, or observation), along with a plan for ongoing renal/hepatic and adherence monitoring at follow-up [^113njy2S] [^114pDwJ3].

> Hold on, I should tie this together into a concise algorithm without losing the nuance. Default to clinical monitoring alone for stable patients on standard regimens; if a special scenario arises — bleeding, urgent procedures, suspected accumulation, extremes of weight, interactions, absorption concerns, or thrombosis on therapy — use dilute TT or ecarin-based testing for dabigatran and calibrated anti‑Xa for the FXa inhibitors, avoid relying on PT/INR or aPTT for quantitative decisions, and interpret levels against timing and organ function while prioritizing clinical urgency and radiologic findings for reversal decisions [^112Fp2To] [^111WocP4] [^1136kfi4].

> Final clinical pearl: Let me reconsider the phrase "no monitoring" — it refers to the absence of routine pharmacodynamic dose-adjustment, not a prohibition on labs; a strategic, indication-based testing paradigm paired with robust clinical surveillance and system supports is the safest approach, and harmonized access to calibrated assays and clear labeling will continue to refine practice [^112qMxuu] [^112xxa2M] [^113QqZGj].

Routine coagulation monitoring is not required for NOACs due to their predictable pharmacokinetics [^1155dUxX], but **renal function monitoring** is essential at baseline, annually, and more frequently in patients with CKD, elderly, or those on interacting drugs [^1132Atef] [^112EPnKr]. Liver function monitoring is recommended at baseline and periodically, especially in **hepatic impairment** [^111PcRDm] [^113njy2S]. In emergencies (bleeding, urgent surgery, suspected overdose, or adherence issues), use **drug-specific assays**, such as dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, and calibrated anti-Xa assays for factor Xa inhibitors [^112Fp2To] [^115oAxxK] [^112psHL9]. Routine PT/INR or aPTT are unreliable for NOACs [^111WocP4] and should not guide management [^1136kfi4]. Regular clinical assessment for bleeding, thromboembolism, and adherence is necessary, with more frequent monitoring in high-risk patients [^113QqZGj] [^1132Atef].

## Routine laboratory monitoring

- **Renal function monitoring**: Essential at baseline, annually, and more frequently in patients with CKD [^112EPnKr], elderly, or those on interacting medications [^1132Atef] [^1155dUxX] [^112psHL9].

- **Liver function monitoring**: Recommended at baseline [^1132Atef] and periodically [^113njy2S], especially in patients with hepatic impairment [^111PcRDm].

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular evaluation for bleeding, thromboembolic events, and adherence is necessary [^113QqZGj] [^1132Atef].

---

## Situations requiring laboratory assessment

Although routine monitoring is unnecessary, **specific clinical scenarios** require laboratory assessment:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended laboratory tests** |
|-|-|
| Major bleeding or urgent surgery | - Dabigatran: Dilute thrombin time (dTT) or ecarin clotting time (ECT) [^112Fp2To] <br/> - Factor Xa inhibitors: Calibrated anti-Xa assays [^115oAxxK] [^114zopEs] |
| Suspected overdose or non-adherence | - Dabigatran: dTT or ECT [^112psHL9] <br/> - Factor Xa inhibitors: Calibrated anti-Xa assays [^112Fp2To] |
| Renal or hepatic impairment | - Renal function tests (serum creatinine, eGFR) [^1132Atef] [^112EPnKr] <br/> - Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) [^111PcRDm] |
| Extremes of body weight | - Drug-specific assays (dTT, ECT, anti-Xa) [^113W9hEp] [^111tAtEU] [^112psHL9] |
| Suspected drug interactions | - Drug-specific assays (dTT, ECT, anti-Xa) [^116m3Ji8] [^112psHL9] |

## Limitations of standard coagulation tests

Standard coagulation tests such as PT/INR and aPTT are **unreliable for NOACs** [^115cTzmA]. PT/INR is **insensitive to dabigatran** [^111WocP4] and **variably affected by factor Xa inhibitors**, which can yield misleading results [^1136kfi4]. aPTT is also **variably affected by NOACs** [^115oAxxK] and is **not reliable for quantifying anticoagulant effect** [^1136kfi4].

---

## Recommended frequency of monitoring

- **Renal function**: At baseline, annually, and more frequently in patients with CKD, elderly, or those on interacting medications [^112EPnKr] [^1132Atef].

- **Liver function**: At baseline and periodically, especially in patients with hepatic impairment [^111PcRDm] [^113njy2S].

- **Clinical assessment**: Regularly, with increased frequency in high-risk patients [^113QqZGj] [^1132Atef].

---

## Clinical implications of inadequate monitoring

Inadequate monitoring can have **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Particularly in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly, or those on interacting medications [^1155dUxX] [^116m3Ji8] [^1132Atef].

- **Increased thromboembolic risk**: Due to non-adherence, underdosing, or drug interactions [^1138h2jj] [^113QqZGj] [^1132Atef].

- **Delayed detection of adverse events**: Such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, leading to complications [^113njy2S] [^1132Atef].

---

## Summary of laboratory monitoring recommendations

| **Parameter** | **Routine monitoring** | **Situational monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Renal function | Baseline, annually, more frequent in CKD/elderly/interacting drugs [^112EPnKr] [^1132Atef] | ∅ |
| Liver function | Baseline, periodic [^111PcRDm] [^113njy2S] | ∅ |
| Clinical assessment | Regularly, more frequent in high-risk patients [^113QqZGj] [^1132Atef] | ∅ |
| Drug-specific assays | Not routine [^1155dUxX] | Major bleeding, urgent surgery, overdose, non-adherence, renal/hepatic impairment, extremes of body weight, drug interactions [^112Fp2To] [^115oAxxK] |

---

NOACs **do not require routine coagulation monitoring** [^1155dUxX], but regular renal and liver function tests and clinical assessments are essential [^1132Atef]. Drug-specific assays are reserved for specific clinical scenarios [^112Fp2To], and standard coagulation tests are unreliable for NOACs [^111WocP4].

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^1136kfi4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

INR tests give misleading results with NOACs. Dabigatran inhibits coagulation by directly and specifically binding thrombin (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban directly bind FXa. These modes of action differ from that of warfarin, rendering the results of PT/INR tests unreliable in patients treated with the newer agents.

The INR is relatively insensitive to dabigatran-induced anticoagulation, yielding normal or near-normal results at therapeutic dabigatran plasma concentrations and only slight increases at higher drug levels. INR testing with point-of-care devices in dabigatran-treated patients is similarly unreliable. The FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have been reported to produce variable results with PT tests, which are relatively insensitive to FXa inhibitor-induced changes in coagulation. Therefore, for a patient treated with dabigatran, the PT will not provide valid information and could erroneously suggest that the patient's coagulation status is normal or near-normal.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1132Atef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Comorbidities affecting DOAC pharmacokinetics are crucial considerations. Patient-specific comorbidities, particularly those affecting systemic exposure to medication, must be considered when managing patients on DOAC therapy. These comorbidities can alter DOAC elimination rates, thereby increasing the risk of thromboembolic or bleeding events. Among the many factors to consider, the three most pertinent patient comorbidities are renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and extreme body weights.

- **Renal insufficiency**: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events. Historically, warfarin has been the preferred anticoagulant for severe CKD, but robust data supporting its efficacy and safety are lacking. This is coupled with concerns about warfarin-induced vascular calcifications and worsening nephropathy, leading to the pursuit of more appropriate alternatives. However, the presence of coexisting renal impairment can often lead to uncertainty in selecting the best DOAC. DOAC therapies are eliminated by the kidneys to varying degrees, and alterations in renal clearance must be considered when dosing these agents. Dabigatran is the most renally eliminated, accounting for 80% of its clearance pathway, followed by edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and betrixaban: 50%, 35%, 27%, and 11%, respectively. Any clinical decisions regarding the treatment of patients with DOACs require an assessment of renal function, which should be monitored frequently, at least annually, or more frequently for patients with additional risk factors.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112psHL9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

An important advantage of DOACs over warfarin is that there is no need for regular pharmacodynamic monitoring. However, in certain clinical situations, the use of an anti-IIa assay for dabigatran or an anti-Xa assay calibrated for factor Xa-inhibitors may be required. These clinical situations include the occurrence of major bleeding; the need for emergent surgery; concerns about drug absorption or adherence; concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers; morbid obesity; and patients with advanced CKD. A detailed description of anticoagulant reversal is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: A systematic review [^112Fp2To]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or non-cancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

- **Results**: We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.67–0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.78–1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Conclusions**: An ideal test offering both accuracy and precision for measurement of any DOAC is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^1159t5FB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Prescribing information (PIs) from other regulatory agencies includes significantly more data, which can assist clinicians and laboratories in managing their patients. Nevertheless, there is currently no evidence that clinicians in these countries provide better patient management based on the availability of this information, nor that these measurements lead to improved patient outcomes. Conducting a survey comparing practices across different global regions could offer more insight into how the region-specific PIs and the availability of methods for DOAC testing impact patient management.

### Novel oral anticoagulants: Efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used of the vitamin K antagonists, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality secondary to bleeding as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In recent years, a number of competing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed, each of which aspires to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating therapeutic monitoring requirements. At present, one oral direct thrombin inhibitor and two direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

In this paper, we compare the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs. Additionally, we discuss various laboratory assays that may be useful to measure these drugs in certain clinical circumstances. Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency. The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and the management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### The laboratory's 2015 perspective on direct oral anticoagulant testing [^1173KaLd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The introduction of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy into clinical use in the past five years has had a significant impact on the clinical laboratory. Clinicians' desire to determine plasma drug presence or measure drug concentration, along with more recent observations regarding the limitations and utility of coagulation testing in the context of DOAC treatment, suggests that early published recommendations regarding laboratory testing should be reassessed. These initial recommendations were often based on drug-spiked plasma studies rather than samples from patients receiving DOAC therapy.

We have demonstrated that reagent sensitivity varies significantly depending upon whether drug-spiked samples or samples from DOAC-treated patients are tested. Data from drug-enriched samples must therefore be interpreted with caution or used as a guide only.

- **Recommended laboratory assays**: We present laboratory assays that can be used to determine drug presence and measure drug concentration, and provide recommended testing algorithms.

- **Effects on specialty coagulation assays**: As DOAC therapy may significantly impact specialty coagulation assays, we review those tests with the potential to give false-positive and false-negative results.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114hty2c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have quickly gained popularity as an alternative anticoagulation strategy, surpassing vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) as first-line agents due to improved clinical outcomes, simplicity of dosing, lack of monitoring requirements, and an expanding indication list. All DOACs are currently branded medications; therefore, cost remains a significant barrier to access. Apixaban was granted generic approval at the end of 2019, but product availability is likely not expected for several more years. The cost and generic status of other DOACs remain unknown. While DOACs are substantially more expensive than VKAs, laboratory monitoring costs are reduced since INR monitoring is not required.

US cost analyses have shown that apixaban has the highest quality-adjusted life year for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients, followed by dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and the lowest being warfarin. A recent study demonstrated that dabigatran was associated with lower all-cause costs and healthcare resource use compared with rivaroxaban while having similar all-cause costs and hospitalizations compared with apixaban. However, it exhibited higher outpatient and pharmacy healthcare resource use.

In the United States, commercially insured patients are eligible for time-limited programs to reduce out-of-pocket expenses using manufacturer copayment cards, with most limiting patient costs to $10 or less per month. Federally funded patients (Medicare, Medicaid, etc) are ineligible for these programs. Despite the cost, there was a dramatic increase in the use of DOACs for NVAF from 2010 to 2017.

### Role of the anticoagulant monitoring service in 2018: Beyond warfarin [^1138h2jj]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have a wide therapeutic index, few drug interactions, no dietary interactions, and do not require dose adjustment according to the results of routine coagulation testing. Despite these advantages over warfarin, the DOACs remain high-risk medications. Evidence indicates that non-adherence, off-label dosing, and inadequate care transitions during DOAC therapy increase the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Although DOACs are approved for a growing number of indications, some patient populations are not ideal candidates.

Existing expertise within an Anticoagulation Management Service (AMS) should be leveraged to optimize all anticoagulant therapies, including the DOACs. The AMS can facilitate initial drug therapy selection and dose management, reinforce patient education and adherence, as well as manage drug interactions and invasive procedures. In the event that a transition to warfarin is warranted, the AMS is already engaged, which limits the risk of fragmented patient care and ensures that therapeutic anticoagulation is re-established promptly. The AMS of the future will provide comprehensive management for all patients receiving anticoagulant medications and continue to offer anticoagulation expertise to the healthcare team.

### Is there a role for the laboratory monitoring in the management of specific antidotes of direct oral anticoagulants [^116pTTH9]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Given the growing number of patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the need for rapid neutralization is also increasing in cases of major bleeding or urgent surgery/procedures. Idarucizumab is marketed as a specific antidote to dabigatran, while andexanet alfa has gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as an antidote for oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors. Other antidotes or hemostatic agents are still under preclinical or clinical development, with ciraparantag being the most advanced.

DOAC plasma levels measurement allows for the appropriate selection of patients for antidote administration and may prevent unnecessary prescription of expensive molecules in some acute clinical settings. However, these tests might be inconclusive after the administration of certain antidotes, such as andexanet alfa and ciraparantag. The benefit of laboratory monitoring following DOAC reversal remains unclear. Here, we sought to provide an overview of key studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of DOAC reversal using the most developed/commercialized specific antidotes. We discuss the potential role of laboratory monitoring in managing patients receiving DOAC-specific antidotes and highlight areas that deserve further investigation to establish the exact role of laboratory monitoring in the appropriate management of DOAC-specific antidotes.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^113fsTi6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

During treatment with direct oral anticoagulants, coagulation assessment is required before thrombolysis and surgery, and if anticoagulation reversal is evaluated. Limited data support the accuracy of specific coagulation assays around the safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

- **Methods and results**: In 481 samples obtained from 96 patients enrolled at a single center, concentrations were measured using the Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay, Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay, or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran. For factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban), a chromogenic anti-Xa assay and ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry were used as reference methods. All dabigatran-specific assays had high sensitivity to concentrations > 30 ng/mL, but specificity was lower for the Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay (78.2%) compared to the Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay (98.9%) and ecarin clotting time (94.6%). The assays provided high sensitivity and specificity for rivaroxaban, but low sensitivity for apixaban (73.8%; concentrations up to 82 ng/mL were misclassified as < 30 ng/mL). If no specific calibration is available, results two-fold above the upper limit of normal indicate relevant rivaroxaban concentrations. For apixaban, all elevated results should raise suspicion of relevant anticoagulation.

- **Conclusions**: Specific tests differ considerably in diagnostic performance for concentrations close to the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold. Compared with the Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay and ecarin clotting time, the limited specificity of Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay should be noted.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112qMxuu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Specific to this manuscript is the question of why or when a laboratory should consider providing services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that do not require routine monitoring. For decades, we have monitored unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions, with dose adjustments based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and, in some institutions, the anti-FXa activity. Likewise, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States and longer elsewhere. Adjustment of daily VKA dose was primarily based on the patient's INR result, with dietary intake and other factors also considered.

When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use in 1993 in the United States, the drug prescribing information indicated, "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, notably, more recent enoxaparin labeling includes pharmacokinetic (drug level) data, and subsequent iterations suggest that monitoring of anti-FXa may be warranted in certain populations, including those with renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation became available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today, the clinical laboratory is faced with a familiar dilemma with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising a direct thrombin inhibitor, dab.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111PcRDm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with hepatic impairment, similar to other disease states, are at an increased risk of bleeding complications and thrombotic events. Alterations in hepatic function affect DOAC biotransformation to varying extents. Apixaban relies most heavily on hepatic metabolism for drug elimination, accounting for 75% of its elimination pathway, followed by rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, and betrixaban: 65%, 50%, 20%, and up to 18%, respectively. Rivaroxaban and apixaban require cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes for metabolism, while dabigatran and edoxaban require no to minimal CYP metabolism. Betrixaban exhibits minimal hepatic elimination and is neither metabolized by CYP enzymes nor does it induce or inhibit CYP activity.

As there is no optimal monitoring parameter to ensure safety, patients with hepatic dysfunction may not be ideal candidates for these agents. Restrictions for DOAC use in hepatic impairment are based on the Child-Pugh classification system and exclusion criteria applied in pivotal trials. The Child-Pugh score uses clinical and biochemical abnormalities to assess the severity of hepatic dysfunction. All DOACs are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic disease, for whom warfarin is the only recommended anticoagulant. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban are viable options and do not require dose adjustments. All DOACs could be considered in patients with mild hepatic impairment.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: Evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Currently licensed direct oral anticoagulants selectively target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (e.g. apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed to be administered in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists. In randomized controlled trials involving approximately 250,000 patients, they were at least as effective for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding.

The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications because of their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost.

Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. This paper reviews the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarizes the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explores key unresolved issues. Future perspectives for the development and application of these medications are also briefly discussed.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: How do these drugs work, how to monitor, and what is their role in orthopaedic surgery [^115bHMvq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative venous thromboembolism is a major adverse event associated with orthopaedic surgery. With the addition of perioperative anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, the rates of symptomatic venous thromboembolism have dropped to 1% to 3%. Therefore, practicing orthopaedic surgeons must be familiar with these medications, including aspirin, heparin, and warfarin, as well as the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

DOACs are increasingly being prescribed due to their predictable pharmacokinetics and increased convenience, as they do not require routine monitoring. Currently, 1% to 2% of the general population is anticoagulated. Although the introduction of DOACs has provided additional treatment options, it has also led to confusion and uncertainty regarding treatment, specialized testing, and the appropriate use of reversal agents.

This article provides a basic overview of DOAC medications, their suggested use in the perioperative setting, effects on laboratory testing, and considerations for when and how to use reversal agents in orthopaedic patients.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^111tAtEU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases and are administered in fixed-dose regimens. Although their safety and efficacy profiles are considered optimal, clinical events still occur. Given that anticoagulation treatment is a delicate balance between clotting and bleeding, it is possible that an optimal target spot exists where anticoagulation achieves both the lowest possible risks of bleeding and thrombosis. Other currently available anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists and heparins, provide important clues for this potential target spot. If such a target exists, tailored DOAC therapy may further benefit patients.

This opinion article summarizes the available evidence suggesting that such a tailored strategy could be effective. It also outlines research suggestions for conducting studies in patient populations, such as those with extremes of body weight or impaired kidney function, to evaluate whether tailored treatment with DOACs could lead to improved patient outcomes.

### Point of care testing (POCT) to assess drug concentration in patients treated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) [^1145HRZB]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require routine laboratory monitoring; however, the measurement of drug concentration is crucial in emergency situations. Specific laboratory tests are not readily available or implemented in every hospital. Point-of-care tests (POCT) may bridge this gap and serve as a bedside solution.

- **Objectives**: Feasibility of POCT to assess plasma levels of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

- **Patients/Methods**: Activated Coagulation Time-Low Range (ACT-LR) using a portable Hemochron Signature Elite for dabigatran and prothrombin time (expressed as INR) by Coaguchek XS Pro for rivaroxaban and apixaban were obtained at trough and peak in 136 consecutive patients taking NOACs (70 on dabigatran, 45 on rivaroxaban, and 20 on apixaban). Using a paired study design, drug concentrations were concurrently determined by functional specific tests.

- **Results and conclusions**: The correlation between NOAC concentrations and the values obtained using the POCTs was high for dabigatran (r = 0.80) and rivaroxaban (r = 0.82), and low for apixaban (r = 0.21). ACT-LR ≤ 188 seconds better detected dabigatran levels ≤ 50 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 84.1%. ACT-LR values > 217 seconds better discriminated values of dabigatran > 200 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 81.4%. INR Coaguchek values ≤ 1.2 better identified patients with rivaroxaban values < 100 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 88.5%. This analysis was not possible for apixaban.

- **Conclusion**: In emergency situations, POC

### Shifting the paradigm: A population health approach to the management of direct oral anticoagulants [^113QqZGj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Until a decade ago, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin enjoyed nearly 60 years of market exclusivity as the only available oral anticoagulants. With their variable dosing, narrow therapeutic window, frequent laboratory monitoring, and a plethora of endogenous and exogenous factors impacting the quality of therapy, VKAs have represented a significant therapeutic challenge, requiring substantial resources to manage. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) first appeared on the US market in 2010 and have reshaped the anticoagulation landscape. With fixed dosing, predictable pharmacokinetics, and no intensive therapeutic monitoring requirement, DOACs are generally considered safer and more convenient than VKAs.

Despite these advantages, DOACs are still associated with inappropriate prescribing and adverse events, resulting in a concerted effort from regulatory agencies to improve anticoagulation safety. The Joint Commission recently highlighted the need for DOAC vigilance via "Sentinel Event Alert 61" as well as updated National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) to "reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy". These safety concerns highlight that while DOACs do not require monitoring in the traditional sense (i.e. frequent scheduled one-on-one interactions between anticoagulation care providers and individual patients), there is an increasing need for oversight. This increased demand presents a unique challenge for anticoagulation programs.

### Measurement of the new anticoagulants [^116dg1h1]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are administered at fixed daily doses without laboratory dose adjustment for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following elective total knee and hip replacement, for the treatment and prevention of recurrent events of acute venous thromboembolism, and for the prevention of embolic events in atrial fibrillation. However, it may be necessary to determine the anticoagulant effect of new oral anticoagulants in special patient populations, such as the elderly, those with renal impairment, before operations, during bleeding or thrombotic episodes, and to monitor self-compliance.

Oral factor Xa and oral thrombin inhibitors influence dose-dependently global and specific coagulation assays. Standardization of assays is currently underway. Determination of the new oral anticoagulants in serum samples would facilitate blood sampling and analysis from samples taken and stored for creatinine or other biochemical parameters. Point-of-care methods from plasma or urine for the new oral anticoagulants would improve patient care. Initial data demonstrate the feasibility of such assays in urine.

### New oral anticoagulants: A view from the laboratory [^1174MV8J]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacological, biochemical, and clinical features distinct from those of warfarin. Focusing on laboratory perspectives, this article compares and contrasts the pharmacological and biochemical properties of the new oral anticoagulants with those of warfarin and uses this information to speculate on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the clinical features that differentiate the new agents from warfarin.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Cu5Ue]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Use of vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, is characterized by frequent clinic visits for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy. This process, along with heparin use for bridging and the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions requiring dose adjustments, makes the use of warfarin cumbersome and can lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown the equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, few specific guidelines are available to guide physicians about the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs, through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing the overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, the risk of fatal GIB. In addition, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

### Laboratory monitoring of new anticoagulants [^111XkbFm]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Maintaining a balance between bleeding and clotting has always been a challenge in treating coagulation disorders. A perturbation in that balance can be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. As a result, anticoagulant monitoring is extremely important, and inappropriate testing may lead to complications. There are now a variety of new anticoagulant drugs in clinical use including several direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), such as argatroban, bivalirudin, and hirudin, as well as a Factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux.

There are pitfalls associated with some of the currently used laboratory monitoring tests, and newer alternative laboratory monitoring tests have been investigated. In addition, laboratory testing can assist with transitioning patients from DTI to warfarin therapy.

### Practical aspects of the oral new anticoagulants [^111bSqFZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

After years of relying solely on oral vitamin K antagonists, many new antithrombotic agents are now being developed and entering the marketplace. This review analyzes clinical trial results for these new agents, especially focusing on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. The practical aspects of using these new agents, such as monitoring, reversal strategies, and use before medical procedures, are also discussed.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^112upCeZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

We studied samples obtained in two prospective observational trials with blinded outcome assessment (Clinical Trial Registration Information: unique identifiers NCT02371044 and NCT02371070). Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Tübingen University Hospital (protocol‐no 259/2013BO1 and 270/2015B01). The studies were performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment. ME and SP had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis. The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online data supplements.

- **Setting and eligibility criteria**: The studies were conducted at the Department of Neurology & Stroke and the Department of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine of Tübingen University Hospital, a tertiary care facility, between July 2013 and November 2015. Patients were enrolled who were receiving first doses of apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran. Exclusion criteria were known coagulopathy, abnormal coagulation at baseline (Quick 37 seconds), intake of vitamin K antagonist or NOAC within 14 days, low-molecular-weight heparins within 24 hours, or unfractionated heparin within 12 hours before DOAC intake. Use of antiplatelet agents was permitted. Predominantly low dabigatran concentrations in these samples required inclusion of additional samples from patients on maintenance therapy.

### One-year retrospective analysis of anti-FXa apixaban and rivaroxaban levels demonstrates utility for management decisions in various urgent and nonurgent clinical situations [^114zopEs]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

Quantification of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plasma levels can guide clinical management, but insight into clinical scenarios surrounding DOAC-calibrated anti-FXa assays is limited.

- **Methods**: Apixaban- and rivaroxaban-calibrated chromogenic anti-Xa assays performed over a 1-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Patient demographics, DOAC history, concomitant medications, and renal/liver comorbidities were obtained. Indications for testing and associated clinical actions were reviewed. Machine learning (ML) models predicting clinical actions were evaluated.

- **Results**: In total, 371 anti-FXa apixaban and 89 anti-FXa rivaroxaban tests were performed for 259 and 67 patients in recurring urgent (acute bleeding, unplanned procedures) and nonurgent situations, including several scenarios not captured by existing testing recommendations (e.g. drug monitoring, reThromboembolic events, bleeding tendency). In urgent settings, andexanet reversal was guided by radiologic and clinical findings over DOAC levels in 14 of 32 instances, while 51% of apixaban patients qualified for nonreversal strategies through the availability of levels. Levels also informed procedure/intervention timing and supported management decisions when DOAC clearance or DOAC target levels were in question. The importance of clinical context was emphasized by exploratory ML models predicting particular clinical actions.

- **Conclusions**: Although clinical situations are complex, DOAC testing facilitates clinical decision-making, including reversal, justifying more widespread implementation of testing practices.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of the next generation of oral anticoagulants [^115cTzmA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

In contrast to vitamin K antagonists, which reduce the functional levels of several coagulation factors, the new oral anticoagulants specifically target either thrombin or factor Xa. These new agents have such predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that routine coagulation monitoring is unnecessary. However, there are still some situations in which measurement of anticoagulant effect may be required. The coagulation assays that are used to monitor heparin derivatives or vitamin K antagonists may not always accurately reflect the anticoagulant activity of the new oral anticoagulants, and specialized assays may be needed.

- **Situations for assessment**: Identify situations in which assessment of anticoagulant effect may aid treatment decisions.
- **Effects on tests**: Describe the effects of the new oral anticoagulants on the various coagulation tests.
- **Specialized assays**: Review the specialized coagulation assays that have been developed to measure the anticoagulant effects of the new oral anticoagulants.
- **Clinical perspective**: Provide a clinical perspective on the role of coagulation testing in the clinical management of patients treated with the new oral anticoagulants.

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: No need for pharmacogenomics [^1111SqC1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have well-established efficacy data but present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It was hoped that integrating pharmacogenomic data with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

### Is there a role for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-guided dosing for novel oral anticoagulants [^115zT2yG]. American Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

The novel direct oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in oral anticoagulant therapy and are replacing vitamin K antagonists as the preferred options for many indications. Given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring, they have been shown to be at least as effective in reducing thromboembolic stroke as dose-adjusted warfarin in phase 3 randomized trials and are less likely to cause hemorrhagic stroke. Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic subanalyses of the major NOAC trials in patients with atrial fibrillation have established relationships between clinical characteristics, drug levels, and/or pharmacodynamic responses with both efficacy and safety.

Based on these analyses, pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulatory authorities have provided contraindications and dosing recommendations. These recommendations are based on clinical characteristics associated with drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses, stroke reduction, and bleeding risk to optimize the risk-benefit profile of the NOACs in the real world. The fixed-dosing strategy of NOACs has triggered discussions about the potential value of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment in customizing drug exposure to further improve the safety and efficacy of the NOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation. As there is neither high-quality evidence nor consensus about the potential role of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment for the NOACs, a Cardiac Research Safety Consortium "Think Tank" meeting was held at the American College of Cardiology Heart House in December 2015 to discuss these issues.

### Dabigatran and kidney disease: A BAD combination [^116TJZfj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor widely used to prevent and treat various thromboembolic complications. An advantage of this agent over other anticoagulants is that routine laboratory monitoring and related dose adjustments are considered unnecessary. A major disadvantage is the absence of a reliable means of reversing its anticoagulant effect. After U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, recently emerged data suggest a higher bleeding risk with dabigatran, especially in the elderly. Clinicians are thus faced with caring for patients with serious bleeding events without readily available tests to measure drug levels or the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran and without effective antidotes to rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effect.

Based on dabigatran's pharmacokinetic profile, hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy have been used to remove dabigatran with the hope, still unproven, that this would rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effect and reduce bleeding in patients with normal and those with reduced kidney function. However, the best clinical approach to the patient with serious bleeding is not known, and the risks of placing a hemodialysis catheter in an anticoagulated patient can be substantial. This article reviews this issue, addressing clinical indications, drug pharmacokinetics, clinical and laboratory monitoring tests, and dialytic and nondialytic approaches to reduce bleeding in dabigatran-treated patients.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^116w9xNv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is widespread, emergency physicians will likely encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) regularly, either for the same reasons as the general population or due to the increased bleeding risk associated with OAC use. The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades. Recently, however, newer agents such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (collectively known as novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use.

- **Protocols for warfarin-treated patients**: Protocols in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not provide an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs.

- **Need for alternative tests**: Therefore, alternative tests are needed for use in emergency settings. This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### An updated review of target-specific oral anticoagulants used in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, and acute coronary syndromes [^112EPnKr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

In addition, careful monitoring and dose adjustments should be considered in those patient populations that were less likely to be included in the phase III trial populations, that is, subjects aged 65 years or older and those with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min resulting from chronic or acute kidney disease. TSOAs are contraindicated in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis. Dose reduction is required for those with severe renal insufficiency, that is, creatinine clearance 15 to 30 mL/min on dabigatran or creatinine clearance 15 to 50 mL/min on rivaroxaban. The presence of ≥ 2 of the following mandates the reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily for apixaban: aged ≥ 80 years, weight < 60 kg, or creatinine level of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. Regular monitoring of kidney function at least once per year is recommended for patients on these drugs, and more frequent monitoring is prudent for certain populations at risk for a decline in kidney function.

Although concern has been raised about excessive thrombotic risk with cessation of these agents, there is no evidence to support a drug-specific rebound phenomenon. As with warfarin, periods off of the drug should be minimized to the extent that is safely possible given the underlying hypercoagulable states present with AF and VTE.

### Testing and monitoring direct oral anticoagulants [^115oAxxK]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have significantly improved the care of patients requiring anticoagulation. With similar or better efficacy and safety outcomes, and easier use in the outpatient setting compared with standard-of-care vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin, DOACs are now endorsed as first-line treatment for indications including the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and the treatment of venous thromboembolism. These easy-to-use oral agents offer simple dosing and short half-lives, with no need to test levels due to their wide therapeutic window and limited drug-drug interactions.

After almost a decade of DOAC use, the question of testing DOAC levels in certain clinical situations has become the focus of debate. Although guidance for using routine coagulation tests is available, these tests are inadequate for optimal care. DOAC-specific tests have been developed but have limited availability in Europe and even less in the United States, and none are licensed. DOAC testing may be useful in critical clinical situations such as life-threatening bleeding or the need for emergent surgery, especially with the availability of DOAC reversal agents. Patients with characteristics that fall outside normal ranges may benefit from the guidance that DOAC testing could offer.

Obstacles to adopting DOAC testing include concerns about test reliability and staffing costs. However, these issues are rapidly being resolved. Further investigation of the role of DOAC testing is needed to explore its potential benefits comprehensively.

### The role of the laboratory in treatment with new oral anticoagulants [^111GpvGB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Orally active small molecules that selectively and specifically inhibit coagulation serine proteases have been developed for clinical use. Dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are given at fixed doses and do not require monitoring. In most circumstances, these drugs have predictable bioavailability as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. However, there will be clinical circumstances when assessment of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs will be required.

The effect of these drugs on laboratory tests has been determined in vitro by spiking normal samples with a known concentration of active compound or ex vivo by using plasma samples from volunteers and patients. Data on the sensitivity of different reagents are now available, and so guidance as to the effect and interpretation of a test result is now possible. Laboratories should be aware of the sensitivity of their own assays to each drug. This may be achieved by using appropriate calibrated plasma samples.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^116m3Ji8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Drug‐drug interactions are an important concern for any patient managed on DOAC therapy. Concomitantly administered drugs that alter DOAC plasma concentrations can lead to serious complications, with increased DOAC concentrations potentially resulting in bleeding events and decreased DOAC concentration placing the patient at risk for thrombus formation. Initially, DOACs were viewed as having minimal drug interactions, which has proven incorrect. When compared with VKAs, which are highly associated with substantial drug‐drug interactions, DOACs impart a lower risk; however, they still have a significant risk of interactions. Three different types of drug interactions need to be evaluated when managing DOAC therapy: (1) agents affecting renal clearance, (2) agents affecting hepatic clearance, and (3) agents concurrently affecting hemostasis.

- **Agents affecting renal clearance**: All DOACs used for the treatment of atherothrombosis rely on the kidneys for elimination to varying degrees. Agents that hinder this organ's ability to clear DOAC may place the patient at increased risk for bleeding complications. Common agents to monitor are NSAIDs, diuretics, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and immunosuppressants (i.e. calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus). No DOAC‐specific dose adjustments are required but warrant more frequent monitoring of renal function and possibly holding therapy or consideration for transition to an alternative treatment.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113W9hEp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Among low-body-weight patients (< 60 kg), measuring renal function plays an important role in assessing the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). This is critical as renal function is commonly overestimated in this population due to lower muscle mass. In addition, low-body-weight patients often present with comorbid conditions such as elderly age, frailty, and renal impairment, which predispose them to adverse outcomes.

DOACs with recommended dose reductions based on low body weight (≤ 60 kg) include apixaban (which also considers age and renal function) and edoxaban. These recommendations are a result of pharmacokinetic evaluations demonstrating increased systemic exposure in this population. Dabigatran may also represent a less-than-ideal agent for underweight patients due to increased systemic exposure and the likelihood of coexisting renal insufficiency. Observational studies demonstrate increased dabigatran-induced bleeding at low body mass indexes (< 23.9 kg/m²).

There was no conclusive consensus for patients with weight < 60 kg regarding rivaroxaban, but similar to other DOACs, this agent shows increased systemic exposure in cachectic patients. Patient ethnicity should also be considered, especially in low-body-weight patients. In a nationwide study conducted in South Korea with patients having atrial fibrillation (AF), those weighing < 60 kg were treated with regular doses of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban or warfarin.

### Overview of the new oral anticoagulants: opportunities and challenges [^115fJxv8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are replacing warfarin for many indications. These agents include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, which inhibit factor Xa. All four agents are licensed in the United States for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Additionally, rivaroxaban and apixaban are approved for thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty. The NOACs are at least as effective as warfarin and are more convenient to administer because they can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring; they are also safer because they are associated with less intracranial bleeding.

As part of a theme series on the NOACs, this article compares the pharmacological profiles of the NOACs with that of warfarin; identifies the doses of the NOACs for each approved indication; provides an overview of the completed phase III trials with the NOACs; briefly discusses the ongoing studies with the NOACs for new indications; reviews the emerging real-world data with the NOACs; and highlights the potential opportunities for the NOACs while identifying the remaining challenges.

### Accidental rivaroxaban intoxication in a boy: Some lessons in managing new oral anticoagulants in children [^114u2Dja]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants offer equivalent or improved therapeutic profiles compared with warfarin, with less risk of bleeding, no interactions with food, and no need for routine laboratory monitoring. Caution must be exercised in using these drugs in certain patient populations, such as those with renal insufficiency, those receiving additional antithrombotic therapy, those with questionable compliance, children, and those with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Rivaroxaban is a direct Factor Xa inhibitor used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. We report a case of a child who presented with abnormal coagulation tests after unintentionally ingesting four tablets of rivaroxaban. The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma, admitted to intensive care, and showed improvement several hours later. We discuss his presentation and review the literature on this topic.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116Mi1EH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study evaluated the performance of DOAC-specific coagulation assays using real-life patient samples. Unlike prior reports, our analysis focused on the diagnostic accuracy of the assays in the low concentration spectrum and their ability to discriminate between concentrations above and below the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

Previous publications by our group have provided evidence that unspecific point-of-care tests and laboratory-based assays can help identify intact hemostatic function in patients presumably on DOAC treatment. However, the diagnostic performance of these unspecific tests remains suboptimal, detecting only a limited fraction of patients with DOAC concentrations below 30 ng/mL.

Our present analysis investigated guideline-recommended DOAC-specific tests, which should theoretically provide better diagnostic accuracy. In clinical practice, the question of whether it is safe to proceed with treatments that require intact hemostasis, such as surgery with high bleeding risk or thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke, is frequently encountered. Similar concerns arise in evaluating reversal therapy for DOAC-associated bleeding. Unnecessary reversal therapy incurs considerable financial costs, particularly for dabigatran, as idarucizumab, while safe, is an expensive option. The situation is even more complicated for FXa inhibitors, where prothrombin complex concentrate remains the mainstay of reversal therapy.

### Laboratory tests and the new oral anticoagulants [^116E9s2Y]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are ready to enter the scene on a massive basis for the treatment and prophylaxis of many cardiovascular diseases. Although they can be prescribed without dose adjustment based on laboratory testing, the laboratory is still an essential partner that may assist clinicians in the management of anticoagulated patients. In principle, there are many tests that can be used to evaluate the anticoagulant effect of the new drugs, but the choice should be made among those that are more readily available in emergencies and are easy to run.

Linearity of dose-response and responsiveness to increasing dose, in addition to standardization, are other important issues to consider. This article is aimed at reviewing the tests, their characteristics, and the most appropriate choice.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists: Pilot implementation of a near-real-time monitoring program in Italy [^1139dH1e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In a context of rapidly accumulating postmarketing information, establishing a robust framework capable of generating valid, timely information on the safety and effectiveness of new medications to either support or limit evolving observed prescribing changes (Figure S1) is highly valuable. We were interested in the pilot implementation of a medication-monitoring program and chose oral anticoagulants as a test case in response to a request by the regional healthcare government. This request was motivated by the absence of effectiveness and safety information on these agents as used in routine care in Italy. The ultimate goal is the creation of a monitoring framework that could promptly provide Italian prescribers with relevant clinical information on the safety and effectiveness of newly marketed drugs.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116gToSn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an effective and easy-to-use treatment option for conditions that require long-term anticoagulation. Although the fixed-dose scheme omits the requirement of routine coagulation assessment, testing may be needed under certain clinical conditions, such as before surgery or invasive procedures, in case of trauma or bleeding, or if thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is evaluated.

Ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) remains the criterion standard for exact quantification of DOAC concentrations, but limited availability and slow turnaround times prevent routine clinical implementation of this method. Hence, if coagulation testing is deemed necessary, clinical practice guidelines advise using DOAC-specific coagulation assays, i.e. diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time (ECT) for dabigatran and chromogenic anti-Xa assays (AXA) for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). For all of these assays, quantitative assessment of DOAC concentrations can be achieved with the help of substance-specific calibrators.

A special situation arises for the FXa inhibitors. AXA are set up in many institutions, but calibrations are mostly limited to the traditional indication of therapeutic drug monitoring during low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. If DOAC-specific calibration is not available, different cut-offs for AXA have been proposed, below which unimpaired coagulation can be expected.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113njy2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are no FDA-approved methods to monitor the anticoagulant effect of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Qualitative coagulation assays, such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time, can be used as first-line tests if evaluating medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect as is seen with INR for management of VKA therapy. Quantitative measures, such as anti-factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time, can directly assess anticoagulation effects. However, these quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established, and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes.

- **General monitoring parameters**: These include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine. These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before initiating a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation, then every 6 to 12 months thereafter. More frequent follow-ups based on patient-specific characteristics are recommended in provider plans.

In addition to laboratory monitoring parameters, a comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach should include the following items assessed at each follow-up:

### Antidotes for novel oral anticoagulants: Current status and future potential [^112aeptK]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the anti-Xa agents rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban represent a new generation of oral anticoagulants. These drugs hold an advantage over vitamin K antagonists due to their lack of necessity for monitoring and dose adjustments. However, their primary disadvantage is the absence of a specific reversal agent. Dabigatran, unlike the anti-Xa agents, can have its absorption reduced by activated charcoal if administered shortly after ingestion. Additionally, it can be removed from the blood via hemodialysis.

Prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa have demonstrated some activity in reversing the anticoagulant effects of these drugs based on ex vivo, animal, and volunteer studies. It remains unclear which, if any, of these options is most suitable for emergency reversal. Three novel molecules — idarucizumab, andexanet, and PER977 — may offer the most effective and safest means of reversal. These agents are currently undergoing premarketing studies.

### Laboratory testing in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: A practical guide for clinicians [^114pDwJ3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

One of the key benefits of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is that they do not require routine laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, assessment of DOAC exposure and anticoagulant effects may become useful in various clinical scenarios. The five approved DOACs — apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have different characteristics impacting assay selection and the interpretation of results.

- **Which tests to use**: This article provides an updated overview of which test to use, outlining their advantages and limitations.

- **When to assay DOAC levels**: Situations in which to test for DOAC levels are still debated.

- **How to interpret results**: The results relate to bleeding risk, emergency situations, and perioperative management. Assays for anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity are the preferred methods when quantitative information is useful.

- **Impact on assays**: Different reagent sensitivities and variabilities in laboratory calibrations impact assay results. International calibration standards for all specific tests for each DOAC are needed to reduce inter-laboratory variability and allow inter-study comparisons.

- **Hemostasis testing**: The impact of DOACs on hemostasis testing may cause false-positive or false-negative results. However, these can be minimized by using specific assays and collecting blood samples at trough concentrations.

Finally, prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the findings and provide additional guidance for clinicians.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^115GWqZC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

- **Why assess anticoagulant activity**: When a patient presents in the ED and is known or suspected to be on OAC therapy, it is often helpful to measure the level of anticoagulation.

- **Possible overdose**: The patient may have unintentionally or intentionally overdosed on the OAC without exhibiting related symptoms. For example, in the case of warfarin, the patient's routine monitoring could show an overly elevated INR value, which might result from an overdose or a pharmacological interaction.

- **Bleeding incidents**: The patient is experiencing or is suspected to experience a spontaneous episode of external or internal bleeding. Additionally, the patient may have suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding.

- **Urgent medical procedures**: An urgent surgical or other invasive procedure is deemed necessary due to trauma or acute illness. It is essential for the surgical team to know the level of anticoagulation in the patient.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardized tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran, which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg/ml of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The influence of the new anticoagulants on coagulation assays has been determined.

Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported, and a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients, including prolonged PT and aPTT, and increased drug concentration in plasma. These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications. The pros and cons of laboratory measurements are discussed.

### Managing new oral anticoagulants in the perioperative and intensive care unit setting [^114xBEs7]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Managing patients in the perioperative setting who are receiving novel oral anticoagulation agents for thromboprophylaxis or stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation is an important consideration for clinicians. The novel oral anticoagulation agents include direct Factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. In elective surgery, discontinuing their use is important, but renal function must also be considered, as elimination is highly dependent on renal elimination. If bleeding occurs in patients who have received these agents, common principles of bleeding management, similar to those for any anticoagulant including warfarin, should be considered.

This review summarizes the available data regarding the management of bleeding with novel oral anticoagulation agents. Hemodialysis is a therapeutic option for dabigatran-related bleeding. Meanwhile, in vitro studies have shown that prothrombin complex concentrates may be useful for managing rivaroxaban-related bleeding. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine the best method for reversal of the novel oral anticoagulation agents when bleeding occurs.

### Laboratory measurement of the direct oral anticoagulants [^111WocP4]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are approved for thromboembolism prevention and treatment. These drugs do not require routine coagulation monitoring; however, in some circumstances, the measurement of drug level or anticoagulant effect may be necessary. Although traditional coagulation tests lack analytical sensitivity and specificity, they are widely available and inexpensive, providing useful information regarding the residual anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Hemoclot® and ecarin-based assays can be used to quantify dabigatran levels, and calibrated chromogenic anti-FXa assays are suitable for measuring rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban levels, but these tests are not yet widely available.

### Balancing ischaemia and bleeding risks with novel oral anticoagulants [^112Bfyad]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have long been the standard of care for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite their efficacy, the use of VKAs requires frequent monitoring and is complicated by drug-drug interactions and the need to maintain a narrow therapeutic window. Since 2009, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have become alternative options to VKAs owing to their predictable and safe pharmacological profiles. The overall clinical effect of NOACs, which is a balance between ischaemic benefit and bleeding harm, varies according to the clinical scenario.

- **Use in acute coronary syndrome**: As adjunctive therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, NOACs are associated with incremental bleeding risks and modest benefits.

- **Treatment of VTE**: For the treatment of VTE, NOACs have a safer profile than VKAs and a similar efficacy.

- **Thromboprophylaxis in AF**: In thromboprophylaxis in AF, NOACs are associated with the greatest benefits by reducing both ischaemic events and haemorrhagic complications and might reduce mortality compared with VKAs.

The role of NOACs continues to evolve as these drugs are evaluated in different patient populations, including those with renal impairment or with AF and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^113KbHuw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

As discussed in previous sections, several clues support the possibility of an optimal dose-benefit relationship for DOACs. However, since only limited data are available, it is not currently known whether level-dosed DOAC strategies are superior to fixed-dosed DOAC strategies. These clues provide us with various research opportunities.

First, we need to know if patients on DOAC are willing to be monitored and tested on their DOAC level. Previous studies have shown that most patients on DOAC are satisfied with their treatment and feel safe using DOAC without regular thrombin inhibitor or anti-Xa measurements. It is assumed that DOACs have a broad therapeutic window; they work the same for almost everybody, a one-size-fits-all approach. Therefore, for efficacy and safety, the actual DOAC plasma concentration is deemed less important in a patient taking this drug, lending credence to this patient strategy. Given that the overall bleeding and thromboembolism rates are similar to when using VKA, this further supports that the fixed-dose strategy is safe and effective for most patients. Yet, according to a survey in patients who formerly used VKA and who were switched to DOAC, up to 70% of them were willing to undergo some form of blood testing at least once a year if that could further increase the safety and efficacy of the DOAC they were using.

### The new era of anticoagulation [^112J3Jf4]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Warfarin has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for medical use as an anticoagulant for more than 60 years. Although it has been an effective anticoagulant, its use is accompanied by several pitfalls, which has led to research and the discovery of new additional groups of anticoagulants: direct thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. These new anticoagulants are fast-acting, noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and do not require monitoring. More data are accumulating to support their use in the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism. This article reviews the literature on these novel anticoagulants, including their pharmacokinetics and treatment indications.

### Practical considerations in emergency management of bleeding in the setting of target-specific oral anticoagulants [^115yJwRc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The recent arrival of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) offers potential advantages in the field of anticoagulation. However, there are no rapid, accurate, and routinely available laboratory assays to evaluate their contribution to clinical bleeding. With the expanding clinical indications for TSOACs and the arrival of newer reversal agents on the market, emergency clinicians need to be familiar with drug specifics as well as methods for anticoagulation reversal. This review offers a summary of the literature and some practical strategies for approaching patients taking TSOACs and managing bleeding in these cases.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^114nSyx3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether the information in drug PI (or lack thereof) represents drivers for clinicians to seek DOAC measurements. As previously noted, the decision for a clinical laboratory to implement new testing may be predicated on numerous factors. For anticoagulation monitoring, the PI, sometimes referred to as drug labeling, may provide details about PK, PD, impact on laboratory tests, and/or if monitoring is indicated or other precautions. However, it is likely that the clinical laboratory will respond to local clinicians' needs. As seen with the Lovenox PI, when the PI started providing indications for drug monitoring (anti-FXa activity) and guidance documents reported the same, an increasing number of laboratories began reporting these assays.

There is a noted regional difference in DOAC testing availability for clinicians, and perhaps such testing availability is linked to regional DOAC PI. One indicator of testing availability in a given region is the assessment of External Quality Assurance (EQA) programs. EQA programs represent laboratory quality tools that assure the local laboratory meets performance expectations when testing blinded samples containing particular analytes, where the locally reported results are compared with peer groups. EQA programs detail the number of enrolled participants, the test methodology used, and statistical thresholds for performance for acceptability (pass) or not (fail). Comparing the enrolled participants for DOAC measurements, the US laboratories are lagging behind their Australian, Canadian, and European counterparts.

### Quality assurance program for whole blood prothrombin time-international normalized ratio point-of-care monitors used for patient self-testing to control oral anticoagulation [^113Kunb7]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Whole blood coagulation monitors are increasingly used for patient self-testing to control oral anticoagulation, but there are no comprehensive quality assurance (QA) programs to check their performance. We report on the experience with one such program applied in a field study where patients on prothrombin time (PT)-international normalized ratio (INR) self-testing were asked to bring their monitors to the anticoagulation clinic for checking. PT-INR testing was performed three times over three months with 14 patient monitors and test strips on three recalcified QA plasmas by an experienced laboratory operator. Each patient was also asked to perform PT-INR self-testing using their own capillary blood, which was then compared to the laboratory PT-INR (plasma).

Overall, the comparison between the observed and the consensus PT-INR on QA plasmas was acceptable, with the majority of measurements lying within ± 15% or 20% of the consensus values. The comparison between the PT-INR self-testing and the laboratory method was also acceptable. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean PT-INR values, and the majority of paired measurements were less than 15% or 20% apart.

In conclusion, our results show that the proposed QA scheme is feasible and may be implemented on a larger scale. Monitors should be recalled periodically to the clinic where they have been prescribed to the patient. During each visit, the clinic may check the monitors and patient self-testing performance as described. Such a comprehensive QA system would enhance the monitoring of oral anticoagulation.

### Recanalisation therapies for acute ischaemic stroke in patients on direct oral anticoagulants [^116m8kyp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Future research needs to elucidate several aspects. First, the availability of DOAC monitoring needs to be improved, as streamlining central laboratory measurement and reducing turnaround times seem feasible. Point-of-care measurement for DOACs should be among the top priorities.

Second, although prior reversal of anticoagulation using a specific reversal agent seems to be a reasonable and safe approach, health economics (pricing) and advanced imaging selection (salvageable tissue) should be considered, given the relatively small effect size of thrombolysis on functional outcome. It seems unlikely that this approach should be generalized to all patients. Furthermore, other available approaches — using time since last intake and DOAC monitoring — seem to provide equally safe results.

Third, DOAC patients managed with IVT beyond the standard time thrombolysis window need to be explored. Fourth, although tenecteplase is not currently licensed for the treatment of ischemic stroke, several centers have reported off-label use of tenecteplase, but experience with DOAC pretreatment is limited.

### Novel anticoagulants: Bleeding risk and management strategies [^115GbY4Z]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to quantify the novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)-related gastrointestinal bleeding, summarize the management strategies, and highlight the knowledge gaps.

Recent findings indicate that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban differ from warfarin in that they require fixed oral doses and do not necessitate routine monitoring. Patients at the highest risk of thromboembolism benefit most from NOACs; however, there is a clinically significant risk for NOAC-related gastrointestinal bleeding. The management of NOACs in both acute and elective settings differs from the approach used with warfarin.

The summary highlights that the magnitude of gastrointestinal risk is still unclear due to a paucity of literature. Risk stratification models are incomplete and cannot be used solely to predict future risk. The periendoscopic management requires an understanding of drug half-life, metabolism, and the patient's ability to excrete the agent. Acute bleeding management relies on fluid resuscitation to promote renal excretion of the active metabolite, withholding the doses, and timely management of endoscopic stigmata. The administration of coagulation factors such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant activated FVII is more successful in reversing the activity of the upstream inhibitors of coagulation (rivaroxaban and apixaban) than dabigatran, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112xxa2M]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

For the US, there is only one FDA-approved method for measuring DOACs. Instrumentation Laboratory received an FDA reclassification order for HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa for measuring apixaban in bleeding patients or patients at risk for bleeding. However, under the "labeling" section of this document, the FDA requires that the manufacturer must include "A prominent statement that the device is not intended for use in monitoring patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors".

There are two existing IFUs for this reagent: one without apixaban information (HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa, product 0020302602, Insert revision 06/2017) and the other including apixaban information (HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa, product 0020302602, Insert revision 12/2020). For the Instrumentation Laboratory reagent including apixaban information, the intended use statement indicates, "… the following situations where measurement of apixaban levels could be useful to have as additional information:

- **Patients at risk for major bleeding**:

- **Patients experiencing a bleeding episode**:" The assay is not a stand-alone test, and the results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.

It is noted that the use of this kit is specific to a certain class of instruments; therefore, using this kit on other instruments would be considered a modification to the IFU and thus an LDT.
