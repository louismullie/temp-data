## Question

Can POTS cause chest pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) can cause chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how POTS is defined and what symptoms are considered part of the syndrome. Then, I should verify whether chest pain or chest discomfort is explicitly included in authoritative diagnostic criteria and symptom inventories. Next, I will examine the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms that could plausibly generate chest pain in POTS. After that, I should review prevalence data from clinical studies and surveys to quantify how common chest pain is among POTS patients. Finally, I will consider important differentials and red flags to ensure we do not miss cardiac or non-cardiac mimics, and then synthesize a clinically sound conclusion with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions. POTS is defined by a sustained heart rate increase of at least 30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing (≥ 40 bpm in adolescents 12–19 years) without orthostatic hypotension, accompanied by chronic orthostatic intolerance symptoms that improve with recumbency; common symptoms include lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue, and syncope is relatively infrequent in isolated POTS [^114DheF4] [^112ah6gG] [^113Xrjzq].

> Wait, let me verify whether chest pain is actually listed among core symptoms. I initially thought chest pain might not be in the canonical lists, but hold on, I should double-check the consensus statements and contemporary reviews. The Heart Rhythm Society and ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines enumerate orthostatic symptoms such as lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue, and they note that syncope is uncommon in isolated POTS, which could suggest chest pain is not a primary defining feature; however, multiple independent sources explicitly include chest discomfort or chest pain among frequent POTS symptoms, indicating it is a recognized manifestation even if not a diagnostic criterion per se [^112ah6gG] [^113Xrjzq] [^11316sYr] [^111aA2h5].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility to ensure this is coherent. Chest pain in POTS is most plausibly explained by hyperadrenergic sympathetic overactivity with upright catecholamine surges, by hypovolemia and venous pooling that reduce preload and provoke compensatory tachycardia and chest discomfort, and by small-fiber autonomic neuropathy that impairs vasoconstriction and contributes to ischemia-like symptoms. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and often coexist in the same patient, which aligns with the heterogeneous pathophysiology described in POTS [^116VUDmA] [^114xEC4y] [^116FRPLN].

> Next, I should review prevalence data to quantify how often chest pain occurs. In a validated POTS symptom burden instrument (MAPS), chest pain is included among the five cardiac symptoms and contributes to a markedly higher total symptom burden in POTS versus controls; this supports that chest pain is a meaningful and measurable complaint in this population, even if it is not universal [^112pcWE8] [^114Ka6Vu]. In a large long COVID cohort, participants with self-reported POTS endorsed persistent chest pain or pressure in 48% and sharp or sudden chest pain in 43%, substantially higher than those without POTS, reinforcing clinical relevance; I should note that these are self-reported data, but the magnitude of difference is notable and directionally consistent with clinical experience [^111jQ8Yw] [^112x9iFz]. Earlier literature also lists chest discomfort among common orthostatic complaints in POTS, further corroborating its occurrence across settings [^114LFZrj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and attribute all chest pain to POTS. I need to ensure we consider important differentials and red flags. Because POTS is a diagnosis of exclusion, new chest pain warrants a careful evaluation for cardiac, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal causes; a 12-lead ECG is recommended in the initial workup to screen for secondary causes of orthostatic tachycardia, and echocardiography should be considered when structural heart disease is suspected or when the presentation is atypical or refractory to therapy [^116P6YC7] [^111NLLhw] [^117HrUA4]. But wait, what if the pain is positional and reproducible with standing or exertion and improves with recumbency? That pattern would be more consistent with orthostatic, POTS-related chest discomfort, whereas exertional pressure-like pain with ECG changes would prompt evaluation for coronary disease or myocarditis, particularly in post-COVID contexts where myocardial involvement has been described [^115ZL7C4] [^113rRb89].

> Let me reconsider the overall conclusion to ensure internal consistency. Yes, POTS can cause chest pain or chest discomfort, and this is supported by mechanistic plausibility, inclusion in symptom inventories, and prevalence signals in clinical studies and surveys. However, chest pain is not a universal or defining feature of POTS, and clinicians should maintain vigilance for alternative or coexisting etiologies, especially when red flags are present or when symptoms deviate from the typical orthostatic pattern [^11316sYr] [^111jQ8Yw] [^114DheF4] [^116P6YC7].

POTS can cause chest pain, typically due to **orthostatic tachycardia** [^113Xrjzq] and **hyperadrenergic states** [^116VUDmA] that produce cardiac ischemia-like symptoms [^notfound] without structural heart disease [^notfound]. Chest pain in POTS is usually **non-ischemic**, often described as sharp or pressure-like, and linked to palpitations, dyspnea, and anxiety; it is triggered by standing or exertion and improves with recumbency or rest [^114VvGBj]. Evaluation should include a 12-lead ECG [^116P6YC7], echocardiography if indicated [^111NLLhw], and exclusion of coronary disease or myocarditis [^notfound]. Management focuses on **non-pharmacologic measures** (increased salt/fluid intake, compression, graded exercise) [^1124wmq8] and, if needed, beta-blockers, midodrine, or ivabradine [^1153yfc8] [^113GLixr]; prognosis is generally favorable with treatment, though symptoms may persist [^1168YVoa].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of chest pain in POTS

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** underlie chest pain in POTS:

- **Orthostatic tachycardia**: Excessive heart rate increase upon standing [^113Xrjzq] can cause palpitations, chest discomfort, and ischemia-like symptoms due to increased myocardial oxygen demand [^notfound].

- **Hyperadrenergic state**: Elevated catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) [^116VUDmA] can cause vasoconstriction, increased cardiac workload, and chest pain [^notfound].

- **Hypovolemia and venous pooling**: Reduced blood volume and venous pooling [^114xEC4y] decrease preload, increasing heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, contributing to chest discomfort [^115oGb9N].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Impaired autonomic regulation [^1147R6tW] can cause chest pain through altered cardiac innervation and vascular tone [^notfound].

## Clinical characteristics of chest pain in POTS

Chest pain in POTS typically presents with the following **features**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Quality | Sharp, stabbing, or pressure-like |
| Location | Substernal or left precordial region |
| Triggers | Standing, exertion, anxiety, heat exposure |
| Associated symptoms | Palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety |
| Relief | Rest, recumbency, hydration, compression garments |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When evaluating chest pain in POTS, exclude **cardiac etiologies** through:

- **12-lead ECG**: Rule out arrhythmias or ischemia [^notfound].

- **Echocardiography**: Assess for structural heart disease [^1158kr7A].

- **Exercise stress testing**: Evaluate for ischemia or arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Coronary angiography**: Consider if ischemic heart disease is suspected [^notfound].

- **Tilt-table testing**: Confirm POTS diagnosis and correlate symptoms with orthostatic changes [^112i64BX].

---

## Management strategies

Management of chest pain in POTS focuses on **symptom control** and **underlying pathophysiology**:

- **Non-pharmacologic measures**: Increased salt and fluid intake, compression garments, graded exercise training, and lifestyle modifications [^1124wmq8].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Beta-blockers (propranolol), midodrine, fludrocortisone, and ivabradine may be considered based on symptom severity and patient response [^1153yfc8] [^113GLixr].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize the benign nature of chest pain in POTS and provide reassurance [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for chest pain in POTS is **generally favorable** with appropriate management. Most patients experience symptom improvement with lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy, although some may have persistent symptoms requiring ongoing treatment and follow-up [^notfound].

---

POTS can cause chest pain through mechanisms such as orthostatic tachycardia, hyperadrenergic states, hypovolemia, and autonomic dysfunction. The chest pain is typically non-ischemic and improves with rest and hydration. Management includes non-pharmacologic measures and pharmacologic therapy, with a generally favorable prognosis.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common condition of orthostatic intolerance in response to changes in position. We report a case of a middle-aged woman presenting with a new onset of POTS likely due to chemotherapy for treatment of breast cancer. She was started on a trial of a beta blocker, which was effective in controlling her symptoms and heart rate. The objective of this report was to encourage clinicians to consider POTS as a differential diagnosis, while managing patients with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance.

Study Population

The flowchart is illustrated in Figure 1. We performed a case-control study in 100 patients with verified COVID-19 infection and new-onset POTS diagnosed by positive head-up tilt testing. Patients with post–COVID-19 POTS were recruited from a tertiary dysautonomia unit at the Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. All patients were referred for cardiovascular autonomic testing due to prolonged and disabling symptoms with > 50% sick leave for at least 6 months after acute COVID-19 infection and symptoms suggesting cardiovascular dysautonomia, such as orthostatic intolerance, palpitations, chest pain, exercise intolerance, and dyspnea. The referred patients were previously diagnosed with post–COVID-19 syndrome by a multidisciplinary team at the study site between August 2020 and August 2023 in accordance with the current World Health Organization definition.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

The cardiovascular system may be substantially affected in the course of post– COVID-19 condition, and the most prevalent circulatory disorder is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), less known in the prepandemic era but now identified as a major health care burden. Worldwide, about 20 million people may have developed POTS as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the numbers may be underestimated due to diagnostic delay and a broad spectrum of other post–COVID-19 symptoms diverting attention from the correct diagnosis.

POTS is a type of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction characterized by abnormal heart rate increase on standing, symptoms of orthostatic intolerance without hypotension, along with reduced exercise capacity, fatigue, and other nonspecific symptoms such as headache, chest pain, or sleep difficulties, with a duration ≮3 months. Other possible pathogenesis should be excluded for the syndrome to be described as idiopathic, a view shared by the majority of experts.

The steep rise in POTS diagnoses in the wake of the post–COVID-19 condition surge has created a unique opportunity to study the syndrome in detail, offering the hope of understanding that may lead to more effective therapy. In clinical practice, POTS has been seen as an essentially sinus tachycardia-related condition, meaning that taming the orthostatic tachycardia has been the main therapeutic target. However, POTS has also been suggested to be an inadequate blood volume condition with substantial disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system affecting blood pressure (BP) control mechanisms. – Interestingly, prominent research dating back to the late 90s demonstrated that orthostatic intolerance may be a disorder beyond sinus tachycardia and that the vascular autonomic control may be discordant from the cardiac autonomic control in adults with orthostatic intolerance. – To treat the postulated hypovolemia and impaired vasoconstriction in POTS, some off-label therapeutics that address both vasculature (midodrine)and blood volume control (fludrocortisone)are applied, with weak rationale and without any detailed consideration given to baseline hemodynamics and the effects of therapy.

Conclusions

Here, we highlight the results of the largest known survey of patients with a diagnosis of POTS. We believe these results provide important insights into the background, clinical features and diagnostic journey of patients suffering from this condition. We believe these data will serve as an essential step for moving forward with future studies aimed at better identifying these patients and establishing better treatments for their symptoms.

A further confounding diagnostic challenge is that patients with POTS and their families report ongoing difficulties related to diagnosis, medical stigma, and the challenges related to "living with an invisible illness". They are often told their symptoms are purely psychosomatic in nature or due to anxiety. It is common for youth with POTS to meet with as many as seven doctors before being diagnosed and to continue to see numerous specialists to determine a treatment plan after diagnosis. Once a POTS specialist has been identified, the wait to be seen is estimated to be between six to 36 months, further delaying accurate diagnosis and treatment, with youth experiencing an average of 5 years to diagnosis after symptom presentation.

Clinical Perspective

It is theorized that postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was likely first described in the medical literature in 1871 by Da Costa. In his monograph, he described Civil War soldiers who, in the setting of dysentery‐like illness, presented with multiple orthostatic and gastrointestinal symptoms that caused severe disability. The term "POTS" was subsequently coined in 1982 by Rosen and Cryer in a patient with upright lightheadedness, weakness, palpitations, abdominal and leg pain, and diaphoresis. She had reduced plasma volume and poor sodium balance that responded to increased sodium intake plus mineralocorticoid therapy. Since that time, as initial diagnostic features appeared in 1993and the first consensus document describing diagnostic criteria came out in 2011, recognition of the broadening nature of its cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms spread. Although significant progress has been made in the past 40 years toward understanding and managing this autonomic disorder, much remains unknown about POTS. Recent discussions on the pathophysiology, appropriate therapies, and the possible role of autoimmune disease, in POTS have garnered attention as the field slowly advances to gain increasingly advanced insights into these diverse aspects of this disorder. Patients with POTS often present with multiple disease‐related symptoms and multiple associated comorbidities, often in the absence of overt or specific clinical or laboratory findings, which can lead to complicated and prolonged diagnostic journeys. Diagnostic delays, misdiagnoses, and inappropriate attribution of POTS symptoms to psychiatric conditionshave all been seen in these patients. These medical misadventures, either alone or in combination, can cause frustration and mistrust of the medical system, engender online research that may or may not be beneficial, and potentially delay access to an appropriate therapeutic approach as well as prolonging school absence and social isolation.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) affects children and adolescents-normally fit and well and yet troubled by a myriad of everyday symptoms. Understanding the pathophysiology of this not uncommon disorder together with a review of the clinical features may well assist the attending clinicians to arrive at a clear diagnosis without the need for extensive testing and multiple investigations. Simple lifestyle measures such as increasing fluid intake, electrolyte and/or salt supplements, adequate sleep, not missing out on meals and instituting an exercise programme to improve muscle tone and strength may avoid the need of pharmacological management. These simple measures may benefit symptoms which generally improve as adulthood approaches. In addition, it is important to recognise the comorbidities that may be associated with POTS, each of which may require specific management strategies. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, clinical features and recommended treatment in the management of POTS.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — diagnostic thresholds and tilt testing: An exaggerated orthostatic heart rate increase defines POTS, with "typically 30bpm during orthostatic vital signs, and 30 to 40bpm or heart rate ≥ 120bpm 6 min into a 60° to 70° HUTT". In adolescents, "changes of < 30bpm during either of these evaluations are likely physiological". Screening can use orthostatic vitals with "supine heart rate and blood pressure and 3 minutes after standing". For head-up tilt testing, patients are "tilted up to 60° to 70° and observed for 6 to 30 minutes", and "Prolonged (longer than 16 minutes) and steep (> 70°) tilts may have up to a 40% incidence of physiologically positive faints in adolescents".

Introduction

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic symptoms and excessive postural tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension. It is estimated that 1 to 3 million Americans have a POTS diagnosis. Rates in youth are unknown as POTS has only become more recognized in the past 20 years, with the first report of POTS in the pediatric population appearing in 1999. Due to the nascent knowledge of POTS in youth, it may be inappropriate to apply adult clinical management criteria to youth with POTS.

At least one-third of patients develop POTS symptoms prior to age 18 with a median age of symptom onset at 13.1 years of age. Youth with POTS are typically female (5:1), Caucasian, and diagnosed between the ages of 12–40 with over 50% reporting additional somatic symptoms including chronic fatigue, nausea, and sleep difficulties.–Up to 50% of patients have antecedent symptoms of a viral illness with a prolonged course while others have different medical stressors or no identifiable antecedent.

While the individual symptom profile may vary, clinical and physiological symptoms required for diagnosis commonly include both orthostatic difficulties (e.g. dizziness, syncope, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, "brain fog" or difficulty with concentration) and sympathetic overactivation (e.g. shakiness, palpitations, tremor, anxiety, excessive perspiration, and pain). Youth with POTS frequently report the co-occurrence of pain (POTS+pain). It is estimated that 30–88% of youth with POTS report chronic daily headache, migraine, abdominal pain, and/or musculoskeletal pain.–

Evidence-based methods for treating POTS+pain include pharmacological and physiological interventions with only a few early studies incorporating psychosocial factors. Prospective randomized clinical trials in the pediatric population are limited to only two small studies exploring two pharmacological interventions: midodrine and beta-blockers. Ross and colleagues (2014)surmised midodrine hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for POTS in some youth aged 12–20 and Chen and colleagues (2011)reported it can be effective in the treatment of youth aged 6–17 with POTS. Additional studies have shown effectiveness of these pharmacological interventions and have noted additional benefits of exercise when paired with beta-blockers. Other work has demonstrated benefits of exercise, including progressive cardiovascular exercise training in reducing orthostatic intolerance and abnormal cardiac response in adults with POTS, and improvement in symptoms (including pain) and quality of life in youth.

Regarding medical management for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more specifically with respect to pharmacologic therapy, CCS 2020 guidelines recommend to offer the following medications to improve symptom control in patients with POTS:

- midodrine 2.5–15 mg every 4 hours up to TID

- propranolol 10–20 mg QID (also to reduce standing HR and improve exercise capacity).

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^112ah6gG]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) definition — POTS is "a clinical syndrome usually characterized by (1) frequent symptoms that occur with standing", with physiologic criteria including "an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats per minute (bpm) when moving from a recumbent to a standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12 to 19 years of age)" and "the absence of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure)". The standing heart rate in POTS "is often ≥ 120 bpm, and undergoes greater increases in the morning than in the evening", and orthostatic heart rate increases "gradually decrease with age and not abruptly at age 20". The document also notes that "the diagnoses of POTS and vasovagal syncope are not mutually exclusive".

Orthostatic intolerance and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — clinical features note that orthostatic intolerance refers to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing and are relieved by sitting or lying, with common symptoms including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. In POTS, upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm; although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS, and treatments that improve symptoms of POTS might decrease the occurrence of syncope, although this is unknown.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms in postural orthostatic tachycardia… [^115t2TjY]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Study Overview Patients with POTS experience significant gastrointestinal symptoms. Current evidence suggesting that abnormal post-ganglionic sympathetic function could play a role in the pathophysiology of these GI abnormalities. Sympathetic fiber regulate motor and the postprandial GI peptides secretion. The focus of the present proposal is to determine glucose homeostasis, GI motility, and their association with GI and cardiovascular symptoms in POTS patients versus healthy controls. Furthermore, we will determine differences in these outcomes in POTS patients with and without evidence of postganglionic sympathetic fiber neuropathy. Postural Tachycardia Syndrome is a disabling condition that mostly affects young women in their reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic orthostatic intolerance symptoms triggered by assuming an upright posture and that improved upon recumbency.

These symptoms are associated with a rapid increase in heart rate that occur within 10 minutes upon standing. POTS is estimated to affect up to 3 million persons in the United States and is considered a syndrome rather than a single disease. In POTS patients, multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the exaggerated increase in heart rate. The orthostatic tachycardia could be a compensatory phenomenon to hypovolemia, impaired sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction or increased vascular compliance. The later could induce an exaggerated fluid shift upon standing from thorax to lower body. In addition to the cardiovascular symptoms, patients with POTS experience significant gastrointestinal symptoms namely nausea, bloating, diarrhea or even severe constipation. Furthermore, large meals or high carbohydrate meals exacerbates the feelings of palpitations, weakness, and fatigue in these patients.

Multiple studies have reported the presence of alterations in the gastrointestinal motility. Pooled data from 352 patients recruited from 6 different studies, showed 21–80% prevalence of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In four of these studies that measured gastric motility, they found that 43% prevalence of rapid gastric emptying and 20% prevalence of delayed gastric emptying. The 9 symptoms are: mental clouding, blurred vision, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, lightheadedness, and nausea. This symptom score has been previously used by our center, and the symptoms were chosen as they reflect common complaints of patients with POTS.

Peripheral autonomic denervation and hypovolemia in POTS — Up to 50% of patients have a restricted autonomic neuropathy of small and distal postganglionic sudomotor fibers predominantly of the feet and legs, and blood volume is reduced in up to 70% of patients; paradoxically, some have low plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, and this is a low-flow subtype with inappropriately high angiotensin II levels.

### Quantitative assessment of autonomic symptom burden in postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^111jXrU1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood disorder characterized by excessive tachycardia in the upright position. In addition, patients with PoTS often complain of non-postural symptoms, including fatigue, gastrointestinal and vasomotor fluctuations. The present study quantitatively assessed autonomic symptom burden in PoTS patients (n = 32) using the COMPASS-31, compared to that of autonomic failure/neuropathy (AF/N; n = 47) and asymptomatic, healthy controls (n = 32). Using AIC model selection and regression analysis, we found differences in the contribution of individual COMPASS-31 domains, depending on the autonomic disorder. In PoTS, fatigue severity, orthostatic intolerance and pupillomotor symptom domains, contributed significantly to differences in COMPASS-31 scores compared to controls. In contrast, the secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder and vasomotor domains, contributed significantly to the AF/N model. Our results confirm an increase in autonomic symptoms across all functional domains in PoTS compared to controls, and with similar severity to AF/N, though with differing significant domain contributions. Our findings provide additional support that PoTS is indeed a syndrome of autonomic dysfunction beyond orthostatic intolerance, but also indicates the likelihood of disease-specific contributions to symptom burden, highlighting the need for application of expanded physiological assessment beyond orthostatic challenge, as well as disease-specific symptom assessment tools for use in PoTS.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^116DasmG]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

When considering a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms must have been present for greater than six months, although some researchers may set this threshold at three months for youth. It is important to note that chronicity is an important defining factor, as some transient causes (e.g. viral infection) may produce similar symptoms to POTS. Finally, symptoms must be present in the absence of other causes. Youth with a POTS diagnosis often begin their diagnostic journey following an acute illness, inactivity due to injury, or an accident (e.g. concussion). These incidents can, in and among themselves, foster a decrease in function and increase in deconditioning.–

POTS has been described as both a primary medical condition that can be a standalone diagnosis and, conversely, as a collection of symptoms. Garland and colleagues (2015) wrote a well-organized review of POTS and its "overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms": chronic fatigue syndrome, Ehler-Danlos Syndrome and other hypermobile joint syndromes, vasovagal syncope, panic attacks, pain, exercise, caffeine, sympathomimetic medications, anticholinergic medications, anemia, dehydration, and sinus tachycardia. Just as the signs and symptoms of POTS overlap with several medical disorders (e.g. autonomic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy), so do the typical compensatory physiologic responses associated with medical conditions or decrease in function (e.g. deconditioning, hypovolemia, anxiety). Diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that patients sometimes present with POTS as well as a concurrent diagnosis of deconditioning. The presence of deconditioning is considered a differential diagnosis (i.e. weighing the probability of one diagnosis versus the other diagnosis when they present with similar clinical features) for POTS and 70% of youth present with a concurrent diagnosis of deconditioning, making it difficult for clinical providers to name POTS as the primary diagnosis. The diagnostic complexity associated with POTS makes it incumbent upon the clinician to perform a thorough history and physical. If another diagnosis is suggested, an appropriate and reasonable workup should be pursued. If necessary, a comprehensive interdisciplinary examination and screening process is warranted.

### The dermatological manifestations of postural tachycardia syndrome: a review with illustrated cases [^114wz2M5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome of excessive tachycardia with orthostatic challenge, and relief of such symptoms with recumbence. There are several proposed subtypes of the syndrome, each with unique pathophysiology. Numerous symptoms such as excessive tachycardia, lightheadedness, blurry vision, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, and tremulousness are associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other co-morbid conditions associated with POTS are not clearly attributable to orthostatic intolerance. These include chronic headache, fibromyalgia, functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. Dermatological manifestations of POTS are also common and wide ranging, from livedo reticularis to Raynaud's phenomenon, from cutaneous flushing to erythromelalgia. Here, we provide three illustrative cases of POTS with dermatological manifestations. We discuss the potential pathophysiology underlying such dermatological manifestations, and how such mechanisms could in turn help guide development of management.

### Long-term POTS outcomes survey: diagnosis, therapy, and clinical outcomes [^1168YVoa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on long-term outcomes in individuals with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We designed an electronic questionnaire assessing various aspects of outcomes among patients diagnosed and treated in a single-center pediatric POTS clinical program.

Methods and Results

The LT-POTS (Long Term POTS Outcomes Survey) included questions about quality of life, symptoms, therapies, education, employment, and social impact of disease. Patients age ≤ 18years at POTS diagnosis who were managed in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia POTS Program were included. A total of 227 patients with POTS responded with sufficient data for interpretation. The mean age of respondents was 21.8 ± 3.5years. The median age of symptom onset was 13 (interquartile range 11–14) years, with mean 9.6 ± 3.4years symptom duration. Multiple cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms were reported. Symptom prevalence and severity were worse for female patients, with 99% of patients reporting ongoing symptoms. Quality of life showed moderate function and limitation, with more severe limitations in energy/fatigue and general health. Nearly three quarters of patients had diagnostic delays, and over half were told that their symptoms were "in their head". Multiple medications were used and were felt to be effective, whereas fewer nonpharmacologic interventions demonstrated efficacy. Nearly 90% of patients required continued nonpharmacologic therapy to control symptoms.

Conclusions

POTS is a chronic disorder leading to significant disability with a range of multisystem problems. Although symptoms can be modifiable, it rarely spontaneously resolves. Improved understanding of POTS presentation and therapeutic approaches may inform provider education, improve diagnostic success, and help patients self-advocate for appropriate medical management approaches.

### Characterization of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in long COVID: self-reported data from the LISTEN study [^112x9iFz]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) has emerged as a significant cardiovascular phenotype among individuals experiencing postacute COVID-19 syndrome, commonly referred to as long COVID.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of people reporting long COVID-associated POTS.

Methods

We collected data from individuals aged ≥ 18 years with self-reported long COVID who participated in the Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) cohort, an online observational study. The study included participants surveyed from May 2022 to July 2023. POTS status was determined by self-reported diagnosis of POTS. We compared the demographics, symptoms, associated conditions, and health status of people with and without self-reported POTS.

Results

Of the 578 individuals included, 167 (28.9%) reported new-onset POTS and 411 (71.1%) did not report POTS as one of their long COVID-associated conditions. Seventy-eight percent of participants with self-reported POTS were women (range, 18–74 years). Participants with self-reported POTS were younger, had more financial difficulties, more social isolation, more suicidal thoughts, worse health status measured by the EuroQoL visual analog scale, and reported higher rates of rapid heart rate after standing up, dizziness, palpitations, persistent chest pain, sudden chest pain, excessive fatigue, exercise intolerance, heat intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, migraine, internal tremors, skin discoloration, and dry eyes, as well as new-onset myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and mast cell disorders.

Conclusions

Individuals with self-reported long COVID-associated POTS experienced substantial health burdens in various domains compared with those without self-reported POTS, highlighting the urgency for further research to understand the mechanism, characterize the physiological derangements, and target treatments so we can help these individuals.

Part I: Challenges And Controversies In The Clinical Management Of Pediatric POTS

Three major challenges exist when considering pain management in patients with POTS+pain. First, while there are commonly practiced diagnostic approaches to POTS in adults, the diagnostic complexities and heterogeneous presentation of youth with POTS+pain can impact diagnosis and muddy the waters for medical and family understanding. 8 Second, there is not a standard treatment approach to POTS+pain in the rehabilitation or pharmacology literature. Third, the psychosocial comorbidities that can exacerbate symptoms of POTS+pain are often not assessed or are left untreated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome — orthostatic intolerance with excessive tachycardia upon standing may reflect postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and patients with POTS generally have a heart rate > 30 beats per minute above the supine heart rate after 5–10 minutes of quiet standing (and frequently > 120 beats per minute) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. In a study of 152 patients with POTS predating COVID-19, 42% of cases were preceded by a viral infection. Although much remains to be learned about the relationship between POTS and PASC, it is important to recognize that other forms of tachycardia (eg, sinus, inappropriate sinus) may be commonly found.

### Postural hyperventilation as a cause of postural tachycardia syndrome: increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when upright in all postural tachycardia syndrome variants [^116VSA2Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Standing upright (orthostasis) translocates central blood volume (CBV) to the dependent body and can precipitate orthostatic intolerance (OI). Symptoms of OI generally begin within 5 minutes of orthostatic stress. OI is defined by signs, such as changes in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), or respiration; and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, headache, nausea, fatigue, cognitive deficits, and exercise intolerance starting while upright and relieved by recumbency. 1, 2 Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a common form of chronic OI, is associated with excess upright tachycardia in the absence of hypotension. 3, 4, 5

Dyspnea, hyperventilation, and hypocapnia have been reported in association with POTS and also in other forms of OI, including neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope. 6, 7, 8 Circulatory collapse 9 and milder perturbations, such as induction of hypotension in healthy volunteers, result in hyperventilation and hypocapnia. 10, 11 Hypotension and reduced cardiac output (CO) precedes hyperventilation in these OI variants and may act by causing ischemia of the carotid body ("stagnant hypoxia"), 12 in part related to sympathetic vasoconstriction of the artery to the carotid body. 13

Systemic hypotension, however, does not cause hyperventilation in POTS because, by definition, hypotension is absent in POTS. 3, 4, 5 Nevertheless, intermittent hyperventilation, presenting as postural hypocapnic hyperpnea, has been reported. 14, 15, 16, 17 We observed hypocapnic hyperpnea in POTS in response to a rapid initial orthostatic decrease in CO and CBV. 15 In contrast, hyperventilation has not been observed during past experiments using graded incremental upright tilt. 18

Hyperventilation produces sinus tachycardia, whereas resultant hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood flow, and results in symptoms and maladaptive effects, including impaired neuronal activation. 19 Hypocapnia can be eliminated or diminished by artificial CO₂ rebreathing or by adding CO₂ to inhaled gas sufficient to produce eucapnia while maintaining oxygen concentration constant. 20

We hypothesize that postural hyperventilation is a cause of POTS with normal CO supine, but decreased CO, decreased CBV, and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) common to all with POTS when upright. We further propose that hyperventilation‐associated POTS occurs when initial reduction in CO is sufficiently large and that circulatory abnormalities normalize with restoration of CO₂. 21, 22

### Effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition on postural tachycardia syndrome [^114LFZrj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of the most common forms of chronic orthostatic intolerance, affecting an estimated 500 000 Americans. – It commonly affects women of child‐bearing age and often results in significant functional disability. – The hallmark of POTS is exaggerated orthostatic tachycardia in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. Posture‐related symptoms include mental clouding, blurred vision, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, lightheadedness, and nausea. The pathophysiology of POTS is unknown and likely heterogeneous (including partial autonomic neuropathyand hypovolemia –) but many patients have elevated sympathetic tone and norepinephrine levels upon standing.–

Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake transporter (NET) inhibitor (NRI) that is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. – Although there are no prior clinical trials of NRI in POTS, drugs that inhibit NET are sometimes prescribed by physicians seeking a clinically beneficial peripheral vasoconstriction for POTS patients. – NET inhibition has been shown to increase heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in normal volunteersand in patients being treated for ADHD. These effects could be potentially deleterious in the POTS population since they experience excessive tachycardia on standing. We hypothesized that because it potentiates noradrenergic pathways, atomoxetine would increase standing HR and worsen the symptom burden in patients with POTS.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^115oGb9N]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — a variant of neurally mediated syncope — is recognized by a marked heart rate rise during orthostatic testing, and the syndrome features prominent somatic and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with characteristic circulatory findings. POTS is recognized by a marked "(30–40 bpm) increase in heart rate either during a formal head-up tilt test (HUTT) or during 3- to 10-min stand tests in the office", and "the clinical syndrome is characterized by multiple somatic symptoms", with "nearly 50% of patients" having "significant gastrointestinal symptoms". Adolescent evaluations describe "excessive venous pooling" in legs, pelvic and splanchnic beds with a "marked decrease in the thoracic blood pool", and "at least transient declines in cerebral blood flow velocity" despite preserved mean arterial pressure; nevertheless, "cerebral autoregulation remains intact" and "most measures of baroreflex integrity are normal". Many patients have "decreased blood volume" with "normal plasma renin and low serum aldosterone", and a subset shows "increased angiotensin II and decreased cutaneous nitric oxide" consistent with endothelial dysfunction.

Conclusions

The outcome of this study may provide physicians a cost‐effective, nonpharmaceutical, and straightforward behavioral intervention to recommend to their patients for alleviating symptoms alongside standard symptomatic treatment for POTS. Although further research is warranted, POTS patients could readily adopt and tailor the breathing technique according to their requirements. The observed improvements in cardiovascular parameters and symptoms offer a promising therapeutic approach for patients in times of inadequate treatment options.

### Pediatric postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: where we stand [^113h1T9s]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), first described in 1992, remains an enigmatic, yet severely and variably debilitating, disorder. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not understood, and there remains no biomarker indicating the presence of POTS. Although research interest has increased in recent years, there are relatively fewer clinical and research studies addressing POTS in children and adolescents compared with adults. Yet, adolescence is when a large number of cases of POTS begin, even among adult patients who are subsequently studied. This article summarizes reported research in POTS, specifically in pediatric patients, including discussion of aspects of diagnostic criteria, risk factors and outcomes, neurohormonal and hemodynamic abnormalities, clinical assessment, and treatment. The goals of this review are increased recognition and acknowledgment of POTS among pediatric and adolescent providers, as well as to provide an understanding of reported abnormalities of homeostasis, such that symptomatic patients will be able to be recognized and appropriately managed, enabling them to return to their activities of daily living.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome – current experience and concepts [^114VvGBj]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. PoTS is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young (aged between 15 years and 40 years) and predominantly female. The symptoms — palpitations, dizziness and occasionally syncope — mainly occur when the patient is standing upright, and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, such as modest exertion, food ingestion and heat, are now recognized to be capable of exacerbating the symptoms. Onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery or stress. PoTS can be associated with various other disorders; in particular, joint hypermobility syndrome (also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This Review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS, and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, as well as current and investigational treatments.

### Propranolol decreases tachycardia and improves symptoms in the postural tachycardia syndrome: less is more [^114YK9UC]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) induces disabling chronic orthostatic intolerance with an excessive increase in heart rate on standing. beta-Blockade is an appealing treatment approach, but conflicting preliminary reports are conflicting. We tested the hypothesis that propranolol will attenuate the tachycardia and improve symptom burden in patients with POTS. In protocol 1, a low dose (20 mg) was compared with placebo, and the dose response was assessed in protocol 2.

Methods and Results

In protocol 1, patients with POTS (n = 54) underwent acute drug trials of propranolol 20 mg orally and placebo, on separate mornings, in a randomized crossover design. Blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms were assessed while the patients were seated and after standing for up to 10 minutes before and hourly after the study drug. Supine (P < 0.001) and standing (P < 0.001) heart rates were significantly lower after propranolol compared with placebo. The symptom burden improvement from baseline to 2 hours was greater with propranolol than placebo (median, -4.5 versus 0 arbitrary units; P = 0.044). In protocol 2, 18 patients with POTS underwent similar trials of high-dose (80 mg) versus low-dose (20 mg) propranolol. Although the high dose elicited a greater decrease than the low dose in standing heart rate (P < 0.001) and orthostatic tachycardia (P < 0.001), the improvement in symptoms at 2 hours was greater with low-dose propranolol (-6 versus -2 arbitrary units; P = 0.041).

Conclusions

Low-dose oral propranolol significantly attenuated tachycardia and improved symptoms in POTS. Higher-dose propranolol did not further improve, and may worsen, symptoms.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^115wjqNg]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by excessive heart rate (HR) increase on standing and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, posing significant limitations on functional capacity. No objective tool exists to classify symptom burden in POTS.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study in 62 POTS patients and 50 healthy controls to compare symptom burden between groups using the newly developed, self-rating, 12-item, Malmö POTS Score (MAPS; 0–10 per item, total range 0–120) based on patients own perception of symptoms through visual analogue scale assessment. We have also explored correlations between symptom severity assessed by MAPS, basic clinical parameters and postural haemodynamic changes.

Results

POTS patients showed significantly higher total MAPS score (78 ± 20 vs. 14 ± 12, p < 0.001), higher baseline systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and HR (p < 0.001) compared with healthy controls. The most prominent symptoms in POTS were palpitations, fatigue and concentration difficulties. Haemodynamic parameters on standing were significantly correlated with palpitations in POTS after adjustment for age and sex (lower systolic and diastolic BP, and higher HR) (p < 0.001 for all). Orthostatic HR was significantly associated with concentration difficulties and total MAPS score. The optimal cut-point value of MAPS to differentiate POTS and healthy controls was ≥ 42 (sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 98%).

Conclusions

Symptom severity, as assessed by MAPS score, is fivefold higher in POTS compared with healthy individuals. The new MAPS score can be useful as a semiquantitative system to assess symptom burden, monitor disease progression and evaluate pre-test likelihood of disease.

### Psychosocial perspectives in the treatment of pediatric chronic pain [^1124dBKW]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

There are a wide variety of medically difficult-to-explain chronic painful conditions that present in the pediatric population, which are often referred to as medically unexplained syndromes (MUS). These include such conditions as juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome (JFMS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), widespread pain syndrome (WPS), chronic pelvic pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), tension headaches, noncardiac chest pain, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), among others. Central to these conditions is a wide discrepancy in the actual tissue damage sustained by a patient, the perceived severity of the condition, and the degree of disability exhibited. Alternatively, patients with more clearly delineated medical disorders, e.g. childhood leukemias (e.g. ALL, AML), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), sickle cell disease (SCD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), to mention some of the major illnesses, often experience limitations in their daily functioning due to the effects of debilitating pain and accompanying fatigue and/or the side effects of treatment. Lastly, there are those painful pediatric conditions which do not fall neatly on either end of the continuum with regard to how well an organic explanation fits the patient's reported level of pain or disability, e.g. certain headache variants, costochondritis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Tietze syndrome, to give some examples (see Figure 1). The current review will focus primarily on psychosocial approaches to the treatment of the medically difficult-to-explain chronic painful conditions.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^11316sYr]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common multifaceted condition, characterized by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated adrenergic response in the upright position. Prior to COVID‐19, POTS affected an estimated 1–3 million individuals in the United States, predominantly young females aged 15–45 at diagnosis. Current diagnostic criteria for POTS, outlined by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on Syncope, include symptoms of orthostatic intolerance for at least 3–6 months together with orthostatic heart rate (HR) increase > 30 bpm (HR increase > 40 bpm in patients < 19 years) or HR exceeding 120 bpm in upright position in the absence of orthostatic hypotension (ESC recommendation: Class IIa, level C).

The precise aetiology of POTS remains unknown, although the haemodynamic changes are thought to reflect convergence of multiple pathophysiological processes including peripheral autonomic neuropathy, hypovolemia, elevated sympathetic tone, deconditioning and auto‐antibodies to cardiovascular receptors. Previous studies have shown that certain immunological stressors such as viral infections, trauma, surgery and pregnancy predispose to the onset of POTS, which suggest an autoimmune component in the pathophysiological pathway. Long‐term prognosis is poorly explored, though around 50% of patients may experience symptom reduction or recover spontaneously within 1–3 years. Recently, POTS has been indicated as a possible form of post‐acute‐COVID‐19 sequelae.

Symptoms often include both cardiac symptoms (rapid palpitations, light‐headedness, presyncope, chest discomfort, and dyspnoea) and non‐cardiac symptoms (reduced concentration, brain fog, headache, nausea, fatigue, blurred vision, and exercise intolerance). Cardiovascular symptoms experienced by POTS patients are thought to reflect haemodynamic changes of upright posture. Although the primary symptoms of POTS occur when standing and improve when sitting or lying, patients often have other chronic symptoms and comorbidities that cannot be explained by orthostatic intolerance including chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, nausea, fibromyalgia and joint hypermobility, contributing to the complexity of symptoms in POTS.

To date, no objective tool exists to classify symptom burden and assess disease progression in POTS. Integrating the best evidence available with our clinical expertise, we aimed to design a symptom scoring system and test it in the setting of an established cohort of POTS patients.

Further, we explored the correlation between haemodynamic postural changes and symptoms at upright posture.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — "Nonpharmacologic treatments should be attempted first with all patients" and include withdrawing medications that might worsen POTS, enhanced salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and limiting deconditioning; for suspected hypovolemia, patients "should drink at least 2–3 L of water per day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to approximately 10–12 g/day". Exercise is advised with a "regular, structured, graduated, and supervised exercise program", and initially "exercise should be restricted to non-upright exercises". For rescue volume expansion, "1 L of normal saline infused over 1 hour decreases orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms for several hours to 2 days"; although not trial-tested, "this approach is recommended as rescue therapy", whereas "Long-term infusions of intravenous saline are not recommended for routine care". To reduce tachycardia and palpitations, "low-dose propranolol (10–20 mg PO) acutely lowers standing heart rate", while higher doses are less tolerated; ivabradine may help, with "Approximately 60% of patients with POTS treated with ivabradine in an open-label study" showing symptom improvement. For cholinergic augmentation, "Pyridostigmine is a peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor", and "The drug blunts orthostatic tachycardia and can improve chronic symptoms but is limited by adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, and increased urinary urgency and frequency". For venous return and vasoconstriction, midodrine "significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but to a lesser degree than intravenous saline" and "should be administered 3 times daily", with dosing "only… during daytime hours" due to supine hypertension risk.

Although diagnostic criteria have been developed characterizing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), no single set of criteria is universally accepted. Furthermore, there are gaps in the present criteria used to identify individuals who have this condition. The reproducibility of the physiological findings, the relationship of symptoms to physiological findings, the presence of symptoms alone without any physiological findings and the response to various interventions confuse rather than clarify this condition. As many disease entities can be confused with POTS, it becomes critical to identify what this syndrome is. What appears to be POTS may be an underlying condition that requires specific therapy. POTS is not simply orthostatic intolerance and symptoms or intermittent orthostatic tachycardia but the syndrome needs to be characterized over time and with reproducibility. Here we address critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of POTS in an attempt to arrive at a rational approach to categorize the syndrome with the hope that it may help both better identify individuals and better understand approaches to therapy.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: insights into pathogenesis and treatment [^116TbqwS]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

POTS remains a challenging clinical diagnosis with restricted treatment options. The papers discussed in this month's journal club build upon previous work exploring autoimmunity as a causal factor in a sub-population of patients with POTS disease. Further work is needed to clarify the significance of low platelet storage pool deficiency and altered cytokine levels in patients with POTS. Recent work on the prevalence of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies in POTS patients suggests little overlap between POTS and autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. However, a role may be emerging for immunomodulatory therapy in selected patients with refractory, immune-mediated POTS disease.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^114Ka6Vu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by excessive heart rate (HR) increase on standing and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, posing significant limitations on functional capacity. No objective tool exists to classify symptom burden in POTS.

Methods

We conducted a case–control study in 62 POTS patients and 50 healthy controls to compare symptom burden between groups using the newly developed, self‐rating, 12‐item, Malmö POTS Score (MAPS; 0–10 per item, total range 0–120) based on patients own perception of symptoms through visual analogue scale assessment. We have also explored correlations between symptom severity assessed by MAPS, basic clinical parameters and postural haemodynamic changes.

Results

POTS patients showed significantly higher total MAPS score (78 ± 20 vs. 14 ± 12, p < 0.001), higher baseline systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and HR (p < 0.001) compared with healthy controls. The most prominent symptoms in POTS were palpitations, fatigue and concentration difficulties. Haemodynamic parameters on standing were significantly correlated with palpitations in POTS after adjustment for age and sex (lower systolic and diastolic BP, and higher HR) (p < 0.001 for all). Orthostatic HR was significantly associated with concentration difficulties and total MAPS score. The optimal cut‐point value of MAPS to differentiate POTS and healthy controls was ≥ 42 (sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 98%).

Conclusions

Symptom severity, as assessed by MAPS score, is fivefold higher in POTS compared with healthy individuals. The new MAPS score can be useful as a semiquantitative system to assess symptom burden, monitor disease progression and evaluate pre‐test likelihood of disease.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^115z7xrt]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent work has outlined the possibility of including youth with POTS+pain in chronic pain rehabilitation programs and has shown as many as 20% of patients treated in chronic pain programs have a diagnosis of POTS. For example, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has reported successful implementation of a modified Dallas Program in the treatment of POTS in youth with concurrent post concussive symptoms (including, but not exclusively, pain). However, only two interdisciplinary teams treating pediatric POTS+pain have published manuscripts outlining their approaches: The Mayo Clinic and The Cleveland Clinic (see below). The 3-week intensive Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center at the Mayo Clinic utilizes an interdisciplinary team approach to care and researchers have published four articles including pre- and post-program data. The interdisciplinary, CBT-based approach used in that setting has been associated with improvement in depression, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and functional disability among youth with POTS+pain.

Generalizability to types of pain cannot be gleaned from the Mayo Clinic reports, as only two studies discussed specific pain locations; one study reported improvement in headache and psychosocial functioning, while the second reported improvement in psychosocial functioning by discharge in a teenage male with chronic headaches. Additionally, Junghans-Rutelonis and colleagues (2018)compared youth with chronic pain without POTS to youth with POTS+pain and found youth with POTS+pain reported less back, lower extremity, and chest pain but more "other location" pain (without specifying exact location). In the same study, authors noted greater functional disability at admission when compared to youth with chronic pain without POTS, but similar levels across groups at discharge. This study is the only to report improvements in pain intensity at program discharge. In addition, this study is also the only one to examine treatment mediators in youth with POTS+pain, reporting improvement in functional disability that was partially mediated by improvements in depression and pain catastrophizing helplessness (but not in pain intensity or pain catastrophizing magnification or rumination). Interestingly, Kizilbash and colleagues (2014) discuss improvement in POTS symptoms (e.g. dizziness, visual changes, fainting, rapid heart rate, nausea, vomiting, and weakness) in 15 patients participating in the Mayo Clinic program. While they note improvement at treatment discharge and 3-month follow-up, they do not present any specific data to clarify findings. It is worthy to note that some authors from this program directly state "resolution of POTS is not the goal of treatment; functional restoration is the primary goal".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 data standards — PASC postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical syndrome that started during probable or confirmed acute COVID-19 and lasts ≥ 3 mo. POTS is defined as 1) sustained heart rate increment ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of standing or head-up tilt (for individuals who are age 12–19 y, the required heart rate increment is ≥ 40 bpm); 2) absence of orthostatic hypotension (ie, no sustained systolic blood pressure drop of ≥ 20 mm Hg); 3) frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance during standing, with rapid improvement on return to a supine position; 4) duration of symptoms for at least 3 mo; and 5) absence of other conditions explaining sinus tachycardia such as anorexia nervosa, primary anxiety disorders, hyperventilation, anemia, fever, pain, infection, dehydration, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, use of cardioactive drugs (eg, sympathomimetics, anticholinergics) or severe deconditioning caused by prolonged bed rest.

### The face of postural tachycardia syndrome-insights from a large cross-sectional online community-based survey [^116PEWXE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) experience chronic symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. There are minimal data detailing the demographics, clinical features and clinical course of this condition. This online, community-based survey highlights patients' experience with POTS. It consists of the largest sample of POTS patients reported to date.

Objectives

To describe the demographics, past medical history, medications, treatments and diagnostic journey for patients living with POTS.

Methods

Postural tachycardia syndrome patients completed an online, community-based, cross-sectional survey. Participants were excluded if they had not received a diagnosis of POTS from a physician. The questions focused on the patient experience and journey, rather than physiological responses.

Results

The final analysis included 4835 participants. POTS predominantly affects white (93%) females (94%) of childbearing age, with approximately half developing symptoms in adolescence (mode 14 years). POTS is a chronic multisystem disorder involving a broad array of symptoms, with many patients diagnosed with comorbidities in addition to POTS. POTS patients often experience lengthy delays [median (interquartile range) 24 (6–72) months] and misdiagnosis, but the diagnostic delay is improving. POTS patients can present with a myriad of symptoms most commonly including lightheadedness (99%), tachycardia (97%), presyncope (94%), headache (94%) and difficulty concentrating (94%).

Conclusions

These data provide important insights into the background, clinical features and diagnostic journey of patients suffering from POTS. These data should serve as an essential step for moving forward with future studies aimed at early and accurate diagnoses of these patients leading to appropriate treatments for their symptoms.

### Stirring the POTS: finding symptom patterns in long COVID [^115eLBS3]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although POTS and OH are both classified under orthostatic intolerance, they differ in their clinical profiles — POTS tends to affect younger individuals and is associated with considerable psychological and functional burden, whereas OH is more common among older adults, those with diabetes, or individuals taking diuretics. POTS has also been linked to conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. POTS is typically subtyped into hypovolemic, neuropathic, and hyperadrenergic forms, which often overlap. Understanding these subtypes requires a broader perspective on autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia). From a cardiology perspective, particularly among electrophysiologists, POTS has garnered interest due to its clinical overlap with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. This resemblance prompted the Heart Rhythm Society to address POTS in its 2015 expert consensus statement, which included a discussion of diagnostic criteria and potential treatment strategies. At that time, invasive interventions such as sinus node modification and sinus node–sparing ablation were not recommended, reflecting concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, with ongoing advancements in mapping and ablation technologies, these strategies are once again being explored in carefully selected cases.POTS, therefore, offers valuable insights into a range of domains — its symptoms are consistently triggered by a defined physical stimulus (orthostasis), its objective correlates are observable in vital signs, and its pathophysiology straddles autonomic dysfunction and, increasingly, abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system. As such, it serves as a clinically rich and mechanistically complex condition. In recent years, numerous cases of POTS have been reported under the diagnosis of Long COVID, highlighting its growing relevance in this emerging context.

As with POTS in general, medications are not the mainstay of treatment for POTS+pain patients. Appropriate non-pharmacologic, biopsychosocially informed interventions should be employed before medications are considered. Medications that have shown to be beneficial for youth with POTS and chronic pain include gabapentin, amitriptyline, and clonidine. Additionally, multiple groups have recommended an increase in fluid and salt intake. However, there is not a consensus on specific quantity increase.

A comprehensive approach to the treatment of POTS+pain is in the very early stages of the study. In a large medical center that sees hundreds of adolescents with POTS every year, providers anecdotally found a one-hour group psychoeducation session (i.e. pathophysiology of POTS, natural history of the condition, and explanation of the treatment plan) to be helpful. Behavioral change components of the psychoeducation group included recommendations to engage in regular cardiovascular exercise, improve eating habits, and regulate sleep routine. If patients are not able to return to normal functioning based on these recommendations, medications or additional nonpharmacological interventions can be helpful. General nonpharmalogical recommendations for POTS management and treatment that appear to also align with treatment for chronic pain include psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, adequate water intake, physical activity (including resistance training), returning to regular academic activities, improving sleep hygiene (e.g. behaviors that assist in better quality of sleep), addressing biopsychosocial needs, relaxation strategies via biofeedback technology, and tailoring therapy to a patient's needs or "meeting them where they are at". Other recommendations for POTS+pain that are not evidence-based include "wearing leotard-type pressure garments" or compression stockings.

### Intermittent left bundle branch block with septal flash and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in a young woman with long COVID-19 [^113rRb89]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

The emerging entity, long COVID -19 is characterised by long-lasting dyspnoea, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and other symptoms. Cardiac involvement manifested as conduction abnormalities, left ventricle mechanical dyssynchrony, dyspnoea, palpitation and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) are common in long COVID-19. The direct viral damage to the myocardium or immune-mediated inflammation are postulated mechanisms. A woman in her forties presented with a 2-month history of chest pain, functional dyspnoea, palpitation and an episode of syncope after having been home-isolated for mild COVID infection. During clinical workup, a clustering of ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities including left bundle branch block, septal flash, and presystolic wave on spectral Doppler echocardiography, and POTS were detected. The echocardiographic findings together with POTS and persistent dyspnoea indicated the presence of a long COVID-19 state. The prevalence and clinical significance of these finding, as well as the impact on long-term prognosis, should be investigated in future studies.

### Clinical challenges in the diagnosis and management of postural tachycardia syndrome [^116FRPLN]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a multifactorial clinical syndrome defined by an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30bpm on standing from supine position (or ≥ 40bpm in children). It is associated with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion that are worse when upright and improve when in supine position. Patients often have additional symptoms including severe fatigue and difficulty concentrating. There are several possible pathophysiologic mechanisms including hypovolaemia, small-fibre peripheral neuropathy and hyperadrenergic states. POTS can also be associated with several disorders including mastocytosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobility type) and autoimmune disorders. The treatment is focused on symptom relief and not solely on reducing tachycardia. Given its varying presentations, it is important to employ a practical, mechanism-focused approach to the diagnosis and management of POTS.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^1141FWjT]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Challenge I: Complexities And Misunderstandings

The diagnosis of POTS is based on some fundamental tenets. Those include the documentation of a sustained heart rate elevation in upright versus supine heart rate, the absence of orthostatic hypotension, the presence of symptoms for a prolonged period of time, and the absence of other potential causes for the symptoms. The diagnostic criteria vary slightly for adults (> 19 years old) and adolescents (12–19 years old).

To properly document the elevated heart rate, blood pressure measurements should be taken once the patient has been supine for 5 mins. The patient should then stand upright, and heart rate and blood pressure measurements should be taken at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-mins intervals. Adolescents (aged 12–19 years) with a heart rate increase greater than or equal to 40 beats per minute at 10 mins, or absolute upright heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute, fulfill the initial diagnostic criterion (> 30 bpm for patients > 19 years old). Postural tachycardia may also be diagnosed using a head-up tilt table test. The postural tachycardia as noted above must also be diagnosed in the absence of orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure of > 20/10 mm Hg). These criteria are the same across age groups.

INTRODUCTION

Following remission of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), some patients may suffer from either a cluster of new symptoms or worsening of previous conditions, developing a syndrome known as post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). PCC (or long COVID) is defined as the persistence or appearance of new symptoms 3 months after the onset of COVID-19 with at least 2 months of duration. Risk factors for PCC constitute: sex (female), age (> 40 years), BMI (> 30 kg/m²), and smoking. Notably, obesity and smoking represent the highest risk as both promote a generalized proinflammatory state, leading to multisystemic manifestations and their consequences.

PCC is a multisystemic disorder that can manifest heterogeneously. Symptoms may range from nonspecific (e.g. malaise, fatigue, discomfort) to well described symptoms (e.g. palpitations, dyspnea, diarrhea, rash, etc.). Particularly, the cardiovascular and neurological systems are among the most altered.

To some extent, PCC manifestations could be explained by autonomic dysfunction, a condition that has gained recognition because of the increasing incidence of orthostatic intolerance symptoms in these patients. Orthostatic intolerance includes predominantly: orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Precisely, one of the most common symptoms associated with PCC is tachycardia, reported in 25–50% of patients, which could present as POTS.

POTS is characterized by an increase in more than 30 bpm in heart rate (HR) during orthostatism without a drop in blood pressure (BP) for at least 6 months of duration. It is further divided into hyperadrenergic, neuropathic, and hypovolemic POTS. Hyperadrenergic POTS is defined as an increase greater than 30 bpm in HR when standing up, with a greater than 10 mmHg increase in SBP and the presence of elevated serum norepinephrine levels (> 600 pg/ml).

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management [^112i64BX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a variant of cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by an excessive heart rate increase on standing and orthostatic intolerance. POTS affects younger individuals 15–45 years old with a distinct female predominance (≈80%). The prevalence ranges between 0.2% and 1.0% in developed countries. The onset of POTS is typically precipitated by immunological stressors such as viral infection, vaccination, trauma, pregnancy, surgery or psychosocial stress. The most common complaints are dizziness, weakness, rapid heartbeat and palpitation on standing. Moreover, patients often report physical deconditioning and reduced exercise capacity as well as headache, 'brain fog', dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal pain. The aetiology of POTS is largely unknown and three main hypotheses include an autoimmune disorder, abnormally increased sympathetic activity and catecholamine excess, and sympathetic denervation leading to central hypovolaemia and reflex tachycardia. The golden standard for POTS diagnosis is head-up tilt test with a non-invasive beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. Although long-term prognosis of POTS is poorly explored, around 50% of patients spontaneously recover within 1–3 years. After the diagnosis has been established, patient should be thoroughly educated about non-pharmacological measures alleviating the symptoms. Exercise training may be very effective and counteract deconditioning. In more symptomatic patients, different drugs directed at controlling heart rate, increasing peripheral vasoconstriction and intravascular volume can be tested. However, the overall effects of pharmacological therapy are modest and the most affected patients remain handicapped. Future efforts should focus on better understanding of POTS pathophysiology and designing randomized controlled trials for selection of more effective therapy.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^116JszHR]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) often present with co-occurring struggles with chronic pain (POTS+pain) that may limit daily activities. POTS is a clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic symptoms and excessive postural tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension. Active research from the medical and scientific community has led to controversy over POTS diagnosis and treatment, yet patients continue to present with symptoms associated with POTS+pain, making treatment recommendations critical. This topical review examines the literature on diagnosing and treating pediatric POTS+pain and the challenges clinicians face. Most importantly, clinicians must employ an interdisciplinary team approach to determine the ideal combination of pharmacologic (e.g., fludrocortisone), non-pharmacologic (e.g., physical therapy, integrative medicine), and psychological (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation) treatment approaches that acknowledge the complexity of the child's condition, while simultaneously tailoring these approaches to the child's personal needs. We provide recommendations for treatment for youth with POTS+pain based on the current literature.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical review [^111MraR4]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome was defined in adult patients as an increase > 30 beats per minute in heart rate of a symptomatic patient when moving from supine to upright position. Clinical signs may include postural tachycardia, headache, abdominal discomfort, dizziness/presyncope, nausea, and fatigue. The most common adolescent presentation involves teenagers within 1–3 years of their growth spurt who, after a period of inactivity from illness or injury, cannot return to normal activity levels because of symptoms induced by upright posture. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is complex and likely has numerous, concurrent pathophysiologic etiologies, presenting along a wide spectrum of potential symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatment includes (1) increasing aerobic exercise, (2) lower-extremity strengthening, (3) increasing fluid/salt intake, (4) psychophysiologic training for management of pain/anxiety, and (5) family education. Pharmacologic treatment is recommended on a case-by-case basis, and can include beta-blocking agents to blunt orthostatic increases in heart rate, alpha-adrenergic agents to increase peripheral vascular resistance, mineralocorticoid agents to increase blood volume, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. An interdisciplinary research approach may determine mechanistic root causes of symptoms, and is investigating novel management plans for affected patients.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^112pcWE8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Malmö POTS symptom score

We developed a novel, questionnaire‐based, symptom scoring system, the Malmö POTS Symptom Score (MAPS), for self‐assessment of symptom burden using a visual analogue scale graded from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (very pronounced symptoms), based on patients' own perception of 12 commonly reported symptoms: five cardiac symptoms (palpitations, dizziness, presyncope, dyspnoea and chest pain) and seven non‐cardiac symptoms (gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, concentration difficulties, headache, myalgia, nausea and fatigue) during the previous 7 days (Supporting Information: MAPS questionnaire in original Swedish language and English translation). The selection of questions included in MAPS was based on available literature on self‐reported symptomatology in POTS, expert opinion, and authors' own clinical experience. Three co‐authors (JS, VH and AF) analysed data from a large international POTS survey based on 4835 individual online questionnaires and selected the most prevalent symptoms reported by at least 75% of participants. The symptoms were grouped into 12 main categories. Gastrointestinal symptoms were merged into one category (pain in the stomach, diarrhoea or constipation) as majority of POTS patients report varying and alternating symptoms from gastrointestinal tract. The questionnaire was preliminary tested on 10 consecutive newly diagnosed POTS patients who confirmed an adequate coverage of their POTS‐related symptoms. The score ranges from 0 to a maximum score of 120 points(see Graphical Abstract).

All study participants were asked to complete the MAPS questionnaire. The total score was calculated for evaluation and comparison between POTS patients and healthy controls. Frequency distribution graphs for each symptom reported in the MAPS questionnaire are available in the Supporting Information.

Statistical analysis

Group characteristics were reported as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, as appropriate, for continuous variables, and as counts and percentages for categorical variables. Between‐groups comparison was performed using independent samples t ‐test and Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate.

### The face of postural tachycardia syndrome-insights from a large cross-sectional online community-based survey [^115MVyjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical condition in which patients experience chronic symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Consensus documents define POTS by a significant heart rate increase (≥ 30 beats per minute within 10 min of upright posture or ≥ 40 beats per minute if under 18 years), with no orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure > 20/10 mmHg within 3 min of upright posture) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. POTS can be associated with significant morbidity, poor sleep quality and diminished quality of life 6, 7, 8. There is no single treatment that can 'cure' a patient of symptoms 9. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment is often needed 9.

Postural tachycardia syndrome is estimated to affect between 500 000 and 3 000 000 people in the United States alone 10, 11. It also has a strong female predominance (5:1) 12, 13. Despite this, there are few published data detailing the demographics, features and clinical course of this condition. Most studies are limited by small sample sizes, referral bias and comprise populations from single, highly specialized tertiary care centres.

Here, we present data from an international survey of patients with POTS. These data provide unique information from the perspective of patients suffering from POTS. We aimed to highlight patients' long‐term experiences in managing POTS, including background demographics, comorbidities, symptom burden and their diagnostic journey with this illness. This online, community‐based survey consists of the largest sample of POTS patients reported to date.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^114sY13W]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

POTS is defined as the development of orthostatic symptoms associated with a heart rate (HR) increment ≥ 30, usually to ≥ 120 bpm without orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance are those due to brain hypoperfusion and those due to sympathetic overaction.

Methods

We provide a review of POTS based primarily on work from the Mayo Clinic.

Results

Females predominate over males by 5:1. Mean age of onset in adults is about 30 years and most patients are between the ages of 20–40 years. Pathophysiologic mechanisms (not mutually exclusive) include peripheral denervation, hypovolemia, venous pooling, beta-receptor supersensitivity, psychologic mechanisms, and presumed impairment of brain stem regulation. Prolonged deconditioning may also interact with these mechanisms to exacerbate symptoms. The evaluation of POTS requires a focused history and examination, followed by tests that should include HUT, some estimation of volume status and preferably some evaluation of peripheral denervation and hyperadrenergic state. All patients with POTS require a high salt diet, copious fluids, and postural training. Many require beta-receptor antagonists in small doses and low-dose vasoconstrictors. Somatic hypervigilance and psychologic factors are involved in a significant proportion of patients.

Conclusions

POTS is heterogeneous in presentation and mechanisms. Major mechanisms are denervation, hypovolemia, deconditioning, and hyperadrenergic state. Most patients can benefit from a pathophysiologically based regimen of management.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia — definitions and haemodynamic patterns — are detailed as follows: Classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 20 mmHg and in diastolic BP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing; initial OH is a BP decrease immediately on standing of > 40 mmHg with rapid recovery such that the period of hypotension is short (< 30 s), and tracings show the nadir at 7–10 s followed by recovery; in autonomic failure (ANF), BP may fall immediately after standing to very low levels after 1 min upright with little heart rate (HR) increase; delayed (progressive) OH is not uncommon in elderly persons, is attributed to age-related impairment of compensatory reflexes and stiffer hearts, is characterized by a slow progressive decrease in systolic BP on assuming erect posture, is differentiated by the absence of a bradycardic reflex but may be followed by reflex bradycardia with a less steep fall in BP in the elderly than in the young; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) occurs in some patients, mostly young women, with severe orthostatic intolerance but not syncope and very marked HR increases [> 30 beats per minute (b.p.m.) or to > 120 b.p.m.], is frequently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, and its underlying pathophysiology remains to be determined.

Orthostatic intolerance — definition and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) features are described as frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing and are relieved by sitting or lying, most commonly including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. One condition of note is POTS, in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm; although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS. Treatments that improve symptoms of POTS might decrease the occurrence of syncope, although this is unknown.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance — Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. Most commonly, the symptoms include lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by hemodynamic disturbances, including blood pressure decrease, which may or may not meet criteria for OH, and heart rate increase, which may be inadequate or compensatory. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in primary care: diagnosis, treatment and a case of African-American man presenting with POTS [^114dK2Na]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous autonomic disorder characterised by orthostatic intolerance and a rise in heart rate by at least 30 bpm or an absolute heart rate value of at least 120 bpm within 10min of standing or during a tilt table test. Overwhelmingly, POTS affects young Caucasian women, which can lead physicians to miss the diagnosis in men or non-white patients. We describe a case of 29-year-old African-American man who developed lightheadedness, generalised weakness, tachycardia and palpitations and was subsequently diagnosed with POTS. We review its clinical features, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment options. We also emphasise that POTS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with typical clinical features, who may not be in the usual demographics of the disorder.

### Serum activity against G protein-coupled receptors and severity of orthostatic symptoms in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^111aA2h5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of unknown cause characterized by orthostatic intolerance and increased heart rate (HR) of 30 beats per minute during orthostasis, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. 1 In addition to orthostatic intolerance, patients with POTS may experience debilitating symptoms only partly related or unrelated to orthostasis, including light‐headedness, nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, mental confusion ("brain fog"), chest pain, and gastrointestinal problems. 2 Syncope may occur although presyncopal symptoms are more common. Several potential underlying mechanisms have been suggested for POTS including autonomic denervation, hypovolemia, hyperadrenergic stimulation, and autoantibodies against adrenergic receptors. 2, 3, 4 However, none of these proposed mechanisms has yet led to effective treatment.

It has been observed that some patients develop POTS following an infection. This observation has given rise to the hypothesis of an autoimmune‐mediated cause of POTS. The fact that the majority of patients with POTS are women, who are more susceptible to developing autoimmune diseases, further supports the autoimmune hypothesis. 2 Additionally, nearly one fourth of patients with POTS have positive antinuclear antibodies and a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto disease and Sjögren syndrome. 5 Finally, we and others have previously demonstrated presence of antibodies against adrenergic and cholinergic GPCRs (G protein–coupled receptors) in POTS. 6, 7, 8, 9

GPCRs constitute a large family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signaling pathways, ultimately leading to cellular responses. 10, 11 Over time, antibodies against GPCRs have been linked to a spectrum of conditions, including POTS. 10, 12 Thus, we aimed to expand previous observations by studying serum activity against specific GPCRs, cardiovascular ADRA1 (adrenergic α 1 receptor), ADRB2 (adrenergic β 2 receptor), CHRM2 (cholinergic muscarinic type 2 receptor), and nociception‐related OPRL1 (opioid receptor‐like 1) in patients with POTS and matched controls, and relate the serum‐mediated activation to specific orthostatic symptoms.

Methods

The patient population consisted of individuals referred to the Cardiac Arrhythmia and Syncope Center at University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN) and the Hospital of the Good Samaritan and Keck Medical Center (Los Angeles, CA) from January 2016 to January 2020 for evaluation of orthostatic intolerance symptoms consistent with POTS, and who were followed for a minimum of 6 months. Institutional Review Board approvals were obtained from each contributing institution. Written consent was obtained from all patients for use of deidentified data. Deidentified data used for this research will be made available in tabular form upon request by researchers in the field.

All patients were evaluated by 1 of the authors (DC, DGB). Patients who were found to have anemia, hyperthyroidism, ongoing infection, evident systemic inflammatory diseases, or suspected volume depletion that could account for POTS‐like findings were excluded. Patients with POTS symptoms present for < 4 months duration were also excluded to minimize inclusion of individuals with a recent contributory acute illness. Patient assessment occurred before the onset of COVID‐19 pandemic and no patient suspected of having had COVID‐19 was included.

A complete medical history was obtained along with physical examination, a 12‐lead ECG, and laboratory testing for the purpose of excluding acute inflammatory or infectious illness (ie, complete blood cell count and white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C‐reactive protein). A comprehensive symptom assessment was undertaken for each patient. Furthermore, all patients underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring for ≥ 24 hours. Echocardiography was obtained in all cases and none evidenced underlying structural heart disease.

POTS Diagnostic Criteria

A diagnosis of POTS was established based on observations summarized by the Heart Rhythm Society and Canadian Cardiovascular Society. A postural contribution to symptoms was determined by clinical history, as well as during an active standing test or tilt‐table test or both. The following findings were present:
Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance as described in the 2015 Heart Rhythm Society and 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society documents,
Sustained increase in heart rate ≥ 30 beats per minute when moving from seated or recumbent to upright based on consensus published diagnostic criteria,
Absence of sustained orthostatic hypotension (ie, < 20 mm Hg drop of systolic pressure when moving to upright posture with prompt recovery).

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: insights into pathogenesis and treatment [^114xBtFk]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of chronic dysautonomia, most commonly seen in women of child-bearing age and often associated with reduced quality of life. Current diagnostic criteria require an increase in heart rate of 30 beats per minute (bpm), or over 120 bpm in the first 10 min of standing, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, and associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other symptoms suggestive of autoimmune failure include sudomotor dysfunction and gastrointestinal dysmotility. However, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and uncertainty of pathogenesis, often prompts a search for alternative causes before a diagnosis of POTS, a made.

This months' journal club explores the evidence for an autoimmune basis of dysautonomia in POTS. The first paper evaluates biomarkers of inflammation and possible platelet dysfunction in 34 patients with POTS and autoantibodies against the A1 adrenergic and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The second paper examines the prevalence of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies in patients with POTS compared to healthy controls. The third paper is a case series evaluating use of intravenous immunoglobulin in six patients with refractory immune-mediated POTS.

A difficult diagnostic journey

Postural tachycardia syndrome patients often experience long diagnostic delays and a lack of physician awareness of POTS. In fact, many respondents (34%) first suggested the diagnosis to their physicians, and many had to present to several healthcare practitioners prior to receiving a POTS diagnosis. This raises concerns that many individuals suffering from POTS may not receive a diagnosis at all, since many people cannot afford to see multiple doctors, and some healthcare systems or insurance providers do not allow multiple 'second opinions'. Only 9% of participants presented to an Autonomic Disorders Consortium site, which are tertiary referral centres. This may suggest that the majority of POTS patients are either managed in the community by either general practitioners or specialists, or they are not actively followed. In our study, cardiologists most commonly made this diagnosis, followed by neurologists, cardiac electrophysiologists and family physicians. This is similar to the POTS UK study 18. Although the symptom profile of patients suggests that a majority report some neurological features of POTS, only one‐fifth of participants were diagnosed by a neurologist. This continues to highlight that a lack of awareness appears to impede a diagnosis of POTS, regardless of the specialty 28.

Overall, the majority of these diagnoses were clearly made by nontertiary care experts. This means that we cannot verify that the diagnoses of POTS are correct in each case. However, these data do reflect the current state of recognition and diagnosis of this condition in the 'real world', where there is a limited ability to access specialized centres well versed in assessing and managing patients with this condition. We believe these data emphasize the importance of strategies to broadly increase primary care physician education about the diagnosis and treatment of POTS.

### Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder? [^1147R6tW]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a rise in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from supine to standing position, has been traditionally viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that in addition to being considered a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, POTS should be viewed also as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder given (1) significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS; (2) structural and functional differences found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance; (3) evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume, and (4) positive response to medications targeting the CNS and non-pharmacologic CNS therapies. This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder can lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in patents affected by this disabling syndrome.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^111NthAQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated sympathetic response to assuming an upright position. Up till recently, it was largely under-recognised as a clinical entity. There is now consensus about the definition of POTS as a greater than 30/min heart rate increase on standing from a supine position (greater than 40/min increase in 12–19-year-old patients) or an absolute heart rate of greater than 120/min within 10 min of standing from a supine position and in the absence of hypotension, arrhythmias, sympathomimetic drugs or other conditions that cause tachycardia. We present two cases of POTS, followed by a discussion of its pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology and management.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^115oBQ5e]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) often present with co-occurring struggles with chronic pain (POTS+pain) that may limit daily activities. POTS is a clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic symptoms and excessive postural tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension. Active research from the medical and scientific community has led to controversy over POTS diagnosis and treatment, yet patients continue to present with symptoms associated with POTS+pain, making treatment recommendations critical. This topical review examines the literature on diagnosing and treating pediatric POTS+pain and the challenges clinicians face. Most importantly, clinicians must employ an interdisciplinary team approach to determine the ideal combination of pharmacologic (e.g. fludrocortisone), non-pharmacologic (e.g. physical therapy, integrative medicine), and psychological (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation) treatment approaches that acknowledge the complexity of the child's condition, while simultaneously tailoring these approaches to the child's personal needs. We provide recommendations for treatment for youth with POTS+pain based on the current literature.

Dysautonomia such as POTS syndrome presenting with respiratory symptoms can often be misdiagnosed for other common pulmonary conditions. It can be diagnosed with a comprehensive history and orthostatic vital measurement. Simple diagnostic test such as diffusing capacity in supine and standing position can emerge as a noninvasive tool to guide the long-term monitoring and treatment response.

Orthostatic intolerance and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — clinical features and relevance to syncope: Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

### The neuromuscular evaluation of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^111svGfG]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a diagnosis with a wide spectrum of symptomatology and a variety of clinicopathological associations, including hereditary, autoimmune, and infectious associations. There is little consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic approach to the condition. The aim of this work was to provide guidance on the initial diagnosis and when and how to expand diagnostic testing. We define the "typical" POTS patient as younger, female, and with a normal examination apart from joint hyperextensibility. Red flags for "atypical" POTS would be older age at onset, male, prominent syncope, review of systems suggestive of specific alternative diagnoses, examination abnormalities other than joint hyperextensibility, or disease refractory to nonpharmacological and other first-line treatments. Although a limited evaluation is appropriate in POTS with typical features, we recommend an expanded and individualized workup in atypical cases, including additional cardiac testing, autonomic testing, neuropathy workup, and/or autoimmune workup (including consideration of Guillain-Barré syndrome), depending on clinical presentation. We emphasize the importance of shared decision-making in this condition for which treatment remains primarily symptomatic regardless of etiology.
