## Question

Grandma started vomiting this morning

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage an older adult who started vomiting this morning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags that mandate urgent care. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that narrow the differential in older adults. Next, I will examine the physical exam priorities and the initial diagnostic workup. After that, I need to consider age-specific differentials and when to escalate to advanced imaging. Finally, I will outline initial management, medication cautions in the elderly, and disposition thresholds, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities, because in older adults vomiting can herald serious disease. I need to check for alarm features such as hematemesis, severe abdominal pain, chest pain, dyspnea, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits, or signs of shock, which warrant immediate emergency evaluation. I should also confirm whether the emesis is bilious, because bilious vomiting suggests obstruction until proven otherwise and requires urgent attention, especially in the elderly where adhesions, hernias, and volvulus are more common [^0a8752eb] [^e0306294].

> Wait, let me verify the focused history elements that most efficiently narrow the differential. I need to ask about onset and tempo, associated symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, headache, or neurologic changes, recent medications including NSAIDs, antibiotics, digoxin, opioids, and anticholinergics, and any history of GI disease, cardiac disease, diabetes, or prior abdominal surgery. I should also ask about cannabis use, because chronic heavy use can produce cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, and I must not forget to screen for pregnancy in any person with childbearing potential, even if the scenario is an older adult, because rare cases occur and guidelines still advise considering it when relevant [^bf3d1737] [^9b4288fc] [^0a8752eb].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical exam priorities in this age group. I will assess volume status with orthostatics, mucous membranes, and skin turgor, check vitals for hypotension, tachycardia, fever, and oxygen saturation, perform a careful abdominal exam for distension, tenderness, masses, surgical scars, and hernias, and auscultate for bowel sounds. I will also examine the cardiopulmonary systems for murmurs, JVD, rales, or signs of heart failure, and perform a focused neurologic exam if CNS causes are suspected, because older adults may have atypical presentations of serious disease [^0a8752eb].

> I need to ensure the initial diagnostic workup is appropriate and not overly broad. In most stable older adults with acute vomiting and no red flags, basic labs including CBC, electrolytes, renal function, glucose, and a urinalysis are reasonable. If there is concern for obstruction or ileus, a plain abdominal radiograph can be obtained, but I should avoid unnecessary advanced imaging unless guided by clinical suspicion. If the patient is on digoxin, lithium, or other narrow-therapeutic-index drugs, I should check levels, and if there is concern for adrenal insufficiency or thyroid disease, targeted endocrine testing can be considered [^0a8752eb] [^c7e0f003].

> Let me consider age-specific differentials, and I should double-check that I am not anchoring prematurely. In older adults, common and dangerous causes include bowel obstruction from adhesions, hernias, or volvulus, mesenteric ischemia, gallstone ileus, perforated viscus, myocardial ischemia or heart failure presenting with nausea and vomiting, medication-induced gastritis or gastroparesis, and metabolic derangements such as hyperglycemia, uremia, or hyponatremia. Cyclic vomiting syndrome can occur at any age and may be underrecognized in older adults, so I should keep it in mind if there are stereotyped, recurrent episodes with migraine features or autonomic symptoms [^0a8752eb] [^1f470c54] [^4b9aaa4f].

> But wait, what if the vomiting is bilious or there are signs of obstruction. I should confirm that bilious emesis mandates urgent evaluation for obstruction, and in the elderly, volvulus, hernias, and gallstone ileus are key considerations. If plain films are nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, CT abdomen/pelvis is the modality of choice to define the cause and plan intervention, and I should not delay surgical consultation when obstruction is suspected [^e0306294] [^0a8752eb].

> I will now examine initial management principles, and I need to ensure I tailor therapy to the elderly. Supportive care with small, frequent sips of clear fluids, correction of electrolytes, and antiemetics is first-line in the absence of red flags. For antiemetics, ondansetron is often preferred in older adults due to a more favorable safety profile, whereas dopamine antagonists like metoclopramide or prochlorperazine carry higher risks of extrapyramidal symptoms and should be used cautiously with dose adjustments and monitoring. I should confirm there is no prolonged QT before using ondansetron and avoid antipsychotics in patients with dementia-related psychosis due to increased mortality risk [^bf3d1737] [^3c321606] [^1d8870d1] [^131c1e31].

> Hold on, I should verify medication cautions specific to the elderly. Phenothiazines such as prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine have boxed warnings for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis and can cause tardive dyskinesia, so I should avoid them in this population unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk and alternatives are unavailable. If I must use a dopamine antagonist, I should use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely for EPS, and avoid concurrent QT-prolonging drugs [^1d8870d1] [^131c1e31] [^c1f34b2c].

> Let me reconsider the disposition thresholds, because I need to ensure I am not underestimating risk. Indications for emergency department evaluation include hematemesis, severe abdominal pain, signs of dehydration or shock, altered mental status, bilious vomiting, chest pain, or failure of outpatient management within 24 to 48 hours. Given the higher prevalence of serious disease in older adults, a lower threshold for ED referral is appropriate even when alarm features are subtle [^0a8752eb].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety-netting, and I will double-check that instructions are clear. If managed as an outpatient, I will advise return precautions for worsening vomiting, inability to retain fluids, bloody emesis, severe abdominal pain, fever, confusion, or chest pain, and arrange timely primary care follow-up to reassess for persistent symptoms, medication review, and consideration of further testing such as upper endoscopy if symptoms persist beyond a week or if weight loss, anemia, or alarm features emerge [^0a8752eb].

Grandma's morning vomiting is most likely due to **common causes** such as gastroenteritis, medication side effects, or gastroparesis, but in older adults we must also consider **serious conditions** like myocardial infarction, bowel obstruction, or electrolyte disturbances [^bf3d1737] [^22b11033] [^e0306294]. Immediate evaluation should focus on **red flags** (blood, severe pain, confusion, chest pain, dehydration) and key history (medications, comorbidities, recent meals) [^0a8752eb]. If red flags are present, go to the ER; otherwise, start with oral rehydration, a short course of an antiemetic (ondansetron preferred), and close follow-up. Persistent vomiting, weight loss, or new symptoms warrant urgent evaluation [^ebdba6e2] [^bf3d1737].

## Common causes of vomiting in elderly patients

Several **common causes** of vomiting in elderly patients include:

- **Gastroenteritis**: Viral or bacterial infections are common causes of acute vomiting [^bf3d1737].

- **Medication side effects**: Many medications commonly used by elderly patients, such as NSAIDs, antibiotics, digoxin, and opioids, can cause nausea and vomiting [^notfound].

- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying is common in elderly patients, particularly those with diabetes [^notfound].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: GERD is common in elderly patients and can cause nausea and vomiting [^notfound].

- **Constipation**: Chronic constipation can lead to nausea and vomiting in elderly patients [^notfound].

---

## Serious conditions that can present with vomiting in elderly patients

While many cases of vomiting in elderly patients are benign, several **serious conditions** can present with vomiting and require immediate medical attention:

- **Myocardial infarction**: Elderly patients may present with nausea and vomiting as the primary symptoms of a heart attack [^22b11033].

- **Bowel obstruction**: Intestinal obstruction is a serious condition that can present with vomiting, particularly if the vomitus is bilious or feculent [^e0306294].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Severe electrolyte imbalances, such as hypercalcemia or hyponatremia, can cause nausea and vomiting [^notfound].

- **Acute kidney failure**: Renal failure can present with nausea and vomiting in elderly patients [^notfound].

- **Central nervous system disorders**: Stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or increased intracranial pressure can present with vomiting [^0a8752eb].

---

## Immediate evaluation and management

When evaluating an elderly patient with vomiting, the following steps are recommended:

- **Assess for red flag symptoms**: Determine if the patient has any of the following: blood in vomit, severe abdominal pain, chest pain, confusion, dehydration, or signs of shock [^0a8752eb].

- **Obtain a detailed history**: Ask about the duration and frequency of vomiting, associated symptoms (fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, headache), recent medication changes, dietary history, and comorbidities [^bf3d1737].

- **Perform a physical examination**: Evaluate vital signs, hydration status, abdominal examination, and neurological assessment [^202e8721].

- **Initial diagnostic tests**: Consider basic laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, renal function, glucose) and plain abdominal radiography if obstruction is suspected [^0a8752eb].

- **Empiric treatment**: If no red flags are present, initiate supportive care with oral rehydration, small frequent meals, and antiemetic medication (ondansetron preferred due to lower risk of side effects in elderly patients) [^bf3d1737] [^3c321606].

---

## Indications for urgent medical evaluation

Urgent medical evaluation is indicated if any of the following are present:

- Blood in vomit (hematemesis) [^0a8752eb].

- Severe abdominal pain or distension [^0a8752eb].

- Chest pain or signs of cardiac distress [^22b11033].

- Confusion, lethargy, or altered mental status [^0a8752eb].

- Signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, decreased urine output, hypotension) [^0a8752eb].

- Persistent vomiting lasting more than 48 hours [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures and follow-up care

Preventive measures and follow-up care are essential to manage and prevent recurrence:

- **Medication review**: Regularly review and adjust medications that may cause nausea and vomiting [^77ad7b87].

- **Dietary modifications**: Small, frequent meals, avoidance of trigger foods, and adequate hydration [^bf3d1737].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up to monitor for chronic conditions such as diabetes, renal function, and electrolyte imbalances [^c7e0f003].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients and caregivers about warning signs and when to seek medical attention [^0a8752eb].

Grandma's morning vomiting could be due to common causes like gastroenteritis, medication side effects, or gastroparesis, but serious conditions such as myocardial infarction, bowel obstruction, or electrolyte disturbances must be considered [^bf3d1737] [^22b11033] [^e0306294]. Immediate evaluation should focus on **red flags** and key history, with urgent medical evaluation if any concerning symptoms are present [^0a8752eb].

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^0a8752eb]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

Results

Clinical characteristics of the syndrome

Forty-one adults (24 men and 17 women) presented at between 20 and 64 years of age (average, 34 years; median, 34 yrs) for evaluation of recurrent vomiting. The age at onset of the first episode ranged from 2 to 49 years (mean, 21 yrs; median 20 yrs).

The duration of the CVS at the time of consultation ranged from less than 1 year to 43 years (mean, 12 yrs; median, 7 yrs.).

The severity of CVS at the time of the consultation was deemed mild if it did not interfere with patients' ability to attend work or school; moderate, if employment or school enrollment were in jeopardy; and severe if the amount of time they were incapacitated by cyclic vomiting equaled or exceeded the amount of time they were well. Of 39 patients, 3 had mild, 17 had moderate, and 19 had severe CVS. Seven had been treated in emergency departments and as in-patients more than 100 times each. Four patients lost peripheral venous access and required central venous catheters. Thirteen (32%) were completely disabled and required financial support.

Stereotypy of episodes

CVS episodes tend to be similar in duration and symptomatology over months or years. Eighty-five percent of 39 patients had attacks of fairly uniform length and 15% had attacks of varying lengths (Figure 2). Typical hours of onset in 29 patients are depicted in Figure 3. Most patients' episodes began between midnight and noon. Seven additional patients included four who reported "mornings", one who reported "afternoons or evenings", and two who reported that episodes began at any time during the day or night. Data were insufficient in five patients.

Triggering factors

Sixty-three percent of patients (16 men and 10 women) identified conditions that seemed to trigger the onset of cyclic vomiting episodes. The most frequent triggers reported by women were: menstrual periods in 7, noxious stress in 7, pleasant excitement in 5 and fatigue in 3. The commonest triggers in men were: noxious stress in 11, pleasant excitement in 8 and infections in 4.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^1f470c54]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — diagnosis and clinical features emphasize recognition of a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by acute episodes of nausea, vomiting, and retching, separated in time by episode-free periods. In essence, a clinician should consider CVS as a potential diagnosis in any adult presenting with the core clinical feature of episodic bouts of repetitive vomiting. CVS has 4 distinct phases — inter-episodic, prodromal, emetic, and recovery — each of which is associated with a distinct treatment approach and management goal. Like other disorders of gut–brain interaction, CVS is diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, as established by the Rome Foundation. The hallmark of CVS is recurrent, acute episodes of nausea and retching, and although most patients meet Rome IV criteria, there is a wide range of presentations and clinical severity seen in clinical practice. First, many patients (approximately 65%) with CVS experience prodromal symptoms, lasting a median of 1 hour, before the onset of vomiting. Third, abdominal pain is present in most patients during a CVS episode and thus, this symptom should not preclude a diagnosis of CVS. Finally, although CVS episodes can present at any time of day, most episodes tend to occur in the early morning hours.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^a1f0c5ed]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — epidemiology and care burden in adults is marked by frequent health-care utilization and disability: Approximately one-half of people with CVS visit the emergency department (ED) at least annually, and 1 in 3 adults with CVS will become disabled. The prevalence of CVS is approximately 2% in the United States and is more common in women. Although there are effective treatments for most patients, the condition remains underdiagnosed and thus undertreated, with most patients experiencing years of diagnostic delays, extensive and futile investigations, and even unnecessary surgical procedures. Yet, only a small fraction of all individuals with CVS are likely to have received a CVS diagnosis. Access to care, early recognition of CVS, and appropriate treatment can reduce CVS symptoms, reduce health care utilization, and improve patients' quality of life.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life," especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^bf3d1737]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^817e1b69]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — future directions and conclusions — There are major gaps in understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CVS, which limits the development of more effective treatments. Similarly, an incomplete understanding of the clinical features and comorbidities that predict clinical responses is a barrier to developing personalized therapeutic approaches. Clinical research leveraging multicenter, standardized registries of patients with CVS and directed investments by both industry and governmental sources are needed. CVS is a common and disabling condition in adults, but need not be so, as it is a treatable condition, and prompt recognition remains the key factor in avoiding unnecessary investigations and providing patients with effective treatments.

Nausea–vomiting — patient presentation and assessment emphasize goals to identify metabolic causes and prevent volume loss, with inclusion defined by active symptoms. Patient care goals are to "Identify hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia" and "Prevent dehydration." Inclusion is "Currently nauseated and/or vomiting." Assessment includes "Routine patient care (e.g., vital signs)," a "History and physical examination focused on potential causes of nausea and vomiting… as well as medications that may prolong the QT interval," and "3.

### Anticipatory nausea in cyclical vomiting [^1160e981]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

One study found ANV in 59% of paediatric cancer patients. Development of ANV is positively correlated with severity of vomiting (intensity, frequency, duration) and number of chemotherapy cycles ('conditioning trials'); and inversely with patient age. In CVS, the severity of emesis and number of conditioning trials can exceed that in chemotherapy patients, and CVS mainly affects children. Based on these predictors, and the intrinsic evolutionary links between conditioning and nausea, other CVS patients might develop ANV, as illustrated by another young woman's description: " [For] about two months. I would get sick every Saturday morning. I would be sick until Wednesday, feel good on Thursday and Friday and then the cycle would start all over. Looking back at it now, I know I worried when next Saturday would roll around. I think I worried myself so much that in a way I helped my body into the cycle". We believe that ANV could complicate many CVS cases in addition to these two, but is extremely difficult for clinicians to recognise. Whilst triggers for chemotherapy-associated ANV are specific, controlled, and can be objectively observed by doctors within the hospital; the conditioned stimuli for CVS-associated ANV are subtle (e.g. certain day of the week), subjective (e.g. fear of a CVS attack), and occur outside of the hospital, thus are invisible to doctors. As a first-hand account, this case report therefore provides a unique, qualitative perspective on triggering factors as viewed through the eye of the patient, and reveals the hidden role of conditioning.

### Drugs for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults in the emergency department setting [^807c77f1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting is a common and distressing presenting complaint in emergency departments (ED). The aetiology of nausea and vomiting in EDs is diverse and drugs are commonly prescribed. There is currently no consensus as to the optimum drug treatment of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Objectives

To provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of antiemetic medications in the management of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1966 to August 2014), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1980 to August 2014) and ISI Web of Science (January 1955 to August 2014). We also searched relevant clinical trial registries and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any drug in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the treatment of adults in the ED. Study eligibility was not restricted by language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias in included studies. We contacted authors of studies to obtain missing information if required.

Main Results

We included eight trials, involving 952 participants, of which 64% were women. Included trials were generally of adequate quality, with six trials at low risk of bias, and two trials at high risk of bias. Three trials with 518 participants compared five different drugs with placebo; all reported the primary outcome as mean change in visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 100) for nausea severity from baseline to 30 minutes. Trials did not routinely report other primary outcomes of the change in nausea VAS at 60 minutes or number of vomiting episodes. Differences in mean VAS change from baseline to 30 minutes between placebo and the drugs evaluated were: metoclopramide (three trials, 301 participants; mean difference (MD) -5.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -11.33 to 0.80), ondansetron (two trials, 250 participants; MD -4.32, 95% CI -11.20 to 2.56), prochlorperazine (one trial, 50 participants; MD -1.80, 95% CI -14.40 to 10.80), promethazine (one trial, 82 participants; MD -8.47, 95% CI -19.79 to 2.85) and droperidol (one trial, 48 participants; MD -15.8, 95% CI -26.98 to -4.62). The only statistically significant change in baseline VAS to 30 minutes was for droperidol, in a single trial of 48 participants. No other drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo. Other included trials evaluated a drug compared to "active controls" (alternative antiemetic). There was no convincing evidence of superiority of any particular drug compared to active control. All trials included in this review reported adverse events, but they were variably reported precluding meaningful pooling of results. Adverse events were generally mild, there were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there were not enough data.

Authors' Conclusions

In an ED population, there is no definite evidence to support the superiority of any one drug over any other drug, or the superiority of any drug over placebo. Participants receiving placebo often reported clinically significant improvement in nausea, implying general supportive treatment such as intravenous fluids may be sufficient for the majority of people. If a drug is considered necessary, choice of drug may be dictated by other considerations such as a person's preference, adverse-effect profile and cost. The review was limited by the paucity of clinical trials in this setting. Future research should include the use of placebo and consider focusing on specific diagnostic groups and controlling for factors such as intravenous fluid administered.

### A case of nausea and vomiting to remember [^feaf4215]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are the most common overlooked debilitating symptoms that significantly impact the quality of life and acute care we provide as physicians. The duo has an extensive aetiology ranging from common known causes to uncommon idiopathic reasons. Our case illustrates the fact that identifying the aetiology of nausea and vomiting can be lifesaving, given the characteristics of the patient. This case is about a 31-year-old Caucasian woman, with history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on insulin pump since the age 2, Hypothyroidism, diabetic peripheral neuropathy with no significant known family history, who was admitted with intractable nausea and vomiting. She was discharged twice from hospital after temporary symptom control with presumed diagnosis of diabetic gastroparesis. Her third hospital visit enabled us to identify the cause of her symptoms being Addison's crisis rather than gastroparesis.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^4889bbb3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome: what a gastroenterologist needs to know [^073af1c7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

CVS (cyclic vomiting syndrome) is a functional disorder that may occur in any age group of patients. In the past the disorder was considered to be fairly uncommon of unknown etiology. Treatment has generally been based on anecdotal reports.

Methods

Literature review was performed based on internet/Medline search as of April 2006.

Results

CVS is much more common than previously thought, especially in adults and is commonly associated with migraine headaches and sharing many of its characteristic features. Genetic association with mitochondrial DNA has been recognized with CVS. Prompt diagnosis is essential in order to prevent the significant morbidity associated with CVS. It is mandatory to rule out certain life-threatening disorders that can mimic CVS. Treatment options are based on the particular phase of the syndrome in which a patient is in and carried out in a systematic manner.

Conclusion

Expert consensus is that CVS is a distinct disorder and is a part of the migraine spectrum (migraine headaches, CVS, and abdominal migraines). Once patients are properly diagnosed, treatment is highly effective. Because of renewed interest in CVS since the 1990's, many more patients in all age groups are being recognized who suffer from this disabling disorder. An increase in basic science and clinical research in CVS will hopefully lead to better patient outcomes.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^ddc0b12c]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, commonly known as "morning sickness", affects approximately 80 percent of pregnant women. Although several theories have been proposed, the exact cause remains unclear. Recent research has implicated Helicobacter pylori as one possible cause. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is generally a mild, self-limited condition that may be controlled with conservative measures. A small percentage of pregnant women have a more profound course, with the most severe form being hyperemesis gravidarum. Unlike morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum may have negative implications for maternal and fetal health. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients with nonresolving or worsening symptoms to rule out the most common pregnancy-related and nonpregnancy-related causes of severe vomiting. Once pathologic causes have been ruled out, treatment is individualized. Initial treatment should be conservative and should involve dietary changes, emotional support, and perhaps alternative therapy such as ginger or acupressure. Women with more complicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy also may need pharmacologic therapy. Several medications, including pyridoxine and doxylamine, have been shown to be safe and effective treatments. Pregnant women who have severe vomiting may require hospitalization, orally or intravenously administered corticosteroid therapy, and total parenteral nutrition.

### Chlorpromazine (chlorproMAZINE hydrochloride) [^131c1e31]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychos is treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychos is (see BOXED WARNING).

The extrapyramidal symptoms which can occur secondary to chlorpromazine may be confused with the central nervous system signs of an undiagnosed primary disease responsible for the vomiting, e.g. Reye's syndrome or other encephalopathy. The use of chlorpromazine and other potential hepatotoxins should be avoided in children and adolescents whose signs and symptoms suggest Reye's syndrome.

Tardive Dyskinesia: Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

### Vomiting [^e0306294]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Vomiting can be the presenting symptom of a variety of disorders, ranging from self-limited diseases to life-threatening diseases. The causes of vomiting vary with age of presentation, and pediatricians should develop the skill to identify serious conditions at the earliest stage based on the age of presentation. Bilious emesis at any age is a sign of intestinal obstruction until proven otherwise and needs immediate attention. Vomiting is not always due to a GI disorder, and pediatricians should look for causes outside the GI tract if no GI disease is identified.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum [^fedab875]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy:

- **Definition**: NVOP, often referred to as morning sickness, is a common condition affecting the majority of pregnancies. It typically presents in the first trimester and is characterized by mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting. HG is a more severe form of NVOP characterized by excessive, persistent nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and hospital admission.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of NVOP is not fully understood, but it is believed that a combination of hormonal changes, gastric dysrhythmias, and heightened olfactory and gustatory sensitivity may contribute to its development. Pregnancy-related hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, and hCG have been widely studied, and other hormones such as leptin, placental GH, prolactin, thyroid, and adrenal cortical hormones have also been implicated. Additionally, infectious, immunological, psychological, metabolic, and anatomical factors may also play a role in its onset.
- **Epidemiology**: Nausea during pregnancy is reported in about 50–80% of individuals, with nausea and vomiting occurring in approximately 50%, and HG affecting about 0.3–3% of pregnant individuals.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for NVOP and HG include a history of these conditions in previous pregnancies, multiple pregnancy, and maternal age. Other factors such as obesity, dysmenorrhea, motion sickness, migraine, and a history of psychiatric disorders have also been associated with NVOP and HG.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, NVOP is characterized by mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting, typically developing in the first trimester of pregnancy. HG is distinguished by severe nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration, orthostatic symptoms, metabolic and electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and eventually necessitate hospital admission. Both NVOP and HG can significantly impact the patient's QoL due to persistent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of NVOP is generally good, with symptoms often resolving with lifestyle and dietary changes, and more severe cases responding to safe and effective treatments. The prognosis of HG is more variable, with some patients experiencing symptoms throughout their pregnancy.

### Practice bulletin no. 153: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^83c47eff]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (). Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about safety of medications (). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (). Mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Schematic representation of the four phases of cyclic vomiting syndrome and their therapeutic goals. 75

Table 3
Proposed data collection sheet for cyclic vomiting syndrome

Fleischer et al 75 described patterns of coalescence with CVS wherein over a period of time, the duration of individual episodes gets longer while asymptomatic intervals shorten, eventually leading to a pattern that resembles chronic daily vomiting. In others, chronic daily nausea becomes superimposed on acute vomiting episodes resulting in continuous symptomatology and disability. Encountering a patient in a coalescent phase of their illness presents a diagnostic challenge as the illness may not be recognizable as CVS by most clinicians. When the typical episodic pattern is lost (often occurring over years), a careful history focusing on symptoms at the onset of the disorder is important to make an accurate diagnosis, as most patients endorse a discernable cyclic pattern that was part of the initial presentation.

2.5 Statistical analysis

Given the size and heterogeneity of included studies, the majority of results were suitable to narrative summary. Quantitative outcomes were calculated using Open Meta.

2.6 Quality or certainty of evidence

The GRADE approach was used to rate the certainty in the evidence. In this approach, direct evidence from RCTs starts at high quality and can be rated down to levels of moderate, low, and very low quality, based on risk of bias in the body of evidence (or study quality), indirectness (addressing a different but related population, intervention, or outcome, from the one of interest), imprecision (of the summary estimate and boundaries of 95% CI), inconsistency (or heterogeneity in the results of the included studies), and/or publication bias. Due to inherent limitations in observational studies (selection bias, unmeasured confounding, etc.), evidence derived from observational studies starts at low quality and then is potentially downgraded based on the aforementioned factors or upgraded in case of dose‐response relationship and large magnitude of effect. High‐quality evidence suggests that we are confident of the quality of the evidence and/or the direction and magnitude of the effect estimate, and any new data are unlikely to alter this. Moderate certainty suggests that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty suggests that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Finally, very low certainty: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Judgments about the certainty in the evidence were made via discussion among the panel, and any disagreements were resolved by group consensus.

2.7 Evidence‐to‐decision framework

Information from this review was used in combination with factors such as patients' values and preferences, cost‐effectiveness data (if available), and resource utilization to inform the development of the clinical guideline.

### Rectosigmoid gallstone coleus: a rare emergency presentation [^186e90ef]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

An elderly woman presented with abdominal pain and vomiting, was known to have gallstones. A CT scan was arranged identifying gallstone ileus and cholecystitis. Ensuing sepsis precipitated fast atrial fibrillation delaying the planned laparotomy. Her symptoms subsequently resolved with conservative management. Ten days following admission her abdomen became distended. A repeat CT scan showed large bowel dilation with intramural air suggestive of obstruction and bowel ischaemia. Emergency laparotomy was performed identifying a large 23 mm gallstone impacted at the rectosigmoid junction (gallstone coleus). The stone was milked back to the transverse colon where it was retrieved and a transverse loop colostomy was formed. Gallstone ileus is rare; gallstone coleus is even rarer. On review of the published literature both entities have not been seen in the same patient during the same admission or indeed caused by the same gallstone.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — clinical features and burden include recurrent, discrete, self-limited episodes defined by symptom-based criteria and the absence of positive laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic testing, with intense vomiting and early-morning onset described. A large case series found that although it affects only 5% to 15% of a child's lifetime, it results in 24 days of missed school and an annualized cost of care of $17,035. The vomiting is intense (median 6 times/ hour at peak), often bilious (83% in some series), and episodes often commence in the early morning (eg, 3–4 AM or upon awakening). CVS starts commonly in early childhood, and the vomiting symptoms may abate with the onset of classical migraine headaches during adolescence.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^6666abe0]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

About 50% - 90% of all pregnancies are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. According to a study of more than 360 pregnant women, only 2% experienced only nausea in the morning whereas, in 80%, complaints persisted throughout the day. The condition is usually self-limiting and peaks at around 9 weeks gestation. At 20 weeks symptoms typically cease. However, in up to 20% of cases, nausea and vomiting may continue until delivery.

This condition is known as nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) or emesis gravidarum and is of no pathological significance as long as the affected women do not feel unwell or restricted in their daily life. There are, however, different grades in the scope of NVP, which range from occasional morning-sickness to excessive vomiting that persists throughout the day. The most severe grade of NVP often leads to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG; see below), but it can be difficult to differentiate between the two conditions.

A prospective study of more than 9000 pregnant women showed that NVP occurred significantly more often in primigravidas and in women who were less educated, younger, non-smokers and overweight or obese. The incidence of NVP was also higher in women with a history of nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy.

In order to exclude differential diagnoses the following crucial parameters should be investigated: Onset of nausea and vomiting (nearly all of the cases begin before 9 weeks of gestation), attendant symptoms, underlying chronic disorders or, in rare cases, hereditary diseases (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting.

Figure 2
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting in respect to abdominal symptoms.

A small percentage of pregnant women experience a severe form of nausea and vomiting that is termed HG (synonym: excessive vomiting during pregnancy). This disorder has an estimated incidence of 0.5% - 2% of all live births. A standard definition of HG is the occurrence of more than three episodes of vomiting per day with ketonuria and more than 3 kg or 5% weight loss. However, the diagnosis is usually made clinically following the exclusion of other causes.

The mean effective dose in adults is 75‐100 mg daily or 1‐1.5 mg/kg body weight. 3, 15, 28 Amitriptyline is best titrated in 10‐25 mg increments as this improves tolerability by allowing adaptation to and preventing discontinuation from side effects, particularly daytime sedation. This improves the ultimate efficacy of the medication. Most of the panelists used 10 mg but some used 25 mg. As always, this needs to be individualized based upon the patient response. The incidence of side effects with AT varies from 9% to 25% although this did not result in discontinuation of the drug in most studies. 19 Side effects include daytime sedation, weight gain, dryness of mouth, and constipation. The night‐time administration of AT can often promote sleep, whereas the lingering daytime sedation tends to improve or resolve in 8‐12 weeks. Though most studies have only evaluated AT, NT may be used alternatively to minimize side effects. Given the risk of prolongation of the QTc interval and cardiac arrhythmias, we recommend obtaining an EKG at baseline, once during titration at ~50 mg and after the target dose is reached. More frequent monitoring will vary between individual patients, based on their response to AT and concomitant use of other medications that can prolong the QT interval. It is recommended that the QTc be maintained at < 470 msec for women and < 450 msec for men. The dosage of AT should be reduced or stopped if there is QTc prolongation or development of significant side effects. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias appears to be low, and no serious adverse events have been reported with its use in CVS. Serious psychiatric side effects such as psychotic reactions, hypomania, and delirium may occur with the treatment of depression with amitriptyline but are not reported in CVS, perhaps due to the higher doses typically used to treat the former. 29

### Anticipatory nausea in cyclical vomiting [^7a47ebdb]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Case report

A 28-year-old postdoctoral researcher experienced multiple episodes of vomiting from the age of 3 years. The episodes occurred with upper respiratory tract infections and asthma, and generally lasted 24–48 hours. The patient's mother had nearly identical episodes during childhood. The maternal grandmother experienced hyperemesis gravidarum. The patient's sister and paternal grandfather had classical migraine headaches.

The patient first presented to the hospital at age 10 1/2 years. A typical vomiting attack had been triggered by a cold, but had not resolved after four days. Despite treatment with intravenous fluids, the vomiting continued for a further two days before resolving. Cyclical vomiting was diagnosed. She was subsequently hospitalised repeatedly with episodes of about four days duration, with vomiting occurring every 5 to 10 minutes at peak. She continued to have similar attacks during every infection, but never without prior infection. The symptoms were refractory to anti-emetics available at the time (eg. metoclopramide, prochlorperazine).

Shortly before Christmas of that year (1986), a 6 1/2-day vomiting episode was triggered by pneumonia, and the patient spent the Christmas period in hospital. The following year (1987), a cold triggered a CVS attack two days before Christmas. Having spent two successive Christmases in hospital, the patient hoped to be well the next year. However, she was woken by nausea in the early hours of Christmas Day 1988 and began vomiting. Uniquely, this episode had not been triggered by an infection, and the patient (then aged thirteen) recognised this. Subsequently, episodes rapidly increased in frequency: compared with an average of 7.3 episodes per year in the three preceding years, the patient averaged 22.3 episodes per year over the three years following Christmas 1988. Many further episodes now occurred without infection, but coincided with visits to certain places (e.g. friend's house), or commenced on specific days of the week (e.g. Saturday). Most episodes resulted in 3–8 day hospitalisations. At one point, a repetitive cycle commenced, where each episode occurred exactly two days after discharge from hospital following the previous attack. The patient was aware of this pattern and consciously afraid of becoming ill at the expected time. Her attacks always commenced nocturnally and she became reluctant to go to sleep, fearful of another episode beginning.

### Approach to the patient: diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults [^71d47f5d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 1

An 18-year-old woman contacted her general practitioner because of nausea and abdominal pain. She was previously well except vitiligo, which developed at 3 years of age. An elevated TSH value was found (20 mIE/L, range 0.35–4.9), and she was started on a replacement dose with L-thyroxine. Initially she felt better, but then her symptoms worsened, and she would often throw up after breakfast before going to school. She was referred to an endocrinologist who on suspicion of adrenal insufficiency tested adrenocortical function. In a morning sample he found a serum cortisol at 288 nmol/L (range 60–600), plasma ACTH 5.3 pmol/L (range < 11.6), plasma renin 55.8 mIE/L (range 4.4–46.1), and serum aldosterone at 75.1 pmol/L (range 49–1086), all in the normal range except a slightly elevated plasma renin. However, assay of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies revealed an extremely elevated value at > 5000 U/mL (range < 1.0).

Due to persisting symptoms, a standard 0.25 mg cosyntropin test was performed 6 months later. Cortisol climbed from 411 to 595 and 602 nmol/L after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. ACTH in the basal test was 10.1 pmol/L, renin 149 mIE/L, and aldosterone 90.4 pmol/L. TSH was still elevated, and the L-thyroxine dose was increased. She was also started on fludrocortisone since renin was now clearly elevated and aldosterone relatively low. She was also informed of the risk of overt adrenal insufficiency and prescribed cortisone acetate to use in case she got worse. Fludrocortisone improved her nausea and alleviated dizziness, but she still vomited at least twice a week.

During the next 6 months she moved to another city to start college studies. Her mother, who saw her occasionally, noted darkening of the skin. She was then referred to our hospital and when seen at the first appointment, ACTH levels were strikingly elevated (> 278 pmol/L). The corresponding morning cortisol was 209 nmol/L. A new cosyntropin test revealed serum cortisol at 233 nmol/L before and 234 and 225 nmol/L after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Daily cortisone acetate replacement was started. Review of her history revealed considerable salt craving.

### Prochlorperazine maleate [^c1f34b2c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Prochlorperazine maleate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING).

The extrapyramidal symptoms which can occur secondary to prochlorperazine may be confused with the central nervous system signs of an undiagnosed primary disease responsible for the vomiting, e.g. Reye's syndrome or other encephalopathy. The use of prochlorperazine and other potential hepatotoxins should be avoided in children and adolescents whose signs and symptoms suggest Reye's syndrome.

Tardive Dyskinesia: Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic drug treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^0514bae8]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Temporal patterns and severity classification in cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) note Rome IV cutoffs for typical episode length < 7 days and inter-episode interval ≥ 1 week, yet nearly 15% of patients experience episodes longer than 7 days. The ANMS-CVSA guideline proposed a clinical distinction between mild and moderate–severe CVS, with mild defined as < 4 episodes/y each lasting < 2 days without ED visits or hospitalizations and severe defined as ≥ 4 episodes/y, each lasting > 2 days, and requiring ED visits or hospitalizations. A subset with coalescent CVS can have daily nausea and vomiting, and the subset of patients with coalescent CVS should be offered prophylactic therapy akin to that for patients with moderate–severe CVS.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a condition that challenges both patients and healthcare providers alike due to the considerable morbidity and misery associated with it and the lack of a clear understanding of pathophysiology and robust therapeutic evidence required to advance treatment. The 10 recommendations, the consensus statement, and treatment algorithms provided aim to bridge the gap between our current knowledge of CVS and how we can best help patients until we have a more complete understanding of this complex condition. Other sections in this special supplement on CVS include a more detailed discussion of CHS, pathophysiology, gaps in knowledge, and future research directions.

2.4 Systematic review process

2.4.1 Search strategy

The literature search was performed initially in June 2016 and updated in February 2018, with the aid of a research librarian (C.S.). Details of the search strategy are reported in the Online Supplement. Individual studies were identified via searches of three bibliographic databases: PubMed (includes MEDLINE), SCOPUS (a large, multidisciplinary database), and CINAHL (the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). Given the acknowledged possibility of diagnostic misclassification, individual search strategies included the following terms: cyclic vomiting; cyclical vomiting; cannabinoid hyperemesis; functional vomiting; abdominal migraine; and periodic syndrome. The searches excluded animal‐only studies and non–English language studies. The search strategy was iteratively developed through refinement with author input to maximize sensitivity. Given the limited total literature, a single search was conducted for all PICO Questions.

For all PICOs, the a priori intent was to rely upon high‐quality systematic reviews for evidence synthesis, particularly those that synthesized data from randomized control trials (RCTs). If systematic reviews of RCTs were not available, we would then look to individual RCTs to generate summary estimates if possible. In the absence of systematic reviews of RCTs or individual RCTs, systematic reviews of observational studies and observational studies were then considered to inform the evidence. Case series of fewer than 10 individuals were excluded, as were narrative reviews.

2.4.2 Study selection criteria

The reviewers utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to develop the review. A PRISMA flow diagram is included in Figure 1. The titles/abstracts from the database searches were uploaded to Covidence, a Web‐based application that facilitates screening and reviewing studies for systematic reviews. All titles and abstracts were screened by two researchers (R.S. and S.S.) with disagreements regarding inclusion and exclusion resolved by discussion. Inclusion criteria included any articles that might be relevant to the included PICO questions. Exclusion criteria were principally around study design as mentioned above. A total of 1469 non‐duplicate articles were found, and 572 full‐text articles were then reviewed. One author (R.S.) extracted data from full‐text articles into a standardized data collection form with accuracy of data extraction confirmed by several members of the systematic review committee. Study characteristics and data extraction are reported in Table 2 a, b.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in 41 adults: the illness, the patients, and problems of management [^fec5de2b]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Keep the patient's room dimly lit and quiet. As much as possible, use brief intervals of spontaneous wakefulness for measurements of vital signs and urine specimen collections so as to minimize interruptions of sleep. Agitation, water seeking and "guzzle-and-vomit" behaviors are far better managed with effective sedation than by attempting to prevent the wakeful patient from engaging in them.

The recovery phase tends to be prolonged when inadequate management of the emetic phase has permitted severe fluid and electrolyte deficits or weight loss. Some patients are able to tolerate a regular diet as soon as their nausea subsides. Others may suffer a relapse if they take more than clear liquids initially. Prophylactic medications should be resumed as soon as the patient is able to do so comfortably.

Follow-up data suggest that the prognosis for CVS is generally favorable. Our clinical impression is that the severity and duration of CVS are influenced by the tractability of the co-morbidities that predispose to episodes. Although assiduous management of its physical and psychological aspects seems to benefit patients, the relationship between its course and treatment modalities remains to be clarified by future prospective studies. Such research will require clear descriptions of the range of clinical features of adult CVS, a goal towards which this work aims to contribute.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^b11bf7ee]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — recovery and emergency department (ED) care — If a patient cannot abort an episode at home, presentation to an ED for intravenous (IV) fluids and IV abortive therapy is reasonable, though many with shorter-duration attacks (ie, < 24 hours) tend to stay home and not seek ED-based care. In the recovery phase, the priority is to consume electrolyte-rich fluids (ie, sports drinks) or nutrient drinks; patients may feel nauseated or have dyspeptic symptoms but can generally tolerate moderate liquid volumes, and most patients' recovery phase lasts approximately 1–2 days. For ED management, all patients presenting with uncontrolled retching and vomiting should be treated regardless of suspicion for potential cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS); severe abdominal pain may in only the most severe refractory forms require a dose of narcotic pain medication as part of an abortive regimen, whereas non-narcotic approaches are preferable, with many patients doing best in a quiet, darker room in the ED along with IV benzodiazepines to induce sedation. All patients with CVS should receive IV dextrose-containing fluids, and most benefit from IV administration of antiemetic medication; although typically reserved for use in the ED, patients with CVS also respond to sedating antipsychotic medications (eg, droperidol and haloperidol).

An 82-year-old woman was admitted with severe vomiting and progressive dysphagia mainly to solids. She gave a 3-month history of increasing heartburn, vomiting, tiredness, lethargy, anorexia and 13 kg weight loss. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she was a non-smoker. Physical examination revealed evidence of significant weight loss and dehydration only. Gastroscopy revealed mild oesophagitis, tongues of Barrett oesophagus and mild antral gastritis. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was normal. Unfortunately her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died from aspiration pneumonia. Postmortem examination revealed thickening of the muscular wall of lower oesophagus and pylorus, but without any malignancy. The histological assessment of the oesophageal as well as gastric biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of gastrointestinal amyloidosis accounting for her symptoms of dysphagia and vomiting respectively.

### The onset of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^a8a2c906]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Onset of symptoms

From ovulation, symptoms start approximately two weeks earlier, and are more concentrated than from LMP (Fig. 2). Two-thirds of women have onset within 11 to 20 days from ovulation day, and only 5% have earlier onset. The median from ovulation to symptom onset is 16 days and from LMP is 32 days. For onset from LMP, 67% have onset within 26 to day 40 (Fig. 2), with highest frequency at 28 days after LMP. Again, precision is greater when measuring pregnancy from ovulation (Table 2). Symptoms start slightly earlier for women with higher BMI values (Fig. 3), by about one day for an increase of 5 kg/m 2 (regression coefficient -0.225, standard error 0.075). Predicted onset is day 20 for a woman with BMI 18 kg/m 2 and day 16 for a woman with BMI 35 kg/m 2. Symptoms start slightly later with increasing age (Fig. 3), by almost one day for an increase of 3 years (regression coefficient 0.295, standard error 0.094). Predicted onset is day 14 for an 18 year old, and day 21 for a 41 year old woman.

Fig. 2
Distribution of onset of symptoms from LMP and from Ovulation (214 women)

Fig. 3
Onset of symptoms from ovulation: association with age and body mass index (BMI), 214 women

Symptoms disappeared by week 7 from LMP for 20 (8%) of the volunteers, 11 of whom never vomited and 16 of whom had symptoms less than 2 hours per day. Furthermore, out of the 25 women whose symptoms ended in week 8 of their pregnancies, 15 had symptoms less than 2 hours per day. These 32–35 women (12–14% of the study population) with early or mild symptoms might have not recorded them if they were first asked about their symptoms at a later stage of their pregnancy.

Severity of symptoms

Table (1) provides a high level summary of symptom severity considered as average hours per day. A fifth (22%) of women had minimal nausea and vomiting, with an average of less than an hour per day; 36% averaged more than 4 hours per day. Smokers and those with at least two previous live births tended to have symptoms for longer each day. There is no simple association with miscarriages, and a slight suggestion of lower symptom rates for women with degree level education.

5 Conclusions

To conclude, in this prospective longitudinal study collecting daily, self‐reported patient‐level data, patients with CVS reported high variation in the number and duration of CVS episodes, highlighting the unmet need for evidence‐based guideline definitions for episode start and end, and the frequent presence of CVS symptoms during the interepisodic phase. These data elucidate the symptom patterns of CVS and may contribute to informing the revised diagnostic criteria for CVS.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^eb24f717]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Demographic factors

Successful pain management may require an understanding of demographic characteristics (eg, age, sex, race) that influence the effectiveness or tolerability of opioid therapy. Clinicians contemplating implementation of opioid rotation should consider the following: 1) potential reduction in clearance of morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, and oxymorphone has been reported in elderly patients; 2) aging is associated with higher steady-state concentrations of water-soluble drugs and increased half-life of fat-soluble drugs; and 3) potential for higher steady-state concentration of drugs may necessitate dose adjustments (eg, lower doses; longer interval between doses) to maintain an appropriate balance between long-term analgesia and the risk for adverse events. As a result, older patients may experience similar analgesia at a lower opioid doseand have a greater risk for respiratory depression.

Women are more sensitive to the effects of κ agonistsand are generally more likely than men to experience nausea and vomiting from opioids. Clearance of oxycodoneand hydromorphonemay be reduced in women, making dosage adjustments necessary. Patients of Chinese origin have increased clearance of morphine compared with white patients. Clearance of hydrocodone may be altered in Asian or black patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is being increasingly recognized in adults. 1, 2 It is characterized by episodic nausea and vomiting and is associated with significant morbidity. Approximately one‐third of adult patients become disabled. 3 There is considerable variation in recognition, diagnosis, and management of CVS. The diagnosis for CVS is based on Rome criteria, first developed in 2006 and subsequently revised in 2016. 4, 5 Although their sensitivity and specificity in making a diagnosis of CVS has not been determined, the current Rome IV symptom‐based criteria established a uniform, symptom‐based framework that is useful in clinical practice. While other disorders of nausea and vomiting such as gastroparesis may be confused with CVS, these disorders lack the stereotypical and sudden onset of symptoms, features that appear to be fairly unique to CVS. With further research, the clinical features of CVS will become better delineated, and this information is likely to influence future iterations of symptom‐based CVS diagnostic criteria. For example, many patients with CVS experience abdominal pain during an acute attack, but this feature is not currently incorporated in the Rome IV CVS criteria and should be considered in future revisions.

### Chronic nausea and vomiting: evaluation and treatment [^63f2fc15]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea is an uneasy feeling in the stomach while vomiting refers to the forceful expulsion of gastric contents. Chronic nausea and vomiting represent a diverse array of disorders defined by 4 weeks or more of symptoms. Chronic nausea and vomiting result from a variety of pathophysiological processes, involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal causes. The prevalence of chronic nausea and vomiting is unclear, although the epidemiology of specific conditions, such as gastroparesis and cyclic vomiting syndrome, is better understood. The economic impact of chronic nausea and vomiting and effects on quality of life are substantial. The initial diagnostic evaluation involves distinguishing gastrointestinal causes of chronic nausea and vomiting (e.g., gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome) from non-gastrointestinal causes (e.g., medications, vestibular, and neurologic disorders). After excluding anatomic, mechanical and biochemical causes of chronic nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal causes can be grouped into two broad categories based on the finding of delayed, or normal, gastric emptying. Non-gastrointestinal disorders can also cause chronic nausea and vomiting. As a validated treatment algorithm for chronic nausea and vomiting does not exist, treatment should be based on a thoughtful discussion of benefits, side effects, and costs. The objective of this monograph is to review the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting, emphasizing common gastrointestinal causes.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults [^5c757fcf]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2008). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) was initially described in children but can occur in all age groups. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is increasingly recognized in adults. However, the lack of awareness of CVS in adults has led to small numbers of diagnosed patients and a paucity of published data on the causes, diagnosis and management of CVS in adults. This article is a state-of-knowledge overview on CVS in adults and is intended to provide a framework for management and further investigations into CVS in adults.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of DICLEGIS in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of DICLEGIS or placebo. Two tablets of DICLEGIS were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (± 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily.

Over the treatment period, 19% of DICLEGIS-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe).

At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the DICLEGIS arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with DICLEGIS compared to placebo (see Table 6).

### Gastric volvulus through morgagni hernia: an easily overlooked emergency [^a991800f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intractable vomiting in an elderly patient is an emergency condition requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention. Acute gastric outlet obstruction due to gastric volvulus through Morgagni-type diaphragmatic hernia is an exceedingly rare cause of this nonspecific complaint.

Objective

Our aim was to highlight that Morgagni hernia, although rare in adults, should be suspected in the appropriate clinical setting, and that a clue toward diagnosis often comes from routine chest and abdominal x-ray studies. In addition, we emphasize the atypical radiological findings and importance of emergency surgical intervention in such a case.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 78-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with a 4-day history of intractable vomiting, and with no definitive clue to the diagnosis on examination. Her routine chest and abdomen x-ray studies suggested abnormal air-fluid level at right hemithorax, which prompted a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and an upper gastrointestinal contrast study. Gastric volvulus through a foramen of Morgagni was diagnosed and transthoracic reduction of the contents was performed, along with repair of the defect.

Conclusions

A symptomatic Morgagni hernia in adults, although rare, can present with a variety of symptoms ranging from nonspecific complaints of bloating and indigestion to the more severe complaint of intestinal obstruction. Gastric volvulus and obstructive features are less frequently reported as acute complications of these hernias, which need early identification and intervention.

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^d6f6a861]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

The natural history of CVS in adults indicates that while patients improve with effective therapy in a specialized CVS center, only about 1/5 remain episode‐free over long‐term follow‐up. There is significant heterogeneity in episodes with some patients having short and infrequent (three times a year) episodes, while others have longer episodes occurring two to three times a month. Over time, especially if untreated, both the frequency and the duration of episodes can increase, reducing the asymptomatic periods. This ultimately leads to coalescence or near‐coalescence of symptoms and loss of the typical episodic pattern. However, patients with coalescent CVS still continue to report acute episodes when symptoms flare above their new baseline.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome is also associated with multiple comorbid conditions, such as anxiety, depression, autonomic dysfunction, and migraine headaches, which further add to the disease burden. Approximately 30% of patients with CVS are disabled due to their illness and there is substantial healthcare utilization with annual healthcare costs > 4 times higher compared to non‐CVS patients with this mostly driven by inpatient care.

### Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^baa2ef20]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^9b4288fc]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cannabis use patterns in CVS — experts have proposed that cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a subset of CVS when prolonged (> 1 year) and heavy cannabis use (ie, > 4 times weekly, but often daily) precedes symptom onset; in CVS, cannabis use is more occasional and often postdates onset, and expert consensus states that cannabis cessation required to retrospectively diagnose CHS should be 6 months or at least 3 typical cycle lengths for the patient, after which persistent vomiting rules out CHS; all patients, including those with ongoing cannabis use and diagnostic uncertainty, should be offered abortive and/or prophylactic therapy, which can still be effective despite ongoing cannabis use.

### Management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults: evidence review [^583a7eae]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overview

Study details are presented in Table 2 a, b and summarized for each PICO question in the accompanying evidence profiles. The team acknowledges the limited evidence for CVS with few randomized control trials or high‐quality observational studies leaving us with low‐ or very low‐quality certainty in the evidence across outcomes. Given the paucity of literature on the topic, studies of all populations (adult and pediatric) were included with the assumption that the pathophysiology of CVS was similar in adults and adolescents, and that the effects of the various interventions may be generalizable across some populations. Finally, there was variability in criteria used to diagnose CVS, medication exposures (eg, dosage and length of treatment) that were not consistently reported, and variable definitions for "response to treatment" used by authors across studies.

### Painless aortic dissection with bilateral carotid involvement presenting with vertigo as the chief complaint [^04117f20]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A 63 year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. On arrival, she was fully oriented and cooperative. She denied any pain in her chest, neck, back, or abdomen. A bruit was heard on both sides of her neck. Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed no abnormality, while thoracic CT disclosed dissection in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and bilateral common carotid arteries. After several hours, the patient underwent vascular surgery. She had an uneventful course and was discharged without any sequelae after 10 days. Vertigo is a rare presentation of aortic dissection with carotid involvement. Elderly patients presented with vertigo and nausea/vomiting should be evaluated for the condition and carotid dissection should be ruled out. Carotid bruit may be a clue to the diagnosis.

### Hyperkalemia in a patient with myasthenia gravis: case presentation [^d7c51967]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old Chinese woman who was a carrier of the hepatitis B and C viruses and who had a 2-year history of MG was receiving treatment with oral Mestinon (pyridostigmine 120 mg daily), which controlled her symptoms well (minimal bilateral ptosis, especially in the morning, and proximal muscle power of 4/5). The diagnosis of MG was verified by the presence of high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (54.23 nmol/L). The stimulation single fiber electromyography recorded from orbicularis oculi muscle showed abnormal results (MCD: 180 s), and repetitive nerve stimulation showed no decremental response. A chest computed-tomography (CT) scan showed a thymoma of about 3.2 cm.

She presented with a 7-day history of poor appetite and progressive muscular weakness. Acute exacerbation of MG was initially considered by the neurologist but the muscle weakness did not improve in spite of an increased Mestinon dose to 360 mg daily. She was referred to the nephrology department for further assessment because the laboratory data showed an electrolyte imbalance. Such symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stool, and lower extremity numbness were absent. There was no history of recent strenuous exercise or diuretic use.

On admission, physical examination revealed clear consciousness and symmetrical weakness of the lower extremities. The following laboratory findings were recorded: blood pressure, 116/64 mmHg; heart rate, 82 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.8 °C. Moreover, a generalized skin pigmentation without long-term exposure to sunlight was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.

### Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride [^a50592c1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (± 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily.

Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets -treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe).

At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets compared to placebo (see Table 6).
