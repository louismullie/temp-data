## Question

What are the most common mechanical stressors that contribute to pacemaker lead dysfunction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanical stressors most commonly contribute to pacemaker lead dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and categorize mechanical stressors in a way that maps to lead anatomy and in vivo mechanics. Then, I should verify which stressors are most prevalent and impactful across populations and lead designs. Next, I will examine specific mechanisms of failure for each stressor and quantify where possible. After that, I should consider patient- and device-specific modifiers that amplify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized list and double-check that each assertion is supported by data and consensus statements [^112vY2sk] [^111E4wga].

> Let me first confirm the framework for mechanical stressors. Pacemaker leads are flexible cables that traverse venous, valvular, and myocardial compartments and are subjected to continuous cyclic loading from cardiac motion, respiratory mechanics, and shoulder/arm movement; these forces concentrate at transition zones and fixation points, making them predictable sites of fatigue and insulation injury, so I need to keep those anatomic stress foci in mind as I proceed [^115dUfBS] [^111w4asn].

> I will now examine repetitive flexural and tensile fatigue as a primary mechanical stressor. Wait, let me verify the in vivo stress distribution: the Human Use Condition Study showed that the extravenous segment experiences the greatest alternating curvature during cardiac and shoulder motion, and the length of the highly stressed segment correlates inversely with lead stiffness, which mechanistically explains why conductor fracture and insulation wear cluster near the clavicle and venous entry sites; this is also consistent with device-level observations that pace-sense conductor fractures are the predominant failure mode in many recalled leads, such as the Medtronic Fidelis series, and with the general principle that leads are mechanical components with a finite service life under cyclic loading [^115dUfBS] [^116CfJU6] [^111w4asn].

> Next, I should review tricuspid valve interaction as a major mechanical stressor. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the magnitude of TR worsening after lead implantation. Multiple series report that 18–29% of patients develop new or worsening TR after CIED lead placement, with mechanisms including leaflet impingement, entrapment, tethering, and fibrosis, and the risk is higher with defibrillator leads, posterior/septal leaflet location, and leads traversing between chordae; importantly, lead extraction can improve TR in a substantial proportion, reinforcing causality, though extraction itself carries a nontrivial risk of traumatic TR, so I should be careful to balance benefit and risk when attributing TR to lead mechanics [^113sMkLL] [^115hQeXr] [^1111Acrm].

> Let me consider patient-specific growth and activity as a mechanical stressor, especially in pediatrics. Rapid somatic growth stretches leads and can precipitate dislodgment, insulation breaches, or conductor fractures; pediatric series consistently cite growth-related strain and high activity as drivers of lead failure, and case reports in adolescents with congenital heart disease document late dislodgment linked to inadequate slack loops and fibrous fixation, which aligns with the expectation that longer dwell times plus growth equal higher cumulative tensile fatigue [^114XnJDg] [^112e7wVW] [^115dzpwn].

> I should confirm the contribution of lead design and material properties to mechanical vulnerability. The Riata family's externalized cables illustrate how stiff, redundant components can migrate and erode through insulation, producing "inside-out" failure with high mechanical externalization rates; similarly, bench and clinical data for deep septal pacing show that excessive angulation and preconditioning increase early conductor fracture risk at the interelectrode space, underscoring how local geometry and material fatigue interact in vivo [^1168kYds] [^117GmRa5].

> But wait, what about iatrogenic or procedural mechanical stressors. Twiddler's and related migration syndromes, while uncommon, can kink, retract, or wrap leads, creating acute mechanical failure; likewise, transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions may jail or displace leads, imposing new mechanical stress and risking future extraction complexity; and surgical manipulation or suturing of epicardial leads can cause ischemia and fibrosis, altering local mechanics and fixation integrity, so I need to keep procedural context in mind when evaluating new dysfunction [^114zt3Am] [^1133gbVH] [^116NmBxg].

> Let me synthesize and prioritize. Based on prevalence, clinical impact, and mechanistic plausibility, the most common mechanical stressors are: 1) repetitive flexural and tensile fatigue concentrated in the extravenous segment, 2) tricuspid valve mechanical interference with leaflet/chordal entrapment and fibrosis, 3) patient growth and high activity in children and adolescents, 4) design-related material fatigue and cable motion, and 5) iatrogenic mechanical stress from patient behaviors or structural interventions; I should double-check that this ranking aligns with the cited epidemiology and consensus statements, which it does, noting that fatigue and TV interference are repeatedly emphasized as dominant contributors to lead dysfunction across cohorts and guidelines [^115dUfBS] [^113sMkLL] [^1127BiRT].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. These mechanical stressors translate into conductor fracture, insulation breach, impedance shifts, oversensing/noise, capture failure, and dislodgment; impedance trends and device diagnostics can help distinguish fracture from connection issues, but oversensing of nonphysiologic signals is often the earliest clue to pace-sense conductor failure, and abrupt shock impedance rises or very low pacing impedance can flag high-voltage or insulation problems, respectively; recognizing these patterns early allows timely management and mitigates adverse events, especially in pacemaker-dependent patients [^114v96KV] [^113Pz9um] [^115k4yL5] [^116gcSmw].

The most common mechanical stressors contributing to pacemaker lead dysfunction are **repetitive flexion and torsion** at the clavicle and tricuspid valve [^115dUfBS], causing conductor fracture or insulation breach [^116CfJU6], and **lead dislodgement or migration** [^1119WRtm] due to inadequate slack, poor fixation, or patient factors such as rapid growth, obesity, or vigorous activity [^112e7wVW]. Additional stressors include **tricuspid valve interference** with entrapment or impingement [^111Q3F98], **compression or pinching** from subclavian crush or tight ligatures, and **mechanical fatigue** from cardiac and respiratory motion or shoulder movement [^111w4asn]. These stresses can cause fracture, insulation damage, or dislodgement, leading to sensing, pacing, or shock failures [^114v96KV] [^116gcSmw].

---

## Repetitive flexion and torsion

- **Clavicular stress**: The subclavian region is a high-stress zone; repetitive flexion/torsion from arm/shoulder motion and respiration cause conductor fracture or insulation breach [^115dUfBS].

- **Tricuspid valve stress**: Leads crossing the tricuspid valve experience repetitive flexion/torsion from valve motion, risking fracture or insulation damage [^notfound].

- **Cardiac motion**: Continuous cardiac motion induces cyclic mechanical stress, promoting fatigue and fracture [^115dUfBS] [^1161g9ke].

---

## Lead dislodgement and migration

- **Inadequate slack**: Excess or insufficient slack increases dislodgement risk; rapid growth in children and obesity can exacerbate this [^112e7wVW] [^114XnJDg].

- **Poor fixation**: Passive or active fixation failure allows lead migration or dislodgement [^notfound].

- **Patient activity**: Vigorous activity or shoulder motion can cause dislodgement or migration [^112e7wVW].

---

## Tricuspid valve interference

- **Entrapment or impingement**: Leads can entangle or impinge on leaflets/chordae, impairing function and causing dysfunction [^111Q3F98] [^113sMkLL].

- **Lead position**: Septal or posterior leaflet proximity increases interference risk [^115hQeXr].

- **Fibrosis and adhesions**: Chronic inflammation/fibrosis tether the lead, worsening interference [^1111Acrm].

---

## Compression and pinching

Subclavian crush from costoclavicular compression or ligatures can cause **conductor fracture or insulation damage**, and **tight ligatures** or sutures during fixation can pinch or compress leads, impairing function.

---

## Mechanical fatigue and material degradation

- **Material fatigue**: Repeated loading causes conductor/insulation fatigue and fracture [^115dUfBS] [^117GmRa5].

- **Insulation degradation**: Polyurethane insulation degrades with mechanical/chemical stress, increasing failure risk [^notfound].

- **Environmental stress**: Chronic exposure to body fluids and motion accelerates degradation [^111w4asn].

Recognizing and mitigating these stressors through careful implantation, patient counseling, and follow-up can **reduce lead failure and improve outcomes** [^1127BiRT].

The implantable-cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) lead is the most vulnerable component of the ICD system. Despite advanced engineering design, sophisticated manufacturing techniques, and extensive bench, pre-clinical, and clinical testing, lead failure (LF) remains the Achilles' heel of the ICD system. ICD LF has a broad range of adverse outcomes, ranging from intermittent inappropriate pacing to proarrhythmia leading to patient mortality. ICD LF is often considered in the context of design or construction defects, but is more appropriately considered in the context of the finite service life of a mechanical component placed in chemically stressful environment and subjected to continuous mechanical stresses. This clinical review summarizes LF mechanisms, assessment, and differential diagnosis of LF, including lead diagnostics, recent prominent lead recalls, and management of LF and functioning, but recalled leads. Despite recent advances in lead technology, physicians will likely continue to need to understand how to manage patients with transvenous ICD leads.

### Transvenous pacing leads implanted in epicardial position: a recipe for future epicardial pacing electrode? [^116NmBxg]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Rapid physical growth in children leads to lead stretching. The leads rarely may develop insulation defect due to mechanical stress. Prolonged exposure of leads in the body may weaken the insulation, deposit calcification, resulting in de novo lead fracture, or may subject them to increased risk to injury during surgical manipulation. Suturing the leads to the surface of the heart induces local ischemia and eventually results in fibrotic scarring. The epicardium becomes thickened and is not electrically as conductive as a virgin myocardium. Consequently, most often another position must be found during reoperation. Finding an optimal location to achieve the best interventricular/intraventricular synchrony and achieving the lowest possible threshold in a reoperative environment can be challenging.

The Medtronic SelectSecure 3830 transvenous lead is a lumenless single strand of bipolar lead (with both poles placed at the tip ∼1 cm apart) and is described as magnetic resonance conditional when used in a classic transvenous situation. The lumenless linear design without bifurcating poles makes it thin and thus possibly less susceptible to lead dysfunction compared with other transvenous leads. This lead has been developed, tested, and certified for transvenous use (CE approval 31.01.2003; US market release 03.08.2005).

When confronted with a suboptimal position or high stimulation threshold, often in reoperative environments, we considered using the Medtronic SelectSecure 3830 transvenous lead in the epicardial position. Informed consent of the patient or parental caregivers was obtained. This retrospective study aims to analyze the feasibility, efficacy, and midterm longevity of the transvenous SelectSecure electrodes in the epicardial position. The study explores the hypothesis that this technique helps to quickly achieve a satisfactory stimulation threshold at a desired location, despite adhesions and epicardial scarring.

Central Message

Transvenous SelectSecure lead implantation in the epicardial position is feasible. It may be considered in patients with multiple previous surgeries and pacing lead-induced scarring.

Perspective

This pilot study and the experience provide inputs for the design of an epicardial pacing electrode for the future.

Infants with congenital heart disease and congenital or postoperative conduction disorder often need a permanent pacemaker (PM) system within the first year of life, some requiring replacement within 2 to 5 years. The permanent PM leads can be attached to the heart in 2 ways: transvenous or epicardial.

The primary concern with transvenous placement of pacing leads in children is due to the small size of the veins. Transvenous PM implantation in young children is associated with a high incidence of vascular occlusion/thrombosis, severe regurgitation of atrioventricular (AV) valves, and endocarditis. Rapid body growth and increasing physical activity of the patients may lead to mechanical stress and lead dislocation of transvenous pacing systems. For these reasons, epicardial pacing systems are preferred for this age group. Conventionally, transvenous access was not considered an option for patients with Fontan circulation. However, innovative transcatheter access of the pulmonary venous atrium with placement of transvenous leads in Fontan patients has been described, although at the cost of lifelong anticoagulation and a potential risk of thromboembolism.

Epicardial lead placement is still unequivocally considered more suitable for permanent pacing in infants and small children. Despite that, this approach has its downsides. This procedure is invasive (requiring subxiphoid approach, sternotomy, or thoracotomy) and can be technically more challenging. Epicardial leads also may be associated with a significant failure rate. In a prospective follow-up study, using bipolar steroid-eluting epicardial leads, it was shown that although no intraoperative complications occurred, several reoperations were necessary within 5 years, almost all because of lead problems. The main reason was lead fracture caused by muscular activity. Young children, who primarily benefit from the epicardial pacing system, also have a higher rate of reintervention. Reinterventions typically are required due to exhausted battery power or to lead dysfunction. The former occurs earlier in children because of higher energy consumption (due to higher heart rate); the latter is also more frequent in children because of greater physical activity and the intercostal course of the electrodes, and the exposure of the lead to PM interphase to harsh muscular activity.

### Surgical management of superior vena cava syndrome following pacemaker lead infection: a case report and review of the literature [^1173yZpT]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome is an extremely rare but serious complication of pacemaker-lead implantation, characterised by symptomatic occlusion of the SVC. Malignancy is considered to be the most common aetiology of SVC syndrome, but benign iatrogenic causes from intravascular devices (catheters, cardiac defibrillators and pacemaker wires) are becoming increasingly recognised. Symptoms classically include neck, facial and/or upper limb swelling, along with other neurological complaints, which may all be exacerbated by different postures.

The frequency of pacemaker-induced SVC syndrome is difficult to ascertain; it can either be acute or chronic, with many patients being asymptomatic. The asymptomatic prevalence may be as high as 30% of all patients, with partial or complete venous obstruction. This is due to the development of an adequate venous collateral circulation. However, symptomatic cases of SVC obstruction from transvenous pacemaker implantation are more rare and are thought to account for less than 0.5% of all patients. This can develop over a time period of between 2 days and 206 months. The mortality associated with benign causes of SVC syndrome is low, however those patients who do become symptomatic are often debilitated by it, thus necessitating intervention.

The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon is likely endothelial disruption from mechanical stress or infection of the pacemaker leads, leading to inflammation and fibrosis and subsequently, thrombosis. Several predictors may increase the propensity of thrombus formation and venous occlusion: upgrade of pacemaker devices; more than one pacemaker lead; device and/or lead infection; severed pacemaker leads.

The potential to develop SVC occlusion is a recognised indication for lead extraction. Other indications for device and lead extraction have been set out by the Heart Rhythm Society Expert Consensus. These are broadly categorized into four main categories: a) infection including valvular endocarditis, lead endocarditis or sepsis; b) thrombosis or venous stasis including superior vena cava stenosis or occlusion with limiting symptoms; c) functional and d) non-functional leads. With respect to pacemaker-related infections, the incidence varies greatly, with some reporting rates as low as 0.13%, but this can be as high as 19.9%. Staphylococcus species account for the majority of infections (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), while other gram-negative bacilli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida -species have also been implicated.

Lead dysfunction — In case of lead dysfunction, there is the option of abandoning the lead or extracting it. Lead dysfunction seems the second most frequent reason for lead extraction in the ELECTRa registry. Causes include lead fracture or insulation failure resulting in issues with lead impedance, sensing or capture, and in these cases the electrical parameters may still be normal but the integrity of the lead is clearly compromised.

### Pacemaker malfunction-review of permanent pacemakers and malfunctions encountered in the emergency department [^117Grfbu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pacemaker malfunction refers to a failure of the pacemaker to perform the desired cardiac pacemaking function. These malfunctions can occur anywhere within the system from the pulse generator and leads to the electrode-myocardium interface. These failures of sensing, capture, and inadequate pacing can have severe hemodynamic consequences, so rapid identification of specific dysfunction is critical to intervention and stabilization. Emergency providers should be aware of pacemaker components, function, basic programming, and types of malfunctions to adequately assess, stabilize, and disposition patients.

### Tricuspid valve dysfunction following pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator implantation [^111Q3F98]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The potential for cardiac implantable electronic device leads to interfere with tricuspid valve (TV) function has gained increasing recognition as having hemodynamic and clinical consequences associated with incremental morbidity and death. The diagnosis and treatment of lead-related (as distinct from functional) tricuspid regurgitation pose unique challenges. Because of pitfalls in routine diagnostic imaging, a high level of clinical suspicion must be maintained to avoid overlooking the possibility that worsening heart failure is a consequence of mechanical interference with TV leaflet mobility or coaptation and is amenable to lead extraction or valve repair or replacement. The future of cardiac implantable electronic devices includes pacing and perhaps defibrillation without a lead traversing the TV.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 device therapy guidelines — management of advisories and device replacement emphasize that follow-up physicians should be aware of advisories related to potential device malfunction and provide criteria under which clinicians are to consider lead/device replacement: if death is a likely result of device malfunction; if the mechanism of device/lead failure is known, potentially recurrent, and possibly life-threatening; if the patient is pacemaker dependent; if the risk of replacement is substantially lower than the risk of device malfunction; or if the device is approaching its elective replacement indicator.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^116gcSmw]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Suspected lead failure — clinical presentation: The lead failure modes are pace–sense malfunction and shock component malfunction, with the former accounting for the clear majority (> 90%) of diagnosed lead failures in clinical practice. In pace-sense circuits, conductor failure or insulation breach typically present as oversensing of rapid, nonphysiological signals, resulting in inappropriate shocks or pacing inhibition. In the past, the most common presentation of pace-sense lead fracture was inappropriate shocks. Health care providers who provide initial care for patients should understand the use of magnets for suspending therapy. Insulation failure with shorting of the high-voltage circuit can result in catastrophic failure of the pulse generator.

Pacing is an established and ubiquitous treatment of bradycardias and some types of heart failure. The optimal pacing lead position which maximizes cardiac function and minimizes deterioration of ventricular function remains controversial. The desire to achieve a physiological pacing system that mimics cardiac function has led to the investigation of several potential pacing sites. This editorial provides an overview of past and current pacing lead position and summaries the current and future direction of physiological pacing.

### Lead extraction in children and young adults: when is the best time for lead / system replacement? [^114XnJDg]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The number of new cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations in children is not rising. However, due to advances in cardiovascular techniques, the number of young adults with repaired congenital heart as well as children with implanted cardiac devices can be expected to have increased longevity into adulthood (negligible mortality).

Although reports show long-term durability of leads pacemakers (PM) 20 years, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) 10 years these values are usually lower in children. In children, mechanical damage and other types of lead dysfunction resulting from body growth, faster scarring and calcification, lead insulation breaches and a more active lifestyle limit the durability of intracardiac leads (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The strain of the leads caused by the growth of the body. The strain of the leads caused by the growth of the body, which is one of the causes of lead dysfunction (increase of the stimulation threshold, decrease of resistance due to damage to external insulation). Pictures typical of young adolescents with leads implanted in childhood (A – D). Abandoned epicardial leads implanted earlier in early childhood are common (B and C). In children and youth, single-chamber systems (A, C and D) predominate

Lead replacement as the optimal lead management strategy for children with lead dysfunction is recommended both in previous and recent guidelines, but execution of the strategy in pediatric electrocardiology departments may differ. Differences in transvenous lead extraction (TLE) and procedure difficulty between children and adolescents have been discussed in several reports and multicentre studies. Most pediatric cardiologists prefer a passive approach, that is lead removal for class 1 and 2a indications and extraction postponement in patients with class 2b indications. Considering the optimal time for lead extraction some investigators advocate waiting until children stop growing than extracting non-functional leads during physical growth, suggesting that TLE in young adults is safer.

As a result, most children, once they turn 18, are referred to adult electrophysiologists for potential lead replacement or system upgrade. Finally, most young adults become candidates for TLE at adult centers.

### Popeye domain-containing proteins and stress-mediated modulation of cardiac pacemaking [^111ie1Cd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

An intricate network of ion channels and pumps are involved in generating a diastolic pacemaker potential, which is transmitted to the working myocardium with the help of the cardiac conduction system. The principles of cardiac pacemaking are reasonably well understood, however, the mechanism by which the heart increases its beating frequency in response to adrenergic stimulation has not been fully worked out. The Popeye domain-containing (Popdc) genes encode plasma membrane-localized proteins that are able to bind cAMP with high affinity; mice with null mutations in Popdc1 or 2 have a stress-induced pacemaker dysfunction. The phenotype in both mutants develops in an age-dependent manner and thus may model pacemaker dysfunction in man, as well as provide novel mechanistic insights into the process of pacemaker adaptation to stress.

Device advisories and replacement thresholds — clinicians should be aware of advisories related to potential device malfunction, and specific recommendations are to consider lead/device replacement under conditions including pacemaker dependence, known and potentially recurrent life‑threatening failure mechanisms, risk of replacement being substantially lower than malfunction risk, the device approaching elective replacement indicator, or if death is a likely result of malfunction; complications of replacing ICD generators under advisory include infection, need for reoperation, and death; in general, for pacemaker-dependent patients, advisory device failure rates in excess of 0.3% warrant consideration of device replacement, and for ICD generators under advisory an estimated failure rate of 3% favors replacement in the majority of cases, decreasing to 1% when procedural mortality rates are 0.1% or less and/or risk of fatal arrhythmias increases to 20% per year.

### Tricuspid regurgitation in patients with pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: a comprehensive review [^1122y7sm]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Implantable cardiac devices, including defibrillators and pacemakers, may be the cause of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or may worsen existing TR. This review of the literature suggests that TR usually occurs over time after lead implantation. Diagnosis by clinical exam and 2-dimensional echocardiography may be augmented by 3-dimensional echocardiography and/or computed tomography. The mechanism may be mechanical perforation or laceration of leaflets, scarring and restriction of leaflets, or asynchronized activation of the right ventricle. Pacemaker-related TR might cause severe right-sided heart failure, but data regarding associated mortality are lacking. This comprehensive review summarizes the data regarding incidence, mechanism, and treatment of lead-related TR.

Definitions

Clinical success, procedural success, partial radiographic success, as well as major and minor complications of TLE were defined in accordance with recommendations for lead management. The occurrence of permanent bodily injury, significant damage to the tricuspid valve or, for example, stroke, procedure-related death despite optimal treatment, have precluded clinical or procedural success.

The risk of major complications (MC) related to TLE (points, percentage) was assessed using the SAFeTY TLE score, an online tool available at. The EROS score was used for prediction of significant procedural complications that required emergent surgical intervention (1–3 scale). Assessment of procedure complexity was based on the MB score showing the need for use of advanced tools to achieve TLE success (0–5 points), LED index referring to lead extraction difficulty based on fluoroscopy times (0–50 points), and Advanced TLE Techniques (Mazzone) score to predict the necessity of using advanced extraction techniques (0–4 points).

Procedure complexity was expressed as procedure time, i.e. time for extraction of all leads (sheath-to-sheath time) and average time of single lead extraction (sheath-to sheath/number of extracted leads). The occurrence of unexpected procedural difficulties referred to as technical problems, i.e. the circumstances that made the procedure more difficult but without complications was another indicator of procedural complexity. Most commonly it was the need to use venous approach other than the access vein, lead-on-lead scarring, fracture of the targeted lead, Byrd dilator collapse/torsion and occlusion of the access vein.

Lead Failure

Mechanical Lead Damage (Electric Failure)

Sudden increase in impedance > 1500 Ohm or high-voltage impedance > 100 Ohm; > 300 nonphysiological short interventricular-intervals ("crackles").

Non-damaged Lead Dysfunction

Lead failure without mechanical damage: exit/entry block (linear increase in impedance > 1500 Ohm or high-voltage impedance > 100 Ohm or a linear decrease in sensing or increase of pacing threshold to an inacceptable level level), tip dislodgement or extracardiac pacing).

### Hemodynamic response and safety of vasodilator stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients with permanent pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^111HCr5W]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the majority of patients with PPMs and ICDs can be expected to have a tachycardic response to vasodilator stress agents in the nuclear stress testing environment. Nonetheless, in our center's experience, high rates of asynchronous device programming for patients with a history of sinus node dysfunction, high‐grade atrioventricular block, and higher pacing requirements were without adverse events. In those with CMR conditional devices, image quality was generally high, including on scans performed at 3 Tesla field strengths. Further experience is needed to validate these findings and confirm that stress CMR is of sufficient diagnostic quality in patients with PPMs and ICDs.

Lead recalls and advisories — notifications to patients, providers, and regulators occur when a lead has failed to meet prespecified performance expectations; malfunction or failure exceeding expected rates is based on returned product analysis, customer reported failures, postmarketing registry reports, or remote monitoring, with terminology determined largely by regulator language; random component failure describes an unavoidable rare failure not reflecting a systematic mechanism, and advisories are typically reported when a specific mechanism of component or assembly failure is identified, involving insulation, conductors, or connectors.

### When pacing or defibrillator leads become redundant: extract or abandon? [^116iE2Du]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2017 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus paper on lead management and extraction did not express a preference for either extracting or abandoning pacing or defibrillator leads that are dysfunctional or superfluous after an upgrade (hereafter referred to as redundant leads). However, no randomized or even nonrandomized trials show a better patient outcome with extraction. Many experienced centers currently advise patients to have redundant leads removed to prevent more complicated procedures after years of abandonment. According to the literature, however, not all abandoned leads need to be extracted as > 90% will have an uneventful follow-up. As immediate extraction of redundant leads has a small but significant risk, this will generate more adverse events at the population level than when extraction is limited to the patients with future lead complications, even considering a higher extraction risk at that time. Lead extraction is also limited to specialized centers and often necessitates expensive tools, in contrast to abandoning leads, which can be safely performed by any experienced device specialist without additional cost.

St. Jude (now Abbott) Riata ICD leads — characterized by frequent externalization of conductor coils and an increased risk of lead malfunction — had a root cause attributed to redundant cables with stiff ethylene tetrafluoroethylene insulation causing cable sliding and "inside-out" erosion; for select models the mechanical externalization rate can be as high as 25%–30%, electrical failure rates range from 2% to 4%, the long-term risk for mechanical failure due to extruded cables is unknown, and these leads represent an inherently more complex and high-risk extraction challenge although data suggest extraction outcomes are comparable to other lead models in experienced hands.

Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) abandoned leads and extraction risk — balancing factors are emphasized, as abandoned leads are a common extraction indication and procedural risk rises with time and tissue changes. It is crucial to balance the risk of the intervention with the patient's situation, and in pediatrics there is some evidence mortality could be lower but with higher stakes. Abandoned leads account for as many as 38% of extractions; leads left behind become harder to remove and are linked to increased major complications that progress with implantation duration. Extraction risks increase as interlead fibrosis thickens, especially with multiple leads; lead fragility grows with implant duration and bodily stresses, reducing the likelihood of complete removal, with even modest calcification further increasing risk.

### Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead failure: how weak is the link? [^1137oEp4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients when used for primary and secondary prevention. These devices are being used more frequently as indications for primary prevention broaden, and attention has become increasingly focused on complications caused by lead failure. A report using data from a large registry revealed that the cumulative incidence of lead malfunction that necessitated surgical revision of the ICD lead system was 2.5% over 5 years. A strategy to deal with failed leads by the implantation of new pace-sense leads or high-voltage leads resulted in a 20% malfunction recurrence rate at 5 years. Defibrillator leads have been termed the 'weakest link' in the ICD system. Further efforts from manufacturers, regulators, and implanting physicians are required to understand and address the causes of lead failure.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Device or lead advisories and replacement thresholds — It is incumbent upon the follow-up physician to be aware of advisories issued in relation to potential device malfunction, and specific recommendations are to consider lead/device replacement if death is a likely result of device malfunction, the mechanism of device/lead failure is known, potentially recurrent, and possibly life-threatening, the patient is pacemaker-dependent, the risk of replacement is substantially lower than the risk of device malfunction, or the device is approaching its elective replacement indicator. Complications related to replacement of ICD generators under advisory have been well documented, including infection, the need for reoperation, and death. In general, for pacemaker-dependent patients, advisory device failure rates in excess of 0.3% warrant consideration of device replacement; in patients with ICD generators under advisory, an estimated failure rate of 3% favors replacement in the majority of cases, decreasing to 1% when procedural mortality rates are 0.1% or less and/or risk of fatal arrhythmias increases to 20% per year. During certain lead advisories, reprogramming, enabling alert features for impedance, and increasing utilization of remote monitoring may have an effect on future rates of invasive lead replacement and/or extraction.

### ACC / AHA / HRS 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [^114bjryH]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Medium credibility.

Selection of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) generators — A single RV lead for sensing and defibrillation is mandatory for all currently available ICD systems, and triple-chamber ICD systems are capable of CRT (CRT-D); conventional ICD therapy may be associated with adverse effects of RVA pacing with increased risks of AF and heart failure, and approximately 30% to 50% experience some degree of psychological distress after implantation. In patients with no AV block and no intraventricular conduction abnormalities, ventricular pacing should be avoided as much as possible, which for many ICD patients without a bradycardia indication can be achieved by programming a very low backup ventricular pacing rate (i.e., 30 to 40 bpm); for ICD patients with SND requiring support, ventricular pacing may be minimized by use of techniques designed to promote intrinsic conduction, and in AV block alternate single-site RV or LV pacing or biventricular pacing (CRT-P/CRT-D) may be superior to RVA pacing. Efforts to optimize pacing mode or site should be greater in patients with longer expected duration of pacing, poorer cardiac function, and larger mechanical asynchrony, and awareness of dyssynchrony should also lead to more regular monitoring of cardiac ventricular systolic function and mechanical asynchrony in any patient with ventricular pacing.

Ventricular dyssynchrony

Ventricular dyssynchrony refers to an uncoordinated contraction within and between the two ventricles and is present when ventricular activation occurs outside the normal conduction system such as in LBBB, VT, chronic RV pacing, pre-excitation syndrome, and PVCs. Dyssynchrony causes disruption and progression of dyssynergic wall motion, resulting in contractile dysfunction and HF, most extensively studied in LBBB. Studies in animal models of dyssynchronous HF have reported changes in Ca 2+ dynamics (SERCA and PLB) and gap junction remodelling, particularly in the late-activated, high-stress LV free wallthat could partly explain the deterioration of LV function and propensity to arrhythmias.

Tachycardia

Animal and clinical studies have shown that the mechanism of tachymyopathy is multifactorial, including subclinical ischaemia due to underperfusion caused by short diastolic periods and reduced blood pressure combined with increased demands, abnormalities in cellular energetics, redox stress, and calcium overload. These stressors lead to a cascade of mechanisms that ultimately trigger a wide range of maladaptive reprogramming, leading to prolongation of the action potential, abnormal excitation–contraction coupling, and depression of contractile function. Tachycardia plays a role in HFrEF in patients with sustained AT or VT and AF without adequate rate control. Rapid rates may be accompanied by rate-dependent bundle branch block (dyssynchrony) that further reduces pump efficiency and worsens haemodynamics.

Atrioventricular dissociation

The optimal coupling between atria and ventricles implies the completion of atrial contraction and subsequent atrial filling of the ventricles before the onset of systole. Atrioventricular dissociation can be complete (random intervals between the atrial and ventricular contraction) or a constantly prolonged interval between the two (in the case of prolonged PR interval on the ECG). Atrioventricular dissociation can result in increased atrial pressure, inadequate ventricular filling, and/or diastolic mitral regurgitation, all factors that decrease ventricular stroke volume and, therefore, may contribute to the development of HF. Ventricularly paced beats with retrograde conduction to the atrium, a cause of pacemaker syndrome, may have similar effects. Finally, a prolonged PR interval causes a long pause between the end of atrial contraction and onset of ventricular contraction, causing diastolic mitral regurgitation and suboptimal ventricular filling.

Understanding the role of other potential triggers of these cardiomyopathies, including haemodynamic compromise, decreased myocardial flow, and intrinsic autonomic nerve activity, is challenging due to the overlap with the primary triggers described above.

### ASNC imaging guidelines / SNMMI procedure standard for positron emission tomography (PET) nuclear cardiology procedures [^115jrgmk]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Transmission–emission registration and artifacts in PET/CT — metal artifacts can present a challenge for the reconstruction algorithm and must be compensated for to produce accurate attenuation maps. Although pacemaker leads do not appear to cause artifacts in cardiac PET/CT images, automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads frequently do result in artifacts of sufficient magnitude to impact clinical image interpretation. Ideally, stress transmission scans should be acquired during peak stress or vasodilation, although this is not practical, so the technologist and physician must carefully inspect the transmission and emission image sets to ensure that they are properly registered in the transaxial, sagittal, and coronal planes. For patients undergoing PET/CT, a separate, CT-based transmission scan for correction of the stress images is standard, and for 82Rb a post-stress transmission scan is preferred to minimize misregistration artifacts on the corrected 82Rb images when misregistration compensation software is not available.

### Pacing for heart failure [^115m2Drz]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Pacing for patients with severe heart failure without bradyarrhythmia has been proposed as an addition to medical therapy over the past decade. Alteration of the normal electrical activation sequence of the heart modifies its mechanical action, especially when ventricular function is poor. Both the site of ventricular-lead placement and timing with the atria have been manipulated in attempts to alleviate the symptoms of heart failure. Most recently, in addition to the conventional two leads used for pacing, a third lead to pace the left ventricle has been advocated in some patients with heart failure. We review the evidence for pacing in heart failure.

### Does the risk-benefit analysis favor the extraction of failed, sterile pacemaker and defibrillator leads? [^112yauNp]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Transvenous pacemaker and defibrillator (PM-D) lead failure is an important clinical problem. Lead extraction is routinely performed in patients with transvenous pacemaker and defibrillator (PM-D) infections. The management of sterile PM-D leads that have failed or are no longer required is less uniform. While extraction of excess or failed sterile PM-D leads is often advocated, the risk of lead extraction must be weighed against the risk of abandoning these leads. There are no randomized trials comparing lead extraction with abandoning sterile leads in this setting. What then are the data that are used to advocate the extraction of excess or failed, sterile chronically implanted PM-D leads, and are the data adequate to make this recommendation?

### Surgical management of superior vena cava syndrome following pacemaker lead infection: a case report and review of the literature [^117PFMxi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a known but rare complication of pacemaker lead implantation, accounting for approximately less than 0.5% of cases. Its pathophysiology is due to either infection or endothelial mechanical stress, causing inflammation and fibrosis leading to thrombosis, and therefore stenosis of the SVC. Due to the various risks including thrombo-embolic complications and the need to provide symptomatic relief, medical and surgical interventions are sought early. We present the case of a 48-year Caucasian male who presented with localised swelling and pain at the site of pacemaker implantation. Inflammatory markers were normal, but diagnostic imaging revealed three masses along the pacemaker lead passage. A surgical approach using cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest was used to remove the vegetations. Culture from the vegetations showed Staphylococcus epidermidis. The technique presented here allowed for safe and effective removal of both the thrombus and infected pacing leads, with excellent exposure and minimal post-procedure complications.

### The desire for physiological pacing: are we there yet? [^115gDb3M]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pacing is a well established therapy for bradycardia support and certain types of heart failure. Despite technological advances the optimal pacing lead position remains controversial. Right ventricular pacing, particularly apical has been the site of choice but the induction of abnormal cardiac depolarization and the recognition of an increased risk of impairment of left ventricular systolic function, heart failure and mortality has driven a desire for a true physiological pacing system. A number of different lead positions have been determined and of these His bundle pacing appears to most closely mimic normal ventricular conduction. This article reviews the background to the development of physiological pacing, evaluates historical data for right ventricular pacing and the basis for change and new lead positions.

Caveats in diagnosis of lead failure — differentiation from false positives is essential, and a study of leads with impedance issues developed and prospectively validated an algorithm that correctly classified 100% of fractures and 87% of connection problems; the study included 40 fractured leads, 30 with connection problems, and 21 functioning leads, and the algorithm used these criteria: either extremely high maximum impedance or noise oversensing with a normal impedance trend indicating fracture; short temporal interval from surgery to impedance rise or prolonged stable impedance after an abrupt rise indicating a connection problem; and gradual impedance increase or stable, high impedance indicating a functioning lead.

### Impedance in the diagnosis of lead malfunction [^114v96KV]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Impedance is the ratio of voltage to current in an electrical circuit. Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices measure impedance to assess the structural integrity electrical performance of leads, typically using subthreshold pulses. We review determinants of impedance, how it is measured, variation in clinically measured pacing and high-voltage impedance and impedance trends as a diagnostic for lead failure and lead-device connection problems. We consider the differential diagnosis of abnormal impedance and the approach to the challenging problem of a single, abnormal impedance measurement. Present impedance provides a specific but insensitive diagnostic. For pacing circuits, we review the complementary roles of impedance and more sensitive oversensing diagnostics. Shock circuits lack a sensitive diagnostic. This deficiency is particularly important for insulation breaches, which may go undetected and present with short circuits during therapeutic shocks. We consider new methods for measuring impedance that may increase sensitivity for insulation breaches.

Figure 6
Mechanical complication by year of implantation. The freedom from mechanical complication, as calculated by Kaplan‐Meier analysis, for leads implanted in each year between 2003 and 2014 over a 10‐year follow‐up. Noticeably, leads implanted in 2005, 2006, and 2007 have increased failure rates compared with leads implanted before or after that time period.

The increased incidence of lead failure in women in this analysis may be related to anatomic issues related to lead stress or body mass, and it is consistent with prior studies showing a higher rate of lead perforation or complications from lead extraction. 14, 15, 16 Lead failure portends a particular problem in patients with comorbidities that need extraction. In the present study, diabetes mellitus and renal disease were independent predictors of short‐ and longer‐term infectious complications. Atrial fibrillation was associated with short‐term infectious complications, and male sex was associated with long‐term infectious complications. This is consistent with a review of the literature that also found prior cardiovascular implantable electronic device infection, cardiovascular implantable electronic device intervention, and cardiovascular implantable electronic device replacement to be strong predictors of infection risk. 16

Maytin et al 17 showed that the instantaneous mortality rate increases by 5% per each year of patient age and by 16% for each mg/dL increase in serum creatinine; presence of diabetes mellitus increases the rate of death by 71%, and the indication for lead extraction has the most significant impact on survival. Patients with systemic and local infections have a 3.5‐ and a 2.7‐fold increased rate of death, respectively. 17

Thus, the choice of implantation of ICDs, despite their proven benefit, should always include the patient profile and comorbidities. Informed choices need to be made about the types of defibrillators and the types of ICD leads. This is not one size fits all. 18

The risks of mechanical complications and infections described in this analysis must be weighed against the prophylactic protection against sudden cardiac arrest in at‐risk patients. Although the subcutaneous ICD system has not had a similar large, multiple‐institution, multiyear analysis, as performed herein, the subcutaneous defibrillation electrode has had a mechanical complication rate of 6/45 000 implants worldwide 19 and may provide a different risk profile. Potential explanations include absence of the beat‐to‐beat mechanical stress that the transvenous ICD leads endure and fundamentally different lead design in an extravascular space. The equivalence of efficacy of treatment of the subcutaneous ICD and transvenous ICD systems has been well validated. 20, 21

Table 2 — choice of pacemaker generator in selected indications for pacing — defines selection criteria across sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, and neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity: For sinus node dysfunction, a single-chamber atrial pacemaker is aligned with "No suspected abnormality of atrioventricular conduction and not at increased risk for future atrioventricular block" and "Maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing desired", whereas a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker corresponds to "Maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing not necessary". For atrioventricular block, a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker is used for "Chronic atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmia or maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony during pacing not necessary", while a dual-chamber pacemaker addresses situations where "Atrioventricular synchrony during pacing desired"; selection can also note "Rate response available if desired". For neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, a dual-chamber pacemaker applies when "Sinus mechanism present". The table also specifies that a "Single-lead, atrial-sensing ventricular pacemaker" may be considered when there is "Desire to limit the number of pacemaker leads".

Pacemaker generator selection by indication — For sinus node dysfunction (SND), a single-chamber atrial pacemaker applies when there is no suspected abnormality of atrioventricular (AV) conduction and not at increased risk for future AV block, and it is not appropriate for atrioventricular block or for neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. A single-chamber ventricular pacemaker fits SND when maintenance of AV synchrony during pacing not necessary; in atrioventricular block, it applies with chronic atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmia or maintenance of AV synchrony during pacing not necessary; for neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, it applies with chronic atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmia. A dual-chamber pacemaker is aligned with SND when AV synchrony during pacing desired or there is suspected abnormality of AV conduction or increased risk for future AV block; for atrioventricular block, it applies when sinus mechanism present with AV synchrony during pacing desired or atrial pacing desired; for neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, it applies when sinus mechanism present. A single-lead, atrial-sensing ventricular pacemaker is not appropriate for SND or for neurally mediated syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and for atrioventricular block the relevant context is desire to limit the number of pacemaker leads.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Epicardial and transvenous pacing leads — perioperative, pediatric, infection, and tricuspid valve considerations — In selected surgical candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), it may be advisable to place an LV epicardial lead at the time of concomitant cardiac surgery, including patients with LV end-diastolic diameter greater than or equal to 55 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 35%, and epicardial leads may be necessary in pediatric patients with sinus node dysfunction (SND) or atrioventricular (AV) block after congenital heart disease surgery or congenital AV block. For infection scenarios, epicardial leads are suggested in patients with recurrent or prolonged bacteremia, whereas for a single episode of device-related bacteremia extraction of all hardware followed by reimplantation by the transvenous route at a later date is appropriate. In the setting of mechanical tricuspid valve surgery, implantation of permanent epicardial pacing leads is indicated in the pacemaker-dependent patient undergoing mechanical tricuspid valve replacement; a prosthetic mechanical tricuspid valve represents an absolute contraindication to placement of transvenous RV leads, at surgery all hardware should be removed, and if tricuspid valve replacement is necessary, epicardial ventricular leads should be implanted at the time of surgery.

4 Lead‐Related TR

Between 25% to 29% of patients with CIED have TR, and multiple studies have observed worsening TR after implantation of a Permanent Pacemaker (PPM) or Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD).

New or worsening TR after lead placement can occur through different mechanisms, including direct trauma to the leaflets or valvular apparatus during insertion. Lead tethering, impingement, entrapment, or entanglement with papillary muscles or chordae tendineae can also increase TR. Other causes include restricted movement of valve leaflets, abnormal coaptation, adhesion, and fibrosis.

The septal leaflet of the TV is most frequently impinged. Implantation of the lead between the posterior and septal TV leaflets can confer greater risk of interference with the TV apparatus. Additionally, the inflammatory response resulting from neo‐endocardium formation results in adhesion and fibrosis within TV leaflets, further increasing TR. Pacing‐induced cardiomyopathy, worsening left ventricular systolic function, worsening pulmonary artery systolic pressure, or tricuspid annular dilatation can alter right ventricular geometry, eventually leading to increased TR.

4.1 Mechanisms of interference between LLPMs and the tricuspid valve

Acute implantation‐procedure‐related damage of the tricuspid valve might be caused during the maneuvering of the device into the right ventricular (RV) cavity and/or during repositioning of the LLPM. However, there are no data assessing the incidence of such events. In an ex vivo study, Mattson et al. demonstrated that damage of the subvalvular apparatus caused by the Micra™ fixation tines in the case of device repositioning is unlikely to occur. Consistently, the number of required LLPM deployments did not predict increase of TR in our study, which was also not observed by others. In contrast, it has been hypothesized that a septal instead of an apical implantation site may be a mechanical contributor to tricuspid valve dysfunction. Based on the findings of Hai et al.and our own data, a septal implantation did not lead to TR increase. The increased risk of TR worsening after septal LLPM implantation that was reported by Beurskens et al.may be driven by the high number of Nanostim™ implants in this study, which are significantly longer and may interfere with the valve. Numerical models have emphasized the significant influence of large LLPM housings on the collision likelihood with adjacent cardiac structures. Thus, while a septal implantation of a Micra™ alone may not be risk factor for TR worsening, a very basal implantation site close to the tricuspid valve annulus should be avoided to preserve tricuspid valve function.

Besides direct negative mechanical interference of LLPMs with the tricuspid valve, ventricular pacing may per se induce valve dysfunction due to the nonphysiologic electrical activation pattern, which has been shown in conventional pacemaker patients undergoing RV apical pacing. Data regarding this functional impact on TR are conflicting, but the influence of ventricular stimulation is inevitable if patients require stimulation.

Pace-sense failure diagnostics — counts of extremely short R-R intervals: The Medtronic Sensing Integrity Count stores the count of R-R intervals shorter than 130 ms, and a rapidly increasing sensing integrity count is a sensitive indicator of conductor fracture, which in isolation has low specificity; elevated counts are more common with intact integrated bipolar leads than with intact dedicated bipolar leads, and increasing episodes of nonsustained VT, particularly if characterized by rapid rates, should arouse suspicion for possible lead failure.

### Leadless cardiac pacemakers: back to the future [^115yJX8j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in battery longevity, lead performance, and programming features since the first implanted permanent pacemaker was developed, the basic design of cardiac pacemakers has remained relatively unchanged over the past 50 years. Because of inherent limitations in their design, conventional (transvenous) pacemakers are prone to multiple potential short- and long-term complications. Accordingly, there has been intense interest in a system able to provide the symptomatic and potentially lifesaving therapies of cardiac pacemakers while mitigating many of the risks associated with their weakest link-the transvenous lead. Leadless cardiac pacing represents the future of cardiac pacing systems, similar to the transition that occurred from the use of epicardial pacing systems to the familiar transvenous systems of today. This review summarizes the current evidence and potential benefits of leadless pacing systems, which are either commercially available (in Europe) or under clinical investigation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Device Guideline: 2012 update — scope, applicability, and follow-up emphasize that the guideline focuses on the appropriate use of heart pacing devices (e.g., pacemakers for bradyarrhythmias and heart failure management, cardiac resynchronization, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]), not the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. A device listed as a Class I indication (beneficial, useful, and effective) does not preclude other therapeutic modalities that may be equally effective, and recommendations target an average patient and may be modified by comorbidities, limitations of life expectancy, and circumstances judged by the primary treating physician. Follow-up is underscored because optimal results require device adjustment to changing clinical conditions and because advisories and recalls highlight that devices are not infallible and failures of electronics, batteries, and leads can occur. The committee did not include a section on extraction of failed/unused leads owing to the absence of convincing evidence for timing and methods, and the question of when to discontinue long-term cardiac pacing or defibrillator therapy has not been studied sufficiently; this topic is addressed to emphasize the importance of patient-family-physician discussion and ethical principles. Many indications use the modifier "potentially reversible", referring to abnormal pathophysiology that may result from reversible factors such as complete heart block due to drug toxicity (digitalis), electrolyte abnormalities, periatrioventricular node inflammation (Lyme disease), or transient injury to the conduction system at the time of open heart surgery; when faced with a potentially reversible situation, the treating physician must decide how long a waiting period is justified before device therapy is begun.

### First confirmed case of leadless pacemaker insertion via bidirectional glenn shunt in Ebstein's anomaly: a novel approach to pacing challenges [^115dzpwn]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Discussion

This case represents the first confirmed report of a leadless pacemaker (Abbott AVEIR VR) inserted via a bidirectional Glenn shunt in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly with mechanical tricuspid valve replacement, addressing a critical pacing requirement in the complex congenital heart disease (CHD) setting. The patient's history of transvenous lead dislodgment, involving a 4 French SelectSecure Medtronic 3830 lead, aligns with known challenges in CHD patients. Ng et al. reported late dislodgment of SelectSecure 3830 leads in adolescents with congenital heart block, attributing failures to inadequate atrial loops, fibrous tissue fixation, and somatic growth. In this case, the patient's growth from age 20 to 28, combined with an active lifestyle, likely contributed to lead dislodgment, with Twiddler's syndrome or mechanical stress potential cofactors.

The bidirectional Glenn shunt, a palliative procedure redirecting superior vena cava flow to the pulmonary arteries, poses unique challenges for transvenous pacing due to altered venous anatomy and scarring from prior surgeries. Traditional transvenous leads, such as the SelectSecure 3830, are prone to dislodgment or fracture in growing patients, as evidenced by the patient's history and Ng et al.'s case series. Leadless pacemakers eliminate these risks by residing entirely within the RV, offering a durable solution for CHD patients with pacing needs. Beccarino et al. demonstrated midterm success of leadless pacemakers in pacemaker‐dependent patients post‐transvenous lead extraction, reporting stable thresholds and low complication rates. Reynolds et al. further validated the safety and efficacy of leadless pacing systems, with 99.7% successful implantation rates in diverse populations.

The procedural innovation of accessing the RV via the Glenn shunt required overcoming significant scarring, highlighting the technical expertise needed in CHD interventions. The use of ultrasound‐guided vascular access and Proglide sutures minimized complications, while angiography and fluoroscopy ensured precise device placement. This approach expands the therapeutic options for patients with single‐ventricle physiology or complex venous anatomy, where epicardial pacing carries higher risks of lead failure and surgical morbidity. The case also underscores the diagnostic value of multimodal imaging, with chest X‐rays, angiography, and echocardiography providing complementary insights into device positioning and cardiac function.

Shock-impedance thresholds and limitations for shock-component issues: An abrupt increase in shock impedance (typically > 75%) or a shock-impedance value greater than 100 Ω likely indicates shock conductor fracture, although applicability of these thresholds to other manufacturers' leads has not been reported; elevated shock-impedance values could also reflect a faulty connection of shock components, high-voltage insulation breaches result in low impedance values with no defined thresholds, and case reports have shown that shocks can short-circuit despite normal low-voltage measurements of shock impedance.

Acute mechanical circulatory support (MCS) decommission checklist — teams, meetings, and steps are specified as follows: Notification includes clinicians involved in the patient's care (eg, heart failure, interventional cardiologists, surgeon, palliative care provider, intensivists, social worker, ventricular assist device coordinator) as well as chaplains, clinical ethicists, other religious or spiritual support. Family meeting tasks include reviewing the clinical course and goal for comfort or adherence to patient preferences; outlining the process for deactivation with expectations including possibility of prolonged period before death; determining who will be present and the need for any religious rites; discussing other life sustaining therapies that may need deactivation (eg, renal replacement, artificial nutrition and hydration, mechanical ventilation); considering organ or tissue donation when appropriate; and documenting the meeting. Team meeting tasks include determining time for deactivation, reviewing all orders for anxiolytics, sedation and analgesia, and creating a schedule for discontinuation of other life-sustaining therapies and for deactivation of any other devices such as pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Discontinuation steps include to identify a lead person to oversee deactivation, make sure all people required to be present are there, remind family of possible signs and symptoms and the uncertainty in the timing of death, administer medications for comfort, turn off the monitors and silence alarms, and discontinue support.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^1127BiRT]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Tricuspid valve surgery — conduction risk and pacing considerations: The need for pacemaker after repair has been reported to be as low as 2.3%, but several series report a much higher incidence, up to 22%, and the need for PPM placement is frequent after tricuspid valve surgery. In patients in whom new onset advanced primary atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction (SND) develops and does not improve after open tricuspid valve surgery, patients should undergo permanent pacer placement after open tricuspid valve surgery; specific timing has not been formally studied, but 3 to 5 days after surgery is probably reasonable. For repaired tricuspid valves, a transvalvular endocardial ventricular lead is ideally placed at the commissure between the anterior and septal tricuspid leaflets, and transvalvular, endocardial ventricular leads cannot be placed across mechanical valves in the tricuspid position. Even in native valves, nearly one-quarter of patients suffer significant tricuspid regurgitation associated with placement of an endovascular right ventricular lead, and after repair or bioprosthetic replacement transvalvular endocardial ventricular leads may cause severe tricuspid regurgitation; therefore patients who are undergoing tricuspid valve replacement or tricuspid repair with high risk for postoperative atrioventricular block should be strongly considered for permanent epicardial pacing leads at the time of cardiac surgery.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^113Pz9um]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Device electrograms in pace–sense failures: Device electrogram (EGM) analysis is important in the diagnostic approach to suspected lead failure, and oversensing (noise) is the most common observation in this failure mode. In conductor fractures, typical EGM characteristics are signals that are intermittent with a high dominant frequency, highly variable, and not recorded on the high-voltage or shock channel; EGMs are typically noncyclical and exhibit extremely short nonphysiological R-R intervals (< 160 ms), may saturate the sensing amplifier, and produce truncated near-field signals. Lead connection problems can present with similar EGM patterns but are most often temporally associated with an invasive CIED procedure such as implantation or generator replacement. In contrast, insulation failures do not themselves typically generate abnormal signals but instead lead to sensing of physiological or nonphysiological signals from surrounding structures or conductor interaction, so EGM patterns in insulation breaches vary, reflecting the signal source.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^115hQeXr]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid valve dysfunction and injury with cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) leads — incidence, risk factors, outcomes, and management — are detailed: an increase ≥ 2 grades in tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was reported in 18.3% of patients, improvement after lead extraction has been mixed with 63% improvement in TR severity and 75% clinical improvement in symptomatic referrals, and the risk of traumatic tricuspid valve injury during lead extraction varies from 3.5% to 19%, with one study indicating that 26% developed new right heart failure symptoms and 11% required surgical repair. Risk factors for lead-induced or postextraction TR include older age, defibrillator leads, posterior or septal leaflet location, leads passing between chordae, extraction of two or more leads, use of powered sheaths, female sex, and defibrillator leads; significant TR with pacemaker leads was associated with increased mortality. A combined evaluation and approach, in conjunction with cardiothoracic surgery, is optimal with either percutaneous extraction followed by open tricuspid surgery or, more commonly, open surgery then removal of all visible lead portions followed by percutaneous removal of the remnants.

### Evolution of tricuspid valve regurgitation after implantation of a leadless pacemaker: a single center experience, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^115Pq1E9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) aggravates heart failure, and is associated with impaired prognosis independent of a patient's age, left ventricular function or the presence of pulmonary hypertension. After implantation of a conventional pacemaker, the likelihood of significant TR (defined as at least moderate TR) is more than twice as high as compared with patients without device. Besides a pacing‐induced lead‐independent functional increase of TR, TR aggravation seems to be caused mainly by ventricular leads of conventional cardiac pacemakers. Transvenous leads can interfere mechanically with tricuspid valve leaflets, tendinous chords and papillary muscles. This may lead to impaired mobility and insufficient leaflet coaptation, resulting in significant TR.

Leadless cardiac pacemakers (LLPMs) have been introduced to prevent lead‐associated complications of conventional pacemakers. Direct mechanical interference of LLPMs with the tricuspid valve seems less likely due to the limited size of the devices and the lack of structures permanently crossing the tricuspid valve. However, data on the evolution of TR after LLPM implantation remain sparse and conflicting. Some authors have reported a reduction or a stable prevalence of significant TR after LLPM implantation, while others observed a clear increase of significant TR afterwards.

In this study, we analyzed the degree and predictors for changes in TR severity after LLPM implantation at our center. Subsequently, a systematic literature review was performed and our data were pooled to perform a meta‐analysis on the prevalence of significant TR after LLPM implantation.

### Case report: pacemaker lead perforation of a papillary muscle inducing severe tricuspid regurgitation [^113sTyUE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The number of pacemaker implantations is still on the rise with a broad variety of techniques described and devices available. Complications are not rare and meticulous attention has to be paid to avoid potential risks and to identify and treat all kinds of adverse events. Special techniques were recently developed to remove malfunctioning or infected leads by transvenous lead extraction devices. However, these techniques have their limitations and may also lead to severe adverse events requiring urgent surgical intervention. Therefore, pacemaker specialists performing lead extraction have to be familiar with transvenous and open-heart surgical techniques.

This case reports a pacemaker lead perforating a papillary muscle. Lead-induced valve dysfunction may induce ventricular failure years after lead implantation. Once ventricular dysfunction has developed, the risk of surgical procedures increase both with regard to perioperative morbidity and mortality and the therapeutic options are limited. Clear guidelines are lacking in these patients, which is especially true for patients with right heart failure. Therefore, we report this case of an effective surgical approach in a patient with right heart failure to provide guidance in this complex clinical setting.

Abandoned functional leads — There are a variety of situations where a functional lead may no longer be required, with the option of either abandoning or extracting the lead, with examples including upgrades from a pacemaker to an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), downgrading from dual- to single-chamber systems, lead recall with prophylactic revision, system relocation for radiotherapy, and lack of device indication. These abandoned leads may be extracted to reduce the intravascular lead burden in order to avoid future issues.

### A change of pace: modifying pacemaker settings in the emergency department as emergency physicians, A case report [^114wsyvb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pacemakers are implantable or external devices that send electrical impulses, allowing the heart to contract. Some common indications for permanent pacemaker placement include symptomatic bradycardia due to high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, chronic bifascicular block, and postcardiac transplantation. Like all devices, pacemakers can malfunction or stop working entirely. We present a patient with an implantable pacemaker/cardioverter and defibrillator (ICD) displaying symptomatic failure to capture, and settings were adjusted in the emergency department (ED). Adjustment in the ED resolved the patient's symptoms and required no further interventions.

Case Report

An 82-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and a Medtronic dual chamber pacer/ICD (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) presented to the ED for complaints of weakness and lightheadedness. Emergency medical services noted intermittent bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased responsiveness. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed failure to capture. The Medtronic application was used to interrogate and reprogram the device. The settings were DDD at a rate of 60 beats/min with ventricular output of 4.5 millivolts (mV) and atrial output of 4.5 mV, which were changed to ventricular lead outputs from 4.5 mV to 8.0 mV and rate from 60 to 80 for additional cardiac output. After this adjustment, the bradycardia resolved, and ECG showed a successful AV-paced rhythm. Transcutaneous pacing was never required. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Adjustment of pacer settings in the ED to stabilize the critically ill patient is within the scope of the emergency physician. We can reduce stress to the patient and prevent hospitalizations. Pacemakers can become a tool to optimize treatment plans for an aging population in whom pacemakers are becoming more common.

Access to magnetic resonance imaging — There is evidence that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be safely performed in patients implanted with non-conditional CIEDs, but abandoned or dysfunctional leads are considered to be contraindications, and therefore extraction of these leads may be performed in selected cases with appropriate assessment of risk and benefits to allow access to MRI when no other diagnostic alternatives to MRI are available.

### Lead performance of stylet-driven leads in left bundle branch area pacing: results from a large single-center cohort and insights from in vitro bench testing [^117GmRa5]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) requires deep septal lead deployment for left-sided conduction stimulation. Advancing leads toward deep septal positions might add mechanical stress on these leads. Concerns about lead performance and reliability remain an unanswered question.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to analyze lead performance and integrity of stylet-driven pacing leads (SDLs) for LBBAP.

Methods

This study assessed lead fracture rates of SDL in a large single-center cohort of adult LBBAP patients. Fluoroscopic analysis of lead bending angulations at the septal insertion point and in vitro bench testing of lead preconditioning were performed to simulate clinical use conditions. Lead performance was compared between LBBAP and conventional right ventricular apical pacing (RVp) sites.

Results

The study included 325 LBBAP patients (66% male; age 71 ± 15 years). During median follow-up of 18 months, 2 patients (0.6%) experienced conductor fracture between tip housing and ring electrode, whereas no such fractures occurred with RVp patients (n = 149; p = 0.22). X-ray analysis revealed that high lead bending angulations occurred in 1.3% of the patients. Accelerated bench testing of excessive preconditioned leads showcased a higher probability of early conductor fracture compared to standard preconditioned leads.

Conclusion

The incidence of early conductor failure in LBBAP seems higher than with conventional RVp sites. The most vulnerable lead part seems to be the interelectrode space between the tip housing and ring electrode. Excessive angulation and preconditioning might contribute to early fatigue fracture.

### Impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on mechanical dispersion [^111sJHUv]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The pressure overload in aortic stenosis (AS) leads to cardiac remodelling, myocardial fibrosis and ultimately impaired myocardial performance. While left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) remains preserved until later stages of the disease, the reliability and prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS) suggests that GLS may be a better marker of early systolic dysfunction in AS phenotypes with small cavity size and increased LV mass. Moreover, by studying the time course of segmental strain, subtle ventricular heterogeneity can be assessed by mechanical dispersion, which has been previously associated with adverse outcome, mainly ventricular arrhythmias, across a wide range of cardiac conditions.

Knowledge regarding the physiological determinants of mechanical dispersion in AS is emerging. Previously, older age, lower LVEF, larger LV mass and AS severity have been associated with increasing mechanical dispersion in AS. Whether afterload influences heterogeneity of ventricular contractions, however, is subject to discussion. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) causes abrupt haemodynamic changes and provides an opportunity to explore whether significant afterload reduction influences mechanical dyssynchrony. Furthermore, patients undergoing TAVI frequently acquire new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB), enabling investigation of the separate and combined effects of changes in afterload and ventricular conduction on mechanical dispersion.

The primary aim of this study was to explore whether afterload and ventricular conduction are physiological determinants of LV dyssynchrony by assessing the immediate effect of TAVI on LV mechanical dispersion. Although such an experiment would require a selected group of patients without vascular TAVI complications that might affect loading conditions or require pacemakers, we wanted to evaluate whether prognostic information could be retained from mechanical dispersion after an uncomplicated procedure, since previous studies have linked pre-interventional mechanical dispersion to adverse outcome in AS.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^114ESEMk]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Impedance assessment for lead failure: Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) periodically measure the entire circuit's resistance to direct current per Ohm's law (R = V/I). The pace-sense conductors' resistance to current typically contributes less than 15% of the entire circuit's resistance; therefore, impedance assessment and monitoring lacks sensitivity in pace-sense failures, and impedance abnormalities occur in only a minority of pace-sense lead failures before identification by oversensing diagnostics or inappropriate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation detection. Observation of abrupt, relative changes in impedance trends is more specific and is about as sensitive as an out-of-range impedance, but a single abrupt change could be spurious, and a gradual rise without oversensing typically reflects increased resistance at the lead–myocardium interface and by itself does not require lead revision in the absence of sensing and pacing abnormalities. A pacing impedance of less than 200 Ω can indicate an insulation breach of the pace-sense component. Impedance measurements remain the primary diagnostic tool for high-voltage conductors, and confounders for painless shock circuit impedance include typical lead tip low impedances for high-voltage cables and shock electrodes and tissue resistance, which is inversely proportional to voltage.

### Idiopathic lead migration: concept and variants of an uncommon cause of cardiac Implantable electronic device dysfunction [^114zt3Am]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This cumulative case study was performed to properly address the possible mechanisms, forms, and consequences of "twiddler's", "reel", and "ratchet" syndromes.

Background

Twiddler's, reel, and ratchet syndromes are rare entities responsible for lead displacement of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED).

Methods

From 2007 to 2012, 1,472 CIED were implanted at our center. Eighty-nine cases were reviewed for failure of pacing circuit integrity. Only 9 met the inclusion criteria for idiopathic lead migration (ILM) and were grouped as ILM (twiddler) or ILM (reel). For a pooled analysis of cases, a review of the literature from 1990 to 2012 was performed, and the authors identified 78 cases from 64 publications.

Results

The study population consisted of 87 cases (45 women; median age, 66 years; 46 with ILM [twiddler] and 41 with ILM [reel]). Migration affected only 1 lead in 65% of 46 devices with more than 1 lead. None of the previously reported risk factors-manual manipulation of the device, elderly age, obesity, oversized pocket, and psychiatric history-correlated with the risk of ILM.

Conclusions

Neither manual manipulation of the device nor the other traditional risk factors reported in the literature for ILM syndrome correlated with the risk of ILM.

### Tricuspid valve disease and cardiac implantable electronic devices [^111Vmu8g]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has increased exponentially. More than 3.8 permanent pacemakers (PPMs) per million inhabitants, 2.2 implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), and 1.8 cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices are implanted yearly in Europe. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) associated with CIEDs and worsening TR after PPM are increasingly recognized as relevant clinical conditions linked to a higher risk of heart failure and mortality. Interactions between the tricuspid valve (TV) and CIED lead(s) include mechanical interference or damage to the apparatus, as well as pacing-related ventricular remodelling. Patients with worsening TR after PPM have an increased long-term mortality. Novel surgical and interventional TV treatment options are emerging and may be applied to patients suffering from TR related to or associated with CIEDs. This multidisciplinary review article was developed with electrophysiologists, interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, and cardiac surgeons during a structured discussion process to provide clinical guidance (see Supplementary data online, Section S1).

HRS/EHRA CIED monitoring — termination of cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) therapy rationale and device-specific differences emphasize that for a terminally ill patient the nature and function of CIEDs should be reviewed in the specific context of the patient's underlying condition and prognosis, with the primary aim to respect the patient's right to live, or at least to die with dignity, while limiting any therapeutic action that increases stress, pain, or anxiety. The text notes that the nature of pacemaker therapy differs from defibrillator therapy; pacing, as an on-going treatment, is not perceptible and does not likely contribute to suffering, discontinuation of pacing in a pacemaker dependent patient may hasten death, and discontinuation of pacing therapy should be kept distinct from deactivation of antitachycardia pacing therapies which may be considered independently from deactivation of ICD shock therapy.

Conclusions

Lead‐related complications remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality associated with the transvenous ICD system, in addition to incurring an unacceptably high financial burden for patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Reliability of ICD leads at 5 and 10 years continues to be disappointing. Careful consideration should be given to the choice of leads or nontransvenous ICD systems, particularly for patients at a higher risk for mechanical complications or infection.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — scope and objectives: The purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance to clinicians for the management of patients with bradycardia, or symptoms thought to be associated with bradycardia or cardiac conduction system disorders, and it supersedes the pacemaker recommendations from the ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 guideline and the 2012 focused update. The document is aimed at the adult population (> 18 years of age) and offers no specific recommendations in pediatric patients. Specific objectives and goals include describing the clinical significance of bradycardia with respect to mortality, symptoms (e.g., syncope, impaired functional capacity), and exacerbations of associated disorders (e.g., ischemia, heart failure, provoked tachyarrhythmias); addressing inherited and acquired disorders of the sinus node, atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje fibers, and intramyocardial conducting tissue, including the effects of medications, aging, metabolic derangements, trauma, radiation, infiltrative, ischemic, and inflammatory disorders, infectious and toxic agents, and iatrogenic factors; delineating the clinical presentation and general approach to clinical evaluation of patients with overt or suspected bradycardias or conduction diseases; comprehensively evaluating the evidence supporting recommendations for the selection and timing of available diagnostic testing modalities, including monitoring devices and electrophysiologic testing; defining the evidence base supporting recommendations for the use of available treatment modalities, including lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and external and implanted device-based therapies, with particular attention to indications for temporary and permanent pacing; addressing special considerations applicable to distinct populations based on age (> 18 years of age), comorbidities or other relevant factors; and identifying knowledge gaps, pertinent trials in progress and directions for future research.

Tricuspid valve surgery — Incidence and device considerations: The need for pacemaker after repair has been reported to be as low as 2.3%, with several series reporting a much higher incidence, up to 22%, and in patients who need a pacemaker after repair, incidence of moderate to severe or severe tricuspid regurgitation is 42%. Specific timing of pacemaker implant has not been formally studied and will always depend on the individual clinical situation but 3 to 5 days after surgery is probably reasonable. Transvalvular, endocardial ventricular leads cannot be placed across mechanical valves in the tricuspid position, and if possible, intraoperative implantation of several leads (nonapical, lateral left ventricular, right ventricular, and atrial leads) should be considered; although traditionally considered a contraindication, it may be that MRI can be performed safely in selected patients with abandoned leads under the auspices of specialized protocols.

### Human use conditions in fatigue of intravenous leads used in cardiac implanted electronic devices [^115dUfBS]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transvenous lead conductors are subject to fatigue fracture from repetitive bending stresses, which are proportional to alternating curvature. A prerequisite for developing a valid preclinical lead-testing standard is knowledge of the stresses on implanted leads - their fatigue environment, but little is known of it.

Objective

The Human Use Condition Study (HUCS) quantified this fatigue environment, including the relationship between lead stiffness and alternating curvature.

Methods

HUCS was a prospective, observational, multicenter clinical study. Leads from four manufacturers were chosen to span the range of stiffness in clinical use. They were imaged with biplane cinefluoroscopy during cardiac motion and in the shoulder region during arm motion. In each image, the lead was traced, and its curvature was calculated as a function of time.

Results

Images were analyzed for 109 subjects. In each region of the lead analyzed, maximum alternating curvature was determined primarily by between-patient differences, not differences in lead stiffness. Across regions, maximum alternating curvature was greatest in the extravenous region (p = 0.001). In this region, the length of the highly-stressed portion of the lead correlated inversely with lead stiffness (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

HUCS is the first study to measure alternating in vivo stresses applied to leads from multiple manufacturers which spanned a range of stiffnesses and thereby enable development of an evidence-based lead testing standard. The greatest alternating stress occurs in the extravenous region. There, lead stiffness predicts how much of the lead is highly stressed but does not predict maximum alternating curvature.

### Clinical experience with pacemaker pulse generators and transvenous leads: an 8-year prospective multicenter study [^112uQQ8F]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pacemakers have improved the lives of patients worldwide. Unfortunately, the medical community has had little independent information regarding the performance of these vital medical devices.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the reasons pacemaker pulse generators and transvenous leads were removed from service. We evaluated the causes and major adverse clinical events associated with device end-of-service life behavior and how they were detected and managed.

Methods

Pulse generator and lead data were entered prospectively using a web-based format. Normal battery depletion was signified by the elective replacement indicator appearing > 3 years after implant. Lead failure was a device defect causing pacing, sensing, or fixation malfunction, high threshold, or abnormal impedance. Major adverse clinical events were death, angina, heart failure, syncope, and perioperative surgical complications.

Results

From 1998 to 2006, 2,652 pulse generator and 615 leads were removed from service. The average pulse generator was implanted for 7.3 ± 3.1 years (range < 1 day to 26 years). The majority of pulse generators (n = 2,317 [87%]) were replaced for normal battery depletion. Severe and accelerated battery depletion, manufacturers' advisories, and electronic or connector defects accounted for 13% of pulse generator removals. The proportion of pulse generators removed from service as a result of manufacturers' advisories, electronic failure, and housing defects were 4%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Models with rate response capability had shorter battery longevities than those without rate response capability. Major adverse clinical events due to pulse generator end-of-service life behavior were related to electronic and connector defects, and both normal and severe battery depletion. Median time to lead failure was 7.2 ± 5.2 years. Insulation defects caused the majority of lead failures, and most of these leads used polyurethane materials. Lead failure was associated with a 16% incidence of major adverse clinical events. No major adverse clinical events occurred when impending lead failure was detected at routine follow-up. Lead extraction was associated with a 5.6% complication rate, including one death.

Conclusion

Overall pulse generator performance was satisfactory. Differences in battery longevity were observed among models. In some patients, elective replacement indicators signifying normal battery depletion resulted in major adverse clinical events. Pacemaker follow-up effectively identified pulse generator end-of-service life and often detected impending lead failure, thus avoiding major adverse clinical events. Long-term studies are needed to assess chronic lead performance so that appropriate clinical management strategies, including recommendations for lead extraction, can be developed.

### Tricuspid regurgitation related to cardiac implantable electronic devices: an integrative review [^112ByRbT]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of cardiac implantable electronic devices, including permanent pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy, has dramatically increased in recent years. The interaction between the device lead and tricuspid valve leaflets is a potential cause of tricuspid regurgitation that in turn has an impact on morbidity and mortality. Echocardiography is necessary to grade tricuspid regurgitation severity. The use of three-dimensional imaging helps determine whether the device lead is interfering with normal leaflet coaptation. Early identification of lead-related tricuspid regurgitation is critical to select the optimal treatment, which may include lead extraction or even tricuspid valve repair or replacement in severe cases. The aims of this review are to provide a thorough assessment of the evidence about lead-associated tricuspid regurgitation and the benefits of using three-dimensional echocardiography with some technical considerations and to propose a treatment algorithm.

### Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy [^112oKXjp]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Left ventricular non-compaction, the most recently classified form of cardiomyopathy, is characterised by abnormal trabeculations in the left ventricle, most frequently at the apex. It can be associated with left ventricular dilation or hypertrophy, systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or both, or various forms of congenital heart disease. Affected individuals are at risk of left or right ventricular failure, or both. Heart failure symptoms can be induced by exercise or be persistent at rest, but many patients are asymptomatic. Patients on chronic treatment for compensated heart failure sometimes present acutely with decompensated heart failure. Other life-threatening risks of left ventricular non-compaction are ventricular arrhythmias or complete atrioventricular block, presenting clinically as syncope, and sudden death. Genetic inheritance arises in at least 30–50% of patients, and several genes that cause left ventricular non-compaction have been identified. These genes seem generally to encode sarcomeric (contractile apparatus) or cytoskeletal proteins, although, in the case of left ventricular non-compaction with congenital heart disease, disturbance of the NOTCH signalling pathway seems part of a final common pathway for this form of the disease. Disrupted mitochondrial function and metabolic abnormalities have a causal role too. Treatments focus on improvement of cardiac efficiency and reduction of mechanical stress in patients with systolic dysfunction. Further, treatment of arrhythmia and implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for prevention of sudden death are mainstays of therapy when deemed necessary and appropriate. Patients with left ventricular non-compaction and congenital heart disease often need surgical or catheter-based interventions. Despite progress in diagnosis and treatment in the past 10 years, understanding of the disorder and outcomes need to be improved.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Tricuspid valve surgery — incidence and technical considerations note that the need for pacemaker after repair has been reported to be as low as 2.3%, though several series report a much higher incidence, up to 22%, and in patients who need a pacemaker after repair, incidence of moderate to severe or severe tricuspid regurgitation is 42%. Specific timing of pacemaker implant has not been formally studied but 3 to 5 days after surgery is probably reasonable. Transvalvular, endocardial ventricular leads cannot be placed across mechanical valves in the tricuspid position, and although traditionally considered a contraindication, it may be that MRI can be performed safely in selected patients with abandoned leads under the auspices of specialized protocols.

### Cardiac implantable electronic device lead-induced tricuspid regurgitation [^116Jnifp]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

With the expanding use of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIEDs) in an ever-aging population, the looming problem of CIED-associated interference with the tricuspid valve is significant. The first pacemaker was implanted in 1958 for severe symptomatic bradycardia. The concept of a device to avert sudden cardiac death (i.e., the defibrillator) was first published in 1970 by Mirowski and Mower. The first reports of CIED-mediated tricuspid valve apparatus interference surfaced in the late 1900s, but it was not until recently that concentrated efforts have been made to better define the scope of CIED-mediated interference with the tricuspid valve apparatus. Because stopping implantation of these devices is not an option, better understanding of their mechanical complications could potentially lead to improvements in device design or epicardial device implantation, as an alternative, in select patients. This review covers existing evidence for CIED-mediated tricuspid regurgitation, discusses potential mechanisms of CIED-mediated interference of the tricuspid valve apparatus, provides an overview of how to diagnose CIED-mediated interference on echocardiography, and discusses management strategies for patients who have CIED-mediated severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Causes of syncopal recurrences in patients treated with permanent pacing for bradyarrhythmic syncope: findings from the SYNCOPACED registry [^114br2WN]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined the causes of syncope/collapse recurrences in patients with a previously implanted pacemaker for bradyarrhythmic syncope.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the causes of syncope/collapse recurrences after pacemaker implantation for bradyarrhythmic syncope in a large patient population.

Methods

The SYNCOpal recurrences in patients treated with permanent PACing for bradyarrhythmic syncope (SYNCOPACED) registry was a prospective multicenter observational registry enrolling 1364 consecutive patients undergoing pacemaker implantation for bradyarrhythmic syncope. During follow-up, the time to the first syncope/collapse recurrence was recorded. Patients with syncope/collapse recurrences underwent a predefined diagnostic workup aimed at establishing the mechanism of syncope/collapse.

Results

During a median follow-up of 50 months, 213 patients (15.6%) reported at least 1 syncope/collapse recurrence. The risk of syncope/collapse recurrence was highest in patients who underwent implantation for cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope (26.4%), followed by unexplained syncope and chronic bifascicular block (21.5%), cardioinhibitory carotid sinus syndrome (17.2%), atrial fibrillation needing pacing (15.5%), atrioventricular block (13.6%), and sinus node disease (12.5%) (P = 0.017). The most frequent cause of syncope/collapse recurrence was reflex syncope (27.7%), followed by orthostatic hypotension (26.3%), pacemaker or lead malfunction (5.6%), structural cardiac disease (5.2%), and atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (4.7% and 3.8%, respectively). In 26.8% of cases, the mechanism of syncope/collapse remained unexplained.

Conclusion

In patients receiving a pacemaker for bradyarrhythmic syncope, reflex syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most frequent mechanisms of syncope/collapse recurrence after implantation. Pacing system malfunction, structural cardiac diseases, and tachyarrhythmias are rare mechanisms. The mechanism remains unexplained in > 25% of patients.

### Risk factors and temporal trends of complications associated with transvenous implantable cardiac defibrillator leads [^1151xbo8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The ability to glean data from large healthcare databases has allowed researchers and clinicians to analyze the incidence of ICD lead failure, the Achilles heel of a transvenous ICD. Lead failure attributable to mechanical causes usually results in a snowballing effect, with incremental numbers of procedures performed to rectify the problem. Such interventions have a high incidence of unsavory outcomes, which in certain instances could result in patient death during a lead extraction and infection with virulent organisms, leading to significant financial burden imposed on the patient and the healthcare systems. Prior studies that evaluated ICD lead reliability were based on single‐center or multicenter studies and industry‐related databases. These studies are limited by insufficient patient follow‐up time and/or small sample size. The present analysis is unique in that it includes a large number of patients with long‐term follow‐up and implanted with ICD leads from different manufacturers and by implanters in varied healthcare settings, both private and academic.

### Complications and prognosis of patients undergoing apical or septal right ventricular pacing [^115r1NtT]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac pacing devices are central to modern cardiology with over 500 000 devices implanted in the annually across Europe. Higher degree atrioventricular block remains an important indication for pacingin order to mitigate against the risk of syncope, progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. However, there remains a lack of consensus on the optimal positioning of the right ventricular lead in terms of cardiac function and long-term clinical outcomes.

Conventionally, right ventricular leads are placed at the apex, but increasing evidence suggests this strategy may have deleterious effects on cardiac function by producing an iatrogenic left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern on the ECG and dyssynchronous ventricular contraction. The LBBB ECG pattern is associated with worse clinical outcomes in both diseased and normal hearts, with recent data suggesting that pacemaker-related LBBB is similarly disadvantageous. Indeed patients with severely impaired left ventricular function and high right ventricular apical pacing burdens (50%–100%) have an increased subsequent incidence of heart failure compared with patients with low burdens (0%–50%). This is thought to relate to the interventricular and intraventricular electrical and mechanical dyssynchronythat occurs with apical pacing, which can lead to adverse remodelling, altered cardiac perfusionand impaired function. Even in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function, there is evidence to suggest some reduction in function with both apical and septal pacing.

Alternative pacing strategies achieving more physiological depolarisation might improve ventricular synchrony and protect against these detrimental effects. These include minimal ventricular pacing algorithms, upgrade to cardiac resynchronisation therapy and His-bundle pacing. However, the most widely used strategy is pacing of the right ventricular septum and outflow tract. The rationale is that pacing from these septal sites might allow recruitment of the intrinsic cardiac conduction system that lies in close proximity, thereby reducing QRS duration and subsequent ventricular dyssynchrony. Septal pacing is also attractive because it is less technically challenging than other strategies such as cardiac resynchronisation therapy and His-bundle pacing. Moreover, it is generally accepted that septal lead placement avoids the perioperative risk of cardiac perforation and tamponade compared with apical lead placement. However, concerns have been raised about the risks of lead displacement and the ability of this approach to reliably recruit the intrinsic conduction system.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the procedural safety and long-term clinical outcomes of a large real-world cohort of patients with higher degree atrioventricular block non-selectively assigned to pacing operators with preference for either septal or apical right ventricular pacing strategies.

Lead extraction — pre-procedure data collection includes patient demographics (age, height, weight, medication etc.), cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities (e.g. prior open heart surgery, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, presence of ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident etc.) as these may affect procedural outcome, indication for the CIED, pacemaker dependence, indication for extraction, and antibiotic information should be recorded (type, duration, timing). Device and lead data include number of leads and type of device and all leads; the lead consists of the body, conductors, electrodes, insulation, fixation mechanisms, and each of these components can influence the extractability of the lead, and it is therefore important that these data are available for analysis, with the main characteristics (e.g. active- vs. passive-fixation, single- vs. dual-coil ICD leads, subcutaneous leads, epicardial leads, or patches etc.) captured manually for each lead as needed.

### Case report: pacemaker lead perforation of a papillary muscle inducing severe tricuspid regurgitation [^115g3wEU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

We report a rare but severe pacemaker complication of a pacemaker lead perforating the papillary muscle. This induced severe tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure. Patients suffering from right heart failure have an increased operative risk of open-heart surgery and therefore represent a clinical challenge due to the lack of clear guidelines.

Case presentation

A 70-year-old male patient presented with severe tricuspid regurgitation and a history of decompensated right heart failure. One pacemaker lead was described as 'whipping'. Four years earlier he had received a VVIR pacemaker with a passive lead. This lead failed after three years and a new ventricular lead had been placed. We performed on-pump beating heart surgery after a multidisciplinary decision process. One lead was perforating the posterior papillary muscle, severely impairing valve movement. The tricuspid valve was replaced with a stented bioprosthesis. Epicardial pacemaker wires were placed on the right and left ventricle to enable cardiac resynchronization therapy in the case of postoperative heart failure. However, the patient recovered quickly without left ventricular pacing and could be discharged home 12 days after surgery.

Conclusion

This particular case emphasizes the importance of meticulous surgical technique during pacemaker lead implantation and a tight postoperative follow-up including echocardiography in complicated cases. The management of patients with an indication for lead removal having developed secondary severe tricuspid valve dysfunction inducing ventricular impairment represents a clinical challenge and should be approached by a multidisciplinary team.

### Evolution of tricuspid valve regurgitation after implantation of a leadless pacemaker: a single center experience, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^112txZor]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Conventional transvenous pacemaker leads may interfere with the tricuspid valve leaflets, tendinous chords, and papillary muscles, resulting in significant tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR). Leadless pacemakers (LLPMs) theoretically cause less mechanical interference with the tricuspid valve apparatus. However, data on TR after LLPM implantation are sparse and conflicting. Our goal was to investigate the prevalence of significant TR before and after LLPM implantation.

Methods

Patients who received a leadless LLPM (Micra™ TPS, Medtronic) between May 2016 and May 2021 at our center were included in this observational study if they had at least a pre‐ and postinterventional echocardiogram (TTE). The evolution of TR severity was assessed. Following a systematic literature review on TR evolution after implantation of a LLPM, data were pooled in a random‐effects meta‐analysis.

Results

We included 69 patients (median age 78 years [interquartile range (IQR) 72–84 years], 26% women). Follow‐up duration between baseline and follow‐up TTE was 11.4 months (IQR 3.5–20.1 months). At follow‐up, overall TR severity was not different compared to baseline (p = .49). Six patients (9%) had new significant TR during follow‐up after LLPM implantation, whereas TR severity improved in seven patients (10%). In the systematic review, we identified seven additional articles that investigated the prevalence of significant TR after LLPM implantation. The meta‐analysis based on 297 patients failed to show a difference in significant TR before and after LLPM implantation (risk ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.53, p = .11).

Conclusion

To date, there is no substantial evidence for a significant change in TR after implantation of a LLPM.

### 2023 HRS / APHRS / LAHRS guideline on cardiac physiologic pacing for the avoidance and mitigation of heart failure [^115W6EWT]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac physiologic pacing — lead placement site selection in septal or LV regions — Lead placement in close proximity to the normal septal conduction system or left ventricular (LV) sites may be preferred, with select right ventricular (RV) septal pacing sites (typically inflow to mid‑septum) associated with either improved or preserved LV contractility and a narrow QRS/normalized axis. When assessing sites using contractility (dP/dt), the mid‑septal region (moderator band area) was typically associated with the best responses, and the optimal site appears patient specific, stressing the need to individualize lead implants. Electroanatomic mapping has been utilized to localize RV transvenous sites with narrowest QRS on mid‑septum, para‑Hisian, or RV outflow tract, and adverse thresholds and valve problems have not been a concern with septal pacing.

Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with pacemaker implantation — implant complications, timing, and procedural sequencing — Although few studies report pacemaker implant complication rates, the overall risk of lead dislodgement or failure is approximately 2%, and many operators perform both AVNA and pacemaker implant during the same procedure; however, a European survey indicated up to 80% of operators will choose to perform AVNA 1 to 3 months after pacemaker implantation to reduce early lead dislodgement risk. In the prospective FOLLOWPACE registry from 23 centers, lead dislodgment was the most frequent lead-related complication, occurring in 3.3% of patients within the first 2 months of implant. A pooled patient-level analysis of 4814 subjects found higher early complications in those age ≥ 75 years (5% versus 3%), driven by lead dislodgement (2%) and pneumothorax (1.6%). If AVNA and pacing are performed concomitantly, ideally, leads should be placed first to ensure adequate lead function.

### Pacemaker and ICD generator malfunctions… [^113B6vgv]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

During the study period, there were 17 323 devices explanted due to confirmed malfunction. The annual number of malfunctions ranged from 366 to 1152 for pacemakers and from 134 to 2228 for ICDs. Of the 17 323 total device malfunctions during the study period, hardware abnormalities were by far the most common type, affecting 13 827 devices. Hardware abnormalities were the most common type of defect for both pacemakers and ICDs. Of these hardware problems, battery/capacitor abnormalities and electrical issues accounted for half of the total device failures. Battery/capacitor abnormalities accounted for a higher percentage of device malfunctions in ICDs than in pacemakers, as did charge-circuit abnormalities.

Hermetic-seal abnormalities affected a much more significant percentage of pacemakers than of ICDs, primarily because a single manufacturer had repeated problems in multiple pacemaker models in the early 1990s. Miscellaneous electrical problems, such as broken wires, current leakage, and electrical short circuits represented similar percentages of malfunctions, both in pacemakers and in ICDs. Device malfunction was directly responsible for 61 confirmed deaths during the study period. Reported pacemaker and ICD malfunctions were equally likely to have resulted in death. Because ICDs are substantially more sophisticated than pacemakers, it is not surprising that they have a higher device malfunction replacement rate.

The specific types of malfunctions observed most often in ICDs are unique, critical features of the device. After an improving ICD malfunction replacement rate during the first half of the 1990s, the number and rate of ICD replacements due to device malfunction increased.

Impedance in the diagnosis of lead malfunction. Circ arrhythm electrophisiol. 2020; 13: e008092. Doi: /circep.
119. 008092. Event Description It was reported per article of interest literature review that several of the figures discuss boston scientific products. Figure 4 shows pacing impedance trends, including abrupt, transient increase to both in-range and open-circuit pace impedance values, likely caused by is-1 header-lead pin mismatch between a boston scientific implantable cardioverter. defibrillator and non-boston scientific lead pin. This lead remains in service and recent interrogations showed normal trends.

Also described is gradually increasing out-of-range pace impedance in an endotak lead, with electrical function remaining acceptable and the lead remaining in service. Finally, abrupt, transient pace impedance dips within. normal range in a lead connected to a pacemaker. Electrical function was normal, and the lead remained in service, the cause being unknown. Figure 5 shows representative right ventricular shock-coil trends which include examples such as an abrupt 20 ohms increase in shock impedance, within normal limits, after. generator change between prizm 2 and teligen devices due to a change in measuring-pulse amplitude. Also, a gradual increase in an endotak lead shock impedance, out-of-range, presumably caused by mineralization of the rv coil. Noninvasive defibrillation testing demonstrated an adequate safety margin in this lead,… it remained in service. Figure 7 showed impedance trends recorded from functioning leads without other abnormalities.

Examples include an autoscaled plot of individual right atrial and rv pacing impedances in boston scientific accolade pacemaker which gives visual appearance of abrupt changes for values within normal range. Also, a trend from an ingevity bipolar atrial lead connected to an accolade pacemaker showed gradual increase and decrease in pace impedance within normal limits without an identified cause. The impedance subsequently decreased to about 800 ohms and remained stable; the lead continued to function normally. No adverse patient effects were reported.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices with abandoned leads… [^115YXwQZ]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Prior to MRI, the CIED was interrogated with evaluation of baseline battery voltage, sensing, pacing thresholds, and lead impedances. Devices were reprogrammed based on patient-specific pacing needs, and tachyarrhythmia detection and therapies were deactivated. Attempts were made during reprogramming to avoid potential competition from an underlying rhythm and to minimize the risk of a pacing-mediated arrhythmia. Patients who were permanent pacemaker dependent, defined as no significant intrinsic rhythm above 40 beats per minute, were reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode. Patients who were not PPM dependent were programmed to either a nontracking mode, programmed to an asynchronous mode, or pacing was turned off. Manufacturer-specific MRI conditional device programming was used for applicable devices, although the presence of an abandoned lead renders the system nonconditional and the protocol used for these patients was the same as used for those with legacy devices.

CIED leads have been shown to heat when exposed to a magnetic field in an MRI environment, 12, 13 potentially resulting in myocardial thermal injury, arrhythmias, damage to adjacent leads, and changes in capture thresholds and sensing parameters. However, MRI in the setting of abandoned leads is theoretically associated with higher risk leading to exclusion of many of these patients from studies. In a cylindrical phantom model, for clinical lead lengths between 40 and 60 cm, abandoned leads exhibited greater lead tip heating compared with leads attached to a generator. 9 In a similar study using a phantom human trunk simulator, abandoned leads were found to modify the radiofrequency-heating profile of adjacent MRI-conditional leads. The 6 adverse events that were seen included mostly reductions in lead sensing with the ability to successfully reprogram the sensitivity of the affected lead until normalization occurred.

Of those 5 patients, 4 involved the right atrial lead, slightly higher than the 1% incidence of comparable events seen in the largest experience of patients undergoing MRI with legacy devices but without abandoned leads, 27 likely explained by the higher change in sensing threshold of 50% used in that study. Although our patient population was heterogenous with a wide array of active and abandoned leads, this does not represent all available leads, and the extent of heating and current induction is likely a function of lead fragment length as well as the presence or absence of end caps. Although we specifically looked for evidence of abandoned leads during our MRI screening procedure, it is possible that some patients with abandoned leads were not known at the time of MRI.

### MAUDE adverse event report: MEDTRONIC PACEMAKER… [^112zwC9r]. FDA (AccessData) (2016). Low credibility.

The lead wires are/were at the initial implant. I don't know which one is atrial lead. In 2016, one of my pacemaker's lead wires broke and lost it's insulation, so i am told, thereby emitting a constant stream of electrical activity over my heart until 2016. pacemaker was checked over the phone prior to the time it was checked in the cardiac lab. Every three months i get on the phone and had what i thought was a complete pacemaker check. I subsequently found out a broken pacemaker lead does not show up on the phone test, only in the cardiac lab testing. The lead. was replaced on 2016, a few days after it was discovered. The pacemaker was only three years old. Fortunately for me, i am pacemaker dependent from the ventricular wire, not the atrial wire. Otherwise, i would have died within a few minutes of the wire breaking. It. could have been the ventricular wire that failed.

Knowing the seriousness of the lead break, i have tried to find out what caused the wire to fail, to no avail. The doctor simply told me that it was nothing i did or did not do, as did the medtronic representative who was present at the time of. the wire replacement procedure and tested the wire prior to the procedure. Not knowing why the wire failed means i cannot help to prevent my death from a pacemaker failure. I do not assume the doctor and medtronic rep were correct in saying that it was nothing i did or didn't do that caused the wire to fail since they could. not tell me why it did fail. I ask that your office investigate this failure and find the cause of the failure in order to help me and others who may be at risk without knowing it at least know of this potential failure and what to avoid, if anything. I would like to be notified as to the cause of the wire failure.

I am told that it is unusual for a pacemaker wire to break at three years, making the cause of the failure all the more important to investigate. Thank you for your time in reading this letter. I certainly appreciate it. Feel free to call me anytime at the number above, which is.
