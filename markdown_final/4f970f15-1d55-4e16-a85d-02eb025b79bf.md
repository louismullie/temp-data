## Question

Patient with worsening right upper quadrant pain. Abdominal ultrasound showing no cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, or bile duct dilatation. Multiple gallbladder polyps, the largest one of 4mm, compatiblr with benign lesion, recommend abdominal ultrasound follow-up in 12 months. Hepatitic steatosis. Next steps in addressing right upper quadrant pain.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient with right upper quadrant pain, small gallbladder polyps, and hepatic steatosis found on ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and whether the ultrasound has adequately addressed biliary disease. Then, I should verify the significance of the 4 mm gallbladder polyp and whether it explains the pain. Next, I will examine how hepatic steatosis fits into the differential and what labs and noninvasive fibrosis tools are indicated. After that, I need to consider extrabiliary causes of RUQ pain and when to escalate imaging beyond ultrasound. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and outline a stepwise management plan with follow-up and red flags for urgent action.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the adequacy of the initial imaging. Ultrasound is the appropriate first-line test for RUQ pain and suspected biliary disease, and a negative study for cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and biliary dilatation substantially lowers the likelihood of acute biliary pathology, though it does not eliminate it entirely, especially if clinical suspicion remains high or the study quality is limited [^111s74rW] [^115XDdSy] [^116LQFvF]. Wait, let me verify the polyp size and risk implications: a solitary 4 mm polyp is well below the 6–10 mm range where surveillance or intervention is typically considered, and current data suggest that very small polyps have extremely low malignant potential and grow slowly, so routine follow-up is often unnecessary unless there are additional risk factors or growth over time [^113PsArG] [^1163Xxcj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the gallbladder as the pain source. I should confirm whether the pain phenotype matches biliary colic or cholecystitis: biliary colic is typically episodic, severe, lasts 15–30 minutes or longer, localizes to the RUQ or epigastrium, may radiate to the back or right shoulder, and often follows fatty meals; acute cholecystitis adds fever, persistent pain, and RUQ tenderness, which together with ultrasound findings would support that diagnosis [^112ZUeFZ] [^114LvVvZ]. Given a negative ultrasound for cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, the likelihood that a 4 mm polyp is causing this pain is very low, so I should pivot toward other etiologies while keeping a low threshold to revisit biliary disease if the clinical picture evolves or new data emerge [^111s74rW].

> Next, I should review hepatic steatosis as a contributor. Let me think about the initial workup: I need to check liver enzymes, exclude other causes of liver disease, screen for metabolic comorbidities, and quantify fibrosis risk noninvasively using FIB-4 or the NAFLD Fibrosis Score, because ultrasound-detected steatosis alone does not establish disease severity or explain pain, and NAFLD is often silent. Importantly, "normal" ALT ranges in many labs are too high for NAFLD risk stratification, so I should interpret values against tighter sex-specific cut points [^112TeHbB] [^11253FSZ]. I should double-check alcohol intake against accepted thresholds and consider medication and supplement contributors, including over-the-counter agents, to avoid mislabeling as NAFLD when alcohol or drug injury is present [^112hk82c] [^111dPX12].

> I will now examine extrabiliary causes of RUQ pain that ultrasound can miss or underappreciate. Peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and functional dyspepsia commonly present with upper abdominal pain and may be indistinguishable from biliary pain; if symptoms suggest these, a trial of acid suppression and Helicobacter pylori testing is reasonable, reserving endoscopy for alarm features or refractory symptoms. But wait, what if the pain is pancreatobiliary or renal in origin? I should consider acute or chronic pancreatitis, especially if epigastric with back radiation and enzyme elevations, and remember that in older adults or those with idiopathic pancreatitis, MRCP or EUS may be needed to detect occult stones or strictures; likewise, right-sided nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis can mimic RUQ pain and may require CT if ultrasound is nondiagnostic [^114PVJ2t] [^112tX3cX]. I need to ensure I also keep musculoskeletal and pleuropulmonary sources in mind, particularly if the pain is positional or associated with respiratory motion [^111s74rW].

> Let me reconsider the need for additional imaging. If the pain persists, is severe, or if new red flags appear, cross-sectional imaging can increase diagnostic yield beyond ultrasound. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is appropriate to evaluate for complications or alternative intra-abdominal pathology, and MRCP is preferred when biliary obstruction or ductal disease remains suspected despite a negative ultrasound, given its superior delineation of the biliary tree without invasive risks [^112tX3cX] [^117DxLpY]. I should confirm that ERCP is reserved for therapeutic intent due to pancreatitis risk, not for diagnostic purposes alone, aligning with contemporary endoscopy guidance [^1176f8Kn].

> Now, I should synthesize the differential diagnosis. The leading considerations are non-biliary gastrointestinal etiologies such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, functional dyspepsia, and pancreatitis; hepatobiliary alternatives include NAFLD-related capsular stretch or inflammation, early cholangitis, or even drug-induced liver injury; musculoskeletal or pulmonary sources remain possible depending on exam and history; and although the 4 mm polyp is unlikely causal, I should keep gallbladder dyskinesia in reserve if classic biliary colic persists without stones, in which case cholescintigraphy could be considered to assess ejection fraction and symptom reproduction [^112FdDdA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the polyp might be contributing, but given its tiny size and the negative ultrasound for cholecystitis, I should deprioritize biliary sources unless the clinical picture strongly suggests dyskinesia or new findings emerge [^notfound].

> Next, I should review immediate management steps. I need to obtain a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, a complete blood count, lipase, and a basic metabolic profile. I should quantify alcohol intake, review all medications and supplements, and screen for metabolic risk factors including obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Concurrently, I will calculate FIB-4 to risk-stratify fibrosis and arrange follow-up to trend enzymes and symptoms [^112TeHbB] [^11253FSZ]. Let me verify that lifestyle counseling is front and center: weight loss of at least 5–10% improves steatosis and may reduce liver-related progression risk, so structured dietary change and physical activity should be initiated now, with cardometabolic risk optimization alongside liver-directed care [^114QfjoD] [^111ATJwb].

> I should confirm the follow-up plan and surveillance. For the 4 mm gallbladder polyp, given the absence of risk factors and the low growth and malignancy risk at this size, no immediate follow-up imaging is required. If reassurance is needed, a single repeat ultrasound in 12–24 months is reasonable, but prolonged serial surveillance is not supported for sub-6 mm polyps without additional risk factors [^113PsArG] [^1163Xxcj]. For hepatic steatosis, I will reassess liver enzymes in 3–6 months, reinforce weight loss and exercise, and escalate to MRCP or consider liver elastography if cholestatic labs develop, imaging suggests fibrosis, or if noninvasive fibrosis scores indicate higher risk, aligning with AASLD guidance on staging and referral thresholds [^112TeHbB] [^117DxLpY].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety-netting and clear return precautions. Red flags that warrant urgent re-evaluation include fever, jaundice, persistent vomiting, severe or escalating pain, new confusion, or GI bleeding; if such features appear, I should repeat ultrasound or proceed to CT or MRCP as indicated, and involve surgery or gastroenterology early if acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis becomes likely based on evolving labs and imaging [^111s74rW] [^117DxLpY]. Hold on, I should verify that the patient understands that the current findings do not explain the pain and that we are pursuing a parallel GI and metabolic evaluation; this sets expectations and supports adherence to lifestyle interventions while we monitor for changes that could redirect the workup.

The next steps are to **order liver enzymes, bilirubin, and inflammatory markers** to assess for hepatitis, cholangitis, or other hepatobiliary causes [^112TeHbB], and to **consider cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI)** if pain persists or if labs are abnormal, as ultrasound can miss small stones, sludge, or subtle biliary disease [^111s74rW] [^114NNQvx]. If pain remains unexplained, **evaluate for functional gallbladder disorder** with a HIDA scan and consider gastroenterology referral [^112FdDdA]. Manage NAFLD with weight loss, metabolic risk control, and lifestyle changes; no immediate intervention is needed for 4 mm polyps, but repeat ultrasound in 6–12 months if risk factors are present [^114QfjoD] [^113PsArG].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Order **liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT)** to assess for hepatitis, cholangitis, or other hepatobiliary disease [^113nPWUr]. Obtain **bilirubin (total and direct)** to evaluate for cholestasis or biliary obstruction [^117Bni1T]. Check **CBC, ESR, and CRP** to screen for inflammation or infection [^113nPWUr].

---

## Additional imaging studies

If ultrasound is inconclusive or symptoms persist, obtain a **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast** to detect small stones, sludge, or subtle biliary disease [^112tX3cX]. Use **MRCP** for detailed biliary tree assessment when choledocholithiasis or strictures are suspected [^117DxLpY]. Consider **HIDA scan** if functional gallbladder disorder (e.g. biliary dyskinesia) is suspected [^112FdDdA].

---

## Management of hepatic steatosis (NAFLD)

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise are first-line therapy [^notfound].

- **Metabolic risk control**: Manage diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^111ATJwb].

- **Alcohol abstinence**: Strictly avoid alcohol [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Track liver enzymes and fibrosis progression with non-invasive tests (e.g. FIB-4) [^1138NXqB].

---

## Follow-up for gallbladder polyps

For gallbladder polyps, **4 mm polyps** have a very low malignancy risk; no immediate intervention is needed. If risk factors are present (age > 50, solitary polyp, rapid growth), **repeat ultrasound in 6–12 months**; otherwise, annual surveillance is reasonable [^113PsArG].

---

## Clinical pathways and specialist referrals

Refer to **gastroenterology** for persistent unexplained pain, abnormal liver tests, or suspected functional gallbladder disorder. Refer to **surgery** for suspected biliary dyskinesia or if polyps grow to > 10 mm [^112FdDdA] [^113PsArG].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

1. Liver enzymes, bilirubin, CBC, ESR, CRP
2. CT abdomen/pelvis or MRCP if ultrasound is inconclusive
3. HIDA scan if functional gallbladder disorder suspected
4. Lifestyle modifications for NAFLD
5. Repeat ultrasound in 6–12 months for polyps
6. Specialist referral if indicated

---

Persistent RUQ pain despite a negative ultrasound warrants a **structured workup**: labs, advanced imaging, and consideration of functional biliary disorders, with NAFLD management and selective polyp surveillance.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — evaluation when suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma is high (Best Practice Advice 4): PSC patients with increasing cholestatic biochemistry values or who develop jaundice, fever, right upper-quadrant pain, or pruritus should undergo appropriate evaluation for cholangiocarcinoma rather than continued surveillance. Dominant strictures are defined by stenoses with a diameter of 1.5 mm or less in the common bile duct and/or 1.0 mm or less in a hepatic duct within 2 cm of the main hepatic confluence by ERCP. Among PSC patients with a dominant stricture, 6.2% to 26.3% will be diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma over a 6.2- to 9.8-year follow-up period. Because benign and malignant strictures can appear similar on imaging, a high index of suspicion is warranted and direct sampling of the stricture should be considered to rule out underlying cholangiocarcinoma.

### Gallbladder polyp outcomes and association with gallbladder cancer… [^113PsArG]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Kaplan-Meier curves show unadjusted risk of growth of existing gallbladder polyps in adults with quantitative initial polyp size. Follow-up was until the last abdominal ultrasonograph. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that current guidelines recommending periodic ultrasonography of gallbladder polyps to proactively detect gallbladder cancer may need to be revised. Importance Gallbladder polyps are found in more than 4% of adult abdominal ultrasonographs. Their growth pattern and association with gallbladder cancer are poorly defined. The duration of follow-up was not addressed. 10 The 2 studies referenced included 346 patients, of whom 149 underwent ultrasonography follow-up for a mean of 5. 4 years, 11 and 467 patients observed for a median of 39 months. 12 The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy also recommended indefinite yearly follow-up for GPs.

13 A 2017 joint guideline from various European societies recommended surgery for all polyps larger than 10 mm and for those larger than 6 mm with risk factors and 5 years of follow-up for all other polyps. We found that polyps detected by ultrasonography grew at a low rate, but that growth did not stop over time. Consequently, an increasing percentage reached the 10 mm size threshold over time, which, as expected, happened more commonly with polyps that were initially large. Importantly, this growth did not appear to be associated with future GBC; none of the 507 patients with smaller polyps that grew to 10 mm or larger were subsequently diagnosed with cancer, despite 1549 person-years of follow-up. Cholecystectomy is recommended for polyps sized 10 mm or larger and for polyps that grow at least 2 mm. Our study suggests that growth over time is the natural history of GP and that even stability for 5 years does not guarantee subsequent stability.

Furthermore, we did not find evidence that this subsequent growth was associated with GBC. Our findings do support the position of the American College of Radiology that polyps smaller than 7 mm do not need follow-up and suggest that this may also apply to polyps sized between 7 mm and less than 10 mm. 10 Further studies are needed to validate this approach. A limited strategy of 1 or 2 follow-up ultrasonographs in the subsequent year or 2 years should provide adequate reassurance, if needed.

### Adequacy and quality of abdominal echographies requested by primary care professionals [^111E3YDq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

In primary care the main reasons for requesting an abdominal echography are an alteration in the liver function tests, pain in the upper right quadrant, unspecific abdominal disturbances, control of chronic liver diseases, and control of biliary polyps and cysts. Of all these situations, the most appropriate for requesting an abdominal echography are for the screening of hepataocarcinoma in patients with chronic liver diseases, the presence of gallstones, the study of probable steatosis in patients with alterations in liver function tests and the control of biliary polyps. It is not very useful in either the study of dyspepsias or unspecific abdominal disturbances.

Apart from evaluating whether the request for the echography have sufficient information correct or not, it is important to analyse whether it is adequate or not. We believe that this point is very important and needs the effort of both clinicians and radiologists to achieve a consensus of criteria when requesting echographies. It has been reported that the use of guidelines or recommendations reduces the percentage of requests and, in addition, the establishment of criteria regarding whether the indication is adequate or not, this demand would probably be further reduced, thereby improving the diagnostic yield. There are no studies in the literature evaluating the adequacy or not of echographies. However, some reports have evaluated the changes in therapeutic attitude of physicians based on the results of echographies and this is interpreted as good adequacy.

Along this line, one of the most important studies carried out in the Netherlands was a prospective cohort study undertaken from April 2003 to December 2004 in a total of 76 primary care physicians and 396 patients from three areas, The objectives were to quantify the rate of influence of positive and negative abdominal echography findings on the change in therapeutic attitude and management of the patients and evaluate the consequences of abdominal echography on the satisfaction of the patients. The most important results were a change in therapeutic attitude in 64% of the cases, a significant reduction in the number of consultations with specialists (from 45% to 30%) and an increase in the resolution of the patients from primary care (from 15% to 43%). To the contrary, this change was not evaluated by the patients.

### Acute cholecystitis… [^115a35kw]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

In many cases of acute cholecystitis gallstones block the bile ducts. Bile builds up and can push on the walls of the gallbladder, causing inflammation. Other causes of acute cholecystitis include infection, trauma, diabetes, or blockage of the bile ducts due to a tumor. The January 1, 2003, issue of JAMA includes an article about diagnosing acute cholecystitis. SYMPTOMS Symptoms of acute cholecystitis include Intense, sudden pain in the upper right part of the abdomen Recurrent, painful attacks for several hours after meals Pain that can worsen with deep breaths and that extends to thelower part of the right shoulder blade.

Shortness of breath due to pain when inhaling Nausea Vomiting Stiff abdominal muscles, especially on the right side Slight fever Chills Jaundice Abdominal bloating DIAGNOSIS Because the symptoms of acute cholecystitis can resemble symptoms of other illnesses, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose. If a doctor suspects acute cholecystitis after a careful physical examination, he or she may perform some of the following tests: Abdominal ultrasound — use of high-frequency sound waves to create an image of internal organs Hepatobiliary scintigraphy — an imaging technique used to see the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, and upper part of the small intestine Cholangiography — injection of dye into the bile ducts so the gallbladder and ducts can be seen on x-rays. Computed tomography scan — an imaging procedure that uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to produce images of the internal organs TREATMENT.

Treatment for acute cholecystitis usually involves hospitalization. The patient is not allowed to eat or drink, and liquids are given through an intravenous line. If an infection is suspected, antibiotics may be given. Most patients who have acute cholecystitis have their gallbladder removed, either immediately after diagnosis or after the patient has improved. This procedure, called a cholecystectomy, can be performed using a laparoscope or by conventional surgery.

### The diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guideline by the American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Gastroenterology [^116HZTpv]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD encompasses fatty liver disease in individuals without significant alcohol consumption, ranging from fatty liver to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) is hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury (ballooning) or fibrosis, with minimal risk of progression. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without fibrosis, and can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and rarely liver cancer. NASH cirrhosis is cirrhosis with current or previous histological evidence of steatosis or steatohepatitis, while cryptogenic cirrhosis is cirrhosis with no obvious etiology and is enriched with metabolic risk factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. The NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) is an unweighted composite of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning scores used to measure histologic change in NAFLD clinical trials.

Alcohol consumption thresholds in suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — By definition, NAFLD indicates the lack of evidence for ongoing or recent consumption of significant amounts of alcohol. For NASH clinical trials eligibility, significant alcohol consumption was recommended as > 21 standard drinks per week in men and > 14 standard drinks per week in women over a 2-year period preceding baseline liver histology, and a standard alcoholic drink contains about 14 g of pure alcohol. Ongoing or recent alcohol consumption > 21 standard drinks on average per week in men and > 14 standard drinks on average per week in women is a reasonable threshold for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating patients with suspected NAFLD.

### Right upper quadrant pain: ultrasound first! [^114TCGGR]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments and outpatient medical practices, and is most commonly attributable to biliary and hepatic pathology. Ultrasound should be used as a first-line imaging modality for the diagnosis of gallstones and cholecystitis, as it allows the differentiation of medical and surgical causes of upper abdominal pathology, and in many circumstances is sufficient to guide patient management. Knowledge of strengths and limitations of ultrasound in the evaluation of RUQ is paramount in correct diagnosis. A spectrum of RUQ pathology for which a RUQ ultrasound examination should reasonably be considered as the initial imaging modality of choice will be reviewed.

### Acute pancreatitis: updates for emergency clinicians [^116A4Zmj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is a frequent reason for patient presentation to the emergency department (ED) and the most common gastrointestinal disease resulting in admission. Emergency clinicians are often responsible for the diagnosis and initial management of acute pancreatitis.

Objective

This review article provides emergency clinicians with a focused overview of the diagnosis and management of pancreatitis.

Discussion

Pancreatitis is an inflammatory process within the pancreas. While the disease is often mild, severe forms can have a mortality rate of up to 30%. The diagnosis of pancreatitis requires two of the following three criteria: epigastric abdominal pain, an elevated lipase, and imaging findings of pancreatic inflammation. The most common etiologies include gallbladder disease and alcohol use. After the diagnosis has been made, it is important to identify underlying etiologies requiring specific intervention, as well as obtain a right upper quadrant ultrasound. The initial management of choice is fluid resuscitation and pain control. Recent data have suggested that more cautious fluid resuscitation in the first 24 h might be more appropriate for some patients. Intravenous opiates are generally safe if used judiciously. Appropriate disposition is a multifactorial decision, which can be facilitated by using Ranson criteria or the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis score. Complications, though rare, can be severe.

Conclusions

Pancreatitis is a potentially deadly disease that commonly presents to most emergency departments. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and disposition of these patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^111dW4BF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is a common presenting symptom in patients with acute cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, in most clinical scenarios, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound. Although cholescintigraphy has been shown to have slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, ultrasound is preferred as the initial study for a variety of reasons, including greater availability, shorter examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CT or MRI may be helpful in equivocal cases and may identify complications of acute cholecystitis. When ultrasound findings are inconclusive, MRI is the preferred imaging test in pregnant patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Gallbladder carcinoma

The incidence of gallbladder carcinoma widely varies in the world, with the highest incidences in India and South America (it is the primary cause of cancer death among women in Chile). Gallbladder carcinoma affects two to six times more women than men, its incidence steadily increases with age with a peak in the sixth and seventh decades. Gallstones are present in 65–90% of patients with gallbladder carcinoma; other risk factors include porcelain gallbladder, gallbladder polyps, and anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction.

Clinical features

Early diagnosis is difficult because most patients present with non-specific findings of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Jaundice has been associated with unresectable disease. Patients with advanced disease may also present with a palpable gallbladder mass, hard nodular liver, and malignant ascites.

Diagnostic work up

Three major patterns of presentation have been described on ultrasonography, CT-scan, or MRI: a focal or diffuse mural thickening (20–30%), an intraluminal polypoid mass originating from the gallbladder wall (15–25%), and a subhepatic mass replacing or obscuring the gallbladder (45–60%).

### Improving diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with US: new paradigms [^112B6kfD]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is an inflammatory condition of the gallbladder typically incited by mechanical obstruction. Accurate diagnosis of this common clinical condition is challenging due to variable imaging appearances as well as overlapping clinical manifestations with biliary colic, acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangiopathies. In acute cholecystitis, increased dilatation and high intraluminal pressures lead to gallbladder inflammation and may progress to gangrenous changes, focal wall necrosis, and subsequent perforation. In acute calculous cholecystitis, gallstones are the cause of obstruction and are often impacted in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, leading to gallbladder inflammation. In acalculous cholecystitis, patients are typically critically ill, often with hypotensive episodes and prolonged gallbladder stasis, which lead to obstruction, gallbladder ischemia, and inflammation. Helpful sonographic findings of acute cholecystitis include a dilated gallbladder; increased intraluminal pressures in the gallbladder, resulting in a bulging fundus (tensile fundus sign); intraluminal sludge in the setting of right upper quadrant pain; wall hyperemia, which may be quantified by elevated cystic artery velocities or hepatic artery velocities; mucosal ischemic changes, characterized by loss of mucosal echogenicity; pericholecystic inflammation, characterized by hyperechoic pericholecystic fat; and mucosal discontinuity. Extruded complex fluid next to a wall defect is definitive for gallbladder wall perforation, and further evaluation with CT or MRI allows evaluation of the full extent of perforation and other potential complications. The sonographic Murphy sign, while helpful if positive, is relatively insensitive for accurate diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Thus, overreliance on the sonographic Murphy sign results in surprisingly low diagnostic accuracy in practice.

Urgent or emergency management

In stable patients with right upper quadrant pain, bedside US is usually the first-line examination. If abdominal pain, fever, and ALT or AST > 10 times the upper normal value are present, HSV hepatitis should be suspected and acyclovir therapy should start empirically as soon as possible. If leukopenia is seen too, the diagnosis is almost certain. Differential diagnosis include hepatic bleeding and hematoma. Hyperleukocytosis will raise concern for liver abscess.

If hepatic infarction, rupture, hemorrhage, or hematoma are suspected, CT or MRI should be performed with contrast agents, if necessary, without delay. HELLP syndrome, liver tumors, trauma, or AFLP may be complicated by hepatic infarction, bleeding, hematoma, or liver capsule rupture, with a risk of maternal death > 5%. After the diagnosis, a decision of immediate or delayed delivery depends on both the cause of hemoperitoneum and the term of pregnancy and should be made by an expert multidisciplinary team.

In the presence of persistent signs of hemodynamic instability, immediate blood transfusions and delivery are required prior to trans-arterial embolization or surgery. Coordination with an LT center is recommended. Figure 14 provides a diagnostic chart for urgent and emergency situations.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain is a common complaint. Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the primary diagnostic consideration in most adults presenting with acute onset RUQ abdominal pain; however, a variety of other conditions can mimic AC. Abdominal ultrasound (US) receives the highest score for imaging appropriateness for these patients. This article reviews the sonographic findings of uncomplicated and complicated AC and provides practical technical tips. The radiologist should be familiar with conditions that can mimic AC, be able to suggest these alternative diagnoses when findings are present on US, and recommend additional tests or procedures, if needed.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Up to a third of the population have evidence of steatosis on imaging, with the majority (70%–90%) having simple steatosis. However, 10%–30% of subjects with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis, which puts patients at risk of liver-related complications. Due to the metabolic risk factors that are common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, patients with NASH have an increased risk of cardiovascular death as well as liver-related mortality. In the first part of this review, we discussed the diagnosis and staging of patients with NAFLD and the importance of risk stratification. Here we will discuss the management of patients with NAFLD.

### Avoid other imaging tests apart from ultrasound for the… [^111aRGpj]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic workup of acute right upper quadrant pain is informed by risk factors for cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound based on availability, examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. When the clinical features, examination, laboratory and ultrasound findings are congruent, no further imaging is required.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Gallbladder imaging interpretation pearls and pitfalls: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging [^114NNQvx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The gallbladder is a source of common disease processes with a wide variety of presentations. Common pathologies include acute or chronic cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, cancer, polyps, and postoperative complications. Accurate imaging assessment of the gallbladder can be very challenging and fraught with potential pitfalls. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. CT is often used as part of a broader evaluation of patient's abdominal pain if nongallbladder pathologies are also suspected. MRI/MRCP is typically reserved for problem-solving and evaluating patients who present with cholestatic presentation. We discuss common pitfalls, diagnostic challenges, and problem-solving approaches to the imaging evaluation of common gallbladder patho logies.

### Comparing percutaneous treatment and cholecystectomy outcomes in acute cholecystitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kMcD2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

AC typically presents with pain in the right upper quadrant, fever, nausea, and vomiting. To establish a diagnosis, healthcare providers rely on a thorough clinical assessment, along with ultrasound imaging and laboratory tests. The severity of the condition can vary widely, ranging from mild to severe, with serious complications such as gallbladder gangrene or perforation that can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. To ensure consistent and effective management, the Tokyo Guidelines were created to offer a clear framework for diagnosing and treating AC, also providing a classification system for the severity of the disease and evidence-based protocols to improve patient outcomes. According to the Tokyo Guidelines, cholecystectomy (CC), particularly the laparoscopic method, is the preferred surgical treatment for AC, especially when performed within 72 h of symptom onset, as it is associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stays. However, in patients at high surgical risk or those presenting later in the disease course, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC), commonly referred to as drainage, represents a valuable alternative in clinical context. While percutaneous drainage is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stays compared to CC, it remains a critical option for patients who are not candidates for surgery. In certain cases, percutaneous drainage may be employed as a temporary solution, while in others, it can serve as a definitive therapeutic approach.

Recent meta-analyses have consistently shown that early CC, preferably laparoscopic, is associated with better outcomes compared to PC, even in high-risk surgical patients with AC. The 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines strongly recommend early laparoscopic CC as the first-line treatment, reserving PC for patients unfit for surgery. However, the role of PC, either as a definitive treatment or as a bridge to delayed surgery, remains debated in specific clinical scenarios.

These systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide a comprehensive and updated evaluation in light of these guidelines and recent evidence, providing a comparison not only between PC and CC but also evaluates the outcomes of a staged approach (PC followed by CC) versus immediate CC. This dual perspective offers novel insights into the optimal management strategies for high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis.

Discussion

Our study is the first to report the impact of routine use of POCUS on the care of patients with biliary disease. From the perspective of diagnostic test performance our results are consistent with the literature in demonstrating that the use of biliary POCUS is sensitive and specific for assessing the presence of cholelithiasis, as well as features of cholecystitis. Uniquely, we chose to use the need for cholecystectomy as the gold standard by which our diagnostic test was evaluated. We chose this outcome as it is the ultimate treatment disposition for patients with biliary disease that is of most interest to surgeons and their patients. This is in contrast with typical validation studies of POCUS which compare the results of the bedside test with radiology department ultrasound. As a result, this study is the first to demonstrate that the presence of gallstones found on a POCUS scan in a patient with a significant suspicion for biliary pathology is highly predictive of the eventual need for cholecystectomy. Currently, surgeons are unlikely to take a patient for a cholecystectomy on a positive biliary POCUS study alone, instead relying on confirmatory ultrasounds performed in the radiology department. Despite significant evidence demonstrating good sensitivities and specificities of POCUS in the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, a gap between this evidence and surgical decision making remains, owing potentially to a perceived lack of trust in biliary POCUS. We propose that in a patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain that is consistent with biliary disease (gradual onset, constant, and unremitting), without a high-risk feature (clinical jaundice or elevated bilirubin) and without more likely alternative diagnosis (eg, peptic ulcer disease), surgeons consider offering the patient a cholecystectomy on the POCUS findings of biliary disease without confirmatory imaging. We also think that those patients with concerning features or inconsistent history and physical examinations be evaluated with formal radiology department imaging prior to operating. To further support this management strategy we suggest further research be conducted in the form a prospective study design.

### AASLD practice statement on the evaluation and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children [^114aTzK4]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of MASLD in children — criteria and referral triggers emphasize that although elevated ALT continues to be the most validated method to identify hepatic steatosis in children, elevated ALT alone, even with the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, is insufficient for diagnosing MASLD. As per the revised 2023 MASLD nomenclature, the diagnosis of MASLD requires confirmation of steatosis by imaging or biopsy, coupled with the presence of at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Signs of acute hepatitis should prompt more urgent evaluation and early referral to gastroenterology or hepatology if associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, darker urine, lighter stools, easy bleeding, abdominal pain, fatigue, or pruritus are present, and evaluation for alternate causes of liver disease, such as Wilson disease or autoimmune hepatitis, remains important.

### Long-term follow-up of non-operated patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones: a retrospective study evaluating the role of hepatobiliary scanning [^117BtnYb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most cases of gallstone disease are asymptomatic and incidentally found during routine abdominal ultrasonography. The average risk of developing symptoms in gallstone disease is 2.0–2.6% per year. When symptoms do occur, treatment by cholecystectomy is advised. Thus, the diagnosis of "symptomatic" gallbladder (GB) stones is an essential step in the decision to operate. A symptom of gallstone disease is biliary colic, which is a severe steady pain lasting more than 15–30 min, usually located in the epigastrium and/or right upper quadrant, and sometimes radiating to the back. However, if patients have nonspecific symptoms, such as indigestion, discomfort, fat intolerance, and bloating in the presence of a GB stone, it is difficult to determine if these symptoms are associated with GB disease. Gallstone-associated symptoms may occasionally be vague, and are usually confused with other symptoms of gastrointestinal disease. This may explain why biliary symptoms are not relieved in 6–33% of patients after cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy in such patients is delayed because of the vague nature of symptoms, and a significant portion of these patients do not undergo the procedure even though they have symptoms.

There has been no useful objective modality to differentiate gallstone-related symptoms from other etiologies or to predict symptom recurrence. Hepatobiliary (HB) scanning is a sensitive diagnostic modality for acute cholecystitis, and is also useful for predicting the severity of cholecystitis. However, the associations between HB scan results and gallstone-related symptoms have not been well elucidated. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the role of HB scanning for predicting symptom recurrence in patients with vague symptomatic gallstone disease who have not undergone cholecystectomy.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

Results

Review of the management of patients with NAFLD in hospital clinics in NEE

A total of 147 patients (47% male; median age 62; range 26–85 years) from 7 hospitals in the region contributed to this phase of the project. The median duration of follow-up between the first review and latest review was 23 months (range 2–221, SD 39.9). Overall, 68 patients (46%) were identified from gastroenterology clinics, 59 (40%) from hepatology clinics and 20 (14%) from the Newcastle NAFLD clinic. The original referral was from primary care for 113 (77%) patients and secondary care for 34 (23%) patients. Most patients (74%) were referred with abnormal liver blood tests. Other reasons for referral were evidence of steatosis on imaging (15%), evidence of cirrhosis on imaging, abdominal pain and fatty liver identified at the time of cholecystectomy. In NEE, there has been a clearly defined referral pathway for patients with abnormal liver blood tests since 2014. This encompasses a blood liver screen (viral hepatitis, autoantibodies, coeliac screen, ferritin, random/fasting blood glucose or haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c and lipid screen) and non-invasive fibrosis assessment with FIB-4 score or NAFLD Fibrosis score prior to referral. Despite this, only 18% of patients had undergone a full blood liver screen in primary care, 40% had had a partial liver screen and only 16% of patients had non-invasive staging in primary care prior to referral.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^112FdDdA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Biliary dyskinesia — patient selection and diagnostic criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy are described: Patients with symptoms of biliary obstruction without evidence of gallstones, but with abnormal gall bladder emptying may benefit from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Symptoms may include episodic, severe, steady pain, frequently with fatty food intolerance, located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, with or without radiation to the back or shoulder lasting at least 30 minutes but less than several hours, and may potentially be associated with nausea and vomiting. Abnormal gallbladder emptying is usually defined as a gallbladder ejection fraction of less than 35% with cholescintigraphy after injection of cholecystokinin, and severe symptoms, a very low gallbladder ejection fraction (< 14%), and reproduction of symptoms with cholecystokinin administration may be more predictive of resolution of symptoms after cholecystectomy. In patients who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary dyskinesia, stones are found in specimens 10–12% of the time indicating a significant false negative rate for gallbladder ultrasound in this group of patients.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117StPTZ]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD requires evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and absence of secondary causes such as significant alcohol consumption, long-term use of a steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders; histologically, NAFLD is categorized as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning. NASH is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (e.g., ballooning), with or without any fibrosis. For "advanced" fibrosis, this guidance refers specifically to stages 3 or 4, that is, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right upper quadrant pain: 2022 update [^111s74rW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in hospital emergency departments, as well as outpatient settings. Although gallstone-related acute cholecystitis is a leading consideration in diagnosis, a myriad of extrabiliary sources including hepatic, pancreatic, gastroduodenal, and musculoskeletal should also be considered. This document focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging studies performed specifically to evaluate acute right upper quadrant pain, with biliary etiologies including acute cholecystitis and its complications being the most common. An additional consideration of extrabiliary sources such as acute pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, hepatitis, and painful liver neoplasms remain a diagnostic consideration in the right clinical setting. The use of radiographs, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI for these indications are discussed. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Management of NAFLD: a stage-based approach [^113bjwL3]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

NAFLD is the most prevalent form of liver disease in the USA, affecting an estimated 30% of the population. The condition is associated with increased mortality related to cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver disease. Identification of patients who might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes is critical as it is not feasible to screen all patients with suspected NAFLD. Patients with NASH, the progressive subtype of NAFLD, should be targeted for treatment, especially if they have concomitant fibrosis because such patients are more likely than those without fibrosis to have adverse outcomes. Treatment goals in patients with NAFLD vary depending on the disease stage owing to differential risk of progression and the particularities of an individual's comorbid disease. Lifestyle intervention is important for all patients irrespective of disease stage, but other therapies should be targeted to those most likely to benefit. In this Review, we highlight risk factors for disease progression and offer a stage-based treatment approach for patients with NAFLD.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide and is the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of disease of NAFLD with a focus on the earlier spectrum of the disease that is commonly encountered by non-specialists, as well as the hepatic and extra-hepatic associations of the disease. We discuss in detail the two common presentations of NAFLD, incidentally detected hepatic steatosis and asymptomatic raised liver enzymes, and provide an algorithm for management and continued to follow up for these patients. Considerations for the management of cardiovascular comorbidities in these patients are also discussed. Finally, we cover the topic of screening for NAFLD in high-risk populations.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although right upper quadrant pain is a very common clinical presentation, it can be nonspecific. However, acute cholecystitis is very often the diagnosis of exclusion. This review focuses on the recommended imaging evaluation in the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

Clinical diagnosis and management of cholelithiasis in children with inflammatory bowel disease — If no stones are identified but suspicion remains, a cholescintigraphy/hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan can be useful to evaluate gall bladder function and ongoing postprandial symptoms, and gallbladder emptying of < 15% along with reproduction of symptoms may confirm the gallbladder as the likely source of symptoms. Children with symptomatic cholelithiasis should, however, be referred to a pediatric surgeon for cholecystectomy. In those with distal ileal resections and prolonged ileostomies, a preoperative screening ultrasound should be considered before ileostomy closure if any upper abdominal symptoms exist. No evidence, however, advocates for prophylactic or "incidental" cholecystectomy at the time of other surgical procedures in this population.

### Acute cholecystitis: a review [^116TBPPj]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gallbladder disease affects approximately 20 million people in the US. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200 000 people in the US each year.

Observations

Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1–3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.

### ED ultrasound in hepatobiliary disease [^113epxPD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of gallbladder ultrasound performed by emergency physicians (EPUS) in patients with right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric (EPI) pain, adults > 18 years of age with RUQ or EPI pain were prospectively evaluated by physical examination, laboratory data, and EPUS followed by a blinded radiology department ultrasound (RADUS). Diagnostic categories included: "normal gallbladder"; "uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis" (uncomplicated SCL; stones present but symptoms and signs relieved and no abnormal blood-work); or "complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis" (CSCL; stones and positive symptoms and signs including abnormal blood-work). Final Emergency Department patient assessments based on the RADUS were compared to the EPUS. Over 2-years, 127 patients were enrolled. The sensitivity of the EPUS for detecting stones was 94% (positive predictive value 99%; specificity 96%; negative predictive value 73%). In conclusion, the EPUS is a highly sensitive and reliable indicator of the presence of gallstones.

A previously healthy man aged 50 years presented with malaise, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, generalised jaundice, scleral icterus and dark urine. He was not on any prescription or over-the-counter medications, but reported drinking 4–5 energy drinks daily for 3 weeks prior to presentation. Physical examination revealed jaundice and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies were remarkable for transaminitis and evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection. Ultrasound scan demonstrated an echogenic liver and diffuse gallbladder wall thickening. Liver biopsy showed severe acute hepatitis with bridging necrosis and marked cholestasis. The patient was treated supportively with complete resolution of his symptoms and marked improvement in his laboratory abnormalities. The development of acute hepatitis in this patient was likely secondary to excessive energy drink consumption. Energy drinks as well as other herbal/over-the-counter supplements should be considered by clinicians in the workup of patients with acute hepatitis, particularly once other aetiologies have been excluded.

### Emergency department diagnosis of postprocedural hemorrhagic cholecystitis utilizing point-of-care ultrasound [^112EkmSB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare cause of abdominal pain. Most often described in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma, anticoagulation use, coagulopathy (such as cirrhosis or renal failure), and malignancy (biliary angiosarcoma), this rare condition can be difficult to identify unless high on the differential. With point-of-care ultrasound becoming more commonplace in the emergency department (ED), this tool can be successfully used to make a timely diagnosis in the correct clinical context.

Case Report

A 64-year-old man with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post ablation on rivaroxaban, myelodysplastic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance, hypertension, and chronic pain presented to the ED with complaints of right upper quadrant pain in the setting of a recent transjugular liver biopsy. Using point-of-care ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with hemorrhagic cholecystitis. This is an incredibly rare entity, with 87 documented cases in the literature, only two of which are in the setting of transjugular liver biopsy. The patient was ultimately managed conservatively until he had worsening symptoms, and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and recovered. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare pathology that can be easily recognized during point-of-care ultrasound examination. This allows for rapid diagnosis and surgical consultation to provide the patient with timely definitive management.

### From the RSNA refresher courses: imaging evaluation for acute pain in the right upper quadrant [^115Bw1rc]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is the most common cause of acute pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), and urgent surgical removal of the gallbladder is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated disease. However, cross-sectional imaging is essential because more than one-third of patients with acute RUQ pain do not have acute cholecystitis. In addition, patients with complications of acute cholecystitis, such as perforation, are often best treated with supportive measures initially and elective cholecystectomy at a later date. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging modality for assessment of acute RUQ pain; US is both sensitive and specific in demonstrating gallstones, biliary dilatation, and features that suggest acute inflammatory disease. Occasionally, additional imaging modalities are indicated. Computed tomography is valuable, especially for confirming the extent and nature of the complications of acute cholecystitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is helpful in complicated ductal disease (eg, recurrent pyogenic cholangiohepatitis) when more detailed diagnostic information is required for treatment planning, whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is used when biliary intervention is required (eg, treatment of choledocholithiasis). Successful imaging with all modalities requires familiarity with both the characteristic and the unusual features of a wide variety of pathologic conditions. In addition, potential pitfalls must be recognized and avoided.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^1168MP6C]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) hepatobiliary disease — screening: The CFF recommends that annual labs be performed for identification of hepatobiliary involvement in all persons with CF starting at CF diagnosis. The CFF recommends annual physical abdominal examination for hepatosplenomegaly for identification of advanced liver disease in all persons with CF starting at CF diagnosis. The CFF recommends abdominal ultrasound to assess the liver and spleen at least every 2 years in persons with CF from childhood until late adolescence, starting at age 3 or at diagnosis, if diagnosed after age 3. In adults with CF, there is value in baseline screening for CFHBI, but the optimal frequency of subsequent imaging for those with normal baseline findings is unknown and a specific recommendation cannot currently be made. The CFF recommends that persons with CF who are found to have hepatobiliary involvement should undergo baseline liver elastography, when available, for the identification of advanced liver disease. The CFF recommends that persons with CF and hepatobiliary involvement should receive a standardized evaluation for other causes of liver disease. The CFF recommends that all persons with CF who have cholestatic liver test elevation, abdominal pain consistent with biliary cause, and inconclusive abdominal ultrasound should undergo magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to detect hepatolithiasis, choledocholithiasis, biliary strictures, and/or biliary obstruction.

### Emergent right upper quadrant sonography [^113NwiwF]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this presentation is to review the sonographic spectrum of disease entities evaluated by right upper quadrant (RUQ) sonography on an emergent basis.

Methods

Right upper quadrant sonography was performed on an emergent basis in patients who came to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suspicious for or simulating acute cholecystitis or diseases of the liver and biliary tree.

Results

A wide gamut of acute and chronic cholecystitis and diseases of the liver and biliary tree were visualized on RUQ sonography. Several other entities in addition to hepatic and biliary disease were also suspected on sonography and further evaluated by computed tomography.

Conclusions

Right upper quadrant sonography is the first line of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic, gallbladder, or biliary disease as well as RUQ pain. Patient triage or additional imaging may be obtained on the basis of emergent RUQ sonographic findings.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113DjeRR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Symptom criteria in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis

Quality assessment of 14 international guidelines on cholecystolithiasis showed that only five guidelines were suitable for clinical practice, as most recommendations were based on a low level of evidence. For example, the definition of symptomatic gallstone disease and the indication for cholecystectomy are poorly described. Most guidelines advocate cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis or biliary colic. The issue is, however, that both conditions are ill defined.

Table 1 summarizes guidelines and criteria sets for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Most guidelines refer to the Rome criteria to define symptomatic gallstone disease: pain in severe attacks, in the epigastrium or upper right quadrant, and lasting 15–30 min or longer. The Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland commission guidefrom 2016 slightly modified these criteria to epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, frequently with radiation to the back, lasting from several minutes to hours, and often occurring during the night. The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tracthas similar criteria (temporary epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, radiation to the right flank or back, and nausea), whereas the European Association for the Study of the Liverhas reported more than 10 criteria. The various symptoms and criteria reported in these guidelines illustrate the lack of consensus among healthcare professionals.

### The hot rim sign on hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) with CT correlation [^116RLfeY]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

An older male with multiple medical comorbidities presented to the emergency room after 3 days of worsening right upper quadrant pain. The patient had an elevated white blood cell count and mildly elevated liver functions. Initial ultrasound was equivocal and further imaging with CT scan was obtained. The CT scan was read as suggestive of cholecystitis, however a hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) scan was ordered for confirmation, as the patient was a poor operative candidate. The HIDA demonstrated no bile duct or small bowel activity on initial images or delays, however a classic 'hot rim' sign was present, confirming acute cholecystitis. The patient ultimately underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy with drainage for treatment where acute cholecystitis was confirmed. Upon retrospective review, the CT demonstrated hyperaemia surrounding the gallbladder fossa, which is the CT scan equivalent of a scintigraphic 'hot rim' sign. This is an uncommon example of a radiologic sign correlation between multiple imaging modalities.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^114PVJ2t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Etiology of acute pancreatitis — initial evaluation and key management concepts are: We suggest transabdominal ultrasound in patients with AP to evaluate for biliary pancreatitis and a repeat US if the initial examination is inconclusive (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with idiopathic AP (IAP), we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation with repeat abdominal ultrasound, MRI, and/or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence). In the absence of gallstones and/or a significant history of alcohol use, serum triglyceride (TG) should be obtained and considered in the etiology, preferably if greater than 1,000 mg/dL. In patients older than 40 years in whom an etiology is not established, a pancreatic tumor should be considered as a possible cause of AP. Following a second episode of AP with no identifiable cause, in patients fit for surgery, we suggest performing a cholecystectomy to reduce the risk of recurrent episodes of AP.

### The effect of CFTR modulators on a cystic fibrosis patient presenting with recurrent pancreatitis in the absence of respiratory symptoms: a case report [^1115RNCs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

On presentation, the patient reported intermittent right upper quadrant pain with nausea and episodes of constipation and diarrhea, but without evidence of fat malabsorption. He denied emesis, fever, or weight loss, and also denied sinus or respiratory symptoms. He had no current alcohol use. Family history included a brother with CF carrier status who suffered from recurrent acute pancreatitis.

Physical examination was significant for obesity (BMI = 39.4 kg/m²), mild right upper quadrant tenderness, and negative pulmonary findings. Laboratory evaluation was notable for normal LFTs with mildly elevated lipase (116 U/L). Despite obesity, he had severely diminished fecal elastase (< 15.0 μg/g feces) and decreased Vitamin D (11.7 ng/mL), suggesting at least intermittent or evolving pancreatic insufficiency. Computed tomography of abdomen demonstrated acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis without evidence of necrosis and thickening of duodenum likely due to pancreatic inflammation. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with hepatic steatosis with abnormal flow within hepatic veins suggesting possible hepatic fibrosis. Pulmonary function testing resulted in 87 and 90% of predicted FVC and FEV₁, respectively, with a preserved FEV₁/FVC (0.80) High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed modest air trapping in the dependent lungs with early signs of bronchial wall thickening; sputum cultures were negative for CF pathogens. Sweat chloride testing indicated CFTR dysfunction (57 mmol/L). Genetic testing demonstrated disease causing CFTR mutations: R1117H/7 T/F508del.

Awaiting genotyping, the patient was prescribed pantoprazole 40 mg daily and pancrelipase 20,880 USP units TID with meals, and he declined other respiratory interventions. On follow-up 6 weeks later, he reported that low dose pancrelipase worsened gas and diarrhea symptoms. Pancrelipase was discontinued and the patient was prescribed ivacaftor 150 mg BID. After 6 weeks of ivacaftor treatment, patient reported improved gastrointestinal symptoms. For an additional 19 months, patient reported no episodes of pancreatitis, representing a marked improvement in frequency (Fig. 1), until he discontinued ivacaftor. Over the next 3 weeks, patient experienced progressive nausea and sharp epigastric pain and laboratory studies confirmed pancreatitis with elevated amylase (231) and lipase (1221), but normal LFTs. Patient experienced 2 episodes of pancreatitis in the first month off medication. They were instructed to resume ivacaftor but subsequently lost to follow up.

### US of right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department: diagnosing beyond gallbladder and biliary disease [^112jNZ25]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is the most common diagnosable cause for right upper quadrant abdominal (RUQ) pain in patients who present to the emergency department (ED). However, over one-third of patients initially thought to have acute cholecystitis actually have RUQ pain attributable to other causes. Ultrasonography (US) is the primary imaging modality of choice for initial imaging assessment and serves as a fast, cost-effective, and dynamic modality to provide a definitive diagnosis or a considerably narrowed list of differential possibilities. Multiple organ systems are included at standard RUQ US, and a variety of ultrasonographically diagnosable disease processes can be identified, including conditions of hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, gastrointestinal, vascular, and thoracic origin, all of which may result in RUQ pain. In certain cases, subsequent computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography, or cholescintigraphy may be considered, depending on the clinical situation and US findings. Familiarity with the spectrum of disease processes outside of the gallbladder and biliary tree that may manifest with RUQ pain and recognition at US of these alternative conditions is pivotal for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Diagnosis at the time of initial US can reduce unnecessary imaging and its consequences, including excess cost, radiation exposure, nephrotoxic contrast medium use, and time to diagnosis, thereby translating into improved patient care and outcome. This article (a) reviews the causes of RUQ pain identifiable at US using an organ-system approach, (b) illustrates the US appearance of select conditions from each organ system with multimodality imaging correlates, and (c) discusses the relevant pathophysiology and treatment of these entities to aid in efficient direction of management.
