## Question

Can long term steroid use cause IIH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether long-term steroid use can cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of IIH and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking corticosteroids to IIH, distinguishing association from causation. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to consider confounding by indication and steroid-withdrawal phenomena. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical implications for monitoring and counseling.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic framework. IIH is defined by elevated intracranial pressure with normal CSF composition and no mass, hydrocephalus, or venous sinus thrombosis, typically presenting with headache, papilledema, and visual symptoms; it is most common in obese women of childbearing age, though it can occur outside that demographic, and diagnosis relies on modified Dandy criteria including CSF opening pressure greater than 25 cm H2O in adults.

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence linking long-term steroids to IIH. The strongest signal comes from a large Swedish national case-control study that found increased odds of IIH with corticosteroid exposure in the year prior to diagnosis, with an odds ratio around 2.7–13.4 versus general population controls and 1.8–4.8 versus obese controls, suggesting a moderate association even after matching and adjustment; this aligns with earlier Swedish registry analyses reporting similar findings [^113xGtLV] [^1129LQuK] [^111wbvwm]. I should also note that a systematic review of drug-induced IIH categorized corticosteroids as having a moderate association with IIH, reinforcing a pharmacovigilance signal rather than proving causality [^113BTVFL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation. I need to check mechanistic plausibility. Chronic glucocorticoid exposure can increase CSF production via activation of mineralocorticoid receptors in the choroid plexus and upregulation of Na+/K+-ATPase, and 11β-HSD1 activity in the choroid plexus can amplify local cortisol and CSF secretion; weight gain from steroids also contributes to IIH risk, which complicates attribution in observational data [^114PqA93] [^1129LQuK] [^1129LQuK]. But wait, what if the risk is actually from withdrawal rather than chronic exposure itself? Multiple case reports and series describe IIH temporally linked to steroid taper or withdrawal, including after treatment of Cushing's disease and in pediatric steroid-dependent conditions, indicating a distinct withdrawal-related mechanism in some patients [^116pUaz7] [^115nfa3t].

> I should double-check the directionality and clinical context. The Swedish analyses show association with corticosteroid treatment itself, not solely withdrawal, yet they cannot fully exclude confounding by indication because steroids are used for inflammatory diseases that may themselves predispose to IIH through pro-inflammatory pathways; thus, while the association is consistent, causality remains uncertain and likely multifactorial [^113xGtLV] [^114wXEmz]. Let me reconsider the balance: the epidemiologic signal is reproducible across datasets, mechanistic hypotheses are biologically coherent, and regulatory labeling for oral budesonide explicitly warns that benign intracranial hypertension may occur with steroid withdrawal, which supports a clinically meaningful risk signal even if the absolute risk appears low [^117PtfV1] [^116RtcUW].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications and monitoring. Given the moderate association and the potential for visual morbidity, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for IIH in patients on prolonged systemic steroids who develop new headaches, visual obscurations, diplopia, or tinnitus; fundus examination for papilledema is a simple, noninvasive screen that should be considered in long-term steroid users, particularly with other risk factors such as obesity or recent weight gain [^114PqA93] [^116upq8K]. If suspected, prompt neuro-ophthalmology referral, brain MRI/MRV to exclude secondary causes, and diagnostic lumbar puncture are indicated to confirm IIH and guide management, which typically includes acetazolamide, weight loss strategies, and careful tapering of steroids when feasible to avoid withdrawal-related spikes in ICP [^117U11WL] [^112HRQUT] [^117PtfV1].

> Final synthesis: Yes, long-term systemic steroid use is associated with an increased risk of IIH, with evidence ranging from population-based case-control studies to drug-safety reviews and mechanistic models; the relationship appears moderate in strength and likely reflects both direct effects of chronic hypercortisolism on CSF dynamics and indirect effects via weight gain, with a separate withdrawal-related risk in some patients. Absolute risk remains low, but clinicians should counsel patients about warning symptoms and monitor vision during prolonged steroid therapy, especially in the presence of additional risk factors [^113xGtLV] [^113BTVFL] [^114PqA93] [^117PtfV1].

Long-term steroid use can cause **idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)** through chronic hypercortisolism, which increases CSF production and alters CSF dynamics, and via steroid withdrawal, which can precipitate IIH. The risk is **higher with prolonged use, high doses, and abrupt tapering**, and is further amplified by obesity and female sex. Clinicians should monitor for headache, visual changes, and papilledema in patients on chronic steroids, and manage with gradual dose reduction, weight loss, and standard IIH therapies.

---

## Mechanisms linking long-term steroid use to IIH

Several plausible mechanisms link chronic steroid exposure to IIH:

- **Increased CSF production**: Glucocorticoids can upregulate Na+/K+-ATPase in the choroid plexus, increasing CSF secretion and intracranial pressure [^114PqA93].

- **Altered CSF dynamics**: Chronic steroids may impair CSF absorption or venous outflow, contributing to elevated ICP [^116J2LXT].

- **Steroid withdrawal**: Abrupt tapering or cessation can trigger IIH, likely via rebound effects on CSF production or vascular tone [^116pUaz7] [^115nfa3t].

- **Indirect effects**: Steroid-induced weight gain and metabolic changes increase IIH risk, especially in obese women [^116upq8K].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and case reports support a link between long-term steroids and IIH:

| **Study type** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Case reports | - Document IIH with prolonged steroid use and withdrawal [^1145oMqJ] [^116pUaz7] [^115nfa3t] |
| Case-control study | - Increased IIH risk with corticosteroids (OR 2.7–13.4 vs general population; 1.8–4.8 vs obese controls) [^113xGtLV] [^1129LQuK] |
| Systematic review | - Moderate association between corticosteroids and drug-induced IIH [^113BTVFL] |
| FDA labeling | - Budesonide lists benign intracranial hypertension as a withdrawal risk [^117PtfV1] [^116RtcUW] |

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Certain factors increase the risk of steroid-induced IIH:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and longer courses increase risk [^notfound].

- **Withdrawal**: Abrupt tapering or cessation is a recognized trigger [^116pUaz7] [^115nfa3t].

- **Demographics**: Female sex and obesity further elevate risk [^116upq8K].

- **Comorbidities**: Conditions like Cushing's syndrome or adrenal disorders add risk [^116pUaz7].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Steroid-induced IIH presents like typical IIH, with:

- **Headache**: Often diffuse, severe, and worsened by Valsalva [^notfound].

- **Visual symptoms**: Blurred vision, transient visual obscurations, diplopia, and papilledema [^116upq8K].

- **Pulsatile tinnitus**: Common but nonspecific [^notfound].

Diagnosis requires **neuroimaging (MRI/MRV) to exclude secondary causes** and lumbar puncture showing elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition [^111EGcds] [^116upq8K].

---

## Management strategies

Management of steroid-induced IIH includes:

- **Gradual steroid tapering**: Slow dose reduction to minimize withdrawal-related IIH [^117PtfV1].

- **Weight loss**: Essential for obese patients to reduce ICP [^1135oKZH].

- **Medical therapy**: Acetazolamide or topiramate to lower CSF production [^112HRQUT] [^11188MbH].

- **Surgical options**: Optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting for refractory cases with vision threat [^116upq8K].

---

## Prognosis and reversibility

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with timely recognition and management. Visual outcomes depend on the severity and duration of papilledema; early intervention reduces the risk of permanent vision loss [^116upq8K]. Most patients improve after steroid withdrawal and appropriate therapy, though some require ongoing management for chronic IIH [^notfound].

---

Long-term steroid use can cause IIH through increased CSF production, altered CSF dynamics, and withdrawal effects. Risk rises with higher doses, longer duration, and abrupt tapering, and is further increased by obesity and female sex. Clinicians should monitor for IIH symptoms in chronic steroid users and manage with gradual tapering, weight loss, and standard IIH therapies.

### Antenatal steroid exposure among term newborns… [^115XtUuZ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome was antenatal steroid exposure; monthly exposure rates were calculated in the 12 months before and after the dissemination period. The Mass General Brigham institutional review board deemed the study exempt and waived informed consent because it involved non–human participant research. This study followed the STROBE reporting guideline. After dissemination, steroid exposure increased 78%, from an expected 4. 3 to
7. 7 per 1000 births, which corresponded to an absolute rate difference of 3. 4 per 1000 term births. The rate of change of monthly steroid exposure increased 1. 0% per month compared with the baseline rate of change in the pre-ALPS period. Results were robust to diagnostic checks.

This study found that evidence from the ALPS trial was associated with increased steroid exposure among term newborns. Updated guidance from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine3 on late preterm steroids acknowledged the uncertainty about long-term risks and recommended against use in patients unlikely to deliver preterm. In the ALPS trial, 1 which used strict criteria to define a high probability of preterm delivery, approximately 16% delivered at term; in a previous study5 with less stringent criteria, more than 30% delivered at term. We hypothesized that the increase in steroid exposure in term newborns may have reflected similar challenges in predicting preterm birth. Strengths of this study include its robust design and use of complete US population data. Limitations include an ITS model assumption that no simultaneous interventions influenced the outcome.

Because birth certificate data do not capture the timing of steroid administration, we were unable to determine the cause for the increase in steroid exposure among term newborns. Steroid administration abstracted from birth certificate data may have poor sensitivity; actual rates may be higher. 6 Increased practitioner awareness of the benefits of steroids in the late preterm period may have altered reporting practices during the study, potentially biasing the findings away from the null.

### Intracranial hypertension and empty sella from adrenal adenoma and excessive and prolonged steroid usage: a case report [^11179xSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure of unclear etiology. Its most common pathological changes are papilledema and empty sella. If untreated or improperly treated, papilledema can lead to progressive and irreversible vision loss as a result of optic atrophy, and empty sella can cause hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and resultant hormonal alterations. Although the underlying cause of IIH is still unknown, many studies indicate that Cushing disease, chronic steroid administration and acute withdrawal of chronic steroid use are among the largely reported possible causal and associated risk factors. In 1980, Britton et al. reported that there is an association between IIH and cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma. Since then, however, no other cases associated with cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma have been reported. It is unknown whether IIH with cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma has not been given due attention by the academia or it's just an individual and accidental phenomenon.

Current management

The primary goal of treatment of IIH is to prevent visual loss and decrease headache and other symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension. Routine follow-up by neuroophthalmologist or ophthalmologist is very essential for reassessing visual status and degree of papilledema. Weight reduction counseling and medical management are generally sufficient in most patients. Surgery is required only in patients who have severe visual loss, progressive visual loss, or intractable headache despite aggressive medical management. Aggressive weight reduction is necessary in obese patients. Gastric bypass surgery has been demonstrated to improve visual outcomes and reduce ICP in IIH cases with morbid obesity.

Although there are many options for the treatment of IIH, the most recent Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management for IIH.

Pharmacotherapy

To date, acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials for their treatment efficacy in adults with IIH. The efficacy of other medications is only supported by case reports or case series. For example, there was a case series reporting the efficacy of combination of acetazolamide and furosemide in eight children in 1994. Corticosteroid was reported to be effective in the short-term in patients who presented with severe papilledema and severe visual loss. However, steroid withdrawal and its side effect on weight gain are precipitating factors for worsening IIH in long-term use. A summary of the trials of acetazolamide and topiramate in treatment of IIH in adults are discussed in the following sections.

### Medication-induced intracranial hypertension in dermatology [^112gXQTK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a syndrome of intracranial hypertension that is idiopathic or from an identified secondary cause. It is characterized by headaches and visual manifestations. The hallmark of PTC is papilledema and the feared consequence is visual loss that may be severe and permanent. The idiopathic form generally occurs in obese women of childbearing age. Various medications may produce PTC in patients at any age, including children. Several medications used in dermatology, particularly those used in the treatment of acne vulgaris, are associated with PTC. There is a strong association with tetracycline usage. Minocycline and doxycycline have also been linked to PTC, although there are relatively few reported cases. PTC has also been described with retinoids, including vitamin A (retinol) and isotretinoin. Although corticosteroids are often used to lower intracranial pressure acutely, corticosteroid withdrawal after long-term administration may induce increased intracranial pressure. A high index of suspicion, early diagnosis and treatment generally yield a good prognosis.

### Idiopathic "benign" intracranial hypertension: case series and review [^114Bt2LN]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Idiopathic "benign" intracranial hypertension is an uncommon but important cause of headache that can lead to visual loss. This study was undertaken to review our experience in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, giving special attention to treatments used. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 32 patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension between 1984 and 1995. Subjects included 23 females and ranged in age from 2 to 17.5 years. Headache was the most common symptom, followed by nausea and vomiting, double vision, and visual loss. Papilledema was the most common sign. Others were VIth cranial nerve palsy and compromised visual acuity at or within 3 months of presentation. Management included administration of acetazolamide or corticosteroids, lumboperitoneal shunt, optic nerve fenestration, and repeat lumbar puncture. Treatment combinations were used in 40% of cases. During follow-up, headache, papilledema, and decreased visual acuity persisted for longer than 10 months in a significant number of patients. We conclude that idiopathic intracranial hypertension causes significant short- and long-term morbidity with no proven effective treatment available. A prospective study is needed to establish the indications for treatment and the efficacy of the treatments used.

### Intracranial hypertension and empty sella from adrenal adenoma and excessive and prolonged steroid usage: a case report [^1145oMqJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is only one documented case of intracranial hypertension (IH) and empty sella from cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma so far. And IH and empty sella caused by long-term exogenous hypercortisolism has never been reported before. The purpose of this case report is to alert clinicians to glucocorticoid-induced IH.

Case presentation

We present retrospectively a 50-year-old woman with cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma, who progressed to intractable intracranial hypertension and a markedly expanded empty sella due to improper treatment. In 2011, the patient presented with hypertension, lack of cortisol circadian rhythm, low ACTH, a left adrenal adenoma and a partial empty sella, but did not receive low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) and 24-h urinary cortisol. In 2014, she exhibited truncal obesity, raised cortisol, LDDST non-suppression, high urinary free cortisol and low ACTH, proving her cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma. She was simultaneously diagnosed with unexplained IH because of papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure, and her partial empty sella changed to a complete empty sella. In 2015, she underwent adrenal adenoma resection. From 2015 to 2018, she kept taking dexamethasone at least 2 mg daily without her doctors' consent. During this period, she developed transient cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and her empty sella further worsened. After switching to low dose hydrocortisone, her papilledema disappeared completely, but optic atrophy has become irreversible.

Conclusions

The patient seems to be just an extreme case, but it may reveal and illustrate a general phenomenon: Both cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma and long-term exogenous hypercortisolism could cause varying degrees of elevated intracranial pressure and empty sella. Clinicians should remain vigilant for this phenomenon in patients with cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma or excessive and prolonged steroid usage and give them corresponding examinations to identify this complication.

### An update on idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults: a look at pathophysiology, diagnostic approach and management [^117U11WL]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a neurological syndrome determined by a rise in intracranial pressure without a detectable cause. Course and prognosis may be changeable, requiring a multidisciplinary approach for its diagnosis and management. Although its precise pathogenesis is still unknown, many studies have been carried out to define the possible causal and associated factors, such as retinoids, steroid hormones, body mass index and recent weight gains, cytokines and adipokines levels. The clinical presentation can be variable including chronic headache, disturbance of vision, diplopia and tinnitus. Even if papilloedema is considered the most specific sign, it could not be observed in more than 5% of patients during the evaluation of the fundus oculi. Neuroradiological signs acquire greater importance in patients who do not present papilloedema and may suggest the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Other assessments can be useful in the diagnostic process, such as optical coherence tomography, visual evoked potentials, ocular ultrasonography and fundus fluorescein angiography and autofluorescence. Nonetheless, cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurement is required to establish a definite diagnosis. Management may be different, since surgical procedures or lumbar punctures are often required when symptoms develop rapidly leading to a loss of visual function. Apart from these cases, patients can be treated with a pharmacological approach and low-calorie diet, but they also need to be monitored over time since relapses years later are not uncommon.

### Evaluation and management of adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112shy16]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Consensus Guideline in Adult Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: an infographic summary.

Principles of management need to address both the rapidity of the disease that may lead to visual loss in some and require surgical intervention and the morbidity of the headache that can develop in the majority, which substantially affects the quality of life. Weight loss is currently the only established disease-modifying therapyand is notoriously difficult to achieve and maintain.

Evaluation of the headache phenotype is essential to target treatment and to help identify medication-overuse headache. Where there are features of migraine, topiramate may be the first line in treatment, and recent evidence indicates that it has a significant intracranial pressure-lowering effect in rodents. Acute exacerbation of headache often leads to reinvestigation with lumbar puncture, and the collective expert opinion reflected that lumbar puncture provides only temporary relief, can lead in some to longer term complicationsand exacerbation of headache. In those with acute exacerbation of headache, optic nerve examination is essential, and in those found not to have papilloedema, investigation with lumbar puncture and brain imaging is not required, so long as no other secondary causes of headache are suspected. The infographic illustrates the management of acute exacerbation of headache in IIH (figure 1).

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), previously known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is a disabling condition of predominantly young, obese women of childbearing age. The condition results in raised ICP, of no known cause, resulting in visual loss, headaches, and papilledema. IIH without papilledema can also occur but is rare and not the focus of this review.

IIH affects 0.5–2 per 100,000 annually in the general population, but increases to 12–20 per 100,000 for obese women of reproductive age.–Female sex and obesity are strongly associated with the condition. In a cohort of 721 IIH patients, 91% were reported as femalewith 70%–88% being obese.

A diagnosis of IIH is made using the updated modified Dandy criteria. This is based on the presence of papilledema, with an absence of secondary causes and raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure > 25 cm CSF, measured by lumbar puncture in the lateral decubitus. The current management options for the condition are limited and include disease modification to promote weight loss and acetazolamide, but other diuretics may also be used. Surgical management varies although it mainly involves CSF shunting or sometimes optic nerve sheath fenestration and remains reserved for rapid or progressive loss of vision. Venous sinus stenting is used in some specialist centers although long-term efficacy data are awaited.

The etiology of this debilitating condition remains undetermined. Dysregulation of CSF dynamics is key and may involve hypersecretion of CSF at the choroid plexus, reduced drainage at the arachnoid granulations and/or lymphatics, and aberrant venous pressure gradients. It is unlikely that a single anatomical location for CSF dysregulation is exclusively responsible for the raised ICP in IIH, and multiple sites and mechanisms may be involved in impairing ICP homeostasis. As > 70% of patients with the condition are obese, adiposity is felt to have a causative role in IIH, but the mechanisms by which obesity predisposes to the condition have not been fully elucidated.

Human fat is an active endocrine tissue, secreting a myriad of neuroendocrine molecules that could potentially play a role in IIH. Given the very strong female preponderance, steroid hormones are also likely to be involved.

This review provides an overview of the potential role of hormones, adipokines, and cytokines in IIH and describes new potential pathogenic mechanisms in this disease.

### A national Swedish case-control study investigating incidence and factors associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1129LQuK]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatments

Our results support a possible treatment-associated risk, especially for tetracyclines, lithium and corticosteroids. This supports the results of a recent review of drug-induced intracranial hypertension (DIIH) concluding that the evidence is highest for vitamin A derivatives, tetracyclines and lithium, and moderately associated with corticosteroidal withdrawals but not associated with other suggested antibiotics and hormonal contraceptives.

A recent study looking at cycline antibiotics reported an initial increased risk for development of IIH suggesting that the substance could be the risk factor, but when confounders were adjusted for this effect disappeared, and there was no dose-response effect that could strengthen the evidence base. When discussing pharmacological treatments as risk factors one must consider the indication why they are used. For antibiotics, the underlying infections might explain the increased risk seen as proposed in our previous study. In that study we found an increased OR on the proxy analysis of drug dispensation of antibiotics, even when the risk factor antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulphonamides, quinolones) were excluded. Still, the OR of exposure prior to IIH development in this study was slightly higher for tetracycline and sulphonamide antibiotics compared to all other antibiotics in the previous analysis, which supports the argument that there may be an effect from the drug itself. We also found increased OR for lithium and corticosteroid treatments. Lithium, commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, is proposed to affect inflammation in the CNS. The same applies to corticosteroid treatments as this treatment is often used to treat inflammatory disorders. Additionally, longstanding treatments with corticosteroids can cause weight gain, another strong risk factor for IIH. These proposed hypotheses require further research.

Non-conclusive or negative findings among previously suspected factors associated with IIH

We found no association with hormonal contraceptive treatments, rather the opposite, i.e. the exposure to hormonal contraceptives was lower in IIH than in GP controls. This supports previous reports that use of contraceptives containing oestrogen is not a risk factor for IIH development and is in line with the results from Kilgore et al. However, we cannot rule out that there might be an increased risk with certain types of hormonal contraceptives. Pregnancy exposure also did not increase the risk of IIH, as has been suggested previously.

A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was more common in IIH patients relative to controls. When examining treatment dispensation for iron deficiency anaemia, this was only significant compared to GP controls, while lower OR were seen compared to obese controls. With these somewhat divergent results the question remains a matter of debate.

Regarding patient education for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, more specifically with respect to general counseling, ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend to inform patients at the earliest opportunity of the potential issues of analgesic overuse that can lead to medication overuse headache (use of simple analgesics on > 15 days/month or opioids, combined preparations or triptan medication on > 10 days/month for > 3 months).

### Intracranial hypertension and empty sella from adrenal adenoma and excessive and prolonged steroid usage: a case report [^114PqA93]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

After adrenal adenoma excision, the patient continuously misused high-dose dexamethasone, and, as a result, her symptoms of Cushing's syndrome and IH and her empty sella became more evident and serious. Corticosteroids are frequently used for treating inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. In some immune-mediated diseases, IH has been described during corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroids-induced IH is regarded as a rare adverse efect. This patient had no inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases, which can exclude the possibility of IH from a complex interaction between these diseases and corticosteroids. This case suggests that prolonged corticosteroids might inevitably raise intracranial pressure and cause empty sella, but in most cases, these changes are just not to the extent of being perceived. However, this conjecture also needs to be further confirmed by more patients taking corticosteroids.

CSF hypersecretion may have a causative role in glucocorticoid-induced IH. There is a possible mechanism for the effect of glucocorticoids on CSF production. In epithelial choroid plexus cells, glucocorticoids can activate 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1). 11β-HSD1 converts cortisone to cortisol, and cortisol can activate mineralocorticoid receptors and drive Na + /K + ATPase activity, thereby increasing CSF production.

In summary, this case clearly shows how IH and empty sella were gradually formed and accentuated with greater levels of continuous hypercortisolism. The patient seems to be just an extreme case, but it may reveal a general phenomenon: Both cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma and long-term exogenous hypercortisolism could cause varying degrees of IH and empty sella. Clinicians should remain vigilant for this phenomenon. Fundus examination, as an easy to implement, non-invasive and inexpensive screening method for IH, should be routinely used in patients with cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma or exogenous hypercortisolism to identify this complication.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and facial palsy: case report and review of the literature [^112Hk6hP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

We present the case of an 11-year-old obese girl who presented with idiopathic intracranial hypertension affecting first the lateral abducens nerve. She received acetazolamide, but 5 days later she developed lateral, peripheral facial palsy. Imaging evaluation was normal, which primarily excluded cerebral venous thrombosis and sustained the initial diagnosis. Despite some complicating factors (obesity, elevated intracranial pressure), prednisolone was administered for a short-term period to counteract the facial palsy. Ophthalmological residuals resolved within almost 1.5 months, while facial palsy receded after 4 months. Peripheral facial palsy is an extremely rare, but not unknown condition in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. As a symptom, it should be investigated thoroughly, primarily to exclude cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, before it can be attributed to idiopathic intracranial hypertension. As far as treatment is concerned, corticosteroids can be added to the initial treatment with acetazolamide, without worsening already elevated intracranial hypertension or ophthalmologic findings.

Role of gender

A number of case reports have documented patients developing raised ICP in the setting of endocrinopathies and with steroid use (typically corticosteroid withdrawal). Intracranial hypertension in women using hormonal contraception and during pregnancy has been reported but is unsubstantiated, as many of these cases have occurred in women with other risk factors for IIH. Few studies have systematically evaluated the hormone profiles in IIH. Early studies demonstrating elevated serum oestrone levels were compromised by small numbers and mixed gender cohorts. A study using radioimmune assays to evaluate cortisol, testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, insulin, aldosterone, oestradiol, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone, demonstrated that younger patients with IIH had elevated testosterone and androstenedione but a control cohort was not evaluated.

In the ocular ciliary epithelium 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11B-HSD1) drives secretion of aqueous humour and 11B-HSD1 inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure. The ciliary epithelium and the choroid plexus originate from a similar embryological foundation and share secretory mechanisms. In rabbit and human choroid plexus, a functional 11B-HSD1 pathway has been identified, suggesting a potential role in CSF secretion. In patients with IIH, following therapy with a low-calorie diet, ICP falls in correlation with a reduction in 11B-HSD1 activity.

11B-HSD1 is also dysregulated in obesity and the metabolic syndrome and consequently specific inhibitors are being developed as novel therapies.

### A national Swedish case-control study investigating incidence and factors associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113xGtLV]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study the incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in Sweden and to explore whether previously proposed risk factors are associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension by investigating the odds of exposure one year prior to diagnosis in patients compared to controls.

Methods

Using Swedish health care registers and validated diagnostic algorithms, idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients diagnosed between 2000–2016 were compared with randomly selected matched controls, five from the general population and five with obesity.

Results

We identified 902 idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients and 4510 matched individuals in each control group. Mean incidence among inhabitants ≥ 18 years of age was 0.71 per 100,000; rising from 0.53 in 2000–2005 to 0.95 in 2012–2016. There were increased odds for idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients compared to general population for exposure to: kidney failure (odds ratio = 13.2 (4.1–42.0)), arterial hypertension (odds ratio = 17.5 (10.5–29.3)), systemic lupus erythematosus (odds ratio = 13.8 (4.3–44.7)), tetracyclines, sulphonamides, lithium, and corticosteroids. In obese controls, odds ratios were also significantly increased for these exposures. Hormonal contraceptive use and exposure to pregnancy did not appear to be associated factors for idiopathic intracranial hypertension development.

Conclusions

The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in Sweden is lower relative to reports from other countries but is on the rise. This case-control study confirms several previously reported risk factors associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Drug-induced intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and critical assessment of drug-induced causes [^113BTVFL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition with increased intracranial pressure of unknown etiology. Its presenting symptoms include persistent headache, pulsatile tinnitus, and visual obscuration. It tends to occur in obese women of childbearing age, and its greatest risk is irreversible loss of vision. Some of the commonly used medications in dermatology, especially those for acne vulgaris, have been associated with IIH. However, the creation of specific risk categories for drugs as a guide for clinicians has never been performed.

Objective

The aim of this study was to critically assess all published cases of IIH and identify high-risk drugs associated with drug-induced intracranial hypertension (DIIH), to assist dermatologists and other physicians with patient education and monitoring of symptoms of secondary intracranial hypertension.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Review Databases were searched for all cases of IIH thought to be drug-related between January 1900 and June 2019. A total of 5117 articles were identified, and 235 articles were found to be relevant. All cases were assessed to satisfy the modified Dandy criteria for diagnosis of IIH, and the likelihood of each case being a 'definite' adverse drug reaction (ADR) was determined using the Koh algorithm for ADR. An association category (from weakly associated [Category I] to strongly associated [Category V]) was assigned based on the number of cases meeting these two criteria.

Results

There were 259 verifiable cases of DIIH. Vitamin A derivatives, tetracycline-class antibiotics, recombinant growth hormone, and lithium were found to be most strongly associated with DIIH (Categories IV and V). Corticosteroids were moderately associated with DIIH (Category III). Drugs that were weakly associated with DIIH (Categories I and II) include cyclosporine, progestin-only contraceptives, combined oral contraceptives, second- and third-generation fluoroquinolones, sulfenazone, gonadotropin-releasing hormones and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, nalidixic acid, amiodarone, stanozolol, danazol, divalproic acid, sulfasalazine, ketoconazole, and ustekinumab.

Conclusion

We suggest using the term 'drug-induced intracranial hypertension' (DIIH) and propose a set of diagnostic criteria for DIIH. Our review attempts to identify DIIH-associated drugs based on a strict diagnostic and drug-causality algorithm, then stratify them into appropriate risks categories. This may ultimately assist physicians in counselling patients about the risk of DIIH when prescribing medications and recognizing this uncommon yet sight-threatening condition.

Glucocorticosteroid Adverse Reactions

Table 3 displays the frequency and incidence of signs/symptoms of hypercorticism by active questioning of patients in short-term clinical trials.

Table 4 displays the frequency and incidence of signs/symptoms of hypercorticism by active questioning of patients in long-term clinical trials.

The incidence of signs/symptoms of hypercorticism as described above in long-term clinical trials was similar to that seen in the short-term clinical trials.

A randomized, open, parallel-group multicenter safety study specifically compared the effect of ENTOCORT EC (< 9 mg/day) and prednisolone (< 40 mg/day) on bone mineral density over 2 years when used at doses adjusted to disease severity. Bone mineral density decreased significantly less with ENTOCORT EC than with prednisolone in steroid-naïve patients, whereas no difference could be detected between treatment groups for steroid-dependent patients and previous steroid users. The incidence of treatment-emergent symptoms of hypercorticism was significantly higher with prednisolone treatment.

Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ENTOCORT EC. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic reactions; Nervous System Disorders: Benign intracranial hypertension.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, hormones, and 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases [^114rVT3R]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) results in raised intracranial pressure (ICP) leading to papilledema, visual dysfunction, and headaches. Obese females of reproductive age are predominantly affected, but the underlying pathological mechanisms behind IIH remain unknown. This review provides an overview of pathogenic factors that could result in IIH with particular focus on hormones and the impact of obesity, including its role in neuroendocrine signaling and driving inflammation. Despite occurring almost exclusively in obese women, there have been a few studies evaluating the mechanisms by which hormones and adipokines exert their effects on ICP regulation in IIH. Research involving 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, a modulator of glucocorticoids, suggests a potential role in IIH. Improved understanding of the complex interplay between adipose signaling factors such as adipokines, steroid hormones, and ICP regulation may be key to the understanding and future management of IIH.

### Intracranial hypertension presenting with severe visual failure, without concurrent headache, in a child with nephrotic syndrome [^112MqrGo]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterised by the presence of heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and generalised oedema. During childhood NS is often 'idiopathic' and on biopsy associated with minimal change nephropathy on light microscopy.

The majority of children have steroid responsive - so called steroid sensitive - NS and in the absence of any complicating features are treated expectantly with high dose daily steroid therapy. Typically a large number of children with NS develop clinical relapse following initial response to steroids, and are treated with further steroid courses. Following initial presentation a small proportion of children with relapsing NS go on to develop steroid dependent disease. In these cases additional immunosuppresants are often used to reduce the relapsing clinical course and/or to reduce the dose of steroids.

NS and its treatment are associated with significant morbidity and the complications can be fatal. In NS, renal failure, corticosteroids, cyclosporine therapy and cerebral venous thrombosis all contribute to central nervous system complications, which include intracranial hypertension.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) comprises a headache syndrome with an elevated intracranial pressure (greater than 250 mmH₂O), where the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition is normal, and no evidence of a structural cause is identified. A recent study of normal CSF pressure in children concluded that similar adult pressure norms of less than 280 mmH₂O are applicable to childhood cases.

In adults visual symptoms occur in virtually all patients although these may be mild and not noted by the patients. However, loss of visual acuity, restriction in the visual fields, increased blind spots and reduced colour vision form the serious permanent complication of IIH. In children similar long-term visual morbidity has been reported and appears to be more severe in patients that present atypically without headaches. A pressure reduction strategy is crucial to minimise the visual impairment seen in this condition, alongside identifying and eliminating associated factors. Medical management, serial lumbar puncture (LP) or surgical management are treatment options in adults and children with IIH. Here we report a patient with steroid dependent NS presenting acutely with severe visual failure and papiloedema without concurrent headaches, and found to have significantly raised CSF pressure.

### Association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension and risk of cardiovascular diseases in women in the United Kingdom [^1175Ao69]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the risk of cardiovascular disease greater in women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than in women of the same age and body mass index but without idiopathic intracranial hypertension?

Findings

In this population-based matched controlled cohort study of 2760 female patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and 27 125 control patients, women with this condition had twice the risk for cardiovascular disease compared with their counterparts with similar body mass index and age. Between 2005 and 2017, the incidence and prevalence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension have tripled.

Meaning

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension appeared to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women; changing patient management to address the risk factors for cardiovascular disease may reduce long-term morbidity.

### What is new about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? An updated review of mechanism and treatment [^1156xR2q]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. IIH is a relatively rare disease but rapidly increasing incidence is reported due to a global increasing incidence of obesity. Disease course is generally said to be self-limiting within a few months. However, some patients experience a disabling condition of chronic severe headache and visual disturbances for years that limit their capacity to work. Permanent visual defects are serious and not infrequent complications. The pathophysiology of IIH is still not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have facilitated the exclusion of associated conditions that may mimic IIH. No causal treatment is yet known for IIH and existing treatment is symptomatic and rarely sufficient. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of this potentially disabling disease which may show a future escalating incidence due to obesity. Theories of pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are discussed.

### Cushing's disease and idiopathic intracranial hypertension: case report and review of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms [^116pUaz7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Several studies have reported an association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and deficits of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Case Illustration

A 33-yr-old woman with Cushing's disease underwent successful surgical resection of a pituitary adenoma and developed IIH 11 months later after inadvertent withdrawal of oral glucocorticoids.

Methods

A review of the literature was conducted to identify previous studies pertaining to IIH in association with neuroendocrine disease, focusing on reports related to HPA axis dysfunction.

Results

A number of patients developing IIH due to a relative deficiency in glucocorticoids, after surgical or medical management for Cushing's disease, withdrawal from glucocorticoid replacement, or as an initial presentation of Addison's disease, have been reported. Hypotheses regarding the underlying pathophysiology of IIH in this context and, in particular, the role of cortisol and its relationship to other neuroendocrine and inflammatory mediators that may regulate the homeostasis of cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption are reviewed.

Conclusion

In a subset of patients, dysfunction of the HPA axis appears to play a role in the development of IIH. Hormonal control of cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption may be regulated by inflammatory mediators and the enzyme 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. Further study of neuroendocrine markers in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid may be an avenue for further research in IIH.

MANAGEMENT OF MEDICATION OVERUSE HEADACHE

One-third of IIHTT participants overused medication at baseline, on the basis of the last 30-day history, and had a significantly higher mean HIT-6 score (63.1 ± 6.9) than in those without (58.1 ± 9.4; P = 0.0007). Other studies found management of medication overuse headache (MOH) a more common issue for IIH patients long term, reflecting the study type. Successfully removing excessive analgesic use significantly improves headaches in other headache disorders. What is yet what is yet to be determined is the effects it has on the course of IIH-related headache. It seems prudent that all IIH patients with headaches are warned about avoiding excessive analgesic use and where MOH exists standard advice of removal given.

### Fulminant bilateral papilloedema during low-dose steroid taper in a child with systemic idiopathic arthritis treated with tocilizumab [^115nfa3t]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is one of the most severe forms of arthritis that affects children younger than 16 years of age at onset. SJIA often requires corticosteroids to control the inflammation. However, long-term corticosteroid use may have adverse effects, including intracranial hypertension (IH). Biologic therapies have been used as corticosteroid sparing agents. We report the first case of a child with steroid-dependent SJIA treated with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, who developed fulminant IH, bilateral papilloedema and vision loss when oral prednisone was weaned from 2 to 1 mg per day. Despite repeated lumbar punctures and high dose acetazolamide, he required urgent unilateral optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF). This endoscopic surgical intervention released the pressure exerted by the cerebrospinal fluid on the optic nerve and stopped the progression of vision loss. Nine weeks after the diagnosis of bilateral papilloedema, his vision was completely restored in one eye and partially recovered in the contralateral one. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids even at very low dose and tocilizumab may predispose to severe IH, papilloedema and vision loss. The role that tocilizumab might have played in this case in unclear. Early recognition and prompt treatment of papilloedema is crucial in avoiding permanent vision loss. Fulminant papilloedema in an immunocompromised child carries additional significant challenges. Early ONSF is a safe and effective intervention in refractory papilloedema. Children with severe papilledema secondary to IH should be managed by a multidisciplinary team in tertiary centres.

This paper summarises the first consensus guidelines for idiopathic intracranial hypertension as an infographic. Following a systematic literature review, a multidisciplinary specialist interest group met and established questions relating to population, interventions, controls and outcomes (PICO). A survey was sent to doctors who manage idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) regularly. Statements were reviewed by national professional bodies, specifically the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and by international experts. Key areas are represented based on the guideline, namely: (1) investigation of papilloedema and diagnosis of IIH; (2) management strategies; and (3) investigation and management of acute exacerbation of headache in established IIH.

### Infectious and inflammatory disorders might increase the risk of developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension-a national case-control study [^114wXEmz]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder that induces symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances and pulsatile tinnitus due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause. The incidence varies between nations but metanalyses with pooled results report the incidence to be 1.2 per 100,000 individuals in the adult population. It has been reported to be slightly lower in Sweden (0.65 per 100,000). IIH is most frequent among obese females of childbearing age. Many risk factors have been proposed to be associated with IIH; for example, obesity, exposure to tetracyclines, withdrawal from corticosteroids, kidney failure, anaemia, hypervitaminosis A, Addison's disorder and hyperparathyroidism. However, the findings are not conclusive, and the pathogenesis remains unknown. One hypothesis has addressed the possibility that an inflammatory response contributes to IIH pathogenesis. Obesity is a disorder known to cause a chronic pro-inflammatory state in the body, and it is strongly associated with IIH development. Recent weight gain prior to diagnosis is also common. However, other risk factors must also be involved in IIH development and dysregulation of ICP in the brain since most patients with obesity do not develop IIH. Several case reports describe, mostly in children, a clinical syndrome like IIH but with its onset in association with syphilis, hepatitis A, varicella, measles, or other viral infections.

Several mechanisms have been proposed by which an inflammatory process could be involved in IIH pathogenesis, partly to explain the strong association of obesity and IIH. One potential pathway relates to increased activity of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which has been shown to be dysregulated with increased activity in both obesity and IIH. In humans, 11β-HSD1 increases local cortisol levels. Long-standing high cortisol levels have been shown to increase secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and possibly to increase the production of cerebrospinal fluid by affecting sodium transporters in the choroid plexus. Weight loss and lower ICP values has been shown to reduce 11β-HSD1-levels in IIH patients. A second hypothesis has discussed the possible role of proinflammatory cytokines and apokines such as leptin, IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, and TNF-α. Several studies have demonstrated increased or decreased levels of these inflammatory mediators indicating that pro-inflammatory activation could plausibly be involved in the pathogenesis of IIH (,–).

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^117Gz9hq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardising recruitment criteria for clinical trials. The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterised; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives. Recent treatment trials are providing insights into the management but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review will provide an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^116UJg9f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Uncertainty

There are no clinical trials as yet in the treatment of headache alone in IIH.

Q14 How should medication overuse be approached?

Medication overuse is a common issue for patients with IIH. Successfully removing excessive analgesic use significantly improves headaches. Additionally, if not addressed, MOH may prevent the optimisation and effectiveness of preventative treatments.
Non-opioids and triptan medications may be stopped abruptly or weaned down within a month.
Opioid medications should be gradually removed, with at least 1 month painkiller free to determine effectiveness

Uncertainty

The most effective strategies to facilitate acute analgesic medication withdrawal are not fully established.

Q15 Should CSF diversion surgery be used in patients with IIH with headache alone?

Where papilloedema has resolved, typically, the ICP will be normalising, and conservative treatment strategies should be employed. CSF shunting to exclusively treat headache in IIH has limited evidence. Following CSF diversion 68% will continue to have headaches at 6 months and 79% by 2 years. Twenty-eight per cent can develop iatrogenic low pressure headaches, although this figure will vary depending on shunt and valve type.
CSF diversion is generally not recommended as a treatment for headache alone in IIH.
CSF diversion procedures for the management of headaches should only be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting and following a period of intracranial pressure monitoring.

Uncertainty

Patients with IIH often have coexisting migrainous headaches superimposed on the headaches secondary to raised intracranial pressure. Failure to optimise the ICP may render the migrainous headache difficult to treat.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^117E9uCi]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important to understand the aggressive nature of this condition and to act immediately. Patients with fulminant IIH should be admitted for expedited work up and treatment. After we ascertained that blood pressure was normal in case 3, we proceeded with work up and treatment. MRI brain and orbit with and without contrast and MRV with and without contrast revealed bilateral enhancement of the optic nerve head and dilation of the optic nerve sheaths, a partially empty sella and narrowing of the transverse sinuses with no evidence of thrombosis. There was no anaemia and no use of precipitating medications. The lumbar puncture opening pressure was 80 cm H₂O and CSF had a normal composition. Immediate treatment included placement of a lumbar drain, oral acetazolamide 500 mg three times a day to be titrated up to 3–4 g/day rapidly, and intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days. Note treatment with steroids is not recommended in IIH with the exception of fulminant cases where a short course of IV methylprednisolone has been more typically used in North American practice, particularly in paediatric cases. In the United Kingdom IV methylprednisolone is not typically used in adults with fulminant IIH. Further evidence would be required to understand the mechanism by which glucocorticoids may be beneficial here.

We consulted with an oculoplastic specialist for possible ONSF and with neurosurgery for possible CSF diversion surgery. It can take time to arrange the emergency surgery, due to the rarity of the surgery. After placement of a lumbar drain, ICP decreased to 50 cm H₂O but BCVA decreased to counting fingers in the left eye, so the patient underwent left ONSF two days after admission. BCVA remained stable in the right eye at 6/6 and improved to 6/20 in the left eye. Colour vision showed persistent compromise bilaterally. The cranial nerve VI palsy and headaches persisted. Due to the ongoing symptoms and signs and excessively raised ICP the patient finally underwent a right VP shunt placement by neurosurgery four days following the initial admission.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111A5ZWC]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumour cerebri is primarily a disorder of young obese women characterised by symptoms and signs associated with raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a space-occupying lesion or other identifiable cause.

Summary

The overall incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is approximately two per 100,000, but is considerably higher among obese individuals and, given the global obesity epidemic, is likely to rise further. The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly understood, but most theories focus on the presence of intracranial venous hypertension and/or increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and how this relates to obesity. A lack of randomised clinical trials has resulted in unsatisfactory treatment guidelines and although weight loss is important, especially when used in conjunction with drugs that reduce cerebrospinal fluid production, resistant cases remain difficult to manage and patients invariably undergo neurosurgical shunting procedures. The use of transverse cerebral sinus stenting remains contentious and long-term benefits are yet to be determined.

Conclusion

An understanding of the clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic options available for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is important both for neurologists and ophthalmologists as visual loss maybe permanent if untreated.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^115UJZJv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Scope

This is a consensus document to provide practical information for best practice in uniform investigation and treatment strategies based on current literature and opinion from a specialist interest group (SIG) for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This should increase awareness of IIH among clinicians and improve outcomes for patients.

The target audience for this statement includes neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, emergency medicine specialists, physicians, ear nose and throat specialists and other clinicians who investigate and manage IIH. It also contains information that will be of interest to those in primary care and other healthcare professionals.

The increasing economic burden of IIH has been highlighted by a number of groups. Clear guidance will help educate the attending doctors to manage these patients appropriately. This will help reduce the repeat unsolicited emergency hospital attendances and reduce IIH-related disability. There are a number of ongoing clinical trials in IIH and as evidence for medical and surgical management evolves in IIH this document will require timely updates.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children: a review and algorithm [^1175rgWT]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This updated review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension focuses on epidemiology, clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, evaluation, clinical course, and treatment. General guidelines for the clinical management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are discussed. A new algorithm outlines an efficient management strategy for the initial diagnostic evaluation of children with signs or symptoms of intracranial hypertension. This algorithm provides a systematic approach to initial evaluation and management, and identifies important decision-making factors. The risk of permanent visual loss with idiopathic intracranial hypertension necessitates a prompt, thorough collaborative approach in the management of patients. Although idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been recognized for over a century, the need remains for prospectively collected data to promote a better understanding of the etiology, risk factors, evaluative methods, and effective treatments for children with this syndrome.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116J2LXT]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is common in obese women and can lead to significant visual impairment. First described more than 100 years ago, the cause of the disorder remains unknown. Despite a multitude of proposed links, the aetiology has never been established. Impairment of cerebrospinal-fluid reabsorption is the most likely underlying pathophysiological cause of the raised pressure, but this notion has yet to be proven. Cerebral venous sinus abnormalities associated with the disorder need further exploration. Although the major symptoms of headache and visual disturbance are well documented, most data for disease outcome have been from small retrospective case series. No randomised controlled trials of treatment have been done and the management is controversial. The importance of weight loss needs clarification, the role of diuretics is uncertain, and which surgical intervention is the most effective and safe is unknown. Prospective trials to examine these issues are urgently needed.

### Long-term surveillance following intralesional steroid injection for benign vocal fold lesions… [^114pGfXu]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Is vocal fold steroid injection a viable option to manage benign vocal lesions. Findings Following VFSI, 141 of 189 patients showed positive response and received long-term surveillance. Two years after the procedure, VFSI remained effective in about half of the initially recruited 189 patients. This study prospectively recruited patients with vocal nodules, polyps, and mucus-retention cysts who received VFSI between August 2011 and September 2013. Clinical diagnoses were based on the appearance of the vocal fold edge and the vibratory property revealed by videolaryngostroboscopy. Vocal fold nodules refer to bilateral epithelial thickening or swelling, usually at the junction of the anterior to middle third of the vocal folds.

For patients who did not maintain a regular clinical follow-up schedule, we conducted structured telephonic interviews every 6 months for up to 2 years. All patients were asked the 10 questions of the VHI-10 and whether the patient had received any additional interventions. Symptom recurrence was defined using a subjective report together with a VHI-10 score of more than 10.
26. Later, Mortenson and Woo16 reported on 34 patients with nodules, polyps, cysts, granuloma, and scars who were treated successfully by using intracordal methylprednisolone injection. The authors suggested that office-based steroid injection in the vocal folds can be helpful to avoid or delay phonosurgery, reduce scarring following microsurgery, and reduce edema and granulation. Subsequent studies have further supported the alternative application of VFSI to treat benign vocal lesions by providing more objective measurements. 15, 17, 18.

Another limitation of this study was the follow-up period. Because most benign vocal fold disorders are closely associated with personal phonation behavior and occupational voice loads, a longer follow-up period may yield higher recurrence rates. Furthermore, the lack of follow-up records in the 48 patients who did not benefit from the first steroid injection prevented the comparison of recurrence rates between different clinical scenarios. Finally, despite the patient cohort for this study being probably among the largest that has been reported thus far, the number of patients may still be inadequate for ensuring strength of the subgroup analyses, such as the differences between the 3 diagnostic groups.

### A national Swedish case-control study investigating incidence and factors associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1131pn7S]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

Incidence of IIH in Sweden was 0.71 per 100,000 inhabitants which is in the lower range of IIH incidence reports in the adult population. The incidence increased over the investigated period as reported in other studies.
This study provides confirmation of an association between IIH and the factors kidney failure, arterial hypertension and SLE.
Exposure to previously reported risk factor drugs: tetracyclines, sulphonamides, lithium, and corticosteroids were more common among IIH patients compared to controls the year prior to first diagnosis of IIH.
Exposure to pregnancy and hormonal contraceptives did not appear to be factors associated with IIH.

### Severe visual loss associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in pregnancy [^111kS1e6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in pregnancy is often responsive to conservative management and usually carries a favorable prognosis. Pregnant patients may be managed with dietary control, corticosteroid therapy, diuretics, and occasionally serial lumbar puncture. We report an unusual case of permanent visual loss due to IIH in pregnancy, requiring aggressive CSF diversion and bilateral optic nerve sheath fenestration after failure to improve with a brief course of medical management and a lumbar puncture. Despite resolution of the papilledema, the subject's acuity improved only to 20/40 in the right eye and remained no light perception in the left eye.

### Steroids for the treatment of viral encephalitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^114Xy2HC]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The data included in this review and meta-analysis do not yield superiority of steroid therapy compared to supportive treatment or antiviral monotherapy, nor does it favor a specific steroid compound, timing or dosing regimen. Therapeutic approaches in the studies investigated vary considerably and seem to be informed by local conventions rather than by pathophysiological rationales (see Table 2). To some extent, this may explain the higher rate of steroid use in the Houston versus the Linz cohort, as this discrepancy extends to all pathogens occurring at both sites. Another factor might be the differences in morbidity and mortality, pointing toward a more severely affected cohort treated at the Houston site.

In the three trials reporting a positive outcome, most patients were treated with dexamethasone at equivalent doses of five to 30 mg per day, well below the dose of 40 mg per day recommended in adults with bacterial meningitis. Most patients in these trials received steroids for 7 days or less, presumably owing to the idea that the hyper-acute phase of VE has passed after this period and potential steroid side effects will surpass its benefit. Only one of the positive trials reports the interval between VE onset and steroid initiation (3–12 days); hence, no valid conclusions can be drawn.

The data generated by the case series and clinical trials are of low to very low quality due to small and heterogeneous study populations and interventions, incomplete data, and possible selection, allocation and detection bias. The generalizability of the results to other pathogens and different socioeconomic settings is questionable. Furthermore, although cases reporting the use of steroids explicitly for increased intracerebral pressure were not considered, we cannot exclude that beneficial effects of steroids were mediated via the anti-edematous rather than the antiviral or anti-inflammatory effect.

Steroid use seems to be safe in most cases. Only one trial claims that side effects were more frequent in the steroid than in the control group. It does not become evident if this affected the clinical outcome in the treatment group. Furthermore, the trial pertains to an extremely ill cohort receiving multiple drugs. Thus, it remains open if the side effects were steroid-induced. No or only minor transient adverse effects were reported in the other case reports and case series. However, publication bias is likely. Due to the lack of a randomized design in most trials and the paucity of specific outcome data, we cannot fully exclude that steroid use leads to a worse outcome as defined by the mRS. However, our meta-analysis did not support a harmful effect of steroids concerning survival.

### Intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone: data from 25 years of the genentech national cooperative growth study [^113XrH2b]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Intracranial hypertension (IH) is a rare condition in children. However, a relationship between recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy and IH has been well documented. Risk factors were assessed for 70 rhGH-naive patients enrolled in the National Cooperative Growth Study with reports of IH after treatment initiation. Patients with severe growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and obesity (particularly in the CRI group) were at highest risk of developing IH during the first year of therapy, suggesting initiation of careful early monitoring. In some patients, factors such as corticosteroid use or other chromosomal abnormalities appear to confer a delayed risk of IH, and these patients should be monitored long-term for signs and symptoms of IH.

### Steroids in neurooncology: actions, indications, side-effects [^112uvbmR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glucocorticoids are frequently used in the treatment of patients with neurooncological disorders. This review addresses different clinical indications and provides information on beneficial and undesired effects exerted by these drugs. The most important cellular mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids under different conditions are highlighted.

Recent Findings

Glucocorticoids have been used for the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms for decades. In addition to proapoptotic effects, recent studies have delineated the induction of autophagy in lymphoma cells as an important alternative mode of cell death. In contrast, glucocorticoids may reduce the sensitivity of tumor cells, including glioma cells, other than lymphoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Corticosteroids also provide transient relief from neurological symptoms caused by increased intracranial pressure and edema associated with primary and secondary brain tumors. However, treatment with glucocorticoids is also commonly associated with considerable side-effects including hyperglycemia, myopathy, osteoporosis, lymphopenia and others.

Summary

Although in clinical use for more than 40 years in the field of neurooncology, steroids remain a central and essential part in the treatment of brain tumor patients. Along with improved therapeutic options and prolonged life expectancy of many of these patients, careful administration is required and long-term side-effects must be considered.

### Magnetic resonance imaging signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension… [^111tRRE9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 192 patients, the presence of 2 of 3 IIH-specific MRI signs enabled the diagnosis of papilledema in patients with suspected IIH with greater accuracy than with the use of current diagnostic MRI criteria. This diagnostic ability was confirmed in 3 independent cohorts. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study of patients with IIH and controls suggest that an evidence-based MRI score including posterior globe flattening, optic nerve disc protrusion, and transverse sinus stenosis can estimate the presence of papilledema more accurately than the current diagnostic criteria. According to the 2013 diagnostic criteria, 4 cases were classified as IIH, probable IIH, IIH without papilledema, suspected IIH without papilledema, and non-IIH.

Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome was diagnosed in patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for IIH but presenting with an independent disease that was likely causing intracranial pressure elevation. External validation of the score was difficult, given the lack of published clinically relevant data from similar cohorts. The MRI score was found to correlate strongly with the presence or absence of papilledema in validation cohorts 1 to 3 and in patients with confirmed IIH and controls in the present Danish cohort. The MRI score showed a high degree of specificity for IIH but limited sensitivity in the validation cohorts. Although the low sensitivity constitutes a limitation, the score still outperformed the 2013 diagnostic criteria. Thus, its use would likely reduce the number of asymptomatic patients referred to headache centers because of the detection of single imaging signs, such as empty sella.

It also strongly indicates a risk of developing the full clinical picture of IIH, even in patients without papilledema, justifying ophthalmological follow-up and, when sufficient suspicion of IIH persists, lumbar puncture. IIH likely represents a continuum of varying degrees of increased intracranial pressure, with and without papilledema. The higher rate of MRI signs and slightly elevated average opening pressure in the non-IIH controls than in the outpatient cohort in this study support this concept implicating IIH and IIH without papilledema being part of the same continuum rather than 2 different entities.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension; research progress and emerging themes [^116rSdPy]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterised by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause predominantly seen in obese women of childbearing age and associated with a history of recent weight gain. The aetiology is poorly understood and there are no evidence-based guidelines on the management of the disease. We aim to provide a review of the recent literature outlining the latest advances in this field over the past few years. Areas of emerging interest related to the pathophysiology of IIH will be discussed, such as the role of obesity, adipose tissue and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. We consider the latest research on the role of venous sinus stenosis in IIH and ex vivo advances into cerebrospinal fluid drainage via the arachnoid granulation tissue. The latest techniques for optic nerve head evaluation and the role of optical coherence tomography will be summarised. Finally, we will discuss recent advances in the management of IIH, including weight loss, and medical and surgical treatment strategies.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^11329qWF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) occurs throughout the world with an estimated incidence of one to three per 100,000 population per year. It occurs most commonly in obese young women, but the cause is unknown. It presents a significant threat to sight and is associated with severe morbidity in the form of headaches in the majority of cases. Several different treatments have been proposed, ranging from relatively conservative measures such as diuretic therapy to more invasive treatments such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or lumbo-peritoneal shunting.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the evidence from controlled trials looking at the various treatments used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension with a view to producing an evidence-based treatment strategy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - CENTRAL/CCTR (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register) on the Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002, MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2002).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials in which any intervention used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension had been compared to placebo or to another form of treatment in people with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Since no trials met our inclusion criteria, no assessment of quality or meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Of the various treatments available, there is inadequate information regarding which are truly beneficial and which are potentially harmful. Properly designed and executed trials are needed.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115cM4wL]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure. The underlying pathophysiology is mostly unknown and effective treatment is an unmet clinical need in this disease. This review evaluates key emerging themes regarding disease characteristics, mechanisms contributing to raised intracranial pressure and advances in potential therapeutic targets.

Findings

IIH is becoming more common, with the incidence rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. Current medical management remains centred around weight management, which is challenging. Metabolic investigations of patients have identified specific androgen profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggest an endocrine dysfunction impacting CSF secretion in IIH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) have been found to play a role in CSF dynamics in IIH and have formed the basis of the first clinical trials looking at new treatments.

Conclusions

Identification of novel molecular targets thought to underlie IIH pathology is now being translated to clinical trials.

### Budesonide (Uceris) [^116RtcUW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Axis Suppression

Systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with use corticosteroids, including UCERIS. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression during treatment with UCERIS.

Patients with moderate to severe liver disease should be monitored for increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism. Discontinuing the use of UCERIS tablets should be considered in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Glucocorticosteroids, including UCERIS, can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended.

5.2 Transferring Patients from Systemic Glucocorticosteroid Therapy

Care is needed in patients who are transferred from glucocorticosteroid treatment with higher systemic effects to glucocorticosteroids with lower systemic effects, such as UCERIS, since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients, and the dose of glucocorticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously.

Replacement of systemic glucocorticosteroids with UCERIS tablets may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic drug.

### Budesonide — Budesonide — enteric coated [^117PtfV1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Axis Suppression

When corticosteroids are used chronically, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression may occur. Corticosteroids can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic corticosteroid is recommended. Since budesonide capsules (enteric coated) contain a corticosteroid, general warnings concerning corticosteroids should be followed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.3), (5.4)].

Pediatric patients with Crohn's disease have a slightly higher systemic exposure of budesonide and increased cortisol suppression than adults with Crohn's disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C respectively) could be at an increased risk of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression due to an increased systemic exposure of oral budesonide. Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Monitor for increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism and consider reducing the dosage in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Symptoms of Steroid Withdrawal in Patients Transferred from Other Systemic Corticosteroids

Monitor patients who are transferred from corticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects to corticosteroids with lower systemic availability, such as budesonide capsules (enteric coated), since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal axis suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients and the dose of corticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously.

Replacement of systemic corticosteroids with budesonide capsules (enteric coated) may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic drug.

### Nafarelin acetate (Synarel) [^112Cd4hR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

As with other drugs that stimulate the release of gonadotropins or that induce ovulation, in adult women with endometriosis ovarian cysts have been reported to occur in the first two months of therapy with SYNAREL. Many, but not all, of these events occurred in women with polycystic ovarian disease. These cystic enlargements may resolve spontaneously, generally by about four to six weeks of therapy, but in some cases may require discontinuation of drug and/or surgical intervention. The relevance, if any, of such events in children is unknown.

Information for Patients, Patients' Parents or Guardians

An information pamphlet for patients is included with the product. Patients and their caregivers should be aware of the following information:

1. Reversibility of the suppressive effects of nafarelin has been demonstrated by the appearance or return of menses, by the return of pubertal gonadotropin and gonadal sex steroid levels, and/or by advancement of secondary sexual development. Semen analysis was normal in the two ejaculated specimens obtained thus far from boys who have been taken off therapy to resume puberty. Fertility has not been documented by pregnancies and the effect of long-term use of the drug on fertility is not known.

2. Patients and their caregivers should be adequately counseled to assure full compliance; irregular or incomplete daily doses may result in stimulation of the pituitary-gonadal axis.

3. Inform parents and caregivers that reports of convulsions have been observed in patients receiving GnRH agonists. Patients with a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions may be at increased risk [see Warnings].

4. Inform patients and caregivers that reports of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) have been observed in pediatric patients receiving GnRH agonists. Advise patients and caregivers to monitor for headache, and vision issues such as blurred vision, double vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement, ringing in the ears, dizziness, and nausea. Advise patients and caregivers to contact their healthcare provider if the patient develops any of these symptoms [see Warnings].

### The idiopathic intracranial hypertension prospective cohort study: evaluation of prognostic factors and outcomes [^116t26pT]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

This was a prospectively collected study of real-world clinical practice and has some inherent limitations. As it is within a tertiary referral centre, a number of patients from the cohort would have been seen initially at other hospitals. Whilst neuroimaging is requested for review, the clinical details are not routinely requested, other than what is stated in the referral letter. Therefore, baseline data for each participant could have been at a different point in their actual disease course. To reduce this bias, we defined disease duration from the LP to the first encounter in our clinic. We also recognise that patients report symptoms of IIH in a variable time frame before an actual diagnosis. Although the study aimed to capture all outcomes, some were missing due to patient preference. Also, as per clinical practice some individuals who presented in ocular remission were discharged, some were lost to follow-up, and hence these groups had no further clinic appointments or data collected. This resulted in a reduction in the number of patients over the course of the study. We, therefore, advise caution in over interpreting the long-term outcomes as seen in the LOESS smoothers curve due to the reducing sample size over the course of the study. To reduce the bias of missing data, we elected to only analyse headache outcomes in those with active papilloedema, rather than those who presented in remission, as this latter group were more likely to be discharged and had less follow-up data. Likewise, due to the challenges of data collection for intracranial pressure lowering medications, such as confirming dose, duration, and inability to ensure compliance, we only reported baseline data and did not further analyse their effects on outcomes here. This was also the case for analgesic frequency. In the future, our IIH Life study may collect more detailed descriptions of medications and other factors. In addition, thefuture analysis could be compared to a control group which may allow for more insights into the long-term outcomes of IIH to be discovered.

### Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release (Emrosi) [^112CQrKD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis)

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue EMROSI.

5.5 Hepatotoxicity

Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue EMROSI if liver injury is suspected.

5.6 Central Nervous System Effects

Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on EMROSI. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued.

5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension

Idiopathic Intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and EMROSI because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize.

5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes

Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue EMROSI.

We investigated the clinical characteristics of a pediatric population with hemato-oncological disease and intracranial hypertension, analyze the therapeutic response and outcome, and compare its characteristics with respect to a control group with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with hemato-oncological disease and secondary intracranial hypertension in our center during the past five years. We compared these individuals with a historical cohort with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from our institution (control group).

Results

We identified eight patients, all with leukemia, and 21 controls. Mean age at diagnosis was 10.6 years, and 62% of individuals were female. Most of them were under treatment with drugs (62% corticosteroids, 75% active chemotherapy). Mean opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid was 35cmH₂O. All had headache, but only 28% complained of visual symptoms. Only 12.5% exhibited papilledema at the time of diagnosis (versus 71% in controls). All of them were treated with acetazolamide, with average therapy duration of nine months, and all had a favorable outcome (versus 57% of controls who needed second-line treatment). None of them showed long-term visual complications (versus 20% of controls).

Conclusions

Patients with hemato-oncological disease and secondary intracranial hypertension may not develop typical symptomatology. Thus, diagnosis and recognition of this entity among this cohort may be difficult. Associated factors are diverse and do not show an obvious causal relationship. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for diagnosis, because a favorable outcome is expected with prompt treatment. Acetazolamide is effective as a first-line therapy and caused few side effects.

### Pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension and the underlying endocrine-metabolic dysfunction: a pilot study [^114v6M5w]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To unravel the potential idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) endocrine-metabolic comorbidities by studying the natural (and targeted drug-modified) history of disease in children. IIH is a disorder of unclear pathophysiology, characterized by raised intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or space-occupying lesion coupled with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition.

Methods

Retrospective study (years 2001–2010) of clinical records and images and prospective follow-up (years 2010–2013) in 15 children (11 girls, 4 boys; aged 5–16 years) diagnosed previously as "IIH", according to the criteria for pediatric IIH proposed by Rangwala, at four university pediatric centers in northern, central, and southern Italy.

Results

We identified six potential endocrine-metabolic comorbidities including, weight gain and obesity (n = 5), recombinant growth hormone therapy (n = 3), obesity and metabolic syndrome (n = 1), secondary hyperaldosteronism (n = 1), hypervitaminosis A (n = 1), and corticosteroid therapy (n = 1). Response to etiologically targeted treatments (e.g., spironolactone, octreotide) was documented.

Conclusions

IIH is a protean syndrome caused by various potential (risk and) associative factors. Several conditions could influence the pressure regulation of CSF. An endocrine-metabolic altered homeostasis could be suggested in some IIH patients, and in this context, etiologically targeted therapies (spironolactone) should be considered.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^113MMxA9]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — treatments not recommended for intracranial hypertension are listed by the SIBICC working group and include mannitol by non-bolus, continuous intravenous infusion; scheduled infusion of hyperosmolar therapy (e.g., every 4 to 6 hours); lumbar CSF drainage; furosemide; routine use of steroids; routine therapeutic hypothermia to temperatures below 35°C due to systemic complications; High dose propofol to attempt burst suppression; routinely decreasing PaCO2 below 30 mm Hg/4.0 kPa; and routinely raising CPP above 90 mm Hg. The group's decision-making included evidence against treatments (e.g., steroids, CPP > 70 mm Hg) and lack of sufficient supporting evidence, and inclusion on this list does not proscribe consideration in some individual cases.

### Short-term steroid therapy in patients with P. jirovecii… [^113BL8Gv]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Short-term Steroid Therapy in Patients With P. Jirovecii Pneumonia Due to HIV / AIDSClinicalTrials. gov ID. Steroids have shown to improve clinical outcome and reduction in mortality in HIV-infected patients the effectiveness of adjuvant steroid treatment for PCP has been observed if it starts within the first 24 to 48 hours. Possibly, there is a long-term benefit with their use in the recovery of function and limitation of chronic pulmonary complications; recently, benefits have been observed in decreasing the incidence of Inflammatory Immune Reconstitution Syndrome due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. On the other hand, steroids could increase the morbidity related to adverse reactions as well as paradoxical worsening of associated herpes virus infection, which are attributed to IRIS or as a result of immunosuppression generated by their use.

Recently, it has been shown that gradually steroids withdrawal is not necessary in patients who have received less than 21 days of treatment. This non-inferiority work aims to confirm the null hypothesis that a reduced steroid scheme in patients with moderate PCP and severe pneumonia is sufficient to limit long-term ventilatory complications and acute postinflammatory syndrome, compared to the conventional 21-day scheme. It also has been hypothesized that it could be associated with fewer cases of IRIS due to herpes virus type 1, 2, 3 and 8. The investigators selected hospitalized subjects with confirmed or suspected moderate or severe PCP: the diagnostic certainty will be based on the following criteria: Proved PCP. Defined as cases with presence of P. jirovecii cysts in bronchial alveolar lavage exams or lung biopsy. Possible PCP.

Defined by the following two criteria: 1) the presence of three of four items: cough, fever, dyspnea and compatible radiological or tomographic findings 2) associated clinical improvement after the onset of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. After obtaining the informed consent, patients will be randomized accordingly to their CD4+ T cell count. patients will receive 21 days of steroid treatment.
- Group B or Shortened Steroids use. Subjects with moderate PCP will receive 8 days of steroids and subjects with severe PCP 14 days of steroids.

### A national Swedish case-control study investigating incidence and factors associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111wbvwm]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Previously proposed factors associated with IIH

The odds were significantly increased compared to both control groups for the following disorders: kidney failure, iron deficiency anaemia, arterial hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), coagulopathy, (OR between 8.4–17.5 compared to GP controls and 3.4–12.8 compared to obese controls), see Figure 2, Supplementary Table 1. The odds ratio for having ovarian dysfunction including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in females was significantly increased compared to GP controls, OR = 6.5 (95% CI 2-6-16.3) but not compared to obese controls, OR 1.6 (95% CI 0.8–3.0). Sarcoidosis, Turner´s syndrome, Down´s syndrome, Addison, Cushing´s disease, hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism were too rare (n < 4) to allow for informative estimates of whether IIH risk was increased or not, (see frequency Table 1). When analysing pregnancy exposure there was no difference between IIH patients and either of the control groups.

Forest plot comparing exposure to previously reported risk factors, diagnoses and pregnancy, in IIH patients compared to controls.

As a sensitivity analysis we investigated benign skin tumours. This sub-analysis did show a borderline to no significant difference between cases and controls affected by this disorder (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 1).

Among reported pharmacological factors associated with IIH, those exposed to tetracyclines, sulphonamides, quinolones, corticosteroids, and lithium all had significantly higher odds when comparing IIH patients to controls (OR between 2.7–13.4 compared to GP controls and OR 1.8–4.8 compared to obese), see Figure 3, Supplementary Table 2. Hormonal contraceptives were less frequently used in IIH cases compared to both control groups. Exposure to retinoidal treatments were too low to conduct a reliable comparison (see frequency Table 2). The OR for androgen treatments exposure were only significant relative to the GP controls but the numbers were low. Sensitivity analysis on antihypertensive drug dispensation confirmed the high ORs obtained for arterial hypertensive diagnosis. However, sensitivity analysis on iron deficiency anaemia treatments resulted in significantly increased OR when comparing IIH to GP controls but not compared to obese controls (see Figure 3, Supplementary Table 2).

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in cystinosis [^115K7b1p]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report a high frequency of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in patients with cystinosis and to speculate on the relationship between these two disorders.

Study Design

Retrospective case series and review of the literature regarding risk factors for the development of IIH in cystinosis.

Results

Eight patients with cystinosis had documented papilledema, normal neuroimaging of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure greater than 200 mm of H2O, and normal CSF composition. No common medication, condition, or disease except cystinosis was found in these persons. Six of the patients had received prednisone, growth hormone, cyclosporine, oral contraceptives, vitamin D, or levothyroxine at the time of onset of IIH. Five patients had previous renal transplants.

Conclusion

No single risk factor for the development of IIH linked IIH to cystinosis in our patients. However, thrombosis susceptibility as a result of renal disease or impaired CSF reabsorption in the arachnoid villi as a result of cystine deposition might lead to the development of IIH in cystinosis.
