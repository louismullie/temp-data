## Question

Doxycycline to reverse type 1 diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether doxycycline can reverse type 1 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes to define what "reversal" would actually require. Then, I should review doxycycline's established pharmacology, including any immunomodulatory or mitochondrial effects that might intersect with autoimmunity. Next, I'll examine mechanistic and preclinical data for plausibility, followed by a careful search for human clinical evidence in type 1 diabetes. After that, I need to consider safety signals and potential risks in people with type 1 diabetes. Finally, I will compare this idea against current standards of care and provide a synthesis and recommendation based on evidence and clinical practice guidelines [^113MPDyb] [^112KrFgn] [^114iTwS1].

> Let me first confirm the disease biology, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be off. Type 1 diabetes is fundamentally an autoimmune, T-cell–mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency; true "reversal" would require halting autoimmunity and restoring sufficient β-cell mass and function, whether by endogenous regeneration, replacement, or durable immunologic tolerance to islet antigens [^113MPDyb] [^1172sQcV] [^113fwHw4].

> Now, I should review what doxycycline actually does. Doxycycline is a second-generation tetracycline with broad antimicrobial activity that also has anti-inflammatory actions and recognized effects on immune cell function and mitochondrial protein synthesis, given the bacterial ancestry of mitochondria; these features can dampen inflammatory signaling, but they are non-specific and can impair cellular bioenergetics at research-relevant exposures [^111pWixk] [^1144gAv6] [^1169nqPd] [^112MY1L8] [^112KLQSf] [^117Tpybq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions just because doxycycline is "anti-inflammatory". I need to check whether non-specific immunosuppression translates to antigen-specific tolerance or β-cell preservation in type 1 diabetes. In other autoimmune contexts like rheumatoid arthritis, tetracyclines show modest improvements in disease activity, but that is not equivalent to halting β-cell autoimmunity, and in neuroinflammation models, ribosome-targeting antibiotics can suppress Th17 function through mitochondrial translation inhibition, which again is not antigen-specific and may carry infection risks; this makes a disease-modifying role in type 1 diabetes biologically tenuous without targeted evidence [^116nLUqN] [^112KLQSf] [^113utBm5].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about the reports that doxycycline induces β-cell replication? At first glance, that sounds promising, but let me verify the mechanism and context. Those studies use doxycycline only as a Tet-ON/Tet-OFF chemical switch to control transgene expression of cell cycle drivers like CDK6 and cyclin D1; the proliferative effect is from the induced genes, not from doxycycline acting on β-cells per se, and the authors specifically note the limitation that gene therapy approaches are not directly acceptable for human diabetes treatment, so I should not attribute β-cell regeneration to doxycycline itself; that would be a mistake, and the correction is that doxycycline is simply the inducible regulator in those models [^111g6SgT] [^115KiwK1] [^115vwgA7].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence in humans with type 1 diabetes. I need to be certain here: are there trials of doxycycline to reverse type 1 diabetes or preserve C-peptide? I should double-check — there are no human trials in the provided corpus testing doxycycline for reversal or β-cell preservation in type 1 diabetes, whereas the only FDA-approved immune therapy with disease-modifying evidence is teplizumab, which delays progression from Stage 2 to Stage 3 by a median of 25 months; earlier broad immunosuppression such as cyclosporine A produced transient insulin-free remissions but failed to achieve durable reversal in clinical practice, underscoring how hard it is to convert non-specific immunosuppression into lasting β-cell preservation [^114WynCy] [^117JYLCn] [^112KrFgn].

> I will now examine safety considerations, because even a theoretically plausible approach must be safe in people with type 1 diabetes. Doxycycline and tetracyclines carry class contraindications for hypersensitivity; long-term tetracycline use has been associated with autoimmune syndromes such as drug-induced lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, particularly with minocycline; ribosome-targeting antibiotics can suppress T-cell effector function through mitochondrial translation inhibition; there is a rare case report of doxycycline-associated hypoglycemia in an insulin-treated patient; and mitochondrial toxicity cautions suggest that prolonged exposure can perturb cellular metabolism, which could be counterproductive for stressed β-cells or immune homeostasis in type 1 diabetes; taken together, these risks do not support off-label chronic doxycycline for a disease-modifying intent in type 1 diabetes without compelling efficacy data [^114jUT6C] [^116PMutk] [^112KLQSf] [^115SmSma] [^117Tpybq].

> Let me compare this concept with the standard of care to ensure I am not missing any guideline-supported role. Current ADA Standards emphasize intensive insulin therapy, education on matching prandial insulin to carbohydrate, fat, and protein, dynamic dose adjustments, and risk mitigation for hypoglycemia; there is no role for antibiotics, including tetracyclines, as disease-modifying therapy in established type 1 diabetes, and for prevention or delay of onset in high-risk individuals, teplizumab is the agent with FDA recognition for delaying progression, not reversing established disease [^112KrFgn] [^114iTwS1] [^116sFDDn] [^114WynCy].

> Synthesis time — let me reconsider everything before concluding. There are no human data showing that doxycycline reverses type 1 diabetes; plausible mechanisms are either non-specific anti-inflammatory effects or mitochondrial translation inhibition, which do not equate to antigen-specific tolerance or durable β-cell rescue; the β-cell replication reports rely on doxycycline-inducible gene therapy switches rather than a direct β-cell effect of doxycycline; and the safety profile raises concerns for off-label chronic use without clear benefit in this population; therefore, I should conclude that doxycycline cannot be recommended to reverse type 1 diabetes, and doing so would deviate from evidence-based standards [^111g6SgT] [^115KiwK1] [^115vwgA7] [^112KLQSf] [^117Tpybq] [^112KrFgn].

> Clinical recommendation: I need to ensure the guidance is clear and aligned with best practice. People with type 1 diabetes should receive guideline-directed insulin therapy with education on meal dosing and correction strategies, consider immunotherapy such as teplizumab only in appropriate pre-symptomatic stages to delay progression, and avoid off-label doxycycline for the purpose of reversing established type 1 diabetes; doxycycline should be reserved for approved indications, with standard precautions for tetracycline-class drugs, and any experimental disease-modifying approaches should be pursued within clinical trials [^112KrFgn] [^114iTwS1] [^116sFDDn] [^114WynCy] [^114jUT6C].

No, doxycycline does **not reverse type 1 diabetes** in humans [^113fwHw4]. There is **no clinical evidence** that doxycycline preserves or restores beta-cell function in T1D, and it is not recommended for this purpose by any guidelines. While doxycycline has anti-inflammatory effects and can inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis in immune cells [^112KLQSf], these properties have not translated into clinical benefit for T1D. The only approved therapy that delays progression in stage 2 T1D is teplizumab [^114WynCy], and insulin remains the standard of care [^112KrFgn].

---

## Mechanisms of doxycycline relevant to type 1 diabetes

Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties [^1169nqPd]. These include **inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis**, which can impair mitochondrial function in immune cells and potentially reduce their activity [^117Tpybq], and **anti-inflammatory effects**, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which may theoretically reduce inflammation [^1169nqPd]. These mechanisms suggest a potential role in modulating immune responses, but their **clinical relevance to T1D remains unproven** [^113fwHw4].

---

## Preclinical evidence

Preclinical studies have explored doxycycline's effects on immune cells and inflammation. They report **immune cell modulation**, with doxycycline impairing T-cell effector function via inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, and **reduced inflammation**, with anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated in various models, including rheumatoid arthritis [^116nLUqN] and dermatological conditions [^1169nqPd]. However, there is **no direct preclinical evidence** that doxycycline reverses established T1D or regenerates pancreatic beta cells [^113fwHw4].

---

## Clinical evidence

Currently, there is **no clinical evidence** supporting doxycycline to reverse T1D in humans [^111QNjuQ]. No trials have demonstrated that it preserves or restores beta-cell function in patients with T1D [^11284WR5].

---

## Safety considerations

Doxycycline is generally well tolerated [^111AMsrh], but long-term use may pose risks. These include **mitochondrial dysfunction**, as prolonged doxycycline use can impair mitochondrial function and potentially affect metabolic health [^117Tpybq], and **antibiotic resistance** [^1144gAv6], since prolonged antibiotic exposure can contribute to resistance, a significant public health concern.

---

## Current standard of care

The current standard of care for T1D involves **insulin therapy**, glucose monitoring, and lifestyle management [^112KrFgn]. Recent advances include immunomodulatory therapies such as **teplizumab**, which has been shown to delay the progression of T1D in at-risk individuals [^114WynCy].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting doxycycline to reverse T1D in humans [^111QNjuQ]. Although doxycycline has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties [^1169nqPd], these have not been shown to preserve or restore beta-cell function in T1D. The standard of care remains insulin therapy and glucose monitoring [^112KrFgn], while emerging immunomodulatory therapies show promise in delaying disease progression [^114WynCy].

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112KrFgn]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically in relation to insulin therapy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend providing education on how to match mealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake to improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life (QoL), and to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, education should be provided on how to modify the insulin dose, also known as the correction dose, based on current glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day management, and anticipated physical activity.

Table 3 displays the baseline disease characteristics in Study TN-10.

- **Efficacy results**: In Study TN-10, Stage 3 type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 20 (45%) of the TZIELD-treated patients and in 23 (72%) of the placebo-treated patients. A Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by age and oral glucose tolerance test status at randomization, demonstrated that the median time from randomization to Stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis was 50 months in the TZIELD group and 25 months in the placebo group, for a difference of 25 months. With a median follow-up time of 51 months, therapy with TZIELD resulted in a statistically significant delay in the development of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes, hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.78; p = 0.0066).

Study TN-10 was not designed to assess whether there were differences in the effectiveness between subgroups based on demographic characteristics or baseline disease characteristics.

### Successful treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor-induced alopecia with doxycycline [^112MY1L8]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Doxycycline, as a member of the tetracycline family, inhibits key proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These anti-inflammatory effects of doxycycline may contribute to its success in treating EGFR inhibitor–associated alopecia. In addition, doxycycline is a potent broad-spectrum antibiotic with good coverage of skin flora. Patients undergoing EGFR-inhibitor treatment frequently have superinfections at sites of toxicity. In one study, 84 of 221 (38%) patients had culture-positive Staphylococcus aureus superinfections after treatment with EGFR inhibitors. S. aureus infection has also been linked to exacerbations of EGFR inhibitor–induced skin eruptions, including a papulopustular eruption on the scalp with associated alopecia. Minocycline, another tetracycline, was reported to help in one case of folliculitis decalvans–type alopecia associated with erlotinib. However, within the tetracycline family, doxycycline has been linked to fewer severe toxicities and is safer in patients with renal impairment than minocycline.

The success of doxycycline in treating our patient's EGFR inhibitor–associated alopecia may be a combination of its potent anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Although further studies are required, doxycycline should be considered a potential therapeutic option for corticosteroid-resistant EGFR inhibitor–induced alopecia.

### Prevention of type 1 diabetes [^1172sQcV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of the loss of beta cells in type 1 diabetes is a major goal of research. Knowledge of genetic susceptibility, the increasing ability to predict who may be at risk, recognition of the potential clinical impact of residual insulin secretion after diagnosis, and the development of new immunomodulatory agents have supported an increasing number of clinical trials to prevent beta-cell loss. Interventions can be targeted at three stages: before the development of autoimmunity (primary prevention), after autoimmunity is recognized (secondary prevention), or after diagnosis when significant numbers of beta cells remain (tertiary prevention). Thus far, several agents show promise when given shortly after diagnosis, but no interventions before diagnosis have shown benefit. Knowledge in this area has grown quickly in recent years and will continue to grow rapidly with several international collaborative efforts underway.

### Drug insight: New immunomodulatory therapies in type 1 diabetes [^114hrzEr]. Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). High credibility.

Animal models and human studies have provided strong evidence that the immune response causing type 1A diabetes is initiated against a limited array of antigens but acquires breadth and depth until beta-cell mass is critically compromised. Two recent trials confirmed the ability to identify relatives at risk for the development of diabetes but were unsuccessful in preventing the disease. However, treatment of at-risk individuals with oral insulin, which is postulated to be an antigen in the disease, showed efficacy in a subgroup of these subjects. This suggests that antigen-specific prevention approaches might be successful in the right group of subjects at the right time.

Earlier trials indicated that the natural progression of the disease can be altered with conventional immune suppression, but these approaches have been supplanted by tolerance-induction strategies. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies have shown efficacy in preventing the loss of insulin production over the first two years of disease without chronic immune suppression. The mechanisms are novel and appear to involve the induction of immune regulation by the monoclonal antibody. Ultimately, preservation and even improvement in beta-cell mass is the goal of therapy. Achieving this will depend on the timing and mechanisms of the immune intervention and might require combinations of agents.

### Regulated and reversible induction of adult human β-cell replication [^115vwgA7]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The first goal, developing a means of reversibly inducing, then reversing, then reactivating brisk human β-cell replication, was achieved. These findings indicate that it is indeed possible to reversibly activate and arrest human β-cell replication, providing hope that strategies to mitigate oncogenic concerns associated with sustained cell cycle activation may be feasible.

The second goal, mimicking the transient proliferation that occurs in normal human development, was also achieved. Dox was able to activate replication, its withdrawal inactivated it, and its reintroduction reactivated adult human β-cell replication. The time span used (3, 7, and 10 days) was briefer than the weeks to months that occur in normal development, but further extending proliferation with longer exposure to Dox is clearly possible. We have already demonstrated that prolonged (2 months) induction of human β-cell replication is possible using these approaches. The proliferation rates here were comparable to those achieved by constitutive CMV promoter adenoviruses in prior studies. Significantly, we achieved rates of proliferation comparable to, or exceeding, those observed in developing human pancreas. These observations support the notion that induction of human β-cell replication at the 5% range for 2–3 months may be sufficient to expand endogenous and ex vivo sources of human β-cells.

These studies also have limitations. One is the use of gene therapy techniques, which are unlikely to be directly acceptable for human diabetes treatment.

### Minocycline-mediated inhibition of microglia activation impairs oligodendrocyte progenitor cell responses and remyelination in a non-immune model of demyelination [^113utBm5]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2005). Low credibility.

Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, disrupts inflammatory processes within the CNS and reduces demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Several recent studies indicate that components of the inflammatory response to demyelination may be beneficial for the regenerative process of remyelination. In this study, we examined the effects of minocycline on remyelination independent of its effects in limiting immune-mediated white matter damage using a toxin model of demyelination.

Demyelinating lesions were induced by injection of ethidium bromide into the caudal cerebellar peduncles of adult rats. Minocycline or PBS was administered by twice daily injections from day one prior to lesion induction to post-lesion day three. Remyelination was assessed, blinded to grouping, using standard morphological criteria.

- **Microglia activation**: The microglia activation within the lesion was assessed by examining the expression of OX-42 and major histocompatibility class II immunoreactivity.

- **OPC response**: The oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) response was quantified by in situ hybridization using probes for OPC-expressed mRNAs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha, and Olig-1. Minocycline treatment strongly inhibited microglia/macrophage activation at day one and day three post-lesion induction and suppressed the OPC response to demyelination. We also found a significant decrease in the extent of oligodendrocyte, but not Schwann cell, remyelination in the minocycline-treated animals as compared with controls at three weeks post-lesion induction.

These results indicate that microglia/macrophage activation is an important factor in the remyelination process.

### Use of cardioprotective adjuncts in type 1 diabetes [^112z65yv]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is associated with excess cardiovascular risk, even after accounting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including glycaemia. Hence, there is an urgent need to document the metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the cardiovascular mortality gap in type 1 diabetes and to examine whether cardioprotective type 2 diabetes medications prevent premature morbidity and mortality in this population.

### Aspirin-responsive gene switch regulating therapeutic protein expression [^112B9LBb]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

We quantified systemic biomarkers of chronic inflammation in both WT and late-stage T1D mice, including C-reactive protein (CRP) (Fig. 7e), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Fig. 7f), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (Fig. 7g), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (Fig. 7h), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Fig. 7i). These inflammatory biomarkers were all significantly upregulated in untreated T1D mice or T1D mice receiving HEK-ASPIRIN but no ASA, whereas T1D mice implanted with HEK-ASPIRIN and treated with ASA exhibited a remarkable reduction to levels akin to those observed in healthy controls (WT, ASA(-)) (Fig. 7e–i). These results demonstrate that aspirin alone has minimal effects on biomarkers associated with diabetic complications; however, with the assistance of the ASPIRIN system, aspirin significantly downregulates these biomarkers to wild-type levels (Fig. 7a–i). Collectively, these findings support the idea that ASPIRIN could become an attractive strategy for therapeutic transgene regulation by elegantly exploiting the treatment benefits of ASA itself.

### Tetracycline antibiotics impair mitochondrial function and its experimental use confounds research [^117Tpybq]. Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

Tetracyclines, a class of antibiotics that target bacterial translation, are commonly used in research for inducible gene expression using Tet-ON/Tet-OFF systems. However, such tetracycline-inducible systems carry a risk. Given that mitochondria have a "bacterial" ancestry, these antibiotics also target mitochondrial translation and impair mitochondrial function. Indeed, treatment with doxycycline — a tetracycline derivative — disturbs mitochondrial proteostasis and metabolic activity, and induces widespread gene-expression changes. Together, this affects physiology in well-established model systems ranging from cultured cells to simple organisms and to mice and plants. These changes are observed with doxycycline doses that are widely used to regulate gene expression.

In light of these findings, and bearing in mind the conserved role of mitochondria in metabolism and whole organism homeostasis, we caution against the use of tetracyclines in experimental approaches. The use of newly developed tetracycline-based systems that are more sensitive could be an alternative; however, even if no overt mitochondrial toxicity is detected, widespread changes in gene expression may sensitize cells to the intended tetracycline-controlled loss or gain of function, thereby introducing a "two-hit model". This is highly relevant for cancer research, as mitochondrial metabolism holds a central position in the reallocation of nutrients for biomass production known as the Warburg effect.

### Tresiba [^114JwrxB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 2,713 adults with type 2 diabetes to Tresiba, with a mean exposure duration of 36 weeks in six open-label trials: Study D, E, F, G, H, and I [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The mean age was 58 years, and 3% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent were male, 71% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 13% were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 30 kg/m². The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years, and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.3%. A history of neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease at baseline was reported for 14%, 10%, 6%, and 0.6% of participants, respectively. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 83 mL/min/1.73 m², and 9% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) occurring in Tresiba-treated subjects during clinical trials in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of the population studied. Hypoglycemia is not shown in these tables but is discussed in a dedicated subsection below.

### Adult-onset Still's disease: Switch to atypical skin manifestations under anakinra therapy [^1171t4KF]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, are known to suppress inflammatory responses in the skin through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood, without exerting substantial systemic immunosuppressive effects. In cases such as the one presented here, doxycycline might be an effective and comparatively safe treatment option. Further research is necessary to address the pathogenesis of atypical skin manifestations in adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) to offer the best suitable therapies.

### All-trans retinoic acid inhibits type 1 diabetes by T regulatory (Treg)-dependent suppression of interferon-gamma-producing T-cells without affecting Th17 cells [^113RguZT]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

We used an adoptive transfer animal model of the disease to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potential immunoregulatory effect of ATRA on type 1 diabetes. Splenocytes isolated from newly diabetic NOD mice were adoptively transferred to NOD/scid recipient mice. Donor T-cell phenotype, including CD4+ versus CD8+ T-cells, percentage of CD4+ Foxp3-expressing Treg cells, CD8+ cells expressing different markers, and their cytokine secretion profile are shown in Fig. 1 A. The data showed that control recipient mice developed diabetes within 3 weeks, and all mice became diabetic within 4 weeks of cell transfer (Fig. 1 B). In comparison, ATRA treatment (every other day, starting on day 1 of cell transfer) not only significantly delayed the onset of diabetes for 5 weeks in recipient mice but also significantly reduced diabetes incidence compared with controls (25% vs. 100%, respectively) (Fig. 1 B). Histological studies of pancreases from recipient mice showed that control mice had already developed severe destructive insulitis 2 weeks after cell transfer, whereas either intact islets or stationary peri-insulitis was observed in ATRA-treated mice as late as week 17 after cell transfer (Fig. 1 C).

The effects of ATRA treatment on spontaneous diabetes development in NOD mice were also analyzed in studies where treatment was initiated only at 10 weeks of age. At this age, 2 weeks before the onset of overt diabetes, it is known that destructive insulitis has developed for several weeks.

### C-peptide: much more than a byproduct of insulin biosynthesis [^115cbCN7]. Pancreas (2004). Low credibility.

During the past decade, numerous studies in both humans and animals have demonstrated that C-peptide, although not influencing blood sugar control, might play a role in preventing and potentially reversing some of the chronic complications of type 1 diabetes. The aim of this paper is to present an up-to-date review of C-peptide, focusing on its role in insulin biosynthesis and in the classification of diabetes mellitus, as well as its potential clinical applications.

- **Methods and results**: The relevant literature cited in the MEDLINE database shows that the measurement of C-peptide production combined with screening for the presence of islet-cell and other autoantibodies seems to exert an important role in the accurate differentiation between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Also, both experimental and clinical data provide evidence suggesting that combined replacement of insulin and C-peptide has potential therapeutic value in patients with type 1 diabetes.

- **Conclusions**: Further study in this area is warranted, but the findings that pancreas transplants promote the reversal of diabetic neuropathy and stabilization of diabetic retinopathy and that both pancreas and islet transplants lead to the reversal of diabetic nephropathy lend credence to the concept that combined replacement of insulin and C-peptide may more effectively mitigate the inexorable progression of diabetes-related complications.

### Proposal for generating new beta cells in a muted immune environment for type 1 diabetes [^117JYLCn]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, many immune tolerance agents have shown promise in the non-obese diabetic mouse model for the prevention and reversal of type 1 diabetes but have not been successful in clinical trials among recently diagnosed type 1 patients. Trials from decades ago using Cyclosporine A, in significantly lower dosages than those used for organ transplantation and in similar dosages that have increased T regulatory cell populations in conditions such as atopic dermatitis, demonstrated very high initial insulin-free remission rates when administered immediately after diagnosis. Over time, all newly diagnosed type 1 patients given Cyclosporine A required insulin. Human trials with immune tolerance agents suggest that in addition to an immune tolerance agent, a beta cell regeneration agent may also be necessary to induce long-lasting remission among patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind prospective trial among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients has been designed using Cyclosporine A and a proton-pump inhibitor, which increases gastrin levels and has been shown to work through the Reg receptor to transform pancreatic duct cells into islets.

### Regulated and reversible induction of adult human β-cell replication [^115KiwK1]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Cdk6 and cyclin D1 can be overexpressed in a dose-dependent manner in human β-cells transduced with tet-inducible adenoviruses. Human islets were transduced with an adenovirus delivering the tet transactivator (Ad.TTA) and either a control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad.GFP) or adenoviruses expressing cdk6 or cyclin D1 under the control of the tet response element (Ad.TRE-cdk6 or Ad.TRE-cyclin D1). Increasing amounts of doxycycline (Dox) (0–1 μg/mL) were added to the medium to define the dose responsiveness of the cdk6 and cyclin D1 expression.

Figure 1 shows that cyclin D1 or cdk6, or both, markedly increased with rising concentrations of Dox, plateauing at 0.1 μg/mL Dox. Close examination indicates that both cdk6 and cyclin D1 were expressed at low levels in the absence of Dox. For example, control (Ad.GFP-transduced) islets expressed 12.2% of the maximal amount of cdk6 expressed by Ad.TRE-cdk6 (with 0.1 μg/mL Dox), whereas Ad.TRE-cdk6 without Dox exposure expressed 23% of the maximum; similarly, Ad.GFP-transduced islets and Ad.TRE-cyclin D1 without Dox expressed 2.7 and 13.9% of maximal cyclin D1 levels, respectively. This suggests some "leakiness" of the TRE promoter, but below levels associated with the activation of proliferation.

### Endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta cells and autoimmune diabetes [^113u2JxP]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells, leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Although multiple attempts have been made to slow the autoimmune process using immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents, there are still no effective treatments that can delay or reverse the progression of type 1 diabetes in humans. Recent studies support endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a novel target for preventing the initiation of the autoimmune reaction, propagation of inflammation, and β cell death in type 1 diabetes. This review highlights recent findings on ER stress in β cells and the development of type 1 diabetes and introduces potential new treatments targeting the ER to combat this disorder.

### Stopping type 1 diabetes: Attempts to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes in man [^112Aqm2B]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Alternatively, other types of existing adult cells may be reprogrammed or transdifferentiated into β-cells. In animal systems, functional insulin-producing cells have been generated from pancreatic α-cells, pancreatic ductal cells, pancreatic acinar cells, and from human liver cells. A recent study generated pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts of patients with type 1 diabetes. In theory, one could envision obtaining such tissue (such as liver) by biopsy, manipulating that tissue in the laboratory to convert it to insulin-producing cells, and then reinfusing them as an autotransplant back into the individual from whom the tissue was obtained.

- **An alternative to external differentiation in vitro**: Stimulate neogenesis or regeneration of insulin-secreting tissue in vivo. Agents that may enhance β-cell function and potentially stimulate repair, regeneration, or neogenesis of β-cells include glucagon-like peptide 1, exenatide, islet neogenesis-associated peptide, and human proislet peptide-2B. They have clearly demonstrated the ability to do so in rodents and/or in vitro. Although the potential for regeneration or neogenesis of β-cells in human beings is still unclear, it should be noted that, in conjunction with adequate immunomodulation, exenatide has been used in individuals receiving a second islet transplant with remarkable success in preserving posttransplant islet function and maintaining insulin independence, especially if the drug is administered also in the peritransplant period and not just when islet function is beginning to decline.

### Autologous umbilical cord blood transfusion in very young children with type 1 diabetes [^113MPDyb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder characterized by T-cell–mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells and lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin administration. At the time of writing, the majority of efforts seeking to ameliorate the autoimmune process and reverse hyperglycemia have focused on the use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs. Although several agents have shown and continue to show promise, no single agent has succeeded in demonstrating long-term success in preventing or reversing type 1 diabetes as a means of standard medical practice.

More recently, efforts have focused on the use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as potential immunoregulatory agents to reverse this disease. Hematopoietic stem cells have successfully been directed in vitro to differentiate into insulin- and C-peptide–producing cells, and infusion of human hematopoietic stem cells into diabetic animals has demonstrated reversal of disease. The potential of such cells to provide a source of safe and effective immunomodulation may be of the greatest importance in treating type 1 diabetes, but this has yet to be realized.

### Tresiba [^116sFDDn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Starting dose in insulin naive patients**: The recommended starting dosage of Tresiba for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder should be administered as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general guideline, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naive patients with type 1 diabetes.

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the recommended starting dose of Tresiba is 10 units once daily.

- **Switching to Tresiba from other insulin therapies**: Dosage adjustments are necessary to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when transitioning patients to insulin degludec from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba should be started at the same unit dose as the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin dose.

For pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba should be initiated at 80% of the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin unit dose to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Developing combination immunotherapies for type 1 diabetes: Recommendations from the ITN-JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Combination Therapy Assessment Group [^114VEWJC]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Like many other complex human disorders of unknown etiology, autoimmune-mediated type 1 diabetes may ultimately be controlled via a therapeutic approach that combines multiple agents, each with differing modes of action. The numerous advantages of such a strategy include the ability to minimize toxicities and realize synergies to enhance and prolong efficacy. The recognition that combinations might offer far-reaching benefits, at a time when few single agents have yet proved themselves in well-powered trials, represents a significant challenge to our ability to conceive and implement rational treatment designs. As a first step in this process, the Immune Tolerance Network, in collaboration with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, convened a Type 1 Diabetes Combination Therapy Assessment Group, the recommendations of which are discussed in this Perspective paper.

### Should tetracycline treatment be used more extensively for rheumatoid arthritis? Metaanalysis demonstrates clinical benefit with reduction in disease activity [^116nLUqN]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). High credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of tetracycline antibiotics versus control (placebo or conventional treatment) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we examined the reduction of disease activity as defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline (1966-February 2002), Embase (1980-February 2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2002 Cochrane Library). Reference lists of published trials were hand-searched for further identification of published reports and presentations at scientific meetings. Randomized controlled trials comparing tetracyclines to control (placebo or conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic therapy) were selected for inclusion if at least one of the following outcomes was reported: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count, patient pain score by visual analog scale, patient global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity, eosinophil sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), joint space narrowing and erosions, adverse events, and quality of life as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Subjects were required to have RA as defined by the 1987 ARA criteria.

- **Results**: Ten randomized controlled trials including 535 individuals were reviewed. Only 3 trials were considered high quality; elements of bias could not be excluded in the remainder. Tetracyclines, when administered for ≥ 3 months, were associated with a significant reduction in disease activity in RA, as follows: for TJC, standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.39, 95% CI -0.74.

### Ptpn22 silencing in the NOD model indicates the type 1 diabetes-associated allele is not a loss-of-function variant [^111QEcwB]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

- **Time of treatment**: Determines the effect of Ptpn22 silencing on Teff-cell differentiation. The percentage of CD44ʰⁱ CD62Lˡᵒ (Teff) cells within the CD4⁺ T-cell compartment was quantified in WT, P2, and P4 mice that had either been untreated, treated for 2 months from birth, or treated for 3 months from the age of 6 weeks. Data for CD8⁺ T cells were similar (not shown). Data are averaged (mean ± SEM) for two to six mice per group and are representative of two (doxycycline [dox] from birth) and six (dox from 6 weeks) similar experiments.

- **Cellularity of spleens**: From WT, P2, and P4 mice untreated or treated with dox for 4–5 months from the age of 10 weeks, cellularity is averaged (mean ± SEM) for 14 WT, 5 P2, and 8 P4 mice (untreated groups) and 19 WT, 10 P2, and 9 P4 mice (treated groups).

- **Relative distribution**: Of B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, dendritic cells (DC), and macrophages (Mp) in the spleen of WT and P2 mice, either untreated or treated from the age of 4 weeks for a duration of 4 months. Data are averaged (mean ± SEM) from five mice per group and are representative of four similar experiments.

- **Quantification of naïve and effector cells**: Quantification of naïve (CD44ˡᵒ CD62Lʰⁱ) and effector (CD44ʰⁱ CD62Lˡᵒ) cells in mixed WT and P2 or WT and P4 CD4⁺ T-cell populations before and after (32–35 days) transfer into NOD. Scid mice, with WT and transgenic cells identified based on GFP expression.

- **Percentage of Teff cells**: The percentage of CD44ʰⁱ CD62Lˡᵒ (Teff) cells was quantified in CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells from WT and P2 mice (pretreated with dox for 10 days) 2 days after injection with PBS only or anti-CD3 antibody.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: Report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^111AMsrh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Although long-term safety and tolerability studies have not been performed with doxycycline as a malaria chemoprophylaxis, similar drugs in the same class, tetracycline and minocycline, have been used in equivalent doses (less than 1 g/day for tetracycline, 50 mg/day to 100 mg twice a day for minocycline) for a few months to several years in the treatment of various dermatological conditions. This suggests that doxycycline can be used for long-term malaria chemoprophylaxis. When used at this dosage, tetracyclines were found in some studies to cause no abnormalities in renal and hepatic function when taken for as long as 5 years and in one study, for as long as 13 years.

- **Autoimmune reactions and side effects**: There have been several case reports of minocycline-associated autoimmune hepatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome in persons who used minocycline at 100 mg or more daily for more than 1 year. Of note, doxycycline users were not found to have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity in one matched case-control study. Scleral, dental, and dermal hyperpigmentation has also been reported in patients taking long-term minocycline as early as 1 month after the initiation of treatment, but this hyperpigmentation has been shown to fade after discontinuation of the medication.

- **Study comparison**: In a 2-year, double-blind comparison of minocycline (100 mg twice a day) and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, only 10% of patients withdrew because of rash or GI symptoms. Overall, these case reports and studies observed rare to occasional adverse events associated with the long-term use of other tetracyclines.

### Novel approach for assessing outcomes of type 1 diabetes prevention trials over a fixed time interval [^114mUeH6]. Diabetes (2025). Low credibility.

Challenges in designing time-to-event type 1 diabetes (T1D) prevention trials can lead to negative results, even for treatments that may actually improve disease pathology. We evaluated whether a binary metabolic endpoint for a 12-month change from baseline to one year post-randomization could be useful in T1D prevention trials. This approach detected treatment effects at least as well as standard primary endpoints with shorter follow-up. Fixed interval metabolic endpoints should be used in combination with traditional T1D endpoints to better understand the treatment effects of preventive agents.

### Have we pushed the needle for treatment of type 1 diabetes [^111QNjuQ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Studies with immunologics have shown that the natural history of type 1 diabetes can be modified. These studies have targeted key mediators of the disease, and recent analyses, together with studies in preclinical models, have identified mechanisms that may be involved in the clinical effects. Several issues remain, including the specificity of the interventions, adverse effects of the treatments, and the duration of their effects. Future studies are likely to include more specific approaches with agents such as cell therapies with selected immune regulatory subsets, antigen-specific therapies, and combinations of agents with complementary mechanisms of activity.

### A multicentre, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1% and 3% topical minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea [^115uRKHP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Minocycline is a broad‐spectrum, semisynthetic, second‐generation tetracycline similar to doxycycline and has been reported to have both antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory properties. The tetracycline nucleus consists of four linear‐fused tetracycline rings, with a variety of functional groups attached at different positions. Minocycline has a dimethylamino group at position 7 and no substituents at position 6. Like other tetracyclines, minocycline is bacteriostatic and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis in a reversible manner by preventing the incorporation of amino acid residues into the peptide chain.

Minocycline's anti-inflammatory properties are due to its effects on a wide variety of immune responses. Particularly important in the pathobiology of papulopustular rosacea are the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases in the cathelicidin pathway, the inhibition of immune cell function and infiltration, the reduction of oxidative stress, and the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. These effects could potentially account for the clinical efficacy of tetracycline derivatives in papulopustular rosacea.

The study details the results of a multicentre, randomized, double‐masked, vehicle-controlled study of minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea over a 12-week treatment period.

### Doxycycline-induced hypoglycaemia [^115SmSma]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are widely used drugs that form an integral part of daily prescribing, and serious adverse reactions (SARs) are rarely reported. The frequency of hypoglycaemia complicating tetracycline treatment remains unknown and is not a recognized complication. We describe an 80-year-old man with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes who was recruited into a large research study, and subsequently experienced the unexpected SAR of hypoglycaemia following treatment with doxycycline.

### Repurposing anti-inflammasome NRTIs for improving insulin sensitivity and reducing type 2 diabetes development [^111zoYkb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Alu mobile elements propagate themselves by hijacking the endogenous reverse-transcriptase LINE-1. Notably, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), drugs used to treat HIV-1 and hepatitis B infections, inhibit not only viral reverse-transcriptases but also LINE-1 reverse-transcriptase activity. NRTIs also block inflammasome activation by Alu RNAs and other stimuli, independent of their ability to block reverse-transcriptase. Therefore, we seek to determine whether, among patients with HIV-1 or hepatitis B, there is a relation between exposure to NRTIs and development of type 2 diabetes.

We employ a health insurance claims database analyses approach to examine the link between NRTI use and incident type 2 diabetes. We also investigate the effect of the NRTI lamivudine on insulin resistance in diabetic human adipocytes and myocytes and in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes to obtain experimental evidence in support of the clinical observations. We find that NRTI exposure is associated with reduced development of type 2 diabetes in people and that lamivudine inhibits inflammasome activation and improves insulin sensitivity in experimental systems. These data suggest the possibility of either repurposing this approved class of drugs or exploring less toxic modified NRTIs for treating prediabetes or diabetes.

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: Efficacy and safety [^112TormG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Although it is more convenient for patients to take than first-generation tetracyclines, as it only needs to be taken once or twice a day and can be taken with food, it is more expensive. Concerns have also been expressed over its safety following the deaths of two patients taking the drug. There is a lack of consensus among dermatologists over the relative risks and benefits of minocycline. As most acne prescribing is undertaken by general practitioners, it is important that guidelines issued to them are based on the best available evidence rather than personal judgments.

- **Objectives**: To collate and evaluate the evidence on the clinical efficacy of minocycline in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris. Specific objectives were to compare the efficacy of minocycline with other drug treatments for acne and to collate information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions.

- **Search strategy**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of minocycline for acne vulgaris were identified by searching the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, Biological Abstracts, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Skin Group's Trial Register, Theses Online, BIDS ISI Science Citation Index, National Research Register, Controlled Trials, and BIDS Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Other strategies used were scanning the references of articles retrieved, hand-searching of major dermatology journals, and personal communication.

### Minocycline hydrochloride [^116PMutk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients taking minocycline hydrochloride (minocycline HCl, USP) extended-release tablets should receive the following information and instructions:

- **Use in pregnancy and conception**: Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by pregnant women or women attempting to conceive a child [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1), NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]. It is recommended that minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets not be used by men who are attempting to father a child [see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Patients should be advised that pseudomembranous colitis can occur with minocycline therapy. If patients develop watery or bloody stools, they should seek medical attention.

- **Hepatotoxicity risk**: Patients should be counseled about the possibility of hepatotoxicity. They should seek medical advice if they experience symptoms such as loss of appetite, tiredness, diarrhea, yellowing of the skin, easy bleeding, confusion, and sleepiness.

- **Central nervous system effects**: Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. They should seek medical help for persistent headaches or blurred vision.

- **Contraceptive efficacy**: Use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)].

- **Autoimmune syndromes**: Autoimmune syndromes, including drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis, and serum sickness, have been observed with tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline.

### Type 1 diabetes: translating mechanistic observations into effective clinical outcomes [^113fwHw4]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains an important health problem, particularly in Western countries, where the incidence has been increasing in younger children. In 1986, Eisenbarth described T1D as a chronic autoimmune disease. Over the past three-and-a-half decades, research has identified many of the genetic, immunological, and environmental factors involved in the disease, leading to hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis. Clinical trials have tested these hypotheses, yielding mixed results.

Here, we discuss the findings that have shaped our concepts of the disease mechanisms involved in T1D and the clinical studies these findings have inspired. The results from preclinical and clinical studies support the originally proposed model of T1D development. However, they also suggest that the disease is more complex than initially thought, indicating a need for broader treatment approaches.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114iTwS1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically concerning glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend deintensifying hypoglycemia-causing medications, such as insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides, in patients at high risk for hypoglycemia. Alternatively, switching to a medication class with a lower risk of hypoglycemia is advised. This should be done within individualized glycemic goals. Additionally, diabetes medications should be deintensified if the harms and burdens of the treatment may outweigh the benefits, again considering individualized glycemic goals.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? The role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^111E1Pj4]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

We will take a journey from basic pathogenetic mechanisms elicited by viral infections that play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes to clinical interventions, where we will discuss novel combination therapies. The role of viral infections in the development of type 1 diabetes is a rather interesting topic because in experimental models, viruses appear capable of both accelerating and decelerating the immunological processes leading to type 1 diabetes. Consequently, I will discuss some of the underlying mechanisms for each situation and consider methods to investigate the proposed dichotomy for the involvement of viruses in human type 1 diabetes.

Prevention of type 1 diabetes by infection supports the so-called "hygiene hypothesis". Interestingly, viruses invoke mechanisms that need to be exploited by novel combinatorial immune-based interventions. The first mechanism is the elimination of autoaggressive T-cells attacking the beta-cells, ultimately leading to their immediate but temporally limited amelioration. The second mechanism is the invigoration of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which can mediate long-term tolerance to beta-cell proteins in the pancreatic islets and draining lymph nodes. In combination, these two immune elements have the potential to permanently stop type 1 diabetes. It is my belief that only combination therapies will enable the permanent prevention and curing of type 1 diabetes.

### Umbilical cord blood and type 1 diabetes: A road ahead or dead end [^113rzh2K]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although there is currently no definitive roadmap for utilizing stem cells to reverse type 1 diabetes in children, two promising research discoveries may offer clues for future clinical trials. Recently, Zhao et al. used human umbilical cord blood stem cells to reverse type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Through the development of coculture techniques, nondiabetic human umbilical cord blood stem cells were mixed with NOD mouse spleen cells to generate an unconventional subset of Tregs. These Tregs bore CD4 + CD62L + markers but lacked CD25 + on the cell surface. When injected into diabetic NOD mice, these unconventional Tregs reversed type 1 diabetes 75% of the time and stimulated pancreatic β-cell regeneration. Conventional Tregs, which bear CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + (FoxP3 being a transcription factor indicating functional Tregs) did not exhibit these regenerative properties.

The unconventional CD4 + CD62L + cells could only be derived using purified human cord blood stem cells from healthy donors, not from donors with type 1 diabetes (Y. Zhao, personal communication). Healthy umbilical cord blood appears to contain a critical stem cell population capable of transforming diabetic regulatory cells into regenerative CD4 + CD62L + cells, which can potentially reverse type 1 diabetes. Conversely, umbilical cord blood from individuals who later developed type 1 diabetes lacks this critical stem cell population and may not serve as a viable source of regenerative cells. While extrapolating findings from NOD mouse studies to human scenarios carries certain risks, these insights present a notable step forward in diabetes research.

### Congenic mesenchymal stem cell therapy reverses hyperglycemia in experimental type 1 diabetes [^113GF774]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

A number of clinical trials are underway to test whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in treating various diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Although this cell therapy holds great promise, the optimal source of MSCs has yet to be determined with respect to major histocompatibility complex matching. Here, we examine this question by testing the ability of congenic MSCs, obtained from the NOR mouse strain, to reverse recent-onset type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, as well as determine the immunomodulatory effects of NOR MSCs in vivo.

- **Research design and methods**: NOR MSCs were evaluated with regard to their in vitro immunomodulatory function in the context of autoreactive T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell (DC) generation. The in vivo effect of NOR MSC therapy on reversal of recent-onset hyperglycemia and on immunogenic cell subsets in NOD mice was also examined.

- **Results**: NOR MSCs were shown to suppress diabetogenic T-cell proliferation via PD-L1 and to suppress generation of myeloid/inflammatory DCs predominantly through an IL-6-dependent mechanism. NOR MSC treatment of experimental type 1 diabetes resulted in long-term reversal of hyperglycemia, and therapy was shown to alter diabetogenic cytokine profile, to diminish T-cell effector frequency in the pancreatic lymph nodes, to alter antigen-presenting cell frequencies, and to augment the frequency of the plasmacytoid subset of DCs.

- **Conclusions**: These studies demonstrate the inimitable benefit of congenic MSC therapy in reversing experimental type 1 diabetes. These data should benefit future clinical investigations in this field.

### Induction of chimerism permits low-dose islet grafts in the liver or pancreas to reverse refractory autoimmune diabetes [^116GpsCA]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. A cure for type 1 diabetes will require a reversal of autoimmunity as well as the regeneration or replacement of islet β-cells. Currently, islet transplantation is the only therapy with the potential to reverse refractory late-stage type 1 diabetes in animal models and patients, although hundreds of regimens have been reported to prevent type 1 diabetes, and anti-CD3 therapies have been shown to reverse or ameliorate new-onset type 1 diabetes in mouse models or patients. However, islet transplantation under the Edmonton protocol, which administers immunosuppressants including rapamycin, tacrolimus, and anti-IL-2 mAb, only provides insulin independence for 1 to 2 years in most recipients.

The obstacles that prevent islet transplantation as a curative therapy for refractory late-stage type 1 diabetes include:

1. Chronic rejection of islet grafts mediated by allo- and autoimmunity.

2. Chronic toxicity of immunosuppressants and their impairment of islet graft function and β-cell regeneration.

3. Limited availability of donor islets. For example, under the Edmonton protocol, more than two cadaveric donors are usually required for each recipient, which limits the widespread application of islet transplantation.

4. Lack of an ideal graft site. In clinical islet transplantation, donor islets are usually injected via the portal vein into the liver. Unfortunately, this procedure has shortcomings. First, portal vein injection of islets can cause bleeding.

### Opdivo [^116G8XZa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis, requires monitoring of patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold Opdivo depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Opdivo as a single agent**: Diabetes occurred in 0.9% (17/1994) of patients receiving Opdivo as a single agent, including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions, and two cases of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetes led to the permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in no patients and withholding of Opdivo in 0.1% of patients.

	- No patients (0/17) with diabetes required systemic corticosteroids. Diabetes resolved in 29% of the 17 patients. Of the 2 patients in whom Opdivo was withheld for diabetes, both reinitiated Opdivo after symptom improvement; of these, neither had recurrence of diabetes.

- **Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction**: Opdivo can cause immune-mediated nephritis, which is defined as requiring use of steroids and no clear alternate etiology.

	- **Opdivo as a single agent**: Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 1.2% (23/1994) of patients receiving Opdivo as a single agent, including Grade 4 (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (0.5%), and Grade 2 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction led to permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in 0.3% and withholding of Opdivo in 0.4% of patients.

	- Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (23/23) of patients with nephritis and renal dysfunction. Nephritis and renal dysfunction resolved in 78% of the 23 patients.

### Stopping type 1 diabetes: Attempts to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes in man [^1163yPf3]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Although considerable work remains to be accomplished, the potential to prevent and to cure type 1 diabetes is clearly within reach. The clinical trials necessary to demonstrate this must be well designed, adequately powered, carefully controlled, and vigilantly conducted. Depending on the modality being tested and the population being used for such trials, sample sizes likely will require a collaborative, cooperative, multicenter approach. The diabetes community of scientists, clinical trialists, patients, families, funding agencies, and regulatory agencies must work together in a cooperative and collegial manner if we are to be successful in our efforts to prevent and cure type 1 diabetes.

Approaches that are more aggressive than those used in the past, including combination approaches and novel interventions, will likely be needed. Despite impediments, the progress in recent years has been greater than in preceding decades, and together, we are uniquely poised to address existing challenges and conquer type 1 diabetes.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? The role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^112mtzPx]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

What are our perspectives on treating or preventing type 1 diabetes, and what are the projected timelines? The most basic approach, and also the ultimate goal, is to tackle the disease at its root and eliminate the cause of type 1 diabetes. This could theoretically occur through genetic modification of the genes that predispose an individual to type 1 diabetes or the products of those genes, as well as by eliminating environmental factors, such as those being studied in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) trial.

This approach has proven to be very complicated, as it has become clear over the past two decades that type 1 diabetes is a polygenic and multifactorial disease. We now know that many genes, both protective and enhancing, contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, which makes it exceedingly difficult to therapeutically modify all of their products in a suitable way.

From the studies of George Eisenbarth, it is clear that in addition to genetic predisposition, other environmental factors are also implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Among these factors, viral infections are of significant interest, and their potential roles will be discussed later. It is therefore possible that multiple and unique pathways can lead to type 1 diabetes, and that the pathogenesis of the disease is heterogeneous in nature.

Thus, eliminating or modifying all of the factors that cause type 1 diabetes will be difficult unless the field can focus on a few key molecules.

- **Loqtorzi as a single agent**: Diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.9% (8/851) of patients receiving Loqtorzi, including Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.7%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation in 0.4% of patients. Six of the 8 (75%) patients with diabetes mellitus required long-term insulin therapy.

- **Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction**:
	- **Loqtorzi in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine**: This combination can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.7% (1/146) of patients receiving Loqtorzi. The one patient with Grade 4 immune-mediated nephritis required systemic corticosteroids, and nephritis led to the discontinuation of Loqtorzi. Nephritis resolved in this patient.

### It's time to consider changing the rules: The rationale for rethinking control groups in clinical trials aimed at reversing type 1 diabetes [^11284WR5]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

In some ways, it is difficult to imagine that more than a quarter-century has passed since the earliest attempts to reverse type 1 diabetes through immune modulation saw their genesis. Sadly, despite the performance of a multitude of clinical trials during this time period, ranging from single case studies to large multicenter collaborative efforts, no agent or methodology has been identified as a proven means for reversing this disorder in a setting meaningful to public health care delivery. These efforts, like those seeking to prevent the disorder before its symptomatic onset, have not been devoid of scientific benefit as many intellectual gains have been realized through their performance. This includes improvements in assays for immunologic and metabolic biomarkers of disease (e.g. autoantibodies, C-peptide), standardization of tests for metabolic function, the organization of large collaborative networks (e.g. National Institutes of Health [NIH] TrialNet and Immune Tolerance Network), as well as an improved understanding of the natural history of type 1 diabetes; many facets of which have been reported over the years within the pages of Diabetes.

To be clear, clinical trials seeking the reversal of type 1 diabetes are tough to perform for reasons large in number and diverse in nature. Often, a therapeutic agent can be difficult to obtain from a pharmaceutical entity (especially if it is in the early stages of development), and even when available, it can be cost-prohibitive. Beyond this, costs for laboratory testing, patient care, travel, and mechanistic studies add further challenges.

### Tetracycline hydrochloride [^111UzwAk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma protein in varying degrees. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations in a biologically active form.

- **Microbiology**: Tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis through binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Tetracycline is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The drugs in the tetracycline class have closely similar antimicrobial spectra, and cross-resistance among them is common. Tetracycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections, as described in the indications and usage section of the package insert.

	- **Gram-negative bacteria**
	- **Gram-positive bacteria**
	- **Anaerobes**
	- **Other bacteria**

### It's time to mow the GRAS in type 1 diabetes [^115LV4ft]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Significant large-scale efforts have taken place over the last decade in an attempt to prevent and reverse type 1 diabetes (e.g. National Institutes of Health [NIH] TrialNet, Immune Tolerance Network, European Nicotinamide Diabetes Intervention Trial). While such efforts have resulted in improvements in our knowledge of the natural history of the disease (both immunological and metabolic), and there is certainly cause for optimism that one form of therapy may eventually cure the disorder, the sobering reality is that no means exists today to practically or with assurance reverse type 1 diabetes.

Yet, with research emphasis on intervening in new-onset patients, a continuing "numbers" problem exists — one that has been largely ignored but deserves attention. Nearly all studies seeking to reverse type 1 diabetes require patients to be enrolled and subject to treatment within a 3-month window from the time of diagnosis. Based on NIH SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study data, approximately 18,000 individuals under age 20 years are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. each year, meaning that at any point in time only an estimated 4,500 individuals are trial-eligible.

It could be considered remarkable, in a way, that so much of our clinical trial efforts to halt progression of type 1 diabetes are directed at this exclusive (and quite small) group when perhaps as many as 1.5 million individuals in the U.S. live with established disease — a population for which little cure-focused research is afforded, outside of islet and/or pancreas transplantation, which is indicated for an

### Tresiba [^116skxLz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In open-label adult clinical trials of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as in the open-label pediatric clinical trial of patients with type 1 diabetes, percentages of adult and pediatric patients randomized to Tresiba who experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia are discussed [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Adults with type 2 diabetes are referenced in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Severe hypoglycemia in the open-label trials with adult patients was defined as an episode requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. In the pediatric trial, severe hypoglycemia was characterized by an altered mental status where the child could not assist in their own care, was semiconscious or unconscious, or in a coma with or without convulsions, potentially requiring parenteral therapy such as glucagon or intravenous glucose. A hypoglycemia episode was defined as either a severe hypoglycemia episode or an episode where a laboratory or self-measured glucose calibrated to plasma was less than 56 mg/dL, or where a whole blood glucose was less than 50 mg/dL, regardless of the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms.

### Inhibition of caspase-1 with tetracycline ameliorates acute lung injury [^113nH2rB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous syndrome with a mortality rate of up to 40%. Precision medicine approaches that target patients based on their molecular phenotypes of ARDS might help identify effective pharmacotherapies. The inflammasome-caspase-1 pathway contributes to the development of ARDS via IL-1β and IL-18 production. Recent studies indicate that tetracycline can be used to treat inflammatory diseases mediated by IL-1β and IL-18, although the molecular mechanism by which tetracycline inhibits inflammasome-caspase-1 signaling remains unknown.

Objectives: To identify patients with ARDS characterized by IL-1β and IL-18 expression and investigate the ability of tetracycline to inhibit inflammasome-caspase-1 signaling in ARDS.

Methods: IL-1β and IL-18 concentrations were quantified in BAL fluid from patients with ARDS. Tetracycline's effects on lung injury and inflammation were assessed in two mouse models of direct (pulmonary) acute lung injury. Its effects on IL-1β and IL-18 production were assessed by alveolar leukocytes from patients with direct ARDS ex vivo. Murine macrophages were used to further characterize the effect of tetracycline on the inflammasome-caspase-1 pathway.

Measurements and main results: BAL fluid concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 are significantly higher in patients with direct ARDS than those with indirect (nonpulmonary) ARDS. In experimental acute lung injury, tetracycline significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary inflammation by selectively inhibiting caspase-1-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 production.

### Congenic mesenchymal stem cell therapy reverses hyperglycemia in experimental type 1 diabetes [^1112oHv2]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The incidence of type 1 diabetes is steadily rising at a global level, and the most common form of intervention seeking to reverse the disease in recently diagnosed patients has been that of immunosuppression through the use of agents such as anti-CD3. However, as immunosuppressive regimens are commonly associated with acute morbidity, novel treatments to reduce the burden of immunosuppression are in dire need of development. MSC therapy is one such treatment modality that, because of the considerable immunomodulatory effects of these cells, has shown promising results in treating autoimmune diseases and has the potential to serve as a component of combination therapy to reduce immunosuppressive regimen morbidity.

Whereas MSCs are capable of differentiating into a number of mesenchymal cell lineages, hematopoietic stem cells are multipotent stem cells that give rise to all cells in the blood and have been shown to have immunomodulatory roles as well; indeed, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes has resulted in improved β-cell function. Clinical trials examining the effects of MSC therapy have also been initiated for a multitude of disorders, including type 1 diabetes. However, type 1 diabetes trials have been initiated with a paucity of preclinical data, which are necessary to determine the type and course of MSC therapy as well as to elucidate the mechanisms by which MSCs exert their immunomodulatory effects. We and others have previously demonstrated the benefit of MSC therapy in the specific setting.

### Regulated and reversible induction of adult human β-cell replication [^111g6SgT]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Induction of proliferation in adult human β-cells is challenging. It can be accomplished by the introduction of cell cycle molecules such as cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and cyclin D1, but their continuous overexpression raises oncogenic concerns. We attempted to mimic normal, transient, perinatal human β-cell proliferation by delivering these molecules in a regulated and reversible manner. Adult cadaveric islets were transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible adenoviruses expressing CDK6 or cyclin D1. The end points were CDK6/cyclin D1 expression and human β-cell proliferation, survival, and function. Increasing doses of Dox led to marked dose- and time-related increases in CDK6 and cyclin D1, accompanied by a 20-fold increase in β-cell proliferation. Notably, Dox withdrawal resulted in a reversal of both CDK6 and cyclin D1 expression as well as β-cell proliferation. Re-exposure to Dox reinduced both CDK/cyclin expression and proliferation. β-cell function and survival were not adversely affected. The adenoviral tetracycline (tet)-on system has not been used previously to drive human β-cell proliferation. Human β-cells can be induced to proliferate or arrest in a regulated, reversible manner, temporally and quantitatively mimicking the transient perinatal physiological proliferation that occurs in human β-cells.

### The tetracycline resistome is shaped by selection for specific resistance mechanisms by each antibiotic generation [^1144gAv6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Since their discovery in the 1940s, the tetracycline family of antibiotics has been intensively used in agriculture and clinical settings. These drugs inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosome subunit, preventing the accommodation of incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs. Tetracyclines are type II polyketides composed of a four-ring (tetra-) scaffold (cycl-). First-generation tetracyclines include the naturally occurring chlortetracycline (1948), oxytetracycline (1950), and tetracycline (1953).

Over the decades, to overcome resistance to existing tetracyclines, the core tetracycline scaffold has been modified with a variety of functional groups to improve ADME-Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), efficacy, and spectrum of activity. These semi-synthetic and fully synthetic derivatives are referred to as second- and third-generation tetracyclines, respectively. The second-generation tetracyclines include minocycline (1961), metacycline (1962), and doxycycline (1967). Third-generation tetracyclines (i.e.g.lycylcyclines) are the most recently developed and include tigecycline (reported 1993, FDA-approved 2005), omadacycline (reported 2013, FDA-approved 2018), and eravacycline (reported 2013, FDA-approved 2018). These later-generation drugs were intentionally optimized for activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, and tigecycline is currently reserved as an antibiotic of last resort.

The history of tetracycline resistance in human pathogens has been characterized by cycles where new generations of tetracyclines have alternately emerged to counteract existing resistance mechanisms.

### Strategies to prevent type 1 diabetes [^113Vvvhj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting from T cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing cells in the islets of Langerhans. Its primary cause remains unknown, but it has been established that the clinical presentation is preceded by a long prodrome. This prodrome enables individuals at high risk of the disease to be identified and offers the possibility of intervention to prevent clinical disease. Many groups are working in this field, concentrating on manipulation of environmental exposures that are potential triggers of autoimmunity and on immunomodulation strategies that aim to prevent the destruction of beta-cells. Some interventions have shown promising results in early trials, but effective disease prevention remains elusive. This article reviews progress in the field.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^114WDCTH]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Screening for type 1 diabetes generally reveals that individuals present with acute symptoms and significantly elevated blood glucose levels. Most cases are diagnosed soon after the onset of hyperglycemia. Evidence from type 1 prevention studies suggests that the measurement of islet autoantibodies can identify individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing may be appropriate for high-risk individuals, including those with prior transient hyperglycemia or relatives with type 1 diabetes, particularly within the context of clinical research studies.

Widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic low-risk individuals cannot currently be recommended, as it would identify very few at-risk individuals in the general population. Those who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes. Clinical studies are underway to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes or reversing early-stage type 1 diabetes in individuals with evidence of autoimmunity.

### Population response to information on reversibility of type 2 diabetes [^114zzPKJ]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Following the publication of the Counterpoint Study, which focused on the reversibility of type 2 diabetes using a very low energy diet, public interest surged, prompting the authors to provide general information about reversing diabetes on a website. In response to this information, individuals shared their personal experiences in attempting to reverse their diabetes. This study collates information on the effects of energy restriction in motivated individuals with type 2 diabetes, achieved outside a research setting.

- **Methods**: Emails, letters, and telephone communications received between July 2011 and September 2012 were evaluated, comprising 77 participants (66 men, 11 women). The median duration of diabetes among participants was 5.5 years, with a range from 3 months to 28 years. Reversal of diabetes was defined as achieving fasting capillary blood glucose levels…

### Tresiba [^113n1vc1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: In clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)], a total of 75 (7%) of the 1,102 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 1 diabetes had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 1 (0.1%) had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². A total of 250 (9%) of the 2,713 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and no subjects had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

In the safety outcomes trial (DEVOTE), a total of 1,429 (37.4%) of the 3,818 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 108 (2.8%) subjects had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Differences in safety or effectiveness were not observed in the subgroup analyses.

No clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of TRESIBA was identified in a study comparing healthy subjects and subjects with kidney impairment, including subjects with end-stage kidney disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, as with all insulin products, glucose monitoring should be intensified, and the TRESIBA dosage adjusted on an individual basis in patients with kidney impairment.

### Ribosome-targeting antibiotics impair T cell effector function and ameliorate autoimmunity by blocking mitochondrial protein synthesis [^112KLQSf]. Immunity (2021). High credibility.

It is well established that some ribosome-targeting antibiotics (RAbos) can inhibit mitoribosomes, and some have been described as immunosuppressive. For example, chloramphenicol diminishes neutrophil extracellular trap release, and doxycycline inhibits B cell class switching and IgM secretion. However, the mechanism by which the reduction of immune cell function occurs is not well understood. We have shown here that inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by antibiotics can reduce Th cell cytokine secretion.

Certain clinical observations suggest that linezolid is immunosuppressive: as previously mentioned, linezolid treatment confers an increased risk of fungal and Gram-negative infections. Th17 cell function is necessary for mounting antifungal and antibacterial responses. As linezolid is active exclusively against Gram-positive bacteria, we postulated that linezolid facilitates opportunistic fungal or Gram-negative infections by dampening Th17 cell function. Importantly, we found linezolid to inhibit both mitochondrial translation and Th17 cell function in vitro at concentrations routinely achieved during clinical administration. We also showed that linezolid prevented the development of self-reactive T cells in the T cell-mediated autoimmunity EAE model. Thus, repurposing linezolid as an immunosuppressive drug resulted in significant protection from pathogenic T cell infiltration and led to absent (or mild) EAE symptoms. However, future studies will be necessary to determine if T cell suppression by linezolid contributes to the progression of infections.

### Tresiba [^116UsMoz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)], a total of 77 (7%) of the 1,102 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 1 diabetes were 65 years or older, and 9 (1%) were 75 years or older. A total of 670 (25%) of the 2,713 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were 65 years or older, and 80 (3%) were 75 years or older. Differences in safety or effectiveness were not suggested in subgroup analyses comparing subjects older than 65 years to younger subjects.

In the safety outcomes trial (DEVOTE), a total of 1,983 (52%) of the 3,818 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were 65 years or older, and 381 (10%) were 75 years or older. Differences in safety or effectiveness were not observed in these subgroup analyses.

Nevertheless, greater caution should be exercised when TRESIBA is administered to geriatric patients since greater sensitivity of some older individuals to the effects of TRESIBA cannot be ruled out. The initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia, as hypoglycemia may be more difficult to recognize in geriatric patients.

### Congenic mesenchymal stem cell therapy reverses hyperglycemia in experimental type 1 diabetes [^117Us4Eo]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

A number of clinical trials are underway to test whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in treating various diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Although this cell therapy holds great promise, the optimal source of MSCs has yet to be determined with respect to major histocompatibility complex matching. Here, we examine this question by testing the ability of congenic MSCs, obtained from the NOR mouse strain, to reverse recent-onset type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, as well as determine the immunomodulatory effects of NOR MSCs in vivo.

- **Research design and methods**: NOR MSCs were evaluated with regard to their in vitro immunomodulatory function in the context of autoreactive T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell (DC) generation. The in vivo effect of NOR MSC therapy on the reversal of recent-onset hyperglycemia and on immunogenic cell subsets in NOD mice was also examined.

- **Results**: NOR MSCs were shown to suppress diabetogenic T-cell proliferation via PD-L1 and to suppress generation of myeloid/inflammatory DCs predominantly through an IL-6-dependent mechanism. NOR MSC treatment of experimental type 1 diabetes resulted in long-term reversal of hyperglycemia. Therapy was shown to alter the diabetogenic cytokine profile, diminish T-cell effector frequency in the pancreatic lymph nodes, alter antigen-presenting cell frequencies, and augment the frequency of the plasmacytoid subset of DCs.

- **Conclusions**: These studies demonstrate the inimitable benefit of congenic MSC therapy in reversing experimental type 1 diabetes. These data should benefit future clinical approaches.

### Tetracyclines: nonantibiotic properties and their clinical implications [^1169nqPd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics that function at the ribosomal level to interfere with protein synthesis. These antibiotics gained popularity among dermatologists in the early 1950s due to their effectiveness in treating acne. More recently, research has explored their biologic actions, which include effects on inflammation, proteolysis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metal chelation, ionophoresis, and bone metabolism.

The therapeutic effects of tetracycline and its analogues have been investigated in various diseases such as rosacea, bullous dermatoses, neutrophilic diseases, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, aortic aneurysms, cancer metastasis, periodontitis, and autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. We examine the nonantibiotic properties of tetracycline and its analogues and their potential for clinical application.
