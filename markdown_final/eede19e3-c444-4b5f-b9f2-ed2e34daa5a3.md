## Question

R breast ulcer with -Moderate Morganella morganii isolated - how should I treat? what is morganella morganii?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat a breast ulcer with Morganella morganii and what Morganella morganii is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's intrinsic and inducible resistance patterns and how they shape empiric choices. Then, I should assess the clinical context of a breast ulcer as a skin and soft tissue infection and the need for source control. Next, I will outline empiric and targeted antibiotic strategies while avoiding agents with intrinsic resistance or high induction risk. After that, I need to discuss culture acquisition, de-escalation to oral therapy, and duration with monitoring. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like hardware and biofilm, and close with stewardship and prevention considerations.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and baseline resistance profile, because that will anchor safe empiric therapy. Morganella morganii is an Enterobacterales species within the Proteeae tribe that exhibits basal AmpC beta-lactamase production, conferring intrinsic resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins; cefazolin labeling explicitly notes most M. morganii isolates are resistant, which I should not overlook [^1178bwyF] [^1167m6Ha].

> Hold on, I should verify inducible resistance risk during therapy, since that can convert an initially susceptible profile into clinical failure. M. morganii can derepress AmpC during exposure to third-generation cephalosporins, with clinical reports of on-therapy resistance emergence; thus, even if initial testing shows susceptibility, prolonged therapy with third-generation cephalosporins risks selection of resistant subpopulations [^1178bwyF] [^111nyiuN].

> Next, I will examine the clinical context: a breast ulcer generally falls under skin and soft tissue infection where systemic antibiotics are indicated for moderate infections and where timely source control is essential. I need to ensure there is assessment for necrotic tissue, sinus tracts, abscess, or undermining that would require debridement or drainage, because antibiotics alone are insufficient without addressing infected or devitalized tissue [^115UDGEL] [^117FNMyT].

> For empiric therapy, let me think about covering Gram-negative organisms with AmpC considerations and possible polymicrobial flora while avoiding intrinsically inactive agents. Oral ciprofloxacin can be considered when the patient is stable and local susceptibility is favorable, as ciprofloxacin is FDA-indicated for skin and skin structure infections including those due to Morganella morganii; piperacillin/tazobactam is a reasonable intravenous option when concern for polymicrobial infection or anaerobes exists and in organisms less likely to develop clinically significant AmpC expression compared with Enterobacter spp.; I must avoid ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first/second-generation cephalosporins given intrinsic resistance [^1124dGGj] [^113XuxMz] [^1178bwyF] [^1167m6Ha].

> Hmm, wait a minute, my first instinct is to consider a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone for convenience, but I should double-check induction risk. While ceftriaxone or cefotaxime may test susceptible and can be used briefly in select monitored scenarios, the AmpC derepression risk increases with continued exposure; stewardship guidance emphasizes reassessment by 48 hours and avoiding prolonged third-generation cephalosporin courses when treating AmpC-harboring organisms [^1178bwyF] [^113AY9fb] [^117HaJ8G] [^111nyiuN].

> I will now examine diagnostic steps to ensure we are treating true infection and informing de-escalation. I need to obtain a deep tissue specimen or aspirate from the ulcer base rather than a superficial swab, request full antimicrobial susceptibility testing with MICs, and ensure the lab is aware of AmpC considerations; conventional culture from appropriate tissue sampling remains the recommended approach to identify pathogens in infected wounds [^112couNP] [^116zeWt8].

> Once susceptibilities return, let me tailor therapy and plan an oral step-down if clinically improving. If ciprofloxacin is susceptible, an oral transition is reasonable given demonstrated efficacy in skin infections caused by Morganella; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is another potential oral option when susceptible, whereas continued intravenous therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime may be preferred in more severe disease or if oral absorption is a concern; I should reserve carbapenems for resistant or complicated cases [^1124dGGj] [^112qhAQC] [^1178bwyF] [^1152k7p9].

> Let me consider duration and monitoring, and I should confirm I am aligning with SSTI guidance. For an uncomplicated moderate skin and soft tissue infection without osteomyelitis, a total duration of about 7 to 14 days is typical, with earlier switch to oral therapy when clinically improved; I should reassess the wound at 48 to 72 hours for response and refine therapy based on culture data and clinical trajectory [^115UDGEL] [^113AY9fb].

> But wait, what if there is no improvement by 48 hours or the patient deteriorates? I need to check for occult abscess or necrosis requiring debridement, re-sample for cultures to detect resistance emergence such as AmpC derepression if a third-generation cephalosporin was used, and consider escalation to cefepime or a carbapenem if resistance patterns or clinical severity warrant broader coverage, ideally with infectious diseases consultation [^117FNMyT] [^1178bwyF].

> I should confirm special factors that increase management complexity, especially hardware and biofilm. If the ulcer overlies or communicates with foreign material (e.g., mesh, drains, or other hardware), I need to consider that Morganella can participate in biofilm and that hardware removal may be required for cure; this is particularly relevant in refractory infections where routine debridement and antibiotics fail [^116jnTHs].

> Hold on, I should verify agent-specific pitfalls to avoid suboptimal choices. Tigecycline has unreliable activity against Morganella morganii and should not be relied upon for definitive therapy, and aminoglycosides like tobramycin are active but best reserved as adjuncts in severe infections due to toxicity and limited tissue penetration when used alone [^11721ws3] [^116ThMvG].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention and stewardship steps are explicit. Reviewing the antibiotic course by 48 hours to confirm source control, culture-directed narrowing, and the shortest effective duration helps reduce resistance selection, while standard precautions and local infection prevention policies for multidrug-resistant organisms help minimize spread in healthcare settings [^113AY9fb] [^117RnVZk].

Morganella morganii is a **Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod** in the Enterobacterales, notable for **intrinsic resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first/second-generation cephalosporins** due to inducible AmpC β-lactamase [^1178bwyF]. For a right breast ulcer with moderate M. morganii, start **piperacillin-tazobactam or a third/fourth-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime)**, or a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) if susceptible; avoid ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first/second-generation cephalosporins [^1178bwyF] [^1124dGGj]. Obtain susceptibility testing, debride necrotic tissue, and treat for 10–14 days, adjusting based on response and culture results.

---

## Microbiological characteristics and clinical significance

- **Gram-negative rod**: Facultative anaerobe in Enterobacterales.
- **Normal flora**: Gastrointestinal commensal; opportunistic pathogen.
- **Clinical spectrum**: UTIs, wound/soft tissue infections, bacteremia, and rare osteomyelitis/endophthalmitis [^1178bwyF] [^113sneJe].

---

## Antibiotic resistance profile

- **Intrinsic resistance**: Ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, first/second-generation cephalosporins via inducible AmpC β-lactamase [^1178bwyF].
- **Susceptible agents**: Third/fourth-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime), piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin) [^1178bwyF] [^1124dGGj] [^111KoZyP].
- **Resistance risk**: Inducible AmpC can cause resistance during therapy, especially with third-generation cephalosporins [^111nyiuN].

## Clinical management of breast ulcer infection caused by Morganella morganii

### Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

Perform a **focused clinical assessment** for systemic infection, necrosis, and comorbidities such as diabetes or immunosuppression. Obtain **deep tissue or aspirate cultures** for organism identification and susceptibility testing [^112couNP]. Use **ultrasound or MRI** if deep tissue involvement or osteomyelitis is suspected.

---

### Empiric antibiotic therapy

Given intrinsic resistance, **avoid ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first/second-generation cephalosporins** [^1178bwyF]. Empiric options include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Recommended dose** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | 4.5 g IV every 6–8 hours | - Broad Gram-negative coverage <br/> - Including M. morganii |
| Ceftriaxone | 1–2 g IV every 24 hours | Third-generation cephalosporin |
| Cefepime | 2 g IV every 8–12 hours | Fourth-generation cephalosporin |
| Ciprofloxacin | 400 mg IV every 12 hours or 500–750 mg PO every 12 hours | - Fluoroquinolone <br/> - Oral option if stable |
| Levofloxacin | 750 mg IV/PO daily | - Fluoroquinolone <br/> - Oral option if stable |

---

### Definitive antibiotic therapy

Tailor antibiotic therapy to the **susceptibility results**. Monitor for clinical improvement and adverse effects. Treat for **10–14 days**, extending the duration if deep tissue involvement or osteomyelitis is present.

---

### Adjunctive wound care and surgical management

Perform **debridement** to remove necrotic tissue and **drain any abscesses**. Provide wound care with appropriate dressings and consider **topical antiseptics** such as Dakin's solution or acetic acid for heavily colonized wounds [^112NdENn]. Pursue **surgical intervention** for extensive necrosis or deep infection.

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Track **wound healing**, systemic signs, and potential complications to gauge response. Repeat **cultures** if there is no improvement or infection recurs. Educate the patient on adherence, wound care, and **red-flag symptoms** that require prompt evaluation.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Complications include **bacteremia, sepsis**, chronic infection, delayed healing, and resistance development. Risk factors include **immunosuppression, diabetes**, chronic wounds, prior antibiotics, and healthcare exposure.

---

## Infection control and prevention

Use **standard precautions**, including hand hygiene and personal protective equipment. Implement **contact precautions** for patients with multidrug-resistant organisms. Apply **antimicrobial stewardship** principles with susceptibility-guided therapy to limit resistance.

### Gram-negative folliculitis caused by Morganella morganii [^116xjfh6]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Morganella morganii (MM) is an anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The urinary and hepatobiliary tracts, blood, and skin are the main points of entry. This microorganism is an opportunistic pathogen, usually presenting as a nosocomial infection involving the urinary tract and surgical wounds. However, MM can also present as bacteremia, meningitis, ecthyma gangrenosum, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cellulitis, chorioamnionitis, septic arthritis, endophthalmitis, and cutaneous abscess. Here, we present a case of gram-negative folliculitis (GNF) caused by MM.

### Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection [^112kYWFH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection is a potentially devastating complication of anti-VEGF injections. Post-injection endophthalmitis due to Enterococcus faecalis is rare, and no previous case of Morganella morganii endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection has been reported.

- **Case presentation**: We present the first reported case of Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection in an immunocompetent patient in the absence of recent ocular surgery. Our patient presented with hand movement visual acuity one day after anti-VEGF injection and demonstrated no clinical improvement despite repeated intravitreal ceftazidime and vancomycin injections. A decision was made to proceed with early vitrectomy given the failure of intravitreal antibiotics. Visual acuity improved to 6/90 at 12 weeks after vitrectomy without any evidence of disease recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Post-injection endophthalmitis due to Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis infections can have visually devastating consequences despite repeated empirical and targeted intravitreal antibiotics. Lack of clinical improvement following intravitreal antibiotics should warrant consideration of early vitrectomy. Our experience is a pertinent reminder of the ever-growing threat of uncommon and multi-resistant bacteria that must be considered when treating infections such as post-injection endophthalmitis.

### Tobramycin [^112AqXCL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

- **Mechanism of action**: Tobramycin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal.

- **Interactions with other antibiotics**: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of Enterococcus faecalis. However, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, e.g. Enterococcus faecium. Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized.

- **Cross-resistance**: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur.

Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections:

- **Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms**:
	- Staphylococcus aureus

- **Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms**:
	- Citrobacter sp
	- Enterobacter sp
	- Escherichia coli
	- Klebsiella sp
	- Morganella morganii
	- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
	- Proteus mirabilis
	- Proteus vulgaris
	- Providencia sp
	- Serratia sp

Aminoglycosides have a low potential for cross-resistance.

### Population-based laboratory surveillance for tribe Proteeae isolates in a large Canadian health region [^116TsdAY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

The tribe Proteeae comprises the genera Proteus, Morganella, and Providencia. Few studies have specifically investigated the epidemiology of infections caused by the Proteeae, and none have been conducted in a large non-selected population. The present study was a population-based laboratory surveillance in the Calgary Health Region (population 1.2 million), Canada, during 2000–2005, that aimed to define the incidence, demographical risk factors for acquisition, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of Proteeae isolates.

In total, 5,047 patients were identified from whom Proteeae isolates were obtained (an annual incidence of 75.9/100,000), with females and the elderly being at highest risk. Incidence rates were 64.8, 7.7, and 3.4/100,000/year for the genera Proteus, Morganella, and Providencia, respectively. Overall, 85% of infections were community-onset, and the overall rate of bacteremic disease was 2.0/100,000. Compared with other species, Proteus mirabilis occurred at a much higher frequency, especially among females, and was less likely to be isolated from hospital-onset infections or to be part of a polymicrobial infection. Among isolates from community-onset infections, Providencia spp. were less likely to be from outpatients and more likely to be from nursing home residents.

There were low overall rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (4%) and gentamicin (5%), with Prot. mirabilis generally being the most susceptible. Members of the Proteeae were isolated frequently in both community and hospital settings but were infrequent causes of invasive disease.

### Are quantitative bacterial wound cultures useful [^112FXsgW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Determining if a non-healing wound is infected can be difficult. The surface of a wound is not sterile and can be colonized with numerous commensal, environmental, and potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Different types of wounds have various clinical presentations, with some signs and symptoms more likely to be present than others depending on the type and location of the wound. Clinicians often order microbiology wound cultures to assist in determining if a non-healing wound is infected. This minireview briefly summarizes the clinical microbiology of wound cultures, with an emphasis on the history and utility (or lack thereof) of the quantitative wound culture.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^114ccUkQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cefuroxime axetil is a bactericidal agent acting through inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It demonstrates activity in the presence of some β-lactamases, including both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, found in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

Resistance to cefuroxime axetil is primarily mediated by hydrolysis through β-lactamase, alterations of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), decreased permeability, and bacterial efflux pumps. The susceptibility of bacteria to cefuroxime axetil can vary by geography and time, so consulting local susceptibility data is recommended, if available. Notably, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains of H. influenzae should be considered resistant to cefuroxime axetil.

Cefuroxime axetil is active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

- **Aerobic bacteria**:
	- **Gram-positive bacteria**:
		- Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)
		- Streptococcus pneumoniae
		- Streptococcus pyogenes
	- **Gram-negative bacteria**:
		- Escherichia coli a
		- Klebsiella pneumoniae a
		- Haemophilus influenzae
		- Haemophilus parainfluenzae
		- Moraxella catarrhalis
		- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
- aMost extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenemase-producing isolates are resistant to cefuroxime axetil.

- **Spirochetes**:
	- Borrelia burgdorferi

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro response.

### Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection [^1152k7p9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

The patient was reviewed again the next day, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the left eye (LE) had declined to perception of light (PL) without projection, with the patient reporting increasing ocular discomfort. Conjunctival injection was persistent, and dense stromal edema with Descemet's membrane folds (DMFs) were observed on corneal examination. The hypopyon had increased to 3.0 mm, and free-floating fibrin in the anterior chamber (AC) was obscuring the intraocular lens (IOL). Vitreous aspirate cultures now showed growth of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Morganella morganii (M. morganii). Consequently, a decision was made to repeat intravitreal injection with the same doses of ceftazidime and vancomycin, along with an additional 0.1 mL (0.4 mg) of dexamethasone. The patient was also commenced on oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily and hydrocortisone acetate 1% ointment at night to the LE. Prednisolone acetate drops were reduced to 2-hourly for the LE.

She was reviewed daily over the next two days without any improvement in LE BCVA and had a persistent 3.0 mm hypopyon with no posterior segment view (Figure 1.a shows left eye). The right eye (RE) remained unremarkable. By this stage, antimicrobial sensitivities revealed that E. faecalis was sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin, whereas M. morganii was sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Upon discussion with the patient, a decision was made to proceed with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), as there was no clinical improvement despite multiple intravitreal antibiotics.

### Piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for Enterobacterales: Recommendations from the United States Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [^113XuxMz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The USCAST recommendation was also informed by the negative signals observed in the pilot (n = 72), multicenter, randomized, open-label trial that compared TZP with meropenem for the definitive treatment of bloodstream infections caused by AmpC β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (MERINO-2). Overall, no significant difference in the primary composite failure outcome (30-day mortality, clinical failure, microbiological failure, or microbiological relapse) was observed between treatment groups. However, 53% of patients in the trial were infected with Enterobacterales that are unlikely to develop clinically significant AmpC expression (i.e. Citrobacter braakii, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia spp., or Serratia spp.). Among the subgroup of 32 patients with infections due to Enterobacterales with a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production (i.e. Enterobacter spp.), a nonsignificantly higher proportion of patients in the TZP arm met the primary composite failure outcome (28% vs 7%, respectively; p = 0.14).

These findings were consistent with those from a recent observational study that demonstrated significantly higher treatment failure rates among patients who received piperacillin ± tazobactam relative to those who received a carbapenem or cefepime for definitive treatment of wild-type AmpC β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales bloodstream infections or pneumonia. In this study, > 75% of patients in the piperacillin group were infected with an Enterobacterales with a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production.

### Bilateral Morganella morganii keratitis in a patient with facial topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis: a case report [^111KoZyP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are being widely misused on the face without a prescription from dermatologists in China. Although the misuse of topical corticosteroid-containing preparations on the face and the adverse effects due to their application have been reported, this is the first report of corneal infection associated with facial corticosteroid usage. We suggest that the dispensing of corticosteroids must be regulated in China.

Morganella morganii is a Gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family and is considered an unusual opportunistic pathogen that mainly causes post-operative wound and urinary tract infections. This species is a rare cause of ocular and periocular infections, such as endophthalmitis and orbital abscess. Only a few cases of keratitis secondary to Morganella morganii have been reported. In our case, facial topical steroids might induce ocular immunosuppression, thereby making corneas vulnerable to infection by opportunistic pathogens. Morganella morganii is considered a significant opportunistic pathogen because of its increased levels of resistance and virulence.

This organism is related to the genera Proteus and Providencia and has a unique antibiotic sensitivity profile, with natural resistance to penicillins, some cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, and others. However, it is sensitive to specific agents, including aminoglycosides, piperacillin, third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and quinolones. In our case, the organism responded well to quinolones.

### Intrinsic resistance to colistin in the genus [^112fVozt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

A bacterial species is considered intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial when nearly all of the wild-type isolates (i.e. those without acquired resistance) exhibit minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values that are sufficiently high to render susceptibility testing unnecessary, meaning the antimicrobial should not be considered for therapy. Knowledge of intrinsic resistance influences both the selection of treatment regimens and the approach to susceptibility testing in the clinical laboratory. Unexpected results assist in recognizing microbial identification or susceptibility testing errors.

Previously, limited data suggested that Hafnia spp. may be intrinsically resistant to colistin. We evaluated the in vitro activity of colistin against 119 Hafniaceae isolates from human samples: 75 (63%) from routine clinical cultures and 44 (37%) from stool samples of travelers screened for antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Broth microdilution colistin MICs were ≥ 4 μg/mL for 117 of 119 (98%) isolates. Whole-genome sequencing of 96 of the isolates demonstrated that the colistin-resistant phenotype was not lineage-specific. Two of the 96 (2%) isolates harbored mobile colistin resistance genes. Compared to whole-genome sequencing, VITEK MS matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and VITEK 2 GN ID failed to consistently distinguish between Hafnia alvei, Hafnia paralvei, and Obesumbacterium proteus. In conclusion, using a reference antimicrobial susceptibility testing method and…

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: A case report and literature review [^115H2A1f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Morganella morganii is a facultative, anaerobic rod gram-negative enteric bacterium. Few cases of musculoskeletal infection are documented. We present a case of a 9-year-old boy with osteomyelitis one year after the index external fixation for leg length discrepancy. The patient initially presented with wound drainage at his distal medial tibia fixation site but had negative radiographs. Initial antibiotic treatment failed following a one-month follow-up, and cultures revealed M. morganii. He underwent incision and drainage with external fixator removal, and the antibiotic regimen was changed following a susceptibility panel. Symptoms were alleviated after 30 days with the new antibiotic regimen, and the patient was put back on his original schedule for limb lengthening through external fixation. A new methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection occurred at the same site 2.5 years later but was easily treated. The three-year follow-up showed no other recurrences or complications.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^112KhpER]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of burn injuries, particularly in the context of infection prevention, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend routine monitoring of the microbial profile of burn wound colonization. Additionally, they advise assessing the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of microorganisms implicated in burn wound infections and tracking trends in the nosocomial spread of these pathogens in burn centers.

### Cefotaxime [^117HaJ8G]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cefotaxime sodium is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is active in the presence of certain beta-lactamases, including both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

- **Mechanism of resistance**: Resistance to cefotaxime primarily involves hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Susceptibility to cefotaxime may vary geographically and can change over time; thus, local susceptibility data should be consulted, if available. Cefotaxime has demonstrated efficacy against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections as detailed in the indications and usage section:

- **Gram-positive bacteria**:
	- Enterococcus spp.a
	- Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)
	- Staphylococcus epidermidis
	- Streptococcus pneumoniae
	- Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci)
	- Streptococcus spp. (Viridans group streptococci)

- **Gram-negative bacteria**:
	- Acinetobacter spp.
	- Citrobacter spp.b
	- Enterobacter spp.b
	- Escherichia coli b
	- Haemophilus influenzae
	- Haemophilus parainfluenzae
	- Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella pneumoniae)b
	- Morganella morganii b
	- Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including beta-lactamase-positive and negative strains)
	- Neisseria meningitidis
	- Proteus mirabilis b
	- Proteus vulgaris b
	- Providencia rettgeri b
	- Providencia stuartii b
	- Serratia marcescens b

a Enterococcus species may be intrinsically resistant to cefotaxime.

### Infectious diseases society of America guidance on the treatment of AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections [^1112BPG2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. A previous guidance document focused on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa). Here, guidance is provided for treating AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections.

A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections. Answers are presented as suggested approaches and corresponding rationales. In contrast to guidance in the previous document, published data on the optimal treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections are limited. As such, guidance in this document is provided as "suggested approaches" based on clinical experience, expert opinion, and a review of the available literature.

Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States. Preferred and alternative treatment suggestions are provided, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and options are also covered.

### Multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant and pandrug-resistant bacteria: An international expert proposal for interim standard definitions for acquired resistance [^116A4UH1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections:

- **Definition**: Antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections are difficult-to-treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant isolates are defined as non-susceptible to at least one agent in ≥ 3 relevant antimicrobial categories. Extensively drug-resistant isolates are defined as non-susceptible to at least one agent in all but ≤ 2 relevant antimicrobial categories. Pandrug-resistant isolates are defined as non-susceptible to all relevant agents. Non-susceptibility is determined by in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing and includes results categorized as resistant, intermediate, or non-susceptible.

- **Pathophysiology**: Gram-negative bacteria acquire resistance through several mechanisms, including the production of enzymes (such as β-lactamases, AmpC β-lactamases, extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and carbapenemases) degrading antibiotics, efflux pumps expelling antimicrobial agents from bacterial cells and reducing intracellular drug concentrations, mutations in target sites such as DNA gyrase or ribosomal subunits decreasing drug binding and efficacy, and reduced permeability of the outer membrane, often due to porin loss or modification, limiting antibiotic entry. Horizontal gene transfer via plasmids, transposons, or integrons facilitates the dissemination of resistance genes across bacterial populations.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the US is a growing concern, as these infections pose significant challenges to public health by increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### Multidrug-resistant microorganisms colonizing lower extremity wounds in patients in a tertiary care hospital, Lima, Peru [^112Q24dx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections cause high morbidity, mortality, and incur significant costs to both patients and hospitals. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of MDRO colonization and associated factors in patients with colonization of lower-extremity wounds. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2015 to July 2016 in a tertiary care hospital in Lima, Peru. During the study, wound swabs were obtained for culture and susceptibility testing. MDRO colonization was defined if cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and/or extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) microorganisms. Among the 97 patients enrolled, the frequency of MDRO wound colonization was 26.8%. The most frequently observed MDRO was ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, which was significantly more common in chronic wounds than in acute wounds (17.2% versus 0%, P < 0.05). Infection control measures should be implemented when patients with chronic lower-extremity wounds are admitted.

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: A case report and literature review [^114AwEu9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Morganella morganii is a facultative, anaerobic rod, Gram-negative enteric bacterium. Few cases of musculoskeletal infection are documented. We present a case of a 9-year-old boy with osteomyelitis occurring 1 year after index external fixation for leg length discrepancy. The patient initially presented with wound drainage at his distal medial tibia fixation site, but radiographs were negative. Initial antibiotic treatment failed at the 1-month follow-up, and cultures revealed M. morganii.

He underwent incision, drainage, and removal of the external fixator, after which the antibiotic regimen was adjusted based on a susceptibility panel. Symptoms were alleviated after 30 days with the new antibiotic regimen, allowing the patient to continue with his original schedule for limb lengthening through external fixation. A new methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection occurred at the same site 2.5 years later, but it was easily treated. The 3-year follow-up showed no further recurrences or complications.

- **Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)**: Avycaz (ceftazidime and avibactam), in combination with metronidazole, is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in adult and pediatric patients (at least 31 weeks gestational age). These infections are caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: *Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii complex*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

- **Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis**: Avycaz (ceftazidime and avibactam) is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, in adult and pediatric patients (at least 31 weeks gestational age). These infections are caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: *Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii complex, Proteus mirabilis*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

- **Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP)**: Avycaz (ceftazidime and avibactam) is indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in adult and pediatric patients (at least 31 weeks gestational age). These infections are caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: *Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Haemophilus influenzae*.

### Restore-IMI 1: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing efficacy and safety of imipenem/relebactam vs colistin plus imipenem in patients with imipenem-nonsusceptible bacterial infections [^112j1Vv1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Most mMITT patients achieved a favorable overall response (IMI/REL, 71%; colistin+IMI, 70%; difference, –7.3%; 90% CI, –27.5%, 21.4%). In both arms, most patients with HAP/VAP and cUTI, but none with cIAI, achieved favorable overall response. Among cIAI patients, 1 out of 2 in both arms had unfavorable overall responses due to missing/indeterminate data.

- **Primary and secondary prospective efficacy endpoints**
- **Favorable overall response against P. aeruginosa** was observed in 13/16 (81%) of IMI/REL and 5/8 (63%) of colistin+IMI patients.
- **Response against Enterobacteriaceae**: The rates were 2/5 (40%) and 2/2 (100%), respectively. Of the 3 patients with Enterobacteriaceae and an unfavorable overall response, 1 had cIAI due to C. freundii and 2 cUTI due to K. pneumoniae. The patient with C. freundii (carrying KPC-2, a plasmid-borne AmpC, and TEM-1 β-lactamases) was a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history (rectal carcinoma, small bowel resection, pleural effusions, and emphysema) who died on day 3 due to pneumonia (cIAI not deemed contributory). Both patients with K. pneumoniae (1 carrying KPC-2, 3 different ESBLs, and TEM-1, and the other carrying KPC-3, SHV-11, and TEM-1) had favorable clinical and microbiologic responses at EOT but recurrence at EFU. Neither patient had clinical signs or symptoms associated with the recurring pathogen; these 2 were the only cUTI patients with chronic infections.

### Antimicrobials: A global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^11721ws3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Tigecycline, an antibiotic from the group of the tetracyclines, does not feature in vitro activity against *P. aeruginosa* or certain Enterobacteriaceae (*Proteus* spp., *Serratia* spp., *Morganella morganii*, *Providencia stuartii*). However, it remains a viable treatment option for complicated intra-abdominal infections (IAI) due to its favorable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci, several extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and some strains of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

In several trials, excess mortality was observed in patients treated with tigecycline compared to other drugs. In 12 of 13 phase 3 and 4 comparative clinical trials, all-cause mortality was higher in the tigecycline group versus the comparison group. Study-level and patient-level analyses identified that patients in the hospital-acquired pneumonia trial, particularly those with ventilator-associated pneumonia with baseline bacteremia, were at a higher risk of clinical failure and mortality.

A mortality analysis investigated the association of baseline factors in abdominal infections, including severity of illness at study entry and treatment assignment, with clinical failure and mortality. Mortality modeling identified multiple factors associated with death, which did not include tigecycline and which were forced into the model.

Similarly, attributable mortality among subjects who died of primary infection in the complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) studies showed no difference among treatments. Combined with the four phase 3 and 4 cIAI trials, these demonstrated the non-inferiority of tigecycline to the comparator regimens.

### Neonatal sulfhemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia associated with intestinal Morganella morganii [^1151e1KE]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Sulfhemoglobinemia is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of sulfhemoglobin in the blood. It is typically drug-induced and may cause hypoxia, end-organ damage, and death through oxygen deprivation. This paper presents a case of non-drug-induced sulfhemoglobinemia in a 7-day-old preterm infant complicated by hemolytic anemia. Microbiota compositional analysis of fecal samples to investigate the origin of hydrogen sulphide revealed the presence of Morganella morganii at a relative abundance of 38% of the total fecal microbiota at the time of diagnosis. M. morganii was not detected in the fecal samples of 40 age-matched control preterm infants. M. morganii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause serious infection, particularly in immunocompromised hosts such as neonates. Strains of M. morganii are capable of producing hydrogen sulphide, and virulence factors include the production of a diffusible α-hemolysin.

The infant in this case survived intact through empirical oral and intravenous antibiotic therapy, probiotic administration, and red blood cell transfusions. This coincided with a reduction in the relative abundance of M. morganii to 3%. Neonatologists should have a high index of suspicion for intestinal pathogens in cases of non-drug-induced sulfhemoglobinemia and consider empirical treatment of the intestinal microbiota in this potentially lethal condition.

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: A case report and literature review [^113sneJe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Morganella morganii is a facultative, anaerobic Gram-negative enteric bacterium first isolated in 1906 by Morgan et al. It is a rare opportunistic pathogen most commonly associated with wound, soft tissue, and urinary tract infections. However, there have been reports of more severe infections, including sepsis, ecthyma, endophthalmitis, chorioamnionitis, and pericarditis. The drug resistance of M. morganii has increased over recent years, thereby raising its pathogenicity and leading to clinical treatment failures. Mortality rates are relatively high in some reports.

Osteomyelitis can be caused by a wide variety of pathogens, most commonly various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas. At the time of this literature review, only a handful of documented cases of osteomyelitis secondary to M. morganii have been reported. We describe the clinical course of this infection in a pediatric patient following external fixation surgery for leg length discrepancy at a tertiary health facility.

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: A case report and literature review [^116jnTHs]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In this report, we described a unique case of chronic osteomyelitis caused by the rare pathogen, M. morganii. The results of our case report and literature review can be summarized by three general findings.

- **Radiological imaging**: Morganella may result in subtle changes in the bone matrix, making it difficult to appreciate on radiological imaging. In cases where radiological evidence for osteomyelitis is wanted, advanced imaging such as MRI should be considered.

- **Biofilm production and hardware**: Strains of Morganella have the capability of producing biofilm. In the setting of implanted hardware, Morganella can be refractory to routine debridements and antibiotics. Removal of hardware should be considered for eradication of the pathogen.

- **Treatment**: Treatment for Morganella typically revolves around broad-spectrum antibiotics. Of the limited incidents, cefixime and piperacillin-tazobactam have shown to result in complete resolution.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^113QTEMp]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of burn injuries, particularly concerning topical agents, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend applying a topical antimicrobial agent to most burn wounds. This is crucial because a burn wound infection can have serious consequences, including wound conversion, invasive infection including sepsis, skin graft failure, and prolonged hospitalization.

### Early onset Morganella morganii sepsis in a newborn infant with emergence of cephalosporin resistance caused by depression of AMPC beta-lactamase production [^111nyiuN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A preterm infant with early onset Morganella morganii sepsis was treated with cefotaxime and gentamicin after confirmation of antimicrobial susceptibility. The infant developed persistent ventriculitis caused by the emergence of a cefotaxime-resistant Morganella variant with derepression of its AmpC beta-lactamase. When choosing antibiotic therapy, the risk of development of resistance to cephalosporins should be considered in infections caused by M. morganii and other Gram-negative organisms with inducible AmpC beta-lactamases.

### Chronic wound infection: facts and controversies [^116zeWt8]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic wound infections are responsible for considerable morbidity and significantly contribute to the escalation in the cost of health care. Wound infection may initially manifest as bacterial colonization, and true infection occurs only when colonization is combined with other factors, such as decreased vascular supply, intrinsic virulence of specific bacteria (e.g. *Staphylococcus aureus*), and host immune factors. The microbiology of chronic wounds is complex, and discerning which bacteria are culpable can be challenging. Deep cultures or quantitative biopsies of wound tissue may be necessary. In some instances, such as the presence of certain mycobacteria, the isolation of specific organisms confirms causation.

In many instances, it is appropriate to treat these wounds empirically with a combination of topical antiseptics and systemic antibiotics, especially in the presence of invasive infections.

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: A case report and literature review [^111RXSgC]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

It was decided that the patient should have the intramedullary nail from his original limb-lengthening surgery removed and be treated for chronic osteomyelitis, regardless of radiological evidence (see Figure 1). The patient was sent home on oral clindamycin 150 mg three times daily (TID) but was subsequently switched to oral cefdinir 250 mg/5 mL twice daily (BID) for 30 days for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, in accordance with infectious disease recommendations. Cefdinir was used due to a history of penicillin allergy. One month later, the patient underwent removal of the deep rod implant with no complications.

At 1 and 6 months postoperatively, the patient showed drastic improvement with no incidence of drainage, fever, or limitation of activity. Imaging at 6 months postoperatively showed no changes in his leg length discrepancy at 5.5 cm.

- **Figure 1**: Patient right tibia and ankle radiographs demonstrating the timeline of infection. (A) Lateral and (B) AP radiographs at the time of M. morganii infection demonstrating persistent irregularity to the distal right tibia and an osteotomy gap but with no lucent lesions or signs of osteomyelitis. (C) AP and (D) oblique radiographs 1.4 years after M. morganii infection. (E) AP and (F) lateral radiographs 2.5 years after M. morganii during our patient's methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infection, demonstrating lucency of the distal tibia.

The patient was then continued on his original schedule for fixation for leg length discrepancy, requiring one additional tibia and fibula lengthening.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^112NdENn]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, and more specifically with respect to topical agents, ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend the application of topical antiseptic solutions, such as Dakin's solution and acetic acid, on chronic, heavily colonized, and infected wounds. These agents have broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects, rare antimicrobial resistance, and are effective against biofilms.

### Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection [^111a4oaQ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

First-line management of infectious endophthalmitis generally involves an intravitreal tap and the injection of antimicrobial agents. Our patient experienced no clinical improvement despite two intravitreal injections of ceftazidime and vancomycin. The decision to treat post-injection endophthalmitis with vitrectomy may depend upon the severity of visual acuity impairment and persistent vitritis following tap and inject. Although evidence for early vitrectomy (within 48 hours of presentation) is inconsistent, its role in M. morganii endophthalmitis may be beneficial.

We report the first case of M. morganii endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection in an immunocompetent patient with no recent ocular surgery. Our patient developed symptoms of left eye endophthalmitis 24 hours after intravitreal aflibercept, associated with a rapid deterioration in visual acuity. Early vitrectomy for M. morganii endophthalmitis may be indicated, especially if no improvement is seen within 48 hours of intravitreal antibiotics. Although the visual prognosis of M. morganii and E. faecalis endophthalmitis is poor, our patient's visual outcome at the final follow-up was better than expected.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^114USfuY]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, specifically in the context of managing wound infections, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend initiating topical and systemic antimicrobial agents for the initial treatment of burn wound infections. Urgent surgical excision or debridement should be performed when clinical and/or laboratory evidence indicates invasive burn wound infections.

### Easy-ceft1g [^112wTfPy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, or Serratia marcescens.

- **Acute bacterial otitis media**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains), or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

### Activity of topical antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria recovered from burn patients [^111yJ8Fs]. Burns (2010). Low credibility.

Topical antimicrobials are employed for the prophylaxis and treatment of burn wound infections despite the absence of established susceptibility breakpoints, which have become vital in an era of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. We compared two methods of determining topical antimicrobial susceptibilities.

- **Methods**: Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus (ABC) from burn patients were tested using broth microdilution and agar well diffusion to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zones of inhibition (ZI). Isolates had systemic antibiotic resistance and clonality determined. MDR included resistance to antibiotics in three or more classes.

- **Results**: We assessed 22 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, 20 ABC (75% MDR), 20 P. aeruginosa (45% MDR), and 20 MRSA isolates. The most active agents were mupirocin for MRSA and mafenide acetate for the gram-negatives, with moderate MICs/ZI found with silver sulfadiazene, silver nitrate, and honey. MDR and non-MDR isolates had similar topical resistance, and no clonality was associated with resistance patterns.

- **Conclusion**: Despite several methods to test bacteria for topical susceptibility, no defined breakpoints exist, and standards need to be established. We recommend continuing to use silver products for prophylaxis against gram-negatives and mafenide acetate for treatment, and mupirocin for MRSA.

### Bilateral Morganella morganii keratitis in a patient with facial topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis: A case report [^113jQ2Tf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Bilateral keratitis usually occurs in predisposed individuals, such as contact lens wearers, those suffering from malnutrition or immunodeficiency, or patients undergoing bilateral refractive corneal surgery. It has rarely been reported to develop in the absence of one of the predisposing factors mentioned above. Morganella morganii is a Gram-negative bacillus more commonly reported as a pathogen for panophthalmitis and orbital infection than as a cause of corneal infection. We report here a case of bilateral bacterial keratitis caused by Morganella morganii that developed in a healthy woman with facial topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^115ogxyS]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Vibrio vulnificus infection, particularly in the treatment of cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend administering doxycycline (PO/IV) 100 mg BID for 7–14 days, along with a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftazidime 1–2 g IV/IM every 8 hours, as first-line therapy for patients with Vibrio vulnificus wound infections. Recognize that a single-agent regimen with a fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or gatifloxacin, has been reported to be at least as effective as a regimen with doxycycline and a cephalosporin in animal studies.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^111Q68iC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with ceftriaxone, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be started before obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ceftriaxone for injection, USP, and other antibacterial drugs, ceftriaxone should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

Ceftriaxone for injection, USP, is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, or Serratia marcescens.

- **Acute bacterial otitis media**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains), or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

Note: In one study, lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^112qhAQC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR P. aeruginosa), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document.

- **Methods**: A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-E, AmpC-E, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa, CRAB, and S. maltophilia. Because of differences in the epidemiology of AMR and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of AMR infections in the United States.

- **Results**: Preferred and alternative suggested treatment approaches are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, transitioning to oral therapy, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are discussed briefly. Suggested approaches apply for both adult and pediatric populations, although suggested antibiotic dosages are provided only for adults.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^116ThMvG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Other options include aminoglycosides, particularly for suspected infections by gram-negative bacteria. They are effective against P. aeruginosa but are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria and need association with metronidazole. Because of their toxic side effects, some guidelines do not recommend aminoglycosides for the routine empiric treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (IAI), reserving them for patients with allergies to beta-lactam agents or in combination with beta-lactams for treatment of IAIs with suspected multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria.

Tigecycline is a viable treatment option, especially in empiric therapy for complicated IAIs due to its favorable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci, several ESBL-producing and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. It does not exhibit in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa or P. mirabilis. Caution is always advised for its use in suspected bacteremia and healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The recent challenges of treating multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections, especially in critically ill patients, have renewed interest in the use of "old" antibiotics such as polymyxins and fosfomycin. These are now routinely used for treatment of MDR bacteria in critically ill patients.

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are new antibiotics that have been approved for treatment of complicated IAIs (in combination with metronidazole), including infection by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.

### Antimicrobials: A global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^117EMcng]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotics for treating patients with intra-abdominal infections should be selected based on susceptibility using local antibiogram data to choose optimal antibiotics for the target population. For example, "imipenem/cilastatin" is more active against ampicillin-susceptible enterococci than ertapenem, meropenem, and doripenem. Ciprofloxacin is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than levofloxacin. Some antibiotics are active in synergy with other agents, while others are not active against Proteus, Morganella, Providencia, or Serratia.

Recommended intravenous doses of the most commonly used antibiotics for patients with intra-abdominal infections and normal renal function (CrCl > 90 mL/min) should be considered with the caveat that this table provides general information. The susceptibility profile of individual organisms should be confirmed to guide antimicrobial therapy in all situations. Dosage should be adjusted according to the antibiotic's pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile in each patient. Higher dosages may be used in septic shock situations.

### Assessing clinical microbiology practice guidelines: American Society for Microbiology Committee on Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines Assessment [^112bkLj1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

As part of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines Committee of the Professional Practice Committee, an ad hoc committee was formed in 2014 to assess guidelines published by the committee using an assessment tool, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research Evaluation II (AGREE II). The AGREE II assessment helps reviewers determine whether published guidelines are robust, transparent, and clear in presenting practice recommendations in a standardized manner. Identifying strengths and weaknesses of practice guidelines by ad hoc assessments helps with improving future guidelines through the participation of key stakeholders. This minireview describes the development of the ad hoc committee and results from their review of several ASM best practices guidelines and a non-ASM practice guideline from the Emergency Nurses Association.

### Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection [^112QgVyY]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

This unusual case of post-injection endophthalmitis was caused by *Enterococcus faecalis* and *Morganella morganii*. While *E. faecalis* is very rarely isolated in endophthalmitis following anti-VEGF treatment, this is the first report of post-injection *M. morganii* endophthalmitis.

Acute endophthalmitis is an infrequent complication of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Post-injection etiology represents 8.5% of all endophthalmitis cases, while endophthalmitis following surgery accounts for 31.2%. Coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus* appears to be the most commonly isolated causative organism of post-injection endophthalmitis. Reports of *M. morganii* endophthalmitis in the literature are very rare, occurring almost exclusively after ocular surgery. A single occurrence of *M. morganii* endogenous endophthalmitis has been reported, with no prior cases following anti-VEGF injection. Sterile inflammation following intravitreal injection should also be considered; however, the presence of pain, hypopyon, severe anterior chamber reaction, and significant vision loss can help distinguish infectious from non-infectious endophthalmitis.

*Enterococcus faecalis* is a gram-positive bacterium known to cause severe endophthalmitis and poor visual outcomes. The pathogen is typically a gut commensal; however, it is also known to cause many serious infections and exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics. In our patient, *E. faecalis* demonstrated an expected sensitivity to vancomycin, making it an appropriate empiric agent. Unfortunately, no improvement was observed after two doses of intravitreal vancomycin.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112DanrV]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

For antibiotic treatment lasting 7 days, the isolated organisms included Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Citrobacter sedlakii (n = 1), Citrobacter koseri (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 2). For the 14-day antibiotic treatment, organisms identified were Morganella morganii (n = 1) and β-hemolytic streptococci (n = 2). In the group that was not randomized, the isolates were Serratia marcescens (n = 1), β-hemolytic streptococci group B (n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), Streptococcus bovis (n = 1), Citrobacter koseri (n = 1), Morganella morganii (n = 1), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and β-hemolytic streptococci (n = 1).

In 99 (28%) patients, urine culture showed either no significant bacteriuria or a mixed flora. In over half of these cases (58%), patients were pre-treated with antibiotics with the group randomized to 7 days showing 13 (59%) and the group randomized to 14 days showing 20 (63%). A similar percentage pertained to those not randomized (n = 23, 51%).

### Importance of reviewing antibiotic courses by 48 hours: Risk factors for third-generation cephalosporin resistance among AmpC harboring organisms in urine and respiratory cultures [^113AY9fb]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, and Serratia (AmpC organisms) species can exhibit third-generation cephalosporin (TGC) resistance after TGC exposure. We aimed to assess if institutional TGC utilization correlated with institutional AmpC organism susceptibility and if prior TGC exposure ≤ 48 hours was associated with TGC resistance in the first culture of a future infection episode caused by an AmpC organism.

- **Methods**: A 5-year retrospective cohort study was performed, including AmpC organisms isolated from pediatric urinary and respiratory tract cultures at an institution with TGC courses reviewed by the antimicrobial stewardship program at 48 hours. Correlations were assessed by Pearson's correlation. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors independently associated with TGC resistance in a subcohort of infection episodes.

- **Results**: Among 654 cultures, AmpC organism TGC susceptibility increased from 74% in 2013 to 89.3% in 2017, and this correlated with a 26.1% decrease in TGC utilization (r = -0.906; P = 0.034). Among 275 AmpC organism infections, 21.1% were resistant. Resistance occurred in 13.6%, 17.4%, and 56.5% of infections with no exposure, ≤ 48 hours, and > 48 hours of TGC exposure in the past 30 days, respectively. TGC exposure ≤ 48 hours was not associated with resistance (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–4.94; P = 0.74), whereas, TGC exposure > 48 hours was (OR, 8.7; 95% CI, 3.67–20.6; P < 0.001). Infections in 2017 were less likely to be resistant (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08–0.8; P = 0.019).

Conclusions: Decreased TGC utilization was associated with improved susceptibility of AmpC organisms to TGCs over the study period.

### Colonization status and appropriate antibiotic therapy for nosocomial bacteremia caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria in an intensive care unit [^116eudKC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Timely initiation of antibiotic therapy is crucial for severe infection, yet appropriate antibiotic therapy is often delayed for nosocomial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The relationship between knowledge of colonization by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria (ABR-GNB) and the rate of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy for subsequent bacteremia was evaluated.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Fifty-four-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Colonization surveillance in this unit is performed through routine site-specific surveillance cultures (urine, mouth, trachea, and anus), with additional cultures done when clinically relevant.

- **Patients**: ICU patients with nosocomial bacteremia caused by ABR-GNB.

- **Results**: Infectious and microbiological characteristics and rates of appropriate antibiotic therapy were compared between patients with and without prior colonization before bacteremia. Prior colonization was defined as the presence (detected ≥ 2 days before the onset of bacteremia) of the same ABR-GNB in both colonization and subsequent blood cultures. During the study period, 157 episodes of bacteremia caused by ABR-GNB were evaluated. One hundred seventeen episodes of bacteremia (74.5%) were preceded by colonization. Appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy (initiated within 24 hours) was administered for 74.4% of these episodes vs. 55.0% of episodes that occurred without prior colonization. Appropriate therapy was administered within 48 hours for all episodes preceded by colonization.

### Mohs surgical postoperative wound infection caused by rare Enterobacteriaceae [^1127BroN]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Raoultella planticola (R. planticola) is a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It was first found in humans in 1984 in a patient with sepsis and was originally classified as the Klebsiella spp. until 2001 when it was reclassified as a member of the Raoultella genus based on phylogenetic gene analysis. Initially, it was considered a harmless environmental organism primarily found in soil and water. However, in recent years, it has emerged as a virulent pathogen closely associated with multiple severe human infections, including liver abscesses, cholangitis, pancreatitis, conjunctivitis, acute cholecystitis, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. The reported cases involving skin infections were linked to a dog scratch, fatal bacteremia following burn wounds exposed to contaminated rainwater used to extinguish a flesh fire, a fractured tibia after an open reduction internal fixation, pelvic cellulitis in a neutropenic patient, and a crush injury of the thumb in a dirty environment washed with running water.

In this study, we report an 85-year-old woman with a R. planticola wound infection of the right lower extremity following Mohs micrographic surgery. We aim to shed light on the rare potential for this organism to infect surgical wounds and cause delayed wound healing. To our knowledge, no cases of R. planticola have been reported in the setting of postsurgical wound infections following Mohs surgery.

### Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection [^116GpJHf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Endophthalmitis following anti-VEGF therapy is an uncommon but recognized complication of intravitreal injections. The visual sequelae of endophthalmitis can be devastating despite early and targeted treatment. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is the most common pathogen isolated in post-injection endophthalmitis, although the list of pathogens is ever-increasing.

While previous cases of Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis, a gut commensal, after anti-VEGF have been reported, endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection due to Morganella morganii has not been documented. Morganella morganii is an unusual opportunistic pathogen, known for causing infections in patients with underlying comorbidities. Neither organism is well-known for causing endophthalmitis.

Here, we report a rare case of post-injection endophthalmitis secondary to Enterococcus faecalis and Morganella morganii with a better-than-expected final visual outcome.

### Bwc0977, a broad-spectrum antibacterial clinical candidate to treat multidrug resistant infections [^116eYFAc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

BWC0977 was evaluated using the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocol against a panel of ATCC strains. It was found to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus and E. faecalis, with median minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.01 µg/mL and 0.06 µg/mL, respectively. For Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, E. cloacae, and P. mirabilis, the median MICs were 0.03, 0.03, 0.25, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.12 µg/mL, respectively.

In a study conducted on a global panel of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, which included a total of 2945 clinical isolates collected in 2019, BWC0977 exhibited potent activity. It achieved MIC 90 values — indicating the MIC at which ≥ 90% of strains within a test population are inhibited — for various pathogens: A. baumannii (1 μg/mL), P. aeruginosa (1 μg/mL), E. coli (0.5 μg/mL), K. pneumoniae (2 μg/mL), E. cloacae (2 μg/mL), Citrobacter species (1 μg/mL), Proteus species (0.5 μg/mL), M. morganii (1 μg/mL), and S. marcescens (1 μg/mL). The comparator drugs, including ciprofloxacin, meropenem, meropenem-vaborbactam, cefiderocol, and tobramycin, exhibited considerably higher MIC 90 values. The majority of the Enterobacterales tested, as shown in Table 1, and Gram-positive bacteria, referenced in Supplementary Table 2, were resistant to currently prescribed drugs.

### State of the management of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms [^117J8gsk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In the past decade, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDR-GN) bacterial infections has increased significantly, leading to higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Treating these infections poses numerous challenges, particularly when selecting appropriate empiric therapy for critically ill patients for whom the margin for error is low. Fortunately, the availability of new therapies has improved the treatment landscape, offering safer and more effective options. However, there remains a need to establish and implement optimal clinical and therapeutic approaches for managing these infections. Here, we review strategies for identifying patients at risk for MDR-GN infections, propose a framework for the choice of empiric and definitive treatment, and explore effective multidisciplinary approaches to managing patients in the hospital while ensuring a safe transition to outpatient settings.

### Preventing transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria in health care settings: A tale of 2 guidelines [^117RnVZk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). High credibility.

Two guidelines for the control of multidrug-resistant organisms in health care facilities have appeared during the past three years — one from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and one, in draft form, from the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These guidelines reflect universal concern in the infection-control community about today's unprecedented levels of activity of multidrug-resistant organisms and about the inadequate or inconsistent application of potentially effective control measures.

- **Detailed reviews**: The two guidelines provide detailed reviews of pertinent issues and evidence-based, rated recommendations, which overlap considerably.
- **Divergence in recommendations**: Recommendations regarding indications for active surveillance cultures and the extent of their use constitute the major divergence.

Although implementing the comprehensive control plans for multidrug-resistant organisms advocated by both guidelines will require health care facilities to confront difficult programmatic issues, aggressive and widespread adoption of control measures for multidrug-resistant organisms is urgently needed.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: Recommendations by the Italian Council for the Optimization of Antimicrobial Use [^113rk6F2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Aztreonam-avibactam is currently under clinical development for the treatment of serious infections caused by MBLs-producing Enterobacterales.

Alarming rates of resistance to many antibiotics in hospitals worldwide have been reported for non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii. These bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics; moreover, they can acquire additional resistance to other important antibiotic agents.

Among Gram-positive bacteria involved in IAIs, the impact of Enterococcus spp. on mortality remains uncertain. While the role of Enterococcus spp. in determining breakthroughs or superinfections in high-risk patients is well documented, their pathogenic impact on IAIs in low-risk patients is still debated. Even though Enterococcus spp. is believed to possess low virulence factors, it may be supposed that an increase in virulence may be obtained by the development of a synergistic effect with other bacteria like E. coli and anaerobes.

Various observational studies highlighted that treatment failure in patients infected by Enterococcus spp. is associated with a poorer outcome; however, there is no consistent evidence that routine use of adequate anti-enterococcal coverage improves the survival rate. This suggests that Enterococcus spp. isolation represents a negative prognostic marker rather than playing a causative role in the infection. In their meta-analysis, Zhang et al. found that enterococci-covered antibiotic regimens provided no improvement in treatment success.

### Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection [^114T7f6L]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection is a potentially devastating complication of anti-VEGF injections. Post-injection endophthalmitis due to Enterococcus faecalis is rare, and no previous case of Morganella morganii endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection has been reported.

- **Case presentation**: We present the first reported case of Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection in an immunocompetent patient in the absence of recent ocular surgery. Our patient presented with hand movement visual acuity one day after anti-VEGF injection and demonstrated no clinical improvement despite repeated intravitreal ceftazidime and vancomycin injections. A decision was made to proceed with early vitrectomy given the failure of intravitreal antibiotics. Visual acuity improved to 6/90 at 12 weeks after vitrectomy without any evidence of disease recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Post-injection endophthalmitis due to Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis infections can have visually devastating consequences despite repeated empirical and targeted intravitreal antibiotics. Lack of clinical improvement following intravitreal antibiotics should warrant consideration of early vitrectomy. Our experience is a pertinent reminder of the ever-growing threat of uncommon and multi-resistant bacteria that must be considered when treating infections such as post-injection endophthalmitis.
