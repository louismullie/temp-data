## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presents to the emergency department with confusion and disorientation that developed over the past 24 hours. His family reports that he has had similar episodes twice in the past six months, each resolving with treatment. On examination, he is disoriented to time and place, has asterixis, and is unable to perform simple calculations. Laboratory tests reveal elevated ammonia levels. He recently started taking diuretics for worsening ascites. No evidence of acute liver failure or portosystemic shunt without liver disease is found.

Using the AISF guideline, classify this patient's hepatic encephalopathy according to underlying condition, severity of mental alteration, time course, and presence of precipitating or facilitating events.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to classify a 54-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and acute confusion using the AISF framework for hepatic encephalopathy, specifically by underlying condition, severity, time course, and precipitating factors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying condition and type of hepatic encephalopathy. Then, I should verify the severity using the West Haven criteria. Next, I will determine the time course based on recurrence intervals. After that, I need to identify precipitating factors, especially diuretic-related issues. Finally, I will synthesize the classification and double-check that it aligns with guideline conventions and the clinical details provided.

> Let me first confirm the underlying condition and type. The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, so this is Type C hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis, not Type A (acute liver failure) or Type B (portosystemic shunt without liver disease), and I should explicitly state that to be precise [^3654e268] [^39716083].

> Wait, let me verify the severity grading before I commit. Disorientation to time and place, asterixis, and inability to perform calculations map to West Haven Grade 2, which is defined by gross disorientation, drowsiness, asterixis, and inappropriate behavior; I initially thought this might be Grade 3, but hold on, I should correct that because Grade 3 requires marked confusion, incoherent speech, and sleeping most of the time, which is more severe than described here [^65f9dcae] [^ccea67f3].

> I need to check the time course next. The family reports two similar episodes in the past six months, each resolving with treatment; by definition, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy is when bouts occur within six months of each other, so this is recurrent rather than isolated episodic or persistent [^25316dbc].

> Let me consider precipitating factors carefully. The recent initiation of diuretics for ascites raises concern for diuretic-induced electrolyte disturbances or volume shifts; diuretic overdose and electrolyte disorders are established precipitants of overt hepatic encephalopathy, and infections, bleeding, and constipation are also common, so I should classify this as precipitated and specify diuretic-related factors as the likely trigger pending labs, while keeping infection and bleeding on the differential [^d6405e19] [^25316dbc].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm aligning with the four-factor classification framework. The AISF-endorsed schema mirrors AASLD/EASL in classifying by type, severity, time course, and precipitating factors, so the synthesis should read: Type C, Grade 2, Recurrent, Precipitated (likely diuretic-related), which matches the clinical picture and guideline conventions [^a4b7c46d] [^ce4f11b6].

> But wait, what if there are additional contributors I'm missing? I should double-check for covert infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and alcohol withdrawal, since these frequently precipitate overt encephalopathy in cirrhosis and can coexist; the management principle remains to identify and treat precipitating factors in parallel with empiric therapy for hepatic encephalopathy, which reinforces the importance of a structured workup now [^d6405e19] [^10bb76f8].

---

This patient's hepatic encephalopathy is best classified as **Type C (cirrhosis-related)** [^3654e268], **Grade 2 (disorientation, asterixis, impaired calculations)** [^65f9dcae], **recurrent** (two prior episodes in 6 months) [^25316dbc], and **precipitated by diuretic use** (recent initiation for ascites) [^d6405e19]. This classification aligns with AISF and AASLD/EASL guidance and will guide targeted management and prevention strategies [^a4b7c46d].

---

## Classification by underlying condition

According to AISF and AASLD/EASL, HE is classified by the **underlying condition** into three types:

- **Type A**: Acute liver failure.
- **Type B**: Portosystemic shunting without liver disease.
- **Type C**: Cirrhosis-related HE [^3654e268].

Given the patient's alcoholic cirrhosis, this is **Type C** [^39716083].

---

## Classification by severity of mental alteration

The **West Haven criteria** are the standard for grading HE severity:

| **Grade** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Grade 1 | - Minimal changes <br/> - Short attention span <br/> - Mild personality changes |
| Grade 2 | - Disorientation to time/place <br/> - Asterixis <br/> - Impaired calculations <br/> - Lethargy |
| Grade 3 | - Marked confusion <br/> - Incoherent speech <br/> - Sleeping most of the time <br/> - Arousable to stimuli |
| Grade 4 | - Coma <br/> - Unresponsive to pain |

---

The patient shows disorientation, asterixis, and impaired calculations, consistent with **Grade 2** [^65f9dcae].

---

## Classification by time course

HE is classified by **time course** as episodic, recurrent, or persistent [^25316dbc]. Recurrent HE is defined as episodes within 6 months; with two prior episodes in 6 months, this is **recurrent** [^25316dbc].

---

## Classification by precipitating or facilitating events

HE is classified as **precipitated or non-precipitated**; precipitating factors should be identified and treated [^25316dbc]. Recent diuretic initiation for ascites is a recognized precipitant, so this is **precipitated** [^d6405e19].

---

## Final classification

Putting this together, the patient's HE is **Type C, Grade 2, recurrent, precipitated by diuretic use**. This classification will guide therapy — treat precipitating factors, initiate lactulose, and consider rifaximin for recurrence prevention [^9a86e06b] [^77a1b032].

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common, worrisome and sometimes difficult to manage complication of end-stage liver disease. HE is often recurrent, requiring multiple hospital admissions. It can have serious implications in terms of a patient's ability to perform complex tasks (for example driving), their earning capacity, their social and family roles. This guideline reviews current knowledge on HE definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment, both by general principles and by way of a summary of available drugs and treatment strategies. The quality of the published, pertinent evidence is graded, and practical recommendations are made. Where possible, these are placed within the Italian health service context, with reference to local diagnosis and management experience.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^7fc5e431]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Classification—Grading and staging of HE

In its 2014 guideline, AASLD recommended classification for HE by four factors: underlying cause (Type A from acute liver failure, Type B from portosystemic bypass or shunting, and Type C from cirrhosis), time course (i.e. “episodic,” “recurrent,” or “persistent”), presence of precipitating factors (i.e. “nonprecipitated” or “precipitated”), and severity.The severity of HE manifestations is most pertinent to management in the inpatient setting and can be classified by several tools. The West‐Haven Criteria (WHC) (see Table 2) are the most frequently used and overall considered the gold standard; however, one of the limitations of this scale is the subjective nature of patient assessment.These shortcomings have fostered an initiative to find new, more objective, and reproducible methods for grading HE, but these tests are not used in routine clinical practice by hospitalists. Some experts prefer to differentiate between grades of encephalopathy using the spectrum of neurocognitive impairment in cirrhosis classification, labeling them as “CHE” or “MHE” (WHC Grade I) and OHE (WHC Grades II–IV).Alternative severity grading systems for encephalopathy and easy to use in the clinical setting include the Glasgow Coma Score and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale.

Trials in patients with episodic overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE)—Design recommendations specify that patients who are not expected to survive the hospitalization, who are terminally ill or have acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) should be excluded. A detailed standard-of-care algorithm must be agreed upon a priori and must be instituted and monitored diligently throughout the trial. Patients should not be entered into trials until after the institution of optimal standard-of-care therapy and only if their mental state abnormalities persist. Provided the optimal standard of care is instituted and maintained, the treatment trial can be initiated earlier if they include a placebo comparator; this would allow an evaluation of the trial treatment as an adjuvant to standard therapy. Large-scale, multicenter treatment trials should be evaluated using robust clinical outcomes, such as in-hospital and remote survival, liver-related and total deaths, completeness and speed of recovery.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^a9197f3f]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in critically ill cirrhosis—brain failure characterization and workup should be guided as follows: The West Haven HE criteria and the Glasgow Coma Scale should be used to characterize brain failure, with cutoffs of Grade 3 or 4 HE and Glasgow Coma Scale <8 indicating severe injury; consider ICU admission for patients with Grades 3 and 4 HE; investigation and treatment of potential precipitating factors and empirical therapy for suspected HE should be performed; workup should include liver-unrelated causes of altered mental status, especially if this is the first episode of confusion or if a patient does not respond to empirical therapy or the precipitating factors are not readily identified; routine brain imaging in patients with presentation similar to prior episodes of HE is not warranted, though brain imaging could be considered for a first episode of altered mental status, seizures or new focal neurological signs, or an unsatisfactory response to therapy; routine ammonia level testing in patients with cirrhosis and altered mental status is not recommended, and a low ammonia level in patients with coma or confusion should point toward etiologies other than HE.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) brain failure—For patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy, simultaneous airway care, evaluation for other causes, treatment of precipitants, and empiric therapy are emphasized; clinicians should consider non-HE causes if recovery is delayed, avoid prolonged sedation, discuss goals of care early and continue afterward, monitor for post-traumatic stress after recovery of consciousness, and note that ventilation without altered mental status is not brain failure. Key statements include: “In patients with grade 3 or 4 HE, care of the airway, evaluation of other causes of altered mental status, treatment of potential precipitating factors, and empiric HE therapy should occur simultaneously,” “Consideration for causes other than HE as the reasons for altered mental status is important, especially in patients who have not recovered after HE therapies are deployed,” “Careful monitoring of pain, delirium, and avoiding medications that prolong sedation are important in allowing for return to consciousness,” “Discussion of goals of care should ideally occur with patients before the onset of alteration in mental status and should continue afterward,” “Patients need to be monitored after they return to consciousness for critical care–related post-traumatic stress,” and “Ventilation in the absence of altered mental status should not be considered brain failure.”

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)—key concept statements for altered mentation and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) emphasize that in patients with grade 3 or 4 HE, care of the airway, evaluation of other causes of altered mental status, treatment of potential precipitating factors, and empiric HE therapy should occur simultaneously. Consideration for causes other than HE as the reasons for altered mental status is important, especially in patients who have not recovered after HE therapies are deployed. Careful monitoring for pain, delirium, and avoiding medications that prolong sedation are important in promoting a return to consciousness. Discussion of goals of care should occur with patients before the onset of alteration in mental status and should continue afterward. Patients need to be monitored after they return to consciousness for critical care–related post-traumatic stress. Ventilation in the absence of altered mental status should not be considered brain failure.

Specific therapy for overt HE episodes includes supportive care, treatment of underlying precipitants, and initiation of specific therapy; first-line choices are nonabsorbable disaccharides or short-course antibiotics. All patients recovering from an acute episode of overt HE should also receive secondary prophylaxis to reduce the risk of recurrence; the evidence-based choices include nonabsorbable disaccharides and/or rifaximin. Appropriate therapy can reduce the duration of admission and reduce the risk of subsequent readmission. However, to maximize the benefits from therapy, early diagnosis is essential to allow prompt initiation of recommended treatment.

We recommend that our conclusions and recommendations be considered further by our colleagues in gastroenterology and hepatology and those in other disciplines and hope that these recommendations assist in the development of regional/national cross-speciality guidelines to improve the identification and triage of patients who may have HE and facilitate appropriate management. We also hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with HE from initial ‘suspicion’ of cognitive impairment, which may be by a clinician or healthcare provider not routinely responsible for management of an individual’s liver disease.

### EASL clinical practical guidelines on the management of acute (fulminant) liver failure [^53d3cf1a]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The term acute liver failure (ALF) is frequently applied as a generic expression to describe patients presenting with or developing an acute episode of liver dysfunction. In the context of hepatological practice, however, ALF refers to a highly specific and rare syndrome, characterised by an acute abnormality of liver blood tests in an individual without underlying chronic liver disease. The disease process is associated with development of a coagulopathy of liver aetiology, and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to hepatic encephalopathy. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention. These, as well as additional clinical procedures will be the subject of these clinical practice guidelines.

Diagnosis and testing for overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE)—The diagnosis of OHE is based on a clinical examination and a clinical decision, and clinical scales are used to analyze its severity; specific quantitative tests are only needed in study settings, and the gold standard is the West Haven criteria (WHC). These scales are subjective with limited interobserver reliability, especially for grade 1 HE, whereas disorientation and asterixis have good inter-rater reliability and are used as marker symptoms; in significantly altered consciousness, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is widely employed. OHE remains a diagnosis of exclusion due to many alternative causes of mental status change, and radiological assessment for a patient with altered mental status in HE is warranted.

### Hepatic encephalopathy: novel insights into classification, pathophysiology and therapy [^4104df64]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent and serious complication of both chronic liver disease and acute liver failure. HE manifests as a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, from subclinical changes (mild cognitive impairment) to marked disorientation, confusion and coma. The clinical and economic burden of HE is considerable, and it contributes greatly to impaired quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review will critically discuss the latest classification of HE, as well as the pathogenesis and pathophysiological pathways underlying the neurological decline in patients with end-stage liver disease. In addition, management strategies, diagnostic approaches, currently available therapeutic options and novel treatment strategies are discussed.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^696b8325]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

General management—initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation—Initial assessment should focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic or acute-on-chronic liver failure, with extensive laboratory and imaging tests helping in that differentiation; obtaining a complete history is of utmost importance, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, complementary and alternative medications, and controlled substance monitoring databases, and all attempts should be made to contact next of kin if history is unobtainable; patients with acute liver failure should be referred for consultation by hepatology or gastroenterology as soon as possible after identification, prognostic assessment and decision related to transfer and liver transplant (LT) should be made as early as possible, and early referral to a liver transplant center is essential because transfer may take time and patients may deteriorate quickly; physical examination should focus on vital signs, presence of jaundice, signs of chronic liver disease, and careful mental status, and encephalopathy due to hepatic encephalopathy can be graded according to the West-Haven Criteria.

### Heretical thoughts into hepatic encephalopathy [^04a53f78]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical progress in the development of new diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy has lagged behind the vast knowledge that has been generated from basic studies. In this article, we critically assess matters that should be revisited, such as definition, classification, diagnosis and grading of hepatic encephalopathy, which are difficult to apply reproducibly using the current criteria. Many lines of investigation have confirmed that hepatic encephalopathy is irreversible in many patients and suggest the need for further studies focussing on mechanisms of neuronal injury and death, to guide future drug development for these patients. The clinical evidence behind using lactulose for all severities of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently considered the standard of care, is poor and placebo-controlled trials for hepatic encephalopathy should be considered ethically sound. This expert opinion identifies current challenges in hepatic encephalopathy and highlights areas which require further debate and investigation in order to help advance the field both scientifically and clinically.

### Hepatic encephalopathy for the hospitalist [^21e2837d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The care of patients with advanced liver disease is often complicated by episodes of acute decline in alertness and cognition, termed hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Hospitalists must be familiar with HE, as it is a common reason for hospitalization in this population and is associated with significantly increased mortality. This narrative review addresses common issues related to diagnosis and classification, precipitants, inpatient management, and transitions of care for patients with HE. The initial presentation can be variable, and HE remains a clinical diagnosis. The spectrum of HE manifestations spans from mild, subclinical cognitive deficits to overt coma. The West Haven scoring system is the most widely used classification system for HE. Various metabolic insults may precipitate HE, and providers must specifically seek to rule out infection and bleeding in cirrhotic patients presenting with altered cognition. This is consistent with the 4-pronged approach of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease practice guidelines. Patients with HE are typically treated primarily with nonabsorbable disaccharide laxatives, often with adjunctive rifaximin. The evidence for these agents is discussed, and available support for other treatment options is presented. Management issues relevant to general hospitalists include those related to acute pain management, decisional capacity, and HE following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. These issues are examined individually. Successfully transitioning patients recovering from HE to outpatient care requires open communication with multiple role players including patients, caregivers, and outpatient providers.

Table 4. Differential diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE)—The differential diagnosis should include common disorders altering consciousness and precipitating factors. Examples listed are diabetic metabolic derangements, alcohol intoxication/withdrawal/Wernicke, drugs (benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, opioids), electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia and hypercalcemia), nonconvulsive epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, intracranial bleeding and stroke, severe medical stress, dementia, brain lesions, and obstructive sleep apnea. The recognition of precipitating factors for HE supports the diagnosis, and hyponatremia and sepsis can both produce encephalopathy per se and precipitate HE; in end-stage liver disease, uremic encephalopathy and HE may overlap.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, hospitalists are commonly charged with taking care of patients with HE in the community or academic settings. Hence, they should be well‐equipped with the knowledge and develop a systematic approach to the overall management of these patients in the hospital setting. This is important as patients with decompensated liver disease and HE is very ill at initial presentation to the hospital and merit an expedited workup and management with or without the help of a subspecialist. Otherwise, these patients have the potential to deteriorate quickly leading to adverse outcomes. Systematic and guideline congruent management will largely optimize the clinical outcomes in these patients.

Methods

On the basis of the results of the Needs Assessment survey and follow on discussions, a PubMed search was undertaken to identify additional management guidelines and recommendations for management of HE. The MESH term ‘hepatic encephalopathy’ combined with the subheadings ‘therapy’, ‘rehabilitation’, ‘diet therapy’, or ‘drug therapy’ was used as an initial search. This was then supplemented by a search combining the MESH term ‘hepatic encephalopathy’ and the article types ‘consensus development conference’, ‘consensus development conference, NIH’, or ‘guideline’. A total of 1146 possible publications were identified and a manual search of this list was then undertaken to identify publications that could inform the development of draft statements. Because of the paucity of suitable papers, a free text search (‘hepatic encephalopathy’ AND (guideline* OR algorithm)) and a MESH search (‘cognition disorders’ AND cirrhosis) were also undertaken. These did not retrieve any additional suitable citations.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hepatic encephalopathy [^c78373f8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A Practical Approach to the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis that can be reversed with treatment. Frequent episodes of recurrence are common, impacting patients, caregivers and healthcare systems, increasing morbidity and mortality statistics and resulting in grave financial consequences. Uptake and adherence to formal recommendations for HE diagnosis and management are low. There is an unmet need to advocate for the use of these recommendations in a more pragmatic form. Clinicians from multiple disciplines, dedicated to raising liver disease awareness, convened in a roundtable format to review and discuss the latest HE guidelines and relevant peer-reviewed literature on HE. The result was this clinical care publication on the screening, diagnosis and management of HE which seeks to facilitate clinicians' recognition and diagnosis of HE, apply a pathway of care for HE that addresses steps for initial management, long-term maintenance and prevention; it also addresses practical recommendations concerning situations encountered in HE. Resources are provided to address the different needs of the three key players in HE: patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

The clinical calculator "West-Haven criteria for hepatic encephalopathy severity" for hepatic encephalopathy.

The West-Haven Criteria for Hepatic Encephalopathy Severity is a clinical scoring system used to assess the severity of hepatic encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can occur in patients with liver disease. This calculator is applicable to patients with both acute and chronic liver disease who present with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, such as confusion, altered level of consciousness, and neuromuscular dysfunction. 

The clinical utility of the West-Haven Criteria lies in its ability to grade the severity of hepatic encephalopathy on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 4 indicating coma. This grading system helps clinicians to monitor disease progression, guide treatment decisions, and assess prognosis. 

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the West-Haven Criteria. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is based on clinical observation and does not take into account laboratory parameters or imaging findings. Therefore, it may not be suitable for patients with atypical presentations or those with other conditions that can mimic the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy.

The West-Haven criteria calculator evaluates the severity of hepatic encephalopathy based on the user's assessment of consciousness, intellectual function, and behavior. The user selects one of four options that best describes the patient's condition. Each option corresponds to a specific grade of hepatic encephalopathy, ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 4, with escalating severity.

The computation proceeds by using the input selection to identify and assign a severity grade as follows:

1. "Changes in behavior with minimal change in level of consciousness" equates to Grade 1.
2. "Gross disorientation, drowsiness, possibly asterixis, inappropriate behavior" corresponds to Grade 2.
3. "Marked confusion, incoherent speech, sleeping most of the time but arousable to vocal stimuli" is classified as Grade 3.
4. "Comatose, unresponsive to pain; decorticate or decerebrate posturing" is considered Grade 4.

The calculator's logic identifies the selected input option and assigns the appropriate grade, which is then returned as the result. If no valid input is selected, the output will indicate the need for a complete input selection.

The determination process can be structured as follows:

| Assessment Option                                                                                                   | Assigned Grade |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Changes in behavior with minimal change in level of consciousness                                                   | Grade 1        |
| Gross disorientation, drowsiness, possibly asterixis, inappropriate behavior                                         | Grade 2        |
| Marked confusion, incoherent speech, sleeping most of the time but arousable to vocal stimuli                       | Grade 3        |
| Comatose, unresponsive to pain; decorticate or decerebrate posturing                                                | Grade 4        |

After evaluating the input against these criteria, the calculator outputs the corresponding grade, indicating the severity level of hepatic encephalopathy as assessed by the user's description of symptoms.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as ‘brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting’. Symptoms of overt HE include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness – particularly disturbance of the sleep/wake cycle–. In more severe HE, patients may become disorientated, acutely confused and suffer from agitation or coma,,. Minimal HE, the mildest form of HE, is clinically undetectable and requires the use of psychometric or neurophysiological testing to make a diagnosis,.

Overt HE is a common complication of cirrhosis; at diagnosis approximately 10% of patients have HE,and 20–40% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HE during their disease course. In a multicentre study in Europe, of 2145 successive patients at different stages of liver disease 21% had HE. HE is also associated with a poor prognosis; 1-year mortality in patients with HE was 64% in one population-based series. Mortality may also be correlated with HE severity,. In addition, HE affects the patient’s quality of life,and caregiver burden. There is also accumulating evidence that after apparent resolution of HE persistent cognitive dysfunction may occur,.

### Predicting overt hepatic encephalopathy for the population with cirrhosis [^00548e2e]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with poor quality of life, sharply increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, falls, and motor vehicle accidents. HE manifests with a dynamic spectrum of severity. Overt HE is clinically obvious disorientation, even coma. Although multiple strategies are available to characterize early-stage HE, data are limited that validate these methods in predicting overt HE, many are impractical in clinical practice, and test cutoffs relevant to the average patient clinicians manage are lacking. To accurately and efficiently classify the risk of overt HE in the population with cirrhosis, novel strategies may be needed. Herein, we review the potential competing strategies for the prediction of overt HE. Conclusion: We propose refining diagnostic cutoffs for tests that are designed to define early HE, using overt HE as a gold standard and expanding prediction tools by using measures of components from the risk pathway for HE.

Research on hepatic encephalopathy is hampered by the imprecise definition of this disabling complication of liver disease. Under this light, the Organisation Mondiale de Gastroentérologie commissioned a Working Party to reach a consensus in this area and to present it at the 11th World Congress of Gastroenterology in Vienna (1998). The Working Party continued its work thereafter and now present their final report. In summary, the Working Party has suggested a modification of current nomenclature for clinical diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy; proposed guidelines for the performance of future clinical trials in hepatic encephalopathy; and felt the need for a large study to redefine neuropsychiatric abnormalities in liver disease, which would allow the diagnosis of minimal (subclinical) encephalopathy to be made on firm statistical grounds. In the interim, it proposes the use of a psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score, based on the result of 5 neuropsychologic tests. Finally, the need for a careful evaluation of the newer neuroimaging modalities for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was stressed.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^54fbe291]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an important complication of decompensated liver disease. Hospital admission for episodes of HE are very common, with these patients being managed by the hospitalists. These admissions are costly and burdensome to the health-care system. Diagnosis of HE at times is not straightforward, particularly in patients who are altered and unable to provide any history. Precipitants leading to episodes of HE, should be actively sought and effectively tackled along with the overall management. This mandates timely diagnostics, appropriate initiation of pharmacological treatment, and supportive care. Infections are the most important precipitants leading to HE and should be aggressively managed. Lactulose is the front-line medication for primary treatment of HE episodes and for prevention of subsequent recurrence. However, careful titration in the hospital setting along with the appropriate route of administration should be established and supervised by the hospitalist. Rifaximin has established its role as an add-on medication, in those cases where lactulose alone is not working. Overall effective management of HE calls for attention to guideline-directed nutritional requirements, functional assessment, medication reconciliation, patient education/counseling, and proper discharge planning. This will potentially help to reduce readmissions, which are all too common for HE patients. Early specialty consultation may be warranted in certain conditions. Numerous challenges exist to optimal care of hospitalized OHE patients. However, hospitalists if equipped with knowledge about a systematic approach to taking care of these frail patients are in an ideal position to ensure good inpatient and transition of care outcomes.

Advance care planning and goals of care discussions—An opportunity to pursue

Owing to time constraints and possibly secondary to focusing on the acute medical issues at hand, goals of care discussions can at times take a back seat. However, hospitalists already have the expertise of leading these discussions for patients with other chronic illnesses and are, hence, in a natural position to coordinate and lead such discussions in patients with end‐stage liver diseases. This holds truer for those with a poor overall prognosis, and in particular, if there is no prospect of a liver transplant. These efforts are usually multidisciplinary and set the tone for the future management of such patients. Furthermore, this effort ensures that current and future management plans are aligned with the patient's/family wishes. If possible, such discussions should be held prior to patients being in florid HE and hence, not being able to participate in such discussions. In such cases, the burden of decision‐making falls on the surrogate health‐care proxy if one has been nominated. Hospitalists can seek help in this area from recent guidelines on this topic.

Accurate documentation leads to accurate coding—Needs improvement

Hospitalists, at times erroneously, document an episode of HE as altered mental status, which is not accurate. As per the current 10th revision of the International Classification of Disease‐10, HE should be documented as metabolic encephalopathy (G93.41). Some of the other representative codes depending on the acuity, presence or absence of coma, and etiology, include chronic hepatic failure without coma (K72.10), chronic hepatic failure with coma (K72.11), alcoholic hepatic failure (acute, chronic, or subacute) without coma (K70.40), and alcoholic hepatic failure with coma (K70.41).Etiology of liver disease should be specified. Accurate and proper documentation leads to accurate coding, which will ultimately translate into accurate billing for the encounter. This is an area in need of much improvement and needs ongoing attention.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^a21a0e93]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. Symptoms include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness. Overt (symptomatic) hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis that is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present to healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we developed a series of ‘consensus points’ to provide some guidance on management.

Methods

Using a modified ‘Delphi’ process, consensus statements were developed that summarize our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Points on which full consensus could not be reached are also discussed.

Results

Our recommendations emphasize the role of all healthcare providers in the identification of cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis and provide guidance on steps that might be considered to make a diagnosis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, treatment recommendations are summarized. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy can have a significant impact on patients; however, in most circumstances identification and management of minimal hepatic encephalopathy remains the responsibility of specialists in liver diseases.

Conclusion

Our opinion statements aim to define the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. We suggest that these recommendations be considered further by colleagues in other disciplines and hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with cirrhosis and with a ‘suspicion’ of cognitive impairment through to a formal diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.

Introduction

The definition of liver dysfunction is far from a global consensus. Typically, liver failure is divided into two major entities depending on the presence or absence of preexisting liver disease. Acute liver failure (ALF) is rare, occurs in the absence of previous liver damage, has a clear etiology and is classified according to the interval between the appearance of jaundice and the onset of hepatic encephalopathy into acute, subacute and hyperacute processes. ALF is managed according to guidelines, which account for transplant needs. In contrast, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is triggered by acute hepatic decompensation in patients with preexisting chronic disease. ACLF definitions vary depending on the issuing consortium. Apart from ALF and ACLF, secondary liver injury without underlying liver disease in response to hypoxic, toxic or inflammatory insults represents the most common form of hepatic dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU), and it commonly manifests as cholestasis and hypoxic liver injury.

In ALF, the liver is triggering clinical deterioration, i.e. extrahepatic organ dysfunction develops due to impaired liver function. The situation in ACLF is more complex: A previous chronic liver disease worsens to liver failure by primary hepatic deterioration [alcoholic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury (DILI)] or by secondary hepatic deterioration due to extrahepatic events (for example, sepsis). Whether alterations are classified as “dysfunction,” “injury” or “failure” depends on the surrogate marker and the score used. For instance, when applying bilirubin as a common marker, the definition of acute liver injury (ALI) by Koch et al. uses a value higher than 3 mg/dl (51.3 µmol/l) to define injury. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score divides dysfunction and failure using thresholds of 1.2 mg/dl (20.5 µmol/l) and 6.0 mg/dl (102.6 µmol/l), respectively. Levels above 2 mg/dl are otherwise frequently used as pragmatic cutoffs to assess jaundice and cholestasis.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^5d9e06aa]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Testing for minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE)—MHE and CHE is defined as the presence of test-dependent or clinical signs of brain dysfunction in patients with chronic liver disease who are not disoriented or display asterixis. The term “minimal” conveys that there is no clinical sign, cognitive or other, of HE, and the term “covert” includes minimal and grade 1 HE. Testing strategies can be divided into two major types: psychometric and neurophysiological.

Panel recommendations

General practitioners, acute care physicians and others, who may encounter patients with cirrhosis, should be aware of the signs and symptoms of HE. If these healthcare providers identify cognitive impairment, or symptoms of HE, in patients with cirrhosis, additional clinical assessment/workup may be required. This may include specialist consultation if helpful. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their family physician: 38% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 3.63/5). Most patients with cirrhosis will be under appropriate specialist care. The primary care physician plays a vital role in the identification of patients with liver disease and should be aware of at-risk groups in addition to clinical signs and symptoms. Guidelines for the primary care provider on this are lacking. HE as a first presentation of cirrhosis would be unusual. However, HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in appropriate clinical settings – for example, the patient with risk factors for liver disease, the patient with physical signs suggesting liver disease, or the patient with abnormal serum liver function tests. Unlike other decompensation events (e.g. variceal bleeding, ascites), patients with HE may not present to their usual specialist as a result of their symptoms, and patients with prior HE are more likely to present to their primary care provider or as an emergency admission. Therefore, it is necessary that patients with HE not presenting to their usual healthcare provider are identified and appropriate treatment initiated. Although assessment of cognition and psychiatric symptoms is relatively simple, making a definitive diagnosis of HE is more difficult and HE remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms of HE are relatively nonspecific (Table 1), which can lead to challenges in making a formal diagnosis of HE. Therefore, providers should be ready to consider HE as a cause of cognitive dysfunction and symptoms in patients with cirrhosis, and either work up the patient to make a formal diagnosis or, if necessary, be prepared to refer such patients to specialist care for further assessment. This prompt workup and/or referral should allow for early initiation of appropriate management, which might reduce the risk of hospitalization and thus reduce healthcare costs.
The lead clinician caring for patients with cirrhosis (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) should formally assess all patients for signs and symptoms of HE. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their gastroenterologist: 63% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.5/5). All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their liver specialist: 75% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.75/5). Although the general practitioner or acute care physician or other healthcare provider encountering patients with cirrhosis and cognitive impairment should have a low ‘threshold’ for suspecting HE as a possible cause, we believe that it is the responsibility of the lead clinician (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) to routinely assess patients with cirrhosis for symptoms of HE. According to current guidelines this may involve clinical assessment and/or psychometric testing. As stated below (point 3), the selection of additional psychometric testing remains a matter of personal experience and availability. Routine formal assessment will facilitate early identification of symptoms of HE, and therefore initiation of appropriate management.
Assessment for overt HE should principally be by clinical evaluation, with use of additional testing as required on an individual basis (and according to availability). The assessment of overt HE outside a liver unit should be by clinical evaluation only: 25% strongly agree; 50% agree (mean score: 3.75/5). Only near consensus was reached for this statement as one author strongly felt that even outside the liver unit additional testing beyond clinical assessment was necessary. However, on further discussion it was agreed that for many healthcare providers the facilities are not available to undertake additional tests. Therefore, the final statement above, which allows for additional testing ‘if available’, was agreed upon. The EASL/AASLD guidelines state that overt HE is primarily a clinical diagnosis (Table 1). Psychometric and neurophysiological tests do not differentiate HE from other causes of cognitive dysfunction, and differential diagnoses include renal dysfunction, hyponatraemia, diabetes, sepsis, alcohol withdrawal and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. However, psychometric, psychophysical and neurophysiological tests can have some value in supporting the clinical diagnosis of lower grades of overt HE, in addition to their use to detect minimal HE. These include simple paper and pencil tests (including the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test) as well as more sophisticated psychometric tests including the Inhibitory Control Test and Repeated Battery for Assessment of Neurological State, neurophysiological testing by electroencephalogram, or psychophysical testing – for example, the Critical Flicker Frequency. Full consensus on the use of a specific test or tests could not be reached, reflecting differences in availability and clinical opinion. It should be noted that not all of the available tests are fully validated and many require administration by a trained examiner. The results of several of these including the Inhibitory Control Test and Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test, can be affected by age, educational status and training effects, and for many tests validated ‘normals’ are not available for all countries/languages and populations. The availability of equipment for these tests varies, and in many centres pencil and paper tests are used and remain valuable. However, if available, the Critical Flicker Frequency test was felt by some authors to have several advantages, including lack of training effect, educational status, and age, and avoidance of interexaminer variability,.
For all patients with HE, consideration should usually be given for referral to a liver unit or physician who specializes in liver disease. All patients with overt HE should be referred to a liver unit: 50% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.38/5). HE is a decompensation event and all healthcare providers managing patients with a diagnosis of HE should consider whether the patient should be referred to a liver specialist. Although policies vary with respect to wait-listing patients with HE and a number of allocation scoring systems have been proposed, further assessment of patients with HE is warranted as they may be eligible for assessment for liver transplantation.
All patients with overt HE should be treated (including checking for precipitants). All patients with HE should be treated: 75% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.75/5). The most important step in the management of HE is evaluation for precipitants (Table 2),and appropriate intervention. In addition, all patients with a diagnosis of overt HE should be treated. The most commonly used treatments are nonabsorbable disaccharides. A meta-analysis indicated that lactulose or lactitol therapy resulted in clinical improvement, although there was no effect on mortality. Although the same meta-analysis reported that nonabsorbable disaccharides were inferior to short-course antibiotic therapy, lactulose is the usual ‘first choice’ treatment for overt HE. Antibiotics are, however, commonly used, whereas other therapies available in some countries include oral branched chain amino acidsand intravenous-ornithine-aspartate (LOLA). Other treatment options specialists may consider include albumin dialysisand embolization of large spontaneous portal–systemic shunts, although these are not part of the EASL/AASLD recommendations. If helpful, advice on treatment should be sought from a specialist in liver diseases, particularly for more severe cases, and/or those for whom a nonstandard therapy is being considered.
After recovery/improvement of HE symptoms, secondary prophylaxis should be considered in all patients. After recovery/improvement of overt HE, patients should receive secondary prophylaxis: 83% strongly agree; 16% agree (mean score: 4.83/5). Prior HE is associated with an increased risk for subsequent episodes,. In one study ∼50% of patients with at least one prior HE event (median 1) suffered recurrence within 1 year, and in another, 46% of those with at least two prior events suffered recurrence within 6 months. Therefore, it is appropriate to offer secondary prophylaxis to reduce recurrence in most, if not all, patients recovering from an episode of HE. Secondary prophylaxis should be initiated by the clinician managing an episode of HE, with advice from a gastroenterologist or specialist in liver disease if helpful. In patients with a median of one prior episode, lactulose was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for recurrence over a median 14 months’ follow-up. Patients receiving lactulose should have the dose adjusted so that there are two or three bowel movements daily but without diarrhoea. In patients with at least two prior episodes of HE in the previous 6 months (the majority of whom were receiving lactulose), rifaximin-α (rifaximin) 550 mg twice daily was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for recurrent HE over 6 months and a reduction in the risk for HE-related hospitalization. The EASL/AASLD guidelines suggest rifaximin 550 mg twice daily add-on to lactulose after the second episode of HE. It may also be appropriate to consider rifaximin monotherapy in patients intolerant to lactulose despite patient education, and dose adjustment to achieve two or three bowel movements each day. A number of other therapies used for secondary prophylaxis are not included in the EASL/AASLD guidelinesbut were felt by some authors to have a role. Full consensus could not be reached on these treatments, partly because of differences in availability and clinical experience. These included laxatives, branched chain amino acids,,and LOLA,,. For patients with hyperammonaemia and HE, LOLA was felt to be particularly helpful by one author, although only intravenous LOLA was reported by the EASL/AASLD guidelines as being effective for the treatment of HE episodes but not for secondary prophylaxis. There was also experience of using oral branched chain amino acids in patients with chronic HE who were protein intolerant, as recommended by the International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) guidelines on nutrition. Patients receiving secondary prophylaxis should be encouraged to remain on therapy to maximize the benefits of treatment. It is the responsibility of all healthcare professionals who encounter patients with cirrhosis and HE to encourage compliance with therapy.
Liver specialists may assess patients with cirrhosis for minimal HE; other healthcare professionals caring for patients with cirrhosis should not be expected to routinely assess patients for minimal HE. Patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for minimal HE by their gastroenterologist: 38% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.13/5). Patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for minimal HE by their liver specialist: 88% strongly agree; 13% agree (mean score: 4.88/5). Substantial expertise is required to make a diagnosis of minimal HE and the diagnosis is defined by the test used. In addition, there are no therapies with a specific approval for its treatment. Therefore, it may be reasonable to expect that diagnosis and management of minimal HE should remain the responsibility of liver specialists. Although treatment for minimal HE has been shown to improve cognitive test score and quality of life–, it is not yet possible to confirm benefits in terms of reduced episodes of overt HE or other clinical outcomes. As a result, there is no agreement over potential treatment strategies, including the optimal duration of therapy. It is appropriate for those healthcare providers caring for patients with cirrhosis, who have the expertise and experience, to utilize psychometric or neurophysiological tests on a case-by-case basis if this will help clinical decision making. This reflects the EASL/AASLD guidelines, which suggest that consideration be given to testing patients for minimal HE and providing counselling in some circumstances – for example, potential consequences on driving, flying, train drivers, or operating machinery.
If diagnosed, consideration should be given to treatment of patients with minimal HE. All patients with a diagnosis of minimal HE should be treated: 38% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.13/5). If a diagnosis of minimal HE has been made it is reasonable to consider treatment, accepting the caveats above regarding uncertainties surrounding the endpoints of treatment and lack of licensed therapies. Such a decision should be taken in consultation with a specialist in liver diseases.

### Acute liver failure: a curable disease by 2024? [^683090ed]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last three decades acute liver failure (ALF) has been transformed from a rare and poorly understood condition with a near universally fatal outcome, to one with a well characterized phenotype and disease course. Complex critical care protocols are now applied and emergency liver transplantation (ELT) is an established treatment option. These improvements in care are such that the majority of patients may now be expected to survive (Fig. 1). Key features of the condition have changed dramatically over time, with a remarkable fall in the incidence of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, a much feared complication. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of key aspects of the classification, pathophysiology and management of ALF, and discuss the foreseeable challenges that will need to be addressed for further improvements to be achieved.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^eba6b140]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The recently published guidelines from the EASL/AASLD provide a framework for the diagnosis and management of patients with HE. Our opinion statements aim to define the role and responsibilities of all those healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and HE (Fig. 1). Although developed before the EASL/AASLD guidelines were published, the expert consensus opinion statements discussed here do not differ significantly from these guidelines.

In developing these statements we have acknowledged that making a definitive diagnosis of HE can be difficult. However, it is possible for all those healthcare providers who encounter patients with cirrhosis to identify cognitive impairment and be aware of HE in terms of the impact on patients. For those healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis we believe that it is reasonable that patients with suspected HE are referred to their gastroenterologist or liver specialist. It is then the responsibility of the primary provider (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) to ensure that appropriate clinical assessments are undertaken to make a diagnosis of overt HE. The use of psychometric and neurophysiological tests is essential to identify minimal HE, but the authors also felt they can be useful in the assessment of lower grades of overt HE. Gastroenterologists who have appropriate training and facilities/equipment should be prepared to supplement clinical assessment with such tests. If appropriate facilities or trained staff are not available, discussion with a liver specialist or liver unit should be considered. As HE is a decompensation event, such a discussion can be helpful to allow prompt consideration of whether the patient should be evaluated for liver transplantation.

### Unexpected clinical outcomes following the implementation of a standardised order set for hepatic encephalopathy [^e5f2698f]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were 30-day readmissions, in-hospital complications, in-hospital mortality and 90-day mortality. In-hospital complications included hypernatraemia (defined as serum sodium >145 mEq/L or an increase in serum sodium >5 mEq/L at any point in the hospital admission); hypokalaemia (defined as serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L at any point in the admission) and acute kidney injury (defined as an increase in serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL over 48 hours).

Study population

Patients were included in the study if they were admitted to the UMMC Hospital Medicine service with an International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 code for cirrhosis and HE or altered mental status in admission or discharge coding. All admissions for HE were validated by manual chart review by a single physician in accordance with the definition of HE provided in the current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guideline.Patients with a diagnosis code for HE that did not meet criteria for HE after chart review were excluded from this study.

Patients were also excluded if they were less than 18 years old; if they had previously received a liver transplant; if they were originally admitted for non-HE condition; if they were admitted to the ICU or any other service than Hospital Medicine; if they were admitted for another acute neurological condition (cerebrovascular accident, meningitis, acute intoxication, intracranial haemorrhage or seizure) or if they were placed on comfort care/hospice care during their hospitalisation.

Data acquisition

Patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity); hospitalisation data (admission and discharge dates, hospital readmission data, hospital admission unit); laboratory values; medications; co-morbid conditions and order-set utilisation data were obtained from the University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute’s clinical data repository via their Informatics Consulting Service. Aetiology of liver disease and precipitating factor for HE was obtained by manual chart review by a single physician.

### Alcohol associated liver disease 2020: a clinical practice guideline by the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) [^6d7a10fd]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Alcohol use disorder which includes alcohol abuse and dependence represents one of the leading risk factors for premature mortality in Europe and it is responsible of over 200 conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, chronic diseases, cancers and accidents leading to permanent disability. Alcohol use disorder represents the most common cause of liver damage in the Western world, with a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. The present clinical practice guidelines by the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) are focused on the current knowledge about epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of alcohol associated liver disease, aiming to provide practical recommendations on the management of this complex pathological condition.

GRADE system for evidence and recommendations—study-design levels, evidence quality, and recommendation strength are defined as follows: randomized, controlled trials are grade I; controlled trials without randomization are grade II-1; cohort or case-control analytic studies are grade II-2; multiple time series or dramatic uncontrolled experiments are grade II-3; and opinions of respected authorities or descriptive epidemiology are grade III. Evidence quality categories are High quality (A) with further research very unlikely to change confidence in the estimated effect, Moderate (B) where further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate effect and may change the estimate, and Low quality (C) where further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate effect and is likely to change the estimate and any change of estimate is uncertain. Recommendation strength is Strong (1), influenced by the quality of evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, and costs, and Weak (2), when there is variability in preferences and values or more uncertainty with less certainty, higher costs, or resource consumption.

### An educational tool for the prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy [^5079b4f0]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A structured educational session (HEEPF) providing information on HE pathophysiology, prevention and medical treatment was designed, with a view to help preventing HE-related hospitalisations. The usefulness of such programme was immediately evaluated by means of NIQ, and over the subsequent 12 months by a monthly telephone interview, to check for the occurrence of HE-related hospitalisations.

After the intervention, 70% of patients had acquired new information about the pathophysiology of HE, and 80% of them had improved their knowledge about HE prevention/treatment. These findings highlight two issues: (1) the limited awareness of these patients about their condition, which is in line with a previous reportand (2) the need to strengthen the communication between patients and physicians, at least within the context of the Italian healthcare system. In other diseases, educational approaches have been shown to enhance patients’ personal understanding, to improve long-term control of the disease, and also to improve evidence of the usefulness of pharmacological treatment.

Importantly, when the results were corrected for the severity of the clinical condition, HEEPF was shown to reduce the risk of HE recurrence over time. This was despite the high absolute number of HE events over the follow-up period. Although well-informed patients in group A could have avoided precipitant factors such as constipation or dehydration, factors such as infection or bleeding are obviously more difficult to prevent/control. Nonetheless, the number of ‘avoidable’ precipitants in both groups was similar. The fact that the AASLD/EASL Practice Guideline on HEstrongly encourages definition and recording of HE precipitants may help with similar studies in future, by way of clearer and better information in this respect in notes/medical records.

In addition, the AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelinehighlights the importance of the education of both patients and their relatives/caregivers. Caregivers have a crucial role in the healthcare process once the patient is discharged,hence new tools are being designed to help them detect episodes of HE.Similarly, the HEEPF could have been administered to both patients and their caregivers, or even only to caregivers. Indeed, one of the initial aims of the present study was to involve caregivers. However, very few patients were accompanied on the day of study, making enrolment impossible.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^af0d92fc]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance—purpose and scope states that there are approximately 800,000 hospitalizations a year for cirrhosis complications in the United States, and 7%–8% of these patients require intensive care at an estimated cost of $2 billion but without standardized intensive care protocols. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a term often applied to patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis with hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, most of whom require intensive care, and the document provides guidance and a data-supported approach for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with cirrhosis and ACLF as well as cirrhosis and critical illness; it differs from the AASLD Guidelines in that it was developed by consensus of an expert panel with oversight provided by the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee because there are an insufficient number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to support meaningful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The introduction describes traditional stages of cirrhosis as a compensated phase with no complications and a decompensated phase that manifests with complications of portal hypertension, notes that there is a more rapid phase, and states that in cirrhosis precipitating events leading to hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures (e.g., neurologic, respiratory, circulatory, renal) may be liver related or non–liver related (e.g., surgery), and often the precipitant is not identified.

### New assessment of hepatic encephalopathy [^fc0a8f89]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis that requires careful appraisal of the clinical manifestations, evaluation of the underlying neurological disorders, and assessment of liver function and the portal-systemic circulation. This article reviews recent developments in the assessment of HE and discusses the controversy regarding the use of a categorical or a continuous approach in measuring the severity of this condition. New scales facilitate effective monitoring and assessment of episodic HE. Neuropsychological test batteries and neurophysiological tests are of value for evaluating cognitive function in outpatients and can establish the diagnosis of minimal HE, and the severity of low-grade HE. These tools allow better evaluation of the origin of cognitive complaints and help in estimating the risk of accidents. It is now possible to complete the evaluation with measurement of the effects of cognitive impairment on daily living. In difficult cases, imaging of the brain and portal-systemic circulation with magnetic resonance imaging is especially helpful. Based on these studies, neurological signs and symptoms can be attributed to HE in patients with mild liver disease and in those with complex neurological manifestations. The new methods presented are also valuable for investigating the neurological manifestations occurring after liver transplantation.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^97ceca6c]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Delphi process

Strong levels of consensus were reached regarding the role of gastroenterologists and liver specialists in the clinical diagnosis of HE, with lower levels of consensus regarding the role of the family physician. There was also consensus that all patients with cirrhosis should be assessed, not only those with a history of decompensation. As shown, full consensus was not reached regarding the specific diagnostic test or tests that should be used, nor the treatment of an overt HE episode. In contrast, there was general consensus that secondary prophylaxis was appropriate. During the final teleconference, agreement was reached to develop the ‘recommendations’ below with all members of the Panel providing agreement. The relevant consensus statements and level of consensus are also provided for each recommendation.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications (...) [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Naltrexone, 50 mg daily Cholestyramine: efficacy data from trials enrolling people with cirrhosis are lacking but considered first-line therapy given safety Naltrexone: placebo-controlled RCT of 16 patients followed up for 4 wk; naltrexone significantly improved pruritus as measured by a 100-mm VAS of pruritus severity with a mean 54% reduction from baseline compared with an 8% with placebo. Cholestyramine: none observed in trials Naltrexone: 50% experienced 3 d of malaise with nausea; 62. 5% experienced mild abdominal cramps Sleep hygiene. Covert HE: deficits in executive function, sleep disorder, vegetative behavior, and gait disturbance Overt HE: asterixis, disorientation, lethargy, and coma Lactulose, 10-20 g, 2-3 times daily with goal of 2-3 soft bowel movements.

The most common causes of cirrhosis in the US, which can overlap, include alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C. Patients with cirrhosis experience symptoms including muscle cramps, pruritus, poor-quality sleep, and sexual dysfunction. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by liver biopsy but may also be diagnosed noninvasively. Elastography, a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness measured in kilopascals, can typically confirm cirrhosis at levels of 15 kPa or greater. Approximately 40% of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when they present with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. The median survival time following onset of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites is 0. 92 and
1. 1 years, respectively.

Among people with ascites, the annual incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is 11% and of hepatorenal syndrome is 8%; the latter is associated with a median survival of less than 2 weeks. Conclusions and Relevance Approximately 2. 2 million US adults have cirrhosis. Many symptoms, such as muscle cramps, poor-quality sleep, pruritus, and sexual dysfunction, are common and treatable. First-line therapies include carvedilol or propranolol to prevent variceal bleeding, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, combination aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics for ascites, and terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis are caused by alcohol use disorder, hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with many patients having overlapping causes.

4 However, hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antivirals and most newly diagnosed cirrhosis is due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder.
5. Outcomes for patients with cirrhosis can be improved with evidence-based therapies directed toward both the etiology of cirrhosis6-12 and its complications. 13-21 Recent innovations include noninvasive risk stratification of cirrhosis22, 23 as well as interventions that improve survival by preventing or reducing the complications of cirrhosis. 24 Such complications include variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. The causes of cirrhosis vary by context and many overlap. In a study of 68 673 patients from a national sample of patients in the Veterans Administration, the causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C, alcohol related, hepatitis C and alcohol related, NAFLD related (25. 9.

### Duration of the acute hepatic encephalopathy episode determines survival in cirrhotic patients [^2f65008a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical parameters and definitions

At enrollment, the following data were collected: clinical history (demographic data, previous disease, previous episodes of acute decompensation), physical examination, laboratory measurements and events that might be potential precipitating factors of HE, such as diuretic use (within 3 months prior to enrollment), presence of bacterial infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hyponatremia. Length of hospitalization and complications during hospitalization (infections, bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, recurrence of HE episode during hospitalization and presence of ACLF) were also recorded.

The time that a patient remained in overt HE (grade ⩾2) was defined as time in HE. Resolution of HE was defined as an improvement in the HE grade to grade 1 or to the absence of HE, as defined in the clinical guidelines. Data were recorded in 12 h time frames. A time in HE of 48 h was chosen as a cut-off based on the median (IQR 25–75) time of HE resolution among the whole cohort 48 h (24–96 h). A model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) cut-off of 15 was chosen in this study as an indicator of different liver disease severity. The cut-off was selected based on other studies showing a flat survival curve (with survival rates of 100% at 3 months) in patients with a MELD score below 15, while the survival curves started to decrease within patients with a MELD score >15 in a logarithmic manner.Moreover, other studies have showed a significant correlation between observed and predicted mortality curves among patients with a MELD score between 10 and 19.For Child–Pugh assessment only the hepatic synthetic and portal elements of Child–Pugh were used (modified Child–Pugh) due to the fact that all the patients included in the study presented with HE grade ⩾2 as per protocol. Three categories were assessed according to the punctuation category: A (4–6), B (7–9) and C (10–12).For the survival analyses HE was divided into two categories: moderate HE (grade 2) and severe HE (grades 3 and 4). Mortality and liver transplantation at 28, 90 and 365 days of follow up and causes of death were also recorded.

### Covert hepatic encephalopathy: not as minimal as you might think [^d0d7ca6f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive complication of acute and chronic liver disease. Symptoms are often overt (confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or coma) but can also be subtle (difficulty with cognitive abilities such as executive decision-making and psychomotor speed). There is consensus that HE is characterized as a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of brain disease, ranging from overt HE (OHE) to minimal HE (MHE). The West Haven Criteria are most often used to grade HE, with scores ranging from 0-4 (4 being coma). However, it is a challenge to diagnose patients with MHE or grade 1 HE; it might be practical to combine these entities and name them covert HE for clinical use. The severity of HE is associated with the stage of liver disease. Although the pathologic mechanisms of HE are not well understood, they are believed to involve increased levels of ammonia and inflammation, which lead to low-grade cerebral edema. A diagnosis of MHE requires dedicated psychometric tests and neurophysiological techniques rather than a simple clinical assessment. Although these tests can be difficult to perform in practice, they are cost effective and important; the disorder affects patients' quality of life, socioeconomic status, and driving ability and increases their risk for falls and the development of OHE. Patients with MHE are first managed by excluding other causes of neurocognitive dysfunction. Therapy with gut-specific agents might be effective. We review management strategies and important areas of research for MHE and covert HE.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications (...) [^6edc6463]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatic Encephalopathy Hepatic encephalopathy represents a potentially reversible decrease in neuropsychiatric function caused by acute and chronic liver disease, occurring predominantly in patients with portal hypertension. The onset often is insidious and is characterized by subtle and sometimes intermittent changes in memory, personality, concentration, and reaction times. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, all other etiologies of altered mental status must be effectively ruled out. Treatment goals for hepatic encephalopathy include provision of supportive care, identification and removal of precipitating factors, reduction in the nitrogenous load from the gut, and optimization of long-term therapy. . 7 Therapy should be directed toward improving mental status via bowel cleansing with lactulose orally or with enemas.

One randomized trial demonstrated that diets with normal protein content can be followed safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis, and that protein restriction has no beneficial effect during such episodes. 11In patients who are refractory to lactulose alone, neomycin can be added.

Increases in the ratio of plasma aromatic amino acids to branched-chain amino acids as a consequence of hepatic insufficiency also may contribute to encephalopathy. One meta-analysis suggested that mental recovery was consistently more rapid in patients whose treatment included a branched-chain amino acid infusion; three studies found lower mortality rates in patients who received this treatment, and two others suggested that the treatment increased mortality.

The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of variceal hemorrhage recommend that patients with cirrhosis who present with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo an urgent upper endoscopic evaluation. . 9 If no varices are observed, these patients should have repeat endoscopy at three-year intervals. If small varices are diagnosed, patients should have repeat surveillance at one-year intervals. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is aimed at reducing the portal pressure gradient, azygous blood f low, and variceal pressure. These guidelines also suggest that the most effective pharmacotherapy is propranolol at a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, increasing to 80 mg twice daily if necessary. 9If propranolol is contraindicated or not tolerated, isosorbide mononitrate at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily is the treatment of choice.

9Studies conducted since these guidelines have titrated the dosage of propranolol based on a reduction of the pulse rate by 25 percent. 15, 16. The goals of treatment in acute variceal bleeding include hemodynamic resuscitation, treatment of active bleeding, and prevention of rebleeding. Band ligation is the standard for the control of variceal bleeding. 9 If banding is difficult because of continued variceal bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors or a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube insertion may be used until TIPS or surgical treatment can be arranged.
9. TIPS has been shown to improve outcomes and is more cost-effective than endoscopic band ligation in reducing variceal bleeding, but it is associated with a higher risk of encephalopathy. After the cessation of active variceal hemorrhage, the subsequent six weeks carry a high risk of recurrent hemorrhage.

### Treatment of patients with hyperthyroidism and liver failure: a retrospective cohort study [^621e5685]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients and study design

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with hyperthyroidism and Liver failure treated at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 2013 and December 2022. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University ([2019]02-293-01). It was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent.

Hyperthyroidism was defined as high free thyroxine (FT4) levels, free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) or total T3 levels, and low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Liver failure was defined as jaundice (serum bilirubin levels > 5 mg/dL) and coagulopathy (international normalized ratio [INR] > 1.5, prothrombin activity < 40%), complicated with ascites and/or encephalopathy as determined by physical examination within 4 weeks, in compliance with the consensus recommendations of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver issued in 2019. The assessment of ascites includes medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, abdominal imaging, and diagnostic abdominal paracentesis. The classification of HE is based on the severity of the underlying liver disease and/or presence of portosystemic shunting, the severity and time course of mental alterations and any identified precipitating events.

Patients with previous major adverse reactions to ATDs, thyroid storm, drug-induced liver injury, severe infection, malignant tumors, failure of another organ, obstructive jaundice, coagulation dysfunction caused by another disease, serious extrahepatic diseases or missing follow-up or missing important data were excluded from the study.

Those patients treated with 131 I would all receive ALSS, but patients treated with MMI received ALSS treatment or not depending on patients’ willingness and their financial status. So the enrolled patients were divided into three groups: those treated with the ATD methimazole (MMI) received low-dose MMI (10 mg/d) therapy after admission plus ALSS (n = 31), those treated with 131 I plus ALSS (n = 16) (the patients accepted 131 I therapy within 7 days after being admitted to hospital and commencing a low-iodine diet), and those treated with MMI received low-dose MMI (10 mg/d) therapy after admission alone (n = 90).

### Development and validation of risk prediction model for bacterial infections in acute liver failure patients [^81817a6f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a severe clinical condition characterized by rapid elevation of aminotransferases, altered mental status, and coagulation abnormalities. This rare, highly heterogeneous, and potentially reversible disease has an incidence ranging from 1 to 2-3000 cases per million people per year in the United States, with a mortality rate of up to 30%. The management of ALF is complex and challenging, necessitating early diagnosis, and intervention to mitigate mortality. Previous studies have identified several independent predictive risk factors for ALF, including age, etiology, comorbidities, the severity of hepatic encephalopathy, timing and methods of treatment, and the presence of concurrent infections, among others.

Immunological dysfunction is frequently observed in ALF patients, initially presenting as immune hyperactivation and subsequently progressing to immune paralysis, rendering them vulnerable to secondary infections. Bacterial infections, occurring late in around 35–40% of ALF patients (>5 days after admission), are a significant contributor to mortality.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on acute-on-chronic liver failure [^0774bea2]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which was described relatively recently (2013), is a severe form of acutely decompensated cirrhosis characterised by the existence of organ system failure(s) and a high risk of short-term mortality. ACLF is caused by an excessive systemic inflammatory response triggered by precipitants that are clinically apparent (e.g., proven microbial infection with sepsis, severe alcohol-related hepatitis) or not. Since the description of ACLF, some important studies have suggested that patients with ACLF may benefit from liver transplantation and because of this, should be urgently stabilised for transplantation by receiving appropriate treatment of identified precipitants, and full general management, including support of organ systems in the intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of the present Clinical Practice Guidelines is to provide recommendations to help clinicians recognise ACLF, make triage decisions (ICU vs. no ICU), identify and manage acute precipitants, identify organ systems that require support or replacement, define potential criteria for futility of intensive care, and identify potential indications for liver transplantation. Based on an in-depth review of the relevant literature, we provide recommendations to navigate clinical dilemmas followed by supporting text. The recommendations are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system and categorised as 'weak' or 'strong'. We aim to provide the best available evidence to aid the clinical decision-making process in the management of patients with ACLF.
