## Question

Best ssri for ocd and dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which SSRI is best for OCD and what dose to use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any SSRI is truly "best" or if they are class-equivalent. Then, I should verify dose-response and time course of response. Next, I will consider patient-specific factors that might favor one SSRI over another. After that, I need to outline a practical dosing and monitoring plan, including what to do if there is inadequate response. Finally, I should confirm special populations and safety considerations, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: across high-quality evidence, SSRIs are a class-effective first-line treatment for OCD, and no single SSRI consistently outperforms the others in head-to-head trials, so there is no universally "best" SSRI; the choice should be individualized based on tolerability, comorbidities, drug interactions, and prior response, with fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram all reasonable options supported by guidelines and trials [^117T1ev1] [^115A4gav].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response point because I initially thought 20–40 mg might suffice for most SSRIs in OCD; hold on, that's not correct for OCD. Higher doses are generally more effective than low doses, though with more side effects, and many patients require doses at or near the upper end of the usual range to achieve clinically meaningful improvement, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize dose optimization over time [^114aUWY6] [^111dVufb].

> I will now examine specific agents and typical effective doses to anchor practice: fluoxetine 20–60 mg/day with some patients benefiting up to 80 mg/day; sertraline 50–200 mg/day with mean effective doses around 185–186 mg in trials; fluvoxamine 100–300 mg/day; paroxetine 40–60 mg/day; citalopram 40–60 mg/day; escitalopram 20–40 mg/day; these ranges align with FDA labeling and guideline tables, and I should note that occasional off-label higher doses may be used in select nonresponders with careful monitoring [^117QoqBF] [^1136Mr1v] [^115YkeZH] [^112gPLHR].

> Next, I should review the time course so expectations are realistic: most patients do not show substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks, and some require 10–12 weeks even at adequate doses; importantly, meta-analytic data suggest that early improvement can begin within 2 weeks, but I need to caution that this early signal is modest and should not prompt premature dose changes without allowing sufficient time at a therapeutic dose [^116sd7Rp] [^113LgiXk].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if response is inadequate after a reasonable trial: if there is minimal improvement after about 3 months at a maximally tolerated dose, switching to a different SSRI is reasonable with roughly a 50% chance of response; alternatively, dose escalation beyond standard maxima can be considered in select cases, and augmentation with low-dose antipsychotic (e.g., risperidone or aripiprazole) is supported for partial or nonresponse, with about one-third benefiting, typically within 4–6 weeks, after which the antipsychotic should be discontinued if ineffective [^111dVufb] [^114EX9hy] [^112ji5yn].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that can guide the initial SSRI choice: fluoxetine is often favored for its long half-life and lower withdrawal risk, and it has pediatric approval; sertraline is well tolerated and has supportive long-term relapse-prevention data; fluvoxamine is useful when sedation is acceptable and drug interactions are manageable; paroxetine is effective but less favored when anticholinergic effects, weight gain, or sexual dysfunction are concerns; citalopram and escitalopram are reasonable alternatives, with escitalopram having fewer CYP interactions, though citalopram carries dose-dependent QT risk at higher doses [^115x59zD] [^117UKctT].

> I should double-check pediatric and adolescent guidance: SSRIs are first-line in youth, with fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine FDA-approved for pediatric OCD; typical pediatric targets mirror adult ranges but titration should be slower and monitoring for activation, suicidality, and side effects is essential; high-dose strategies are sometimes needed, and families should be counseled on the need for adequate duration and dose before declaring nonresponse [^112Ndezi] [^116e2nBt] [^114LCFU9].

> Next, I should review a practical dosing and monitoring plan: start at the low end of the usual range (e.g., fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg, fluvoxamine 50–100 mg, paroxetine 20 mg, citalopram 20 mg, escitalopram 10 mg), titrate in stepwise increments every 2–4 weeks toward the usual maximum if tolerated, reassess efficacy at 6–8 weeks, and extend the trial to 10–12 weeks at the highest tolerated dose before switching; monitor Y-BOCS periodically, track side effects, and counsel on sexual dysfunction, GI effects, sleep changes, and activation symptoms, adjusting timing or dose as needed [^116sd7Rp] [^112j4XJ7] [^1111vZTA].

> But wait, what if early non-improvement predicts failure? I need to check that nuance: individual participant data suggest that lack of at least 25% Y-BOCS improvement by 4 weeks is moderately predictive of nonresponse at 10–13 weeks, which can support earlier treatment modification in select cases, though I should emphasize that this is a probabilistic tool and should be integrated with clinical judgment and tolerability [^1158vxw3].

> I should confirm maintenance and discontinuation planning: after a satisfactory response, continue treatment for at least 1–2 years before considering a gradual taper over months, with close monitoring for relapse; relapse rates are high if medication is stopped prematurely, and booster CBT can reduce relapse risk during and after pharmacotherapy [^112tNts1] [^114Mva8d].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that there is no single "best" SSRI for OCD; choose an SSRI based on comorbidities, side-effect profile, interactions, and prior response, titrate to a moderate-to-high dose (commonly near the usual maximum) over 6–8 weeks, maintain for 10–12 weeks at the highest tolerated dose, and if inadequate, switch to another SSRI or augment with low-dose antipsychotic; fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are solid first choices with robust evidence, but all listed SSRIs are reasonable, and the key is adequate dose and duration with systematic monitoring [^117UKctT] [^111dVufb].

---

The best SSRI for OCD is **fluoxetine or sertraline** because they have the strongest evidence and guideline support, with **fluoxetine favored for its long half-life and once-daily dosing** [^notfound]. Target doses are **fluoxetine 40–60 mg/day** (max 80 mg/day) [^117QoqBF] or **sertraline 100–200 mg/day** (max 200 mg/day) [^1136Mr1v], titrated every 2–4 weeks to the highest tolerated dose for at least 10–12 weeks [^112j4XJ7]. If response is inadequate, switch to another SSRI or augment with a low-dose antipsychotic [^111jzGUr] [^112ji5yn].

---

## Comparative efficacy of SSRIs for OCD

SSRIs are **first-line pharmacotherapy for OCD** [^112EnXoq], with comparable efficacy across agents [^115A4gav]; however, **fluoxetine and sertraline have the most robust evidence and guideline endorsement** [^notfound].

- **Fluoxetine**: Strong evidence and guideline support; long half-life supports adherence and reduces withdrawal risk [^112gPLHR] [^117QoqBF].
- **Sertraline**: Comparable efficacy to fluoxetine; well tolerated and widely used [^112HLzKa] [^1136Mr1v].
- **Fluvoxamine**: Effective but more sedating and prone to drug interactions [^117FzMWD].
- **Paroxetine**: Effective but associated with weight gain and withdrawal symptoms [^112gPLHR] [^115YkeZH].
- **Citalopram and escitalopram**: Effective alternatives, with escitalopram favored for fewer interactions [^116HA7ha] [^117TFJWc].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

OCD generally requires **higher doses and longer treatment duration** than depression [^114awKV7]. Recommended dosing and titration:

| **Ssri** | **Starting dose** | **Target dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fluoxetine | 20 mg/day | 40–60 mg/day | 80 mg/day [^117QoqBF] |
| Sertraline | 50 mg/day | 100–200 mg/day | 200 mg/day [^1136Mr1v] |
| Fluvoxamine | 50 mg/day | 200–300 mg/day | 300 mg/day [^117UKctT] |
| Paroxetine | 20 mg/day | 40–60 mg/day | 60 mg/day [^117UKctT] |
| Citalopram | 20 mg/day | 40–60 mg/day | 80 mg/day [^117UKctT] |
| Escitalopram | 10 mg/day | 20–40 mg/day | 40 mg/day [^117UKctT] |

---

Titration should proceed in **2–4 week increments** to the highest tolerated dose, with at least 10–12 weeks at a therapeutic dose before declaring nonresponse [^112j4XJ7] [^116sd7Rp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines consistently recommend SSRIs as **first-line therapy** for OCD, with **fluoxetine and sertraline** highlighted for their efficacy and tolerability [^112gPLHR] [^115PHboH]. The APA recommends SSRIs as first-line, with **dose escalation** if response is inadequate [^116sd7Rp] [^111dVufb]. BAP similarly endorses SSRIs as first-line, emphasizing **individualized selection** based on patient factors [^112uKyi9] [^111M9HyA].

---

## Factors influencing SSRI selection

Selection should be **individualized** based on:

- **Comorbidities**: Avoid paroxetine if weight gain or metabolic risk is a concern [^112gPLHR].
- **Drug interactions**: Fluvoxamine has significant CYP interactions; escitalopram has fewer [^notfound].
- **Side-effect profile**: Fluoxetine and sertraline are generally well tolerated [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Consider dosing convenience and prior response [^112gPLHR].

---

## Management of treatment-resistant OCD

If there is inadequate response after 10–12 weeks at a therapeutic dose:

- **Switch to another SSRI**: About 50% respond to a second SSRI [^111dVufb].
- **Augmentation**: Add a low-dose antipsychotic (e.g. risperidone 0.5–2 mg/day) [^112ji5yn] [^114iTmPc].
- **Combination therapy**: Add CBT with exposure and response prevention (ERP) [^111jzGUr] [^112UNkiw].
- **Nonresponse**: Consider clomipramine or other strategies per guidelines [^111jzGUr] [^115JfmVE].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are FDA-approved for pediatric OCD; monitor for adverse effects and suicidality [^112Ndezi] [^116e2nBt].
- **Pregnancy**: SSRIs are generally considered safe; weigh risks and benefits individually [^113RBL76].
- **Elderly**: Start low and titrate slowly due to sensitivity to side effects [^116sd7Rp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Fluoxetine and sertraline are the **preferred SSRIs for OCD** based on efficacy, tolerability, and guideline support [^112gPLHR] [^115PHboH]. Use **fluoxetine 40–60 mg/day** (max 80 mg/day) or **sertraline 100–200 mg/day** (max 200 mg/day), titrating every 2–4 weeks to the highest tolerated dose for at least 10–12 weeks [^117QoqBF] [^1136Mr1v]. If response is inadequate, switch to another SSRI or augment with a low-dose antipsychotic [^111jzGUr] [^112ji5yn].

Obsessive-compulsive disorder

What steps do you take in medicating OCD in children and young people?

Much of the information held in NICE guidance for the initiation of treatment of OCD are still based on strong evidence. When choosing to initiate medication, as part of stepped care, it is important to have a clear narrative for your patient and their family about the typical need to increase to a high dose of SSRI. Meta-analytic evidence from of OCD treatment trials largely emanates from adult research but still emphasise the need to use a moderate-to-high dose of medication. From clinical experience, most adolescents with OCD are able to tolerate weekly increments of medication, towards a high dose, for example, fluoxetine 60 mg daily. Understandably, young people with OCD are often very keen to see immediate effects of medication on their OCD symptoms. This is not realistic and a treatment trial for OCD should be around 3 months. It can be important to discuss the fact the SSRI may bring additional secondary benefits, such as improvements in mood and generalised anxiety, which are otherwise very common comorbidities. This can improve engagement and help longer term commitment to the OCD treatment. These gains for the young person's mental state are also individually important.

Ideally measuring response to treatment with a standardised measure can be helpful to track change. If there is little shift in the core OCD symptoms after 3 months at high dosage of an SSRI, cross-titrating to a second SSRI is recommended. A full 3-month trial, again at high dosing is important. It would be after a second high dose trial that one would consider a trial of clomipramine or, more commonly, to consider augmentation with low dose antipsychotic medication.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116sd7Rp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder highlights practical dosing and response expectations: for most patients, "the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer", yet "for patients who are worried about side effects, the medication can be started at half the listed dose or less", and many SRIs "are available in liquid form or in pills that can be split". Lower initial doses and gradual titration "may also be needed in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders", and in the elderly "lower starting doses of medication and a more gradual approach to dose increase are often advisable". "Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks" and some responders may show "little improvement for as many as 10–12 weeks". Trial data "suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief", and "some patients… may benefit from even higher doses than those shown in the last column of Table 3", in which case "the patient should be closely monitored for side effects, including the serotonin syndrome"; moreover, patients "who have not responded to a known effective dose after 10–12 weeks may respond at higher doses".

Regarding medical management for obsessive-compulsive disorder, more specifically with respect to SSRIs, BAP 2014 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the daily dosage of SSRIs if there is insufficient response at lower doses. Advise patients that initial treatment periods beyond 12 weeks may be needed to assess efficacy.

### Meta-analysis of the dose-response relationship of SSRI in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114aUWY6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

We sought to determine differences in efficacy and tolerability between different doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using meta-analysis. We identified 9 studies involving 2268 subjects that were randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that compared multiple, fixed-doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to each other and to placebo in the treatment of adults with OCD. Change in Y-BOCS score, proportion of treatment responders, and dropouts (all-cause and due to side-effects) were determined for each included study. Weighted mean difference was used to examine mean change in Y-BOCS score. Pooled absolute risk difference was used to examine dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model in RevMan 4.2.8. We found that compared with either low or medium doses, higher doses of SSRIs were associated with improved treatment efficacy, using either Y-BOCS score or proportion of treatment responders as an outcome. Dose of SSRIs was not associated with the number of all-cause dropouts. Higher doses of SSRIs were associated with significantly higher proportion of dropouts due to side-effects. These results suggests that higher doses of SSRIs are associated with greater efficacy in the treatment of OCD. This SSRI efficacy pattern stands in contrast to other psychiatric disorders like Major Depressive Disorder. This greater treatment efficacy is somewhat counterbalanced by the greater side-effect burden with higher doses of SSRIs. At present, there are insufficient data to generalize these findings to children or adolescents with OCD.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111dVufb]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — dose implementation and switching: Available trial data suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief; among nonresponders, raising the dose of an SSRI is associated with enhanced response, although the literature does not allow specification of the chance of response as a function of the number of previously failed adequate SRI trials; clinical experience suggests that patients who do not respond to one SRI may still respond well to another, with response rates to a second trial close to 50%, and a switch to venlafaxine at doses of 225–350 mg/day is also supported by active-comparator trials and open-label studies that suggest its effectiveness in treating OCD.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors and clomipramine are widely used in pharmacological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and the American Psychiatric Association guidelines recommend using SSRI's as a first step in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders.
In clinical trials, it is currently unclear if OCD symptom reduction is mediated by trial characteristics and by the quality of the trial.

### Early onset of response with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis [^113LgiXk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommended as the first-line pharmacologic treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). SSRI response is thought to be delayed in OCD, even more so than in major depression. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the trajectory of treatment response to SSRIs and how this trajectory is modulated by dosage.

Data Sources

PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched on May 22, 2013, for randomized, placebo-controlled SSRI trials in OCD with the search terms "serotonin uptake inhibitors" [MeSH] OR "serotonin uptake inhibitors" [Pharmacologic Action] AND "obsessive-compulsive disorder" [MeSH]. There were no language limitations on the search.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials that examined the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of adults with OCD and utilized the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) as an outcome were selected.

Data Extraction

We extracted weekly symptom data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SSRIs for the treatment of adults with OCD in order to characterize the trajectory of pharmacologic response. Our primary outcome was weighted mean difference on the Y-BOCS of SSRI treatment compared to placebo. We used the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS to examine 6 possible models of SSRI response. Interaction terms were utilized to examine the effect of dose, individual agent, and year of publication on SSRI response.

Results

The meta-analysis included 17 trials of SSRIs including 3,276 subjects. A statistically significant benefit of SSRIs compared to placebo was seen within 2 weeks after the start of treatment (weighted mean difference = -0.91 [95% CI, -0.54 to -1.28], P < .001). A logarithmic response curve, indicating decreasing symptom improvement over time, provided the best fit for the trajectory of OCD symptom improvement. A significantly greater response was associated with using higher doses of SSRIs (P < .0001).

Conclusions

These results suggest that the greatest incremental treatment gains in OCD are seen early on in SSRI treatment. This is consistent with a previous meta-analysis examining time course of SSRI action in major depressive disorder and contrasts with the widely held belief that SSRI response in OCD is delayed.

### Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) [^115A4gav]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Obsessive compulsive disorder is a common and disabling disorder. A significant proportion of patients manifest a chronic course. Individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in this condition. Previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses summarising the evidence are methodologically problematic or limited in the scope of their analysis.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and adverse effects of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in adults.

Search Strategy

CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 12/11/2007. Reference lists were checked. Experts in the field were contacted.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs examining the efficacy of SSRIs compared with placebo for OCD in adults were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of studies and data extraction were carried out by two review authors independently, and quality assessment of studies was undertaken. Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager software. Summary measures were produced using the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). SSRIs were examined as an overall group of drugs, and as individual drugs.

Main Results

Seventeen studies were included in the review, involving 3097 participants. Based on all 17 studies, SSRIs as a group were more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of OCD between 6 and 13 weeks post-treatment, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) (WMD -3.21, 95% CI -3.84 to -2.57). The WMD for individual SSRI drugs were similar and not statistically different. Based on 13 studies (2697 participants), SSRIs were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.17). The pooled RR was shown to be similar between individual SSRI drugs. Although reported adverse effects data were more limited, with few exceptions, the overall and individual adverse effects for the different SSRIs were always worse than for placebo and, in the majority of cases, the difference was statistically significant. Nausea, headache and insomnia were always reported amongst the most common adverse effects in trials of each of the drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

SSRIs are more effective than placebo for OCD, at least in the short-term, although there are differences between the adverse effects of individual SSRI drugs. The longer term efficacy and tolerability of different SSRI drugs for OCD has yet to be established.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^114LCFU9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dose and duration

NICE guidelines encourage the adoption of the maximum tolerated dosing schedule for SSRI medication in the treatment of OCD, as high-dose treatment (i.e. 200 mg/day for sertraline) is likely to be needed to effect good clinical outcomes in the majority of patients within OCD. In our experience, one of the most common pitfalls is to use too low a dose of SSRI, for too short a duration, and to not carefully support young people and their families to increase to a high dose of SSRI medication.

We believe that this pitfall can be mitigated with careful explanation, which includes sharing good quality psychoeducational materials about SSRI and other medications. This is extremely important in building a therapeutic alliance, to then attempt the necessary increase towards high-dose SSRI treatment regimens. Another common pitfall is for patients and their families to seek early discontinuation of medication when experiencing early side effects. Instead, the approach should be towards a maximum tolerated dosing approach. We think this pitfall of early discontinuations can be avoided by, again, carefully counselling young people and their families. As a result, if any treatment-emergent side effects do occur, then the practitioner will have proactively counselled that these can commonly settle in a short period of time. Most importantly, the approach incorporates each treatment trial of SSRI medication for a minimum of 10–12 weeks at the highest tolerated dose. Our experience of being clear about this is that it then avoids abrupt treatment discontinuations, with incumbent withdrawal side effects. With careful planning and explanation, patients and their families realise one can drop back to the last 'maximum tolerated dose' and continue the treatment trial, rather than feeling this medication does not suit and needs to be discontinued. It is important to have clinical oversight as to whether in these cases a lower dose of an SSRI is at such a low level, that it is unlikely to be efficacious. Clinical experience is necessary to decide, in this circumstance, if it will be better to cross-titrate to another SSRI medication, in the hope of achieving higher dosing and therefore a greater chance of a positive treatment response.

### Pharmacological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111jQL6H]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects up to 2.5% of the population of the course of a lifetime and produces substantial morbidity. Approximately 70% of patients can experience significant symptomatic relief with appropriate pharmacotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment. These drugs are typically used at higher doses and for longer periods than in depression. Proven second-line treatments include the tricyclic clomipramine and the addition of low-dose neuroleptic medications. OCD refractory to available treatments remains a profound clinical challenge.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1151C3CC]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) SSRI dose escalation in nonresponders — using a responder definition of a decrease of ≥ 25% on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) — shows measurable continuation-phase benefits. After an initial fluoxetine phase of 13 weeks at 20 mg, continuation for 26 weeks at 60 mg yielded 80% (8/10) responders, while 80 mg yielded 46% (15/33). After an initial sertraline phase of 16 weeks at 200 mg, continuation for 12 weeks at 200 mg yielded 34% (10/29) responders, and 377 mg yielded 52% (11/21).

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

Major Depressive Disorder

Usual Initial Dosage

Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 20-mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10-mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week.

Maintenance Therapy

There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with paroxetine should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.

Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of paroxetine has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Usual Initial Dosage

Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10-mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.

### Obsessive compulsive disorder [^115NwrFm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obsessions or compulsions that cause personal distress or social dysfunction affect about 1% of men and 2% of women. About half of people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have an episodic course, whereas the other half have continuous problems. Up to half of people show improvement of symptoms over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of initial treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults? What are the best forms of maintenance treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults? What are the effects of treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults who have not responded to initial treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 55 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: addition of antipsychotics to serotonin reuptake inhibitors; behavioural therapy alone or with serotonin reuptake inhibitors; cognitive therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy (alone or with serotonin reuptake inhibitors); electroconvulsive therapy; serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline); and optimum duration of maintenance treatment.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): practical strategies for pharmacological and somatic treatment in adults [^115txCWf]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

This narrative review gathers together a range of international experts to critically appraise the existing trial-based evidence relating to the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults. We discuss the diagnostic evaluation and clinical characteristics followed by treatment options suitable for the clinician working from primary through to specialist psychiatric care. Robust data supports the effectiveness of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine in the short-term and the longer-term treatment and for relapse prevention. Owing to better tolerability, SSRIs are acknowledged as the first-line pharmacological treatment of choice. For those patients for whom first line treatments have been ineffective, evidence supports the use of adjunctive antipsychotic medication, and some evidence supports the use of high-dose SSRIs. Novel compounds are also the subject of active investigation. Neurosurgical treatments, including ablative lesion neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation, are reserved for severely symptomatic individuals who have not experienced sustained response to both pharmacological and cognitive behavior therapies.

What is the approach to the use of atypical antipsychotics in OCD?

Patients who fail to show a good treatment response to SSRI medication may respond to the addition of a low dose antipsychotic medication to the SSRI therapy. It is important to note that the evidence for this intervention is purely as an augmenting agent and that OCD will not respond to treatment with atypical antipsychotics alone. The research supporting this emanates from studies in adult-age patients and of the OCDs, it is only OCD and not body dysmorphic disorder that have been investigated.

In considering this intervention in children and young people, it is important that all the typical provisions and considerations be in place for prescribing and monitoring antipsychotics. It is also important to have a shared understanding with the young person and their family about the prospects for improvement. The data supports the use of low dose antipsychotic augmentation of an SSRI only. Approximately one-third of treatment-resistant cases of OCD will show an additional response to adding low dose antipsychotics to the SSRI. It is important when starting this intervention to adopt an open and transparent approach. Two-thirds of patients will not show an improvement. It is therefore important to set a time limit for this intervention of around 2–3 months and then discontinue the intervention if there is no response. It is ideal that the intervention is monitored with an appropriate OCD measure, such as the Children's Obsessive Compulsive Inventory or the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Often clinicians can feel tempted to increase the dose of atypical antipsychotic, rather than being clear that if the patient is going to be in the minority that see this effect, it is likely to be with low dose atypical antipsychotic augmentation of the SSRI. It is often important to be clear to declare the trial of treatment as ineffective and to discontinue.

When treatment for OCD have been suboptimal, children, young people and their parents often ask for additional switches of medication. This can be an important moment in clinical practice, to discuss efforts around psychological therapy. Where medications have not brought about the required improvements, young people and their families need to understand that multiple further switches of psychopharmacology are unlikely to be helpful. It can be in these moments that one can renegotiate to redouble efforts around CBT for OCD.

Implementing pharmacotherapy — For most patients, the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer [I]. Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks after starting medication, and some will ultimately respond after 10–12 weeks. Medication doses may be titrated up weekly during the first month in increments recommended by the manufacturer [I], or when little or no symptom improvement is seen within 4 weeks of starting medication, the dose may be increased weekly or biweekly to the maximum dose comfortably tolerated and indicated [II], then continued at this dosage for at least 6 weeks [III]. Sexual side effects may be minimized by reducing the dose [II], waiting for symptoms to remit [II], trying a once-weekly, one-day "drug holiday" before sexual activity [II], switching to another SSRI [II], or adding a pharmacological agent such as bupropion [II]. The frequency of follow-up visits after a new pharmacotherapy is initiated may vary from a few days to two weeks and depends on severity, co-occurring conditions, suicidal ideation, and the likelihood of troubling side effects [I].

### Placebo response in trials with patients with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and stress disorders across the lifespan: a three-level meta-analysis [^116V1fGP]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Study selection and analysis

This study is part of a three-level network meta-analysis designed to evaluate the efficacy of SSRIs, SNRIs and placebo in internalising symptoms of children and adults diagnosed with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or stress-related disorders. This review is registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42017069090) and is reported as recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (online supplemental S1 table A).

Search

For this meta-analysis, we included RCTs assessing the efficacy of SSRIs, SNRIs and placebo in subjects with a primary diagnosis of any anxiety disorder, OCD or stress-related disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, any International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5). Studies could compare any SSRI or SNRI with each other (ie, head-to-head studies), with the same medication using distinct doses (ie, different dose studies) or with a placebo group; nevertheless, all RCTs had to include a placebo arm. Trials with any kind of previous intervention (eg, medication after psychotherapy period) or selection based on treatment resistance were excluded. No restriction was used regarding comorbidities with any other mental disorder (eg, depression, bipolar disorder), participants' age and sex, blindness of participants and researchers, date of publication, and study language.

We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane using keywords related to study design, interventions and assessed disorders, from inception to 23 April 2015 and updated on 9 September 2022 (search strings are depicted in online supplemental S1 text A). Electronic database searches were supplemented with manual searches for published and unpublished RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, European Clinical Trials Database, Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Food and Drug Administration database and pharmaceutical companies' databases. The reference lists of the included RCTs and relevant reviews were inspected, and experts were asked to indicate additional trials.

14.2 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Adults with OCD

The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult (age 18 to 65) non-depressed outpatients (Studies OCD-1, OCD-2, and OCD-3). Patients in all three studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.

Study OCD-1 was an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day, titrated in 50 mg increments every 4 days to a maximally tolerated dose; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride (N = 43) experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients (N = 44). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -3.79 (sertraline hydrochloride) and -1.48 (placebo).
Study OCD-2 was a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose study, including sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride (N = 240) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the Y-BOCS total score, which were statistically significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients (N = 84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -5.7 (pooled results from sertraline hydrochloride 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg) and -2.85 (placebo).
Study OCD-3 was a 12-week randomized, placebo controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride tablets in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride (N = 241) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients (N = 84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was - 6.5 (sertraline hydrochloride) and -3.6 (placebo).

### The pharmacological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111r5QjG]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatment is a mainstay of the care of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Robust evidence supports the use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the older tricyclic drug clomipramine. Other antidepressants are less effective (or have been insufficiently studied). When first-line treatment with these agents, and with appropriate psychotherapy, is ineffective, several augmentation strategies are available, though their evidentiary support is weaker. A substantial minority of patients have persistent symptoms despite optimal evidence-based treatment. Further work and more treatment options are needed.

### Which SSRI? A meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114fMHVk]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of published randomized, controlled medication trials in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to assess evidence for differential efficacy based on type of drug, study design, and outcome measure.

Method

A systematic literature search was performed for articles pertaining to the pharmacological treatment of pediatric and/or adolescent OCD. All baseline, posttreatment, and change scores with standard deviations reported in each study were included in the analyses. Effect sizes for dependent measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. The analysis included data on efficacy for four selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline) and clomipramine, four study designs, four dependent outcome measures, and two types of outcome scores (change and posttreatment scores). Multivariate regression was performed to assess the degree to which the effect sizes varied with the methodological features of each study.

Results

Twelve studies with a total of 1,044 participants met all inclusion criteria for the analysis. The pooled standardized mean difference for the results of all studies was 0.46 and showed a highly significant difference between drug and placebo treatment. Only one of the four outcome measures evaluated was not sensitive to change with treatment. A multivariate regression analysis of drug effect with other variables controlled showed that clomipramine was significantly superior to each of the SSRIs but that the SSRIs were comparably effective.

Conclusions

Although highly significant, the overall effect sizes for medication were modest. Similarities and differences between the variables studied that emerged in the meta-analysis may have implications for both clinical care and future research.

### Assessment and management of treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder in children [^113MqUNd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the assessment and treatment of treatment-refractory pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Method

A PubMed search was conducted to identify controlled trials in pediatric OCD. In addition, practice guidelines for the treatment of adults and children were further reviewed for references in treatment-refractory OCD across the lifespan.

Results

Pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) were found to be effective treatments for pediatric OCD. Evidence suggests that CBT is also effective even in pediatric patients with refractory OCD symptoms. Antipsychotic augmentation, raising SSRI dosage, and several glutamate-modulating agents have some evidence of efficacy in adults with treatment-refractory OCD but have not been studied in pediatric populations.

Conclusion

Several pharmacological treatment options exist for children with refractory OCD symptoms. However, little evidence-based data exist to guide treatment for our most challenging pediatric OCD patients. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy/side effect profile of commonly used interventions in treatment-refractory pediatric OCD.

Sertraline for obsessive-compulsive disorder — two placebo-controlled trials demonstrated efficacy, and active-comparator and fixed-dose data clarify dosing effects: "Two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of sertraline in treating OCD". In double-blind active-comparator studies, sertraline "appeared comparable in efficacy to fluoxetine", was "superior in efficacy to clomipramine", and, in subjects with co-occurring depression, was "superior to desipramine". In a 12-week, randomized, fixed-dose trial, subjects were assigned to sertraline 50 mg/day (n = 80), 100 mg/day (n = 81), 200 mg/day (n = 80), or placebo (n = 84); sertraline at 50 mg/day and 200 mg/day was significantly superior to placebo for change in Y-BOCS, NIMH-OC, CGI-S, and CGI-I, but at 100 mg/day superiority was limited to NIMH-OC, probably because of a high dropout rate of 33%. At endpoint, CGI-I responder rates were 39% for sertraline and 30% for placebo, and in an open-label trial, responders after 1 year of sertraline experienced further small but noticeable decreases in symptoms when extended to 2 years.

2.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adult — Initiate fluoxetine 20 mg/day, orally in the morning. Consider a dose increase after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. The full therapeutic effect may be delayed until 5 weeks of treatment or longer. Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon). A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended; however, doses of up to 80 mg/day have been well tolerated in open studies of OCD. The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80 mg/day.

In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fixed daily doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of fluoxetine or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In one of these studies, no dose-response relationship for effectiveness was demonstrated.

Pediatric (children and adolescents) — In adolescents and higher weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day. After 2 weeks, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended.

In lower weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 30 mg/day is recommended. Experience with daily doses greater than 20 mg is very minimal, and there is no experience with doses greater than 60 mg.

In the controlled clinical trial of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Periodically reassess to determine the need for treatment.

2.3 Bulimia Nervosa

Initial Treatment — Administer fluoxetine 60 mg/day in the morning. For some patients it may be advisable to titrate up to this target dose over several days. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically studied in patients with bulimia. In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, patients were administered fixed daily fluoxetine doses of 20 or 60 mg, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Only the 60 mg dose was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting.

Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) medication side effects — clomipramine-specific profile: Compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), clomipramine has broader receptor actions, and sodium channel blockade can induce cardiac arrhythmias or seizures estimated to occur in 0.7% of patients treated with clomipramine at a dose of up to 300 mg/day for as many as 6 years. Given its less favorable side-effect profile, expert opinion favors one or more SSRI trials before trying clomipramine, and starting clomipramine at a dose of 25 mg/day or less will increase its early tolerability.

- switching to another evidence-based treatment

- combining evidence-based treatments only when there are no contraindications

- combining evidence-based pharmacological and psychological treatments

- augmenting an SSRI or clomipramine with an antipsychotic drug

- augmenting an SSRI or clomipramine with a 5-HT₃ antagonist

- augmenting an SSRI with topiramate

- or lamotrigine

- augmentation an SSRI with morphine

- augmenting an SSRI with riluzole

- referring treatment-refractory cases to regional or national specialist OCD services.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder SRI discontinuation is associated with widely varying reported rates of relapse or discontinuation for insufficient clinical response after double-blind switch to placebo, ranging from 89% within 7 weeks to 24% within 28 weeks. An open discontinuation study reported significantly higher 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year relapse rates for the patients whose SRI treatment was discontinued. Given these observations, discontinuation of pharmacotherapy should be carefully considered, and for most patients, continued treatment of some form is recommended.

Clomipramine vs fluoxetine and overall dosing/tolerability in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Trials directly comparing clomipramine with certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) report equal effectiveness, and in some studies SSRIs appear to have better tolerability; although clomipramine is recommended for treating OCD, studies indicate effectiveness at doses of up to 250 mg/day, while a potential for seizures exists at doses exceeding 250 mg/day. In a crossover study, clomipramine 250 mg/day (n = 5) versus fluoxetine 40 mg/day (n = 6) given 10 weeks on each drug with a 4-week washout produced significant Y-BOCS decreases in both groups with no between-group significant difference. In an 8-week, double-blind comparison of clomipramine 150 mg/day (n = 25) and fluoxetine 40 mg/day (n = 30), there was no difference in Y-BOCS score decrease; the YBOCS-25%, but not the YBOCS-35%, responder rate was significantly higher for clomipramine, and the drugs did not differ in dropout rates.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder pharmacotherapy — sertraline comparative trials and maintenance: A 16-week double-blind study used sertraline and clomipramine with 50 mg/day for 4 weeks followed by increases to 200 mg/day (mean final dose = 132 mg/day for sertraline and 101 mg/day for clomipramine), and the Y-BOCS-35% responder rates were 72% for sertraline and 65% for clomipramine. In comorbid depression, sertraline 50–200 mg/day (mean endpoint dose = 160 ± 50 mg/day; n = 79) versus desipramine 50–300 mg/day (mean endpoint dose = 194 ± 90 mg/day; n = 85) yielded "robust improvement in OCD symptoms" defined as a Y-BOCS score decrease ≥ 40% in favor of sertraline. During continued open-label sertraline 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day, a mean decrease in Y-BOCS scores from about 12 to about 9 was observed in 38 subjects, and after 1 year of single-blind treatment, relapse over 28 weeks occurred whether maintained on sertraline 50–200 mg/day (3/108, or 3%) or switched to placebo (5/113, or 4%).

Obsessive-compulsive disorder acute phase — choosing specific pharmacological treatment: Clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OCD, are recommended pharmacological agents. Although meta-analyses and head-to-head trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, the results of head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and SSRIs directly do not support this impression. Because SSRIs have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial. Although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one and not to another, and reasons for this patient-specific response are unknown; no demographic or clinical variables are sufficiently accurate predictors of treatment outcome to guide selection. In choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions; for example, paroxetine, the SSRI most associated with weight gain and the most anticholinergic SSRI, would not be the first choice for patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, or urinary hesitancy.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) medication side effects — common SSRI effects and management: The most common SSRI side effects include gastrointestinal distress, agitation, insomnia or somnolence, increased tendency to sweat, and sexual side effects (diminished libido and difficulty with erection and orgasm). A first step is to consider dose reduction to alleviate side effects without loss of therapeutic effect; when this is not possible, specific interventions may be considered. Gastrointestinal distress will usually disappear within 1–2 weeks at a constant dose; insomnia may respond to morning dosing, standard sleep hygiene measures, or a sleep-promoting agent; fatigue or sleepiness may respond to modest doses of modafinil; and sweating has been treated with low-dose anticholinergics such as benztropine, or with clonidine, cyproheptadine, or mirtazapine.

Paroxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder — randomized evidence shows acute and continuation benefits: "Three double-blind placebo-controlled trials show paroxetine to be more effective than placebo acutely; an additional double-blind study shows the superiority of paroxetine relative to placebo in maintaining response over 6 months of continuation treatment". In a 12-week double-blind trial of paroxetine 20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 60 mg/day, or placebo, endpoint response rates (YBOCS-25% or CGI-S decrease ≥ 2) were 25% and 29% for 40 mg/day and 60 mg/day, 16% for 20 mg/day, and 13% for placebo. In a 12-week flexible-dose study, the CGI-I response rate was 50% with paroxetine versus 24% with placebo. In another 12-week trial of flexibly dosed paroxetine 20–60 mg/day (mean 37 mg/day), more than half (55%) were YBOCS-25% responders versus 35% with placebo, and flexibly dosed clomipramine 150–250 mg/day (mean 113 mg/day) produced the same responder rate as paroxetine. Versus venlafaxine over 12 weeks, YBOCS-35% responder rates did not differ (paroxetine up to 60 mg/day 44% [n = 76] vs venlafaxine up to 300 mg/day 37% [n = 75]), though YBOCS-25% response favored paroxetine (66% vs 49%); after double-blind medication switch in nonresponders, YBOCS-25% responders were 56% (15/27) for paroxetine vs 19% (3/19) for venlafaxine. For continuation, responders randomized after a 12-week study and 6-month open-label extension (N = 105) had a higher relapse on placebo than paroxetine (59% vs 38%) with mean time to relapse 29 days vs 63 days.

### Obsessive compulsive disorder: diagnosis and management [^114awKV7]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is an illness that can cause marked distress and disability. It often goes unrecognized and is undertreated. Primary care physicians should be familiar with the various ways obsessive-compulsive disorder can present and should be able to recognize clues to the presence of obsessions or compulsions. Proper diagnosis and education about the nature of the disorder are important first steps in recovery. Treatment is rarely curative, but patients can have significant improvement in symptoms. Recommended first-line therapy is cognitive behavior therapy with exposure and response prevention or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The medication doses required for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder are often higher than those for other indications, and the length of time to response is typically longer. There are a variety of options for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, including augmentation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with an atypical antipsychotic. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition with a high rate of relapse. Discontinuation of treatment should be undertaken with caution. Patients should be closely monitored for comorbid depression and suicidal ideation.

Venlafaxine — overview of role and dosing in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that does not have an FDA indication for OCD, yet several open-label trials showed robust responses in OCD symptoms at doses of at least 225 mg/day, and double-blind active-comparator studies suggest venlafaxine is comparable in efficacy to clomipramine and perhaps to paroxetine, with venlafaxine generally well tolerated.

### Obsessive compulsive disorder [^116oDziy]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obsessions or compulsions that cause personal distress or social dysfunction affect about 1% of adult men and 1.5% of adult women. About half of adults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have an episodic course, whereas the other half have continuous problems. Prevalence in children and adolescents is 2.7%. The disorder persists in about 40% of children and adolescents at mean follow-up of 5.7 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of initial treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults? What are the effects of initial treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in children and adolescents? What are the effects of maintenance treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults? What are the effects of maintenance treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder in children and adolescents? What are the effects of treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults who have not responded to initial treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 43 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: addition of antipsychotics to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, behavioural therapy alone or with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cognitive therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (alone or with serotonin reuptake inhibitors), electroconvulsive therapy, optimum duration of maintenance treatment, psychosurgery, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or sertraline), and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder head-to-head SSRI comparisons — Double-blind trials directly comparing clomipramine with fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine showed no difference, while a double-blind comparison with sertraline found sertraline more effective; this latter result was influenced by inappropriately high clomipramine starting doses of 150 mg/day that led to a high dropout rate and low maximum doses. Meta-regression indicated several predictors of treatment magnitude, but after controlling for these factors clomipramine still appeared superior in comparisons across placebo-controlled trials. Abramowitz suggested that clomipramine's apparent superiority may have resulted from more obvious side effects diminishing the integrity of the blind.

14.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. In study 1, a dose-range finding study, patients received fixed daily doses of paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg. Study 1 demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 60 mg daily with clomipramine 25 mg to 250 mg daily or placebo). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients.

The following table provides the outcome classification by treatment group on Global

Improvement items of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale for Study 1.

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.

The long-term efficacy of paroxetine for the treatment of OCD was established in a long-term extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 3-month double-blind phase and a 6-month extension on open-label paroxetine 20 mg to 60 mg daily were randomized to either paroxetine or placebo in a 6-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients.

### Optimizing first line treatments for adults with OCD [^112UNkiw]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

OCD is characterized by obsessions (recurrent, intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images or impulses and compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the individual feels compelled to perform), which can manifest together or separately (Fineberg et al., 2020). NICE guidelines suggest that low intensity psychological treatments (including ERP) is the first line treatment for OCD, and that a "stepped care" treatment approach for OCD reserves combination treatment for adults with OCD with severe functional impairment, and for adults without an adequate response to: 1) treatment with an SSRI alone (12 weeks duration) or 2) CBT (including ERP) alone (NICE, 2005). Existing US treatment guidelines (APA guidelines) suggest that there are three first-line treatments for OCD (SSRI, CBT, SSRI+CBT) and recommends combined treatment for patients with an unsatisfactory response to monotherapy or for patients with severe OCD. Although, systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published in 1993–2014 suggest that combination treatment was not significantly better than CBT plus placebo (Ost et al., 2015), based on data from a recent systematic and meta-analysis which searched the two controlled trials registers maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental Disorders group, the combination treatment approach is likely to be more effective than psychotherapeutic interventions alone, at least in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (Skapinakis et al., 2016a). Based on data from Optimal treatment for OCD study conducted by Fineberg et al., (2018) combined treatment appeared to be the most effective especially when compared to CBT monotherapy, but SSRI monotherapy was found as the most cost effective. In this review we summarize available treatment recommendations.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^117QoqBF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adult - Initiate fluoxetine 20 mg/day, orally in the morning. Consider a dose increase after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. The full therapeutic effect may be delayed until 5 weeks of treatment or longer. Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon). A dose range of 20 to60 mg/day is recommended; however, doses of up to 80 mg/day have been well tolerated in open studies of OCD. The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80 mg/day.

In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fixed daily doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of fluoxetine or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In one of these studies, no dose-response relationship for effectiveness was demonstrated.

Pediatric (children and adolescents) - In adolescents and higher weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10mg/day. After 2 weeks, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended.

In lower weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 30 mg/day is recommended. Experience with daily doses greater than 20 mg is very minimal, and there is no experience with doses greater than 60 mg.

In the controlled clinical trial of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Periodically reassess to determine the need for treatment.

2.3 Bulimia Nervosa

Initial Treatment - Administer fluoxetine 60 mg/day in the morning. For some patients it may be advisable to titrate up to this target dose over several days. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically studied in patients with bulimia. In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, patients were administered fixed daily fluoxetine doses of 20 or 60 mg, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Only the 60 mg dose was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting.

Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

### Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114DJBHg]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has several limitations. Most studies were of short-term duration. As most of the studies that tested the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions included patients who were taking stable doses of antidepressant medications, generalisation of these results to patients not on medications is not possible. We were unable to test different doses of the same drug to investigate potential dose-response associations. Because of the scarce data, we could not treat alternative dosing schemes in pharmacological trials as different nodes in the network. Several old studies only reported completers analyses, including all cognitive therapy studies, limiting the usefulness of the sensitivity analysis in this domain. We did not consider the relative efficacy of the various interventions in different symptom dimensions of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and generalisation of the results in subgroups of patients with specific symptoms, such as hoarding, should be made with caution.

The results of our analysis generally support current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. For pharmacological management, the recommendation to use SSRIs rather than clomipramine as the first-line agents is supported by our findings since SSRIs have better tolerability than does clomipramine and we identified no convincing evidence for clomipramine being more efficacious than are SSRIs. For non-pharmacological management, all three types of psychotherapy are probably more efficacious than is non-specific therapy, but evidence is limited to patients taking stable doses of antidepressant medication before initiating psychotherapy. The combined initiation of both medication and psychotherapy (either behavioural therapy or CBT) seemed an efficacious treatment. In our analysis excluding waiting list controlled trials, this combined treatment was best, but with considerable uncertainty. Given that most psychotherapeutic trials can also be considered variants of combination trials (since most patients were taking stable doses of antidepressant medications), the combination of SSRIs or clomipramine with psychotherapy is likely to offer more benefit to patients with severe illness than is monotherapy, but more research is needed than at present to support this hypothesis, including cost-effectiveness analyses.

14.2 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

The efficacy of Sertraline HCl Capsules for the treatment of OCD in adults and pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of another sertraline HCl product (referred to as "sertraline" in this section). The results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of sertraline are presented below.

Adults with OCD

The effectiveness of sertraline in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult (age 18 to 65) non-depressed outpatients (Studies OCD-1, OCD-2, and OCD-3). Patients in all three studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.

Study OCD-1 was an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day, titrated in 50 mg increments every 4 days to a maximally tolerated dose; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline (N = 43) experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients (N = 44). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -3.79 (sertraline) and -1.48 (placebo).
Study OCD-2 was a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose study, including sertraline doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Sertraline (N = 240) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the Y-BOCS total score, which were statistically significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients (N = 84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -5.7 (pooled results from sertraline 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg) and -2.85 (placebo).
Study OCD-3 was a 12-week randomized, placebo controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Sertraline (N = 241) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients (N = 84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was - 6.5 (sertraline) and -3.6 (placebo).

### High-dose sertraline strategy for nonresponders to acute treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a multicenter double-blind trial [^114EX9hy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose sertraline for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who failed to respond to standard sertraline acute treatment.

Method

Sixty-six nonresponders to 16 weeks of sertraline treatment who met DSM-III-R criteria for current OCD were randomly assigned, in a double-blind continuation phase of a multicenter trial, either to continue on 200 mg/day of sertraline or to increase their dose to between 250 and 400 mg/day for 12 additional weeks. Efficacy measures included the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), the National Institute of Mental Health Global Obsessive Compulsive Scale (NIMH Global OC Scale), and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Data were collected from July 26, 1994, to October 26, 1995.

Results

The high-dose (250–400 mg/day, mean final dose = 357, SD = 60, N = 30) group showed significantly greater symptom improvement than the 200-mg/day group (N = 36) as measured by the YBOCS (p = .033), NIMH Global OC Scale (p = .003), and CGI-I (p = .011). Responder rates (decrease in YBOCS score of ≥ 25% and a CGI-I rating ≤ 3) were not significantly different for the 200-mg/day versus the high-dose sertraline group, either on completer analysis, 34% versus 52%, or on endpoint analysis, 33% versus 40%. Both treatments showed similar adverse event rates.

Conclusion

Greater symptom improvement was seen in the high-dose sertraline group compared to the 200-mg/day dose group during continuation treatment. Both dosages yielded similar safety profiles. Administration of higher than labeled doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be a treatment option for certain OCD patients who fail to respond to standard acute treatment.

### Pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders [^113nVRhS]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This article reviews new developments of pharmacotherapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and OC spectrum disorders of the past five years. New developments primarily involved the ex-tension of evidence of efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SRIs), the use of atypical antipsychotics in addition to SRIs for treatment refractory patients, the combination of pharmacotherapy with behavior therapy, and studies assessing predictors of response. Today, frontline pharmacological treatment of OCD still consists of drugs with potent serotonin reuptake inhibition proper-ties. In case of non-response, treatment options comprise adding another drug, increasing the dose, switching drugs, or changing the mode of delivery.

We enrolled 348 outpatients with DSM-III-R obsessive-compulsive disorder in phase 1, a 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel study of fixed doses of paroxetine (20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, or 60 mg/day) and placebo. In phase 2, 263 phase 1 completers were enrolled in 6 months of flexibly dosed open-label paroxetine treatment. In phase 3, 105 responders to open-label paroxetine were randomized to 6-month double-blind, fixed-dose, parallel paroxetine/placebo treatment to evaluate long-term efficacy, safety, and impact on relapse prevention. The study was conducted from July 1991 to February 1994.

Results

Patients in phase 1 acute treatment receiving 40 mg/day or 60 mg/day of paroxetine improved significantly (p < .05) more than those receiving placebo; the mean reduction in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score was 25% on 40 mg/day of paroxetine and 29% on 60 mg/day compared with 13% on placebo. During phase 3, long-term treatment, a greater proportion of placebo- (59%) than paroxetine-treated (38%) patients relapsed. Paroxetine was well tolerated at all doses, with no significant increase in frequency of adverse events during long-term compared with short-term therapy. Greater adverse events in the placebo than in the paroxetine group in phase 3 probably represent a discontinuation effect.

Conclusion

Paroxetine doses of 40 mg/day and 60 mg/day (but not 20 mg/day) are effective in treating acute obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term treatment with paroxetine is effective and safe, decreases the rate of relapse, and lengthens the time to relapse.

### Editorial: meta-analysis of individual participant data from trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder: a gold standard approach [^117GfSBU]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common (2% prevalence) and potentially debilitating condition. 1 Early identification and intervention are critical because they may improve outcomes for children and adolescents with OCD and prevent long-term morbidity. The individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis by Cohen and colleagues 2 explores the efficacy of short-term trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared to placebo for treating children and adolescents with OCD. It also investigates the moderating effects of baseline patient variables on treatment outcome.

### Influence of study characteristics, methodological rigour and publication bias on efficacy of pharmacotherapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials [^1166LW8r]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by persistent thoughts, images and/or sensory perceptions that cause distress and repetitive behaviours performed in order to temporarily reduce distress. Its global lifetime prevalence is 2%. Clinical presentation is heterogeneous, but without treatment OCD may profoundly impair quality of life and social functioning. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cognitive–behavioural therapy with exposure and response prevention, or a combination of both is currently recommended for management of OCD. Clomipramine was the first effective pharmacotherapeutic intervention, but its side effect profile renders it a secondary option to SSRIs.

In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), concerns have been raised regarding overestimation of SSRI efficacy due to flaws in trial quality. For instance, a recent reanalysis of a meta-analysis of randomised SSRI trials in MDD showed all studies to be of high or unclear risk of bias. Moreover, another meta-analysis found a small, clinically irrelevant symptom reduction by SSRIs. However, these results are derived from average treatment effects and did not take modifiers of effect into account. Furthermore, a decreasing effect size might be the result of increasing placebo effect or increasing treatment resistance of the trial population. Whether overestimation of efficacy pervades in studies examining SSRIs in OCD as well remains currently unanswered.

Besides quality, study-level characteristics such as sponsor status, number of treatment arms and trial population have been found to influence trial success. For OCD, there is currently a lack of information on the influence of randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology on efficacy, even though this information could contribute to optimising future trial design.

Recent evidence suggests that publication bias exaggerates pharmacotherapy efficacy in MDD, with more pronounced effect size inflation in older trials. For OCD, a study examining publication bias compared efficacy measures of published trials with original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data. They found a pooled effect size of 0.39 Hedges' G according to the US FDA, compared with 0.45 according to the published scientific literature. This increase was non-significant; however, this analysis only included SSRI trials submitted for FDA approval, potentially skewing the representation of reporting bias for OCD pharmacotherapy. Also, publication bias is often identified using funnel plot models that focus on small-study effects, while selection models that focus on biases in publishing of significant studies might be more sensitive to publication bias. In addition, Bayesian approaches to selection models are especially suited for smaller meta-analyses.

### Does SSRI augmentation with antidepressants that influence noradrenergic function resolve depression in obsessive-compulsive disorder? [^114LCDKr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) often coexists with major depressive disorder (MDD). Serotonergic antidepressant medications have emerged as the treatment of choice for both OCD and MDD. In the usual course of events, both the patient's OCD and depressive symptoms improve in parallel following initiation of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment for OCD. However, such is not always the case. We report here on a series of ten patients whose OCD but not depression improved following a trial of SRI therapy.

Method

Ten patients with OCD and comorbid MDD who experienced a worsening or exacerbation of depressive symptoms while being maintained on an adequate dose of SRI therapy were treated using a combination of SRIs and agents with effects on noradrenergic reuptake. Response to treatment was based on clinician-ratings of severity and improvement of OCD and MDD (CGI-S and CGI-I).

Results

Following augmentation, nine of the ten patients had a significant improvement/resolution of their MDD, with little further change in the severity of their OCD.

Limitations

Inferences from the results of this study are limited by the lack of a control group, the small sample size, and the use of nonstandardized ratings as measures of symptom severity.

Conclusions

These results are of practical significance to clinicians insofar as they suggest a possible guideline to clinicians treating depression in OCD with SSRIs without success.

### Efficacy of sertraline in the long-term treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115x59zD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically begins early in life and has a chronic course. Despite the need for long-term treatment, the authors found no placebo-controlled studies that have examined the relapse-prevention efficacy of maintenance therapy.

Method

Patients who met criteria for response after 16 and 52 weeks of a single-blind trial of sertraline were randomly assigned to a 28-week double-blind trial of 50–200 mg/day of sertraline or placebo. Primary outcomes after the double-blind trial were full relapse, dropout due to relapse or insufficient response, or acute exacerbation of OCD symptoms.

Results

Of 649 patients at baseline, 232 completed 52 weeks of the single-blind trial and met response criteria. Among the 223 patients in the double-blind phase of the study, sertraline had significantly greater efficacy than placebo on two of three primary outcomes: dropout due to relapse or insufficient clinical response (9% versus 24%, respectively) and acute exacerbation of symptoms (12% versus 35%). Sertraline resulted in improvement in quality of life during the initial 52-week trial and continued improvement, significantly superior to placebo, during the subsequent 28-week double-blind trial. Long-term treatment with sertraline was well tolerated. Over the entire study period, less than 20% of the patients stopped treatment because of adverse events.

Conclusions

Sertraline demonstrated sustained efficacy among patients responding to treatment and was generally well tolerated during the 80-week study. During the study's last 28 weeks, sertraline demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in preventing dropout due to relapse or insufficient clinical response and acute exacerbation of OCD symptoms.

Anxiety and depressive disorders

What do I do if a young person has depression and has not responded to two SSRIs and CBT?

National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines currently recommend CBT as a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe depression, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line antidepressant and, if that is not effective, sertraline or citalopram. There is limited evidence for other treatments beyond this, other than interpersonal psychotherapy, which is often not available.

The first thing to do when a patient is treatment-resistant is to revisit the formulation and diagnosis. Is this really depression, or does the pattern of symptoms since you started seeing the patient suggest a personality disorder as a more appropriate diagnosis? Are there any social factors that have not been addressed?

Then review whether the patient has indeed had all the treatments to which they appear to be 'resistant'. Did they stop fluoxetine after a few days of mild side effects and would they be prepared to try again? Did they have a good number of sessions of evidence-based psychological therapy from a fully trained and supervised therapist? If they stopped after a few sessions, was this due to a problem in the therapy or the therapist and would they consider trying a different therapist?

If the patient truly does have depression, and you have tried all the evidence-based treatments, there is no evidence to guide you. It would be reasonable to try two SSRIs up to the maximum tolerated dose, within BNF limits: although there is no evidence in favour of or against this, there is some evidence for a dose increase in adult depression; and there is plenty of safety data from paediatric OCD studies which use high doses of SSRIs. If the patient is nearly 18, it may be reasonable to try antidepressants shown to work in studies of 18–64 years old but not in studies of 12–17 years old, such as mirtazapine (adrenergic alpha-2 auto receptors and heteroceptors antagonist and 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors blocker) or venlafaxine (serotonin and norepinephrine inhibitor); caution should be used with the latter due to possible increased risk of suicidal ideation, and for that reason it is especially important to seek peer advice. It may be worth trying an augmenting agent that has evidence in adults such as lamotrigine, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, or-thyroxine.

### Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112kPdrE]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

During the protocol stage of our project (May 1 to June 30, 2013), we did a scoping search of the literature. We used the two specialised registers of controlled trials maintained and administered by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental Disorders Group. We searched the registers using the generic term "condition = obsess* OR compulsi", with no language or date restrictions. We found that the latest comprehensive review had been published in 2006 and specific meta-analyses had been published in 2008. Since then, several new trials have been done. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have generally focused on the comparison between antidepressant medications and placebo or psychotherapeutic interventions and a waiting list. Few studies have directly compared the relative efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants versus each other, behavioural-type psychotherapies versus each other, or medications versus psychotherapies. Clinicians are often interested in pragmatic comparisons (Are all SSRIs equally effective? Is clomipramine more effective than are SSRIs? Is cognitive behavioural psychotherapy more effective than are medications?), but these questions have been examined in few studies in the past using statistical methods that have not always taken into account the complexity of such comparisons. We therefore did a network meta-analysis with the aim to simultaneously compare in a single analysis and rank in terms of efficacy all available interventions for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults.

Added value of this study

We found small differences in efficacy between medications, and the hypothesis of clomipramine being better than SSRIs was not confirmed. Although certain psychotherapies were associated with larger effects than were medications, we underline an important limitation that, in most psychotherapeutic trials, patients who were taking stable doses of antidepressants were not excluded and therefore these therapies cannot be considered as pure monotherapies.

Implications of all the available evidence

Taking all evidence into account, the combination of psychotherapies with medications is possibly the most effective intervention and clinicians should consider this option more often than at present for patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychotherapy is effective in symptomatic patients taking antidepressant medications, and its effect as monotherapy is not known. Future research should try to differentiate more clearly the effect of medications versus psychotherapy and monotherapy versus combined therapy, avoiding the limitations that we have underlined in this study.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^117JK54w]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Maintenance Therapy

Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 6-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with OCD assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). OCD is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.

Panic Disorder

Usual Initial Dosage

Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The target dose of paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder is 40 mg/day. Patients should be started on 10 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10-mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 10 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.

Maintenance Therapy

Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). Panic disorder is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112AkzX7]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children — first-line pharmacotherapy and overall efficacy: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the first-line medications recommended for OCD in children and should be used according to AACAP guidelines to monitor response, tolerability, and safety. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled medication trials in children and adolescents with OCD found an effect size of 0.46 (95% CI 0.37–0.55) with a statistically significant difference between drug and placebo (z = 9.87, p < .001). These statistics translate into an improved CY-BOCS score of about 6 points of drug over placebo. Industry-sponsored multicenter randomized controlled trials have demonstrated significant efficacy of SSRIs compared with placebo, including sertraline, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine.

### Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111qudyd]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Several interventions are available for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults, but few studies have compared their relative efficacy in a single analysis. We aimed to simultaneously compare all available treatments using both direct and indirect data.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched the two controlled trials registers maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental Disorders group for trials published up to Feb 16, 2016. We selected randomised controlled trials in which an active psychotherapeutic or pharmacological intervention had been used in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. We allowed all comorbidities except for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on treatment-resistant patient populations defined within the same study. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was symptom severity as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. We report mean differences with 95% credible intervals compared with placebo. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002441.

Findings

We identified 1480 articles in our search and included 53 articles (54 trials; 6652 participants) in the network meta-analysis. Behavioural therapy (mean difference −14.48 [95% credible interval −18.61 to −10.23]; 11 trials and 287 patients), cognitive therapy (−13.36 [–18.40 to −8.21]; six trials and 172 patients), behavioural therapy and clomipramine (−12.97 [–19.18 to −6.74]; one trial and 31 patients), cognitive behavioural therapy and fluvoxamine (−7.50 [–13.89 to −1.17]; one trial and six patients), cognitive behavioural therapy (−5.37 [–9.10 to −1.63]; nine trials and 231 patients), clomipramine (−4.72 [–6.85 to −2.60]; 13 trials and 831 patients), and all SSRIs (class effect −3.49 [95% credible interval −5.12 to −1.81]; 37 trials and 3158 patients) had greater effects than did drug placebo. Clomipramine was not better than were SSRIs (−1.23 [–3.41 to 0.94]). Psychotherapeutic interventions had a greater effect than did medications, but a serious limitation was that most psychotherapeutic trials included patients who were taking stable doses of antidepressants (12 [80%] of the 15 psychotherapy trials explicitly allowed antidepressants).

Interpretation

A range of interventions is effective in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but considerable uncertainty and limitations exist regarding their relative efficacy. Taking all the evidence into account, the combination of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions is likely to be more effective than are psychotherapeutic interventions alone, at least in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.

### What works for whom in pediatric OCD: description of causally interpretable meta-analysis methods and report on trial data harmonization [^114ovhCi]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Inconsistent findings highlight important limitations of conventional aggregate-data meta-analysis in answering "what works, for whom?" One key limitation relates to implementation differences across trials, comparisons of which have been described as "apples to oranges" (Freeman et al.). Individual studies have tested a variety of different CBT formats, content, and doses, in a variety of settings, and using different comparison conditions. Studies have also tested a variety of CBT augmentation treatment strategies, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs; e.g. clomipramine, sertraline, fluoxetine), other medications (e.g. d-cycloserine), and family therapy. Few of the above options have been directly compared in the same trial. To make such comparisons using existing trial data across studies requires making causal assumptions. Conventional meta-analysis does not have a clear causal interpretation when the distribution of effect modifiers differs among the populations underlying the included trials and the target population. Results of each trial apply to the population underlying it (reflecting the trial's eligibility criteria and recruitment practices), and that population typically has a different distribution of effect modifiers than treatment populations (Dahabreh et al; Pearl & Bareinboim). Conventional meta-analytic methods do not address these concerns.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116HA7ha]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder pharmacotherapy — citalopram and escitalopram outcomes: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 12 weeks of citalopram 20 mg/day (n = 102), 40 mg/day (n = 98), or 60 mg/day (n = 100) produced higher YBOCS-25% response rates (57%, 52%, and 65%, respectively) than placebo (n = 101) (37%). Open-label data include similar inpatient YBOCS-35% responder rates with citalopram (n = 11; mean dose = 51 mg/day) and paroxetine (n = 9; mean dose = 53 mg/day) at 40% and 45%, with fluvoxamine (n = 10; mean dose = 290 mg/day) at 60%; and no significant difference across 12 weeks among citalopram 40–60 mg/day (n = 23) (48%), fluvoxamine 200–300 mg/day (n = 83) (55%), clomipramine 150–250 mg/day (n = 37) (48%), and paroxetine 40–60 mg/day (n = 16) (50%). Additional open-label findings reported that flexibly dosed citalopram 20–60 mg/day (mean final dose = 46 mg/day) led to 22 of 29 (76%) patients achieving a ≥ 50% decrease in Y-BOCS score over 24 weeks, whereas a 12-week trial in prior SRI nonresponders found only one of seven (14%) responded to citalopram 20 mg/day for 2 weeks then 40 mg/day; a case report described benefit when increasing from 80 mg/day to 160 mg/day, and intravenous citalopram was tolerated at 20–80 mg/day. Escitalopram was as effective as paroxetine for OCD and was superior to placebo in preventing OCD relapse in European double-blind trials.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: early treatment responses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and clomipramine in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114pjYAm]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the following: the time course of response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); whether higher doses of SSRIs are associated with an improved response in pediatric OCD; differences in efficacy among SSRI agents; differences in efficacy between SSRIs and clomipramine; and whether the time course and magnitude of response to SSRIs are different in pediatric and adult patients with OCD.

Method

We searched PubMed and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials comparing SSRIs (or clomipramine) to placebo for the treatment of pediatric OCD and using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale as an outcome. We extracted weekly symptom data from trials to characterize the trajectory of pharmacological response to SSRIs. Pooled estimates of treatment effect were calculated based on weighted mean differences between the treatment and placebo groups.

Results

Nine trials involving 801 children with OCD were included in this meta-analysis. A logarithmic model indicating that the greatest benefits occurred early in treatment best fit the longitudinal data for both clomipramine and SSRIs. Clomipramine was associated with a greater measured benefit compared to placebo than SSRIs. There was no evidence for a relationship between SSRI dosing and treatment effect, although data were limited. Adults and children with OCD demonstrated a similar degree and time course of response to SSRIs in OCD.

Conclusion

These results suggest that the greatest incremental treatment gains in pediatric OCD occur early in SSRI treatment (similar to adults with OCD and children and adults with major depression).

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117JZdTV]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment heterogeneity and trial methodology — studies of effectiveness will be required to supplement the findings of efficacy studies, and studies need to provide more information to help target specific treatment approaches to individual patients. Individuals with specific subtypes of OCD or with specific co-occurring symptoms or disorders may exhibit better responses to specific treatments or combinations of treatments, and the optimal schedule and the effective elements of treatment may also differ by OCD symptom type or co-occurring condition. Interpretation and dissemination of future research would be aided by more consistent use of the CONSORT guidelines and recommendation in designing and reporting randomized treatment trials and by including details on study power and effect sizes; using a reliable and valid written self-rating scale to measure OCD symptom intensity; and standardizing definitions of degrees of treatment response, resistance, remission, and relapse following the models of the International Treatment Refractory OCD Consortium and Simpson et al.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111jzGUr]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sequential strategies beyond antipsychotic augmentation — modest evidence supports augmentation of SRIs with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; specifically, exposure and response prevention [ERP]) and augmentation of CBT with SRIs, although some studies have demonstrated no added benefit from combining SRIs and CBT; in the absence of definitive data, combination treatment is provided to treat a co-occurring disorder that is SRI responsive, to augment a partial response to monotherapy, and to reduce the chance of relapse when medication is discontinued. For patients who do not respond to their first SRI, expert opinion and clinical trial data support switching to a different SRI; clinical experience suggests that response rates to a second SRI trial are close to 50% but may diminish as the number of failed adequate trials increases. A switch to venlafaxine at doses ranging from 225 mg/day to 350 mg/day is supported by active comparator trials and open-label studies, and a switch to mirtazapine is supported by one open pilot study and a double-blind discontinuation trial. If earlier strategies are not effective, expert opinion and three open-label studies support clomipramine augmentation of SSRIs; if clomipramine is added, plasma levels of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine should be assayed 2–3 weeks after reaching a dose of 50 mg/day.

### Fluoxetine treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: a placebo-controlled clinical trial [^116LZT7V]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine in the acute treatment of child and adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a 13-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Method

Eligible patients aged 7 to 17 (N = 103) were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive either fluoxetine or placebo. Dosing was initiated at 10 mg daily for 2 weeks, then increased to 20 mg daily. After 4 weeks of treatment, and again after 7 weeks of treatment, non-responders could have their dosage increased by 20 mg daily, for a maximum possible dosage of 60 mg daily. Primary measure of efficacy was improvement in OCD symptoms as measured by the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). All analyses were intent-to-treat.

Results

Fluoxetine was associated with significantly greater improvement in OCD as assessed by the CY-BOCS (p = .026) and other measures than was placebo. Fluoxetine was well tolerated and had a rate of discontinuation for adverse events similar to that of placebo (p = 1.00).

Conclusions

Fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg daily was effective and well tolerated for treatment of OCD in this pediatric population.

### High-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in OCD: a systematic retrospective case notes survey [^114c9CKX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

This article presents a systematic, retrospective case-note survey of a specialist obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) outpatient service. We explore the frequency of 'high-dose' selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescribing and describe clinical outcomes in a naturalistic clinical setting. Patients receiving high doses were compared with 'control' cases at the following three time-points: referral, initiation of high-dose SSRI and last clinical assessment. Twenty-six (13.5%) out of 192 patients received high-dose treatment for 3–364 weeks (mean 81.5 weeks; SD = ± 95.1). At referral, high-dose patients were significantly more likely than controls to be male, and to have received Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), although illness severity and complexity did not differ. At initiation of dose escalation, however, high-dose patients were significantly more symptomatic than controls (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score [Y-BOCS 25.4 vs. 17.7]). At the last assessment, patients on high-dose treatment showed significant within-group improvements (Y-BOCS 25.35 vs. 20.95), although endpoint scores for the high-dose group remained significantly higher than control patients treated for a matched period (Y-BOCS 21.0 vs. 15.5), suggesting enduring treatment-resistance. Frequency of adverse effects did not significantly differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that high-dose SSRI was associated with clinical improvement and well-tolerated in a particularly refractory OCD sample.

Results

Included trials

Out of 14 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adult OCD that were submitted to the MEB by the sponsors, we included 11 trials. Two trials were excluded as they did not provide outcome data, and one trial had to be excluded as information on the assignment of intervention per patient was not available. After excluding the patients assigned to placebo (n = 885), we included a total of 1,753 patients (267 of whom were assigned to clomipramine and 1,486 to an SSRI). Three trials (27%) lasted 10 weeks, seven trials (64%) lasted 12 weeks, and one trial (9%) lasted 13 weeks. Of the included patients, 947 were male (54%) and 806 (46%) were female. The mean age of included patients was 38.2 years (standard deviation [SD] = 12.2) and the mean YBOCS severity at baseline was 24.5 (SD = 5.1), which is indicative of moderate OCD severity. See Table 1 for an overview of the included trials. The mean attrition after 10 weeks was 21,9%. For an overview of attrition after 10 weeks per trial, please refer to.

Trial characteristics

Abbreviations: mg, milligram; SD, standard deviation; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; YBOCS, Yale–Brown obsessive-compulsive scale.

After 4 weeks, 1,220 patients (70%) were positive for the index test of non-improvement (i.e. < 25 percent YBOCS reduction compared to baseline), while 534 (30%) were negative for the index test (i.e. patients did improve more than 25% compared to baseline). A total of 1,107 patients (63%) met the criteria for the reference test (i.e. nonresponse [< 35% YBOCS reduction compared to baseline] at the end of the trial [10–13 weeks]), while 647 (37%) patients responded (i.e. negative reference test). For an overview of classifications of index test and reference test per trial, please see.

Children and adolescents — initial therapy and safety for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): "In children and adolescents, treatment should often start with CBT or with a combination of psychotherapy and an SRI (307)". Efficacy and approvals are noted: "Cognitive-behavioral approaches consisting primarily of ERP have been shown to be efficacious in children (308–310), and three SSRIs and clomipramine are FDA-approved for use in treating OCD in children (308–310)". Safety monitoring is emphasized: "Caution and frequent clinical monitoring are advisable when treating children and adolescents with SRIs because of the possibility of an increase in suicidal thinking or behaviors (314)", while preserving access when needed: "However, using SRIs in treating children and adolescents with OCD or major depression may be necessary and should not be avoided when clinically indicated (315)". Scope guidance adds, "Since discussion of diagnosis and treatment of OCD in children and adolescents is beyond the scope of this guideline, the reader is referred to the practice parameter of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (321)".

Obsessive-compulsive disorder — trazodone: Case reports and case series suggest that trazodone at doses of at least 250 mg/day may warrant a trial in OCD patients who have not responded to first- and second-line treatments, and in one case series (N = 5) augmentation of an SSRI with trazodone 300–600 mg/day was helpful in alleviating OCD and anxiety as well as sleep disturbance.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with co-occurring major depression — Co-occurring major depression does not adversely affect the response of OCD to SRIs; when OCD responds and depression does not, it is reasonable to apply APA major depression strategies, including interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or short-term psychodynamic therapy, increasing the SRI dose, adding an antidepressant from another class or an augmenting agent, or, in severe, treatment-resistant, or suicidal depression, utilizing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Co-occurring major depression has been associated with a poorer OCD outcome in many CBT trials, severe depression clearly interferes with CBT, and it may be useful to utilize antidepressant medication, particularly SRIs, to treat the depression before or during CBT.

14.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

The effectiveness of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. In study 1, a dose-range finding study, patients received fixed daily doses of paroxetine tablets 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg. Study 1 demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine tablets 40 mg and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of paroxetine tablets 40 mg and 60 mg experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine tablets 20 mg to 60 mg daily with clomipramine 25 mg to 250 mg daily or placebo). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine tablets experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients.

The following table provides the outcome classification by treatment group on Global Improvement items of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale for Study 1.

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.

The long-term efficacy of paroxetine tablets for the treatment of OCD was established in a long-term extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine tablets during the 3-month double-blind phase and a 6-month extension on open-label paroxetine tablets 20 mg to 60 mg daily were randomized to either paroxetine tablets or placebo in a 6-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine tablets were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients.

Introduction

Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) fail to respond adequately to first-line antidepressant treatment, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine, in ~40–60% of cases. In case of insufficient response, clinical guidelines recommend dose escalation or switching to an alternative drug. Treatment efficacy is typically evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment, which is long compared to other psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia (Carolyn Rodriguez, Bloch, Sachs, & Williams; Fineberg, Brown, Reghunandanan, & Pampaloni; Koran, Hanna, Hollander, Nestadt, & Simpson). American Psychiatric Association guidelines recommend continuing for at least 8–12 weeks after reaching the maximum recommended dose before considering a patient a nonresponder (Koran et al.), although the evidence for this timeframe remains debatable (Issari, Jakubovski, Bartley, Pittenger, & Bloch; Pittenger & Bloch). Identifying nonresponse sooner in the treatment process would benefit both patients and clinicians by enabling earlier adjustments in treatment strategies. If early indicators of treatment failure can be reliably assessed, clinicians may more promptly revise the intervention – such as by switching medication or introducing psychotherapy – thereby reducing treatment delays and minimizing patients' experiences of failure.

In OCD, some relatively small studies have investigated whether symptom change after 4 weeks can predict eventual response to pharmacotherapy. However, definitions of nonresponse differed across studies, and most studies did not use a priori definitions of nonresponse, making these exploratory in nature (Ackerman, Greenland, & Bystritsky; Brar, Sidana, Chauhan, & Bajaj; da Conceição Costa et al; Krompinger et al.). Methodological differences in trial settings, patient populations, and chosen response times have limited the clinical utility of these studies. Nevertheless, these preliminary results do suggest that early response evaluation on an individual level might inform clinical practice, even though, on a group level, pharmacotherapy in OCD might take longer to show clinically relevant differences compared to placebo.

Pregnancy — SSRI exposure and peripartum dosing in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is addressed by noting risk signals and dose considerations: "Some evidence also suggests an increase in the likelihood of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn when the patient receives an SSRI during the third trimester (298)", and because "the severity of OCD symptoms may not rapidly increase when medication is tapered, tapering the patient's SRI dose during the last weeks of pregnancy may be considered". Long-term child outcome data are limited; "The very limited data regarding long-term effects of exposure throughout pregnancy to TCAs or SSRIs do not suggest an elevated risk of abnormalities in cognitive function, language, temperament, or general behavior between ages 15 and 71 months (299)", and "one study found no evidence for developmental delay at up to 2 years of age associated with in utero exposure to TCAs, fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine at varying times and for varying durations (295)". Although not OCD-specific, third-trimester dose needs can change: "increases in the SSRI dose have been needed in the third trimester to maintain remission in major depression".

Treatment resistance criteria — children with OCD — include failure of adequate trials of at least two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or one SSRI and a clomipramine trial and a failure of adequately delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); each SSRI or clomipramine trial should be a minimum of 10 weeks at maximum recommended or maximum tolerated doses with no change in dose for the preceding 3 weeks, and CBT nonresponders include no improvement after 8 to 10 therapist sessions (or six to eight sessions of exposure/response prevention [E/RP]) or substantial residual obsessive-compulsive psychopathology after completing standard CBT, with the failure of at least two monotherapies and CBT required before labeling a child as treatment resistant.
