## Question

Treatment of 32f with PCOS after failure to menstruate on one cycle of progesterone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a 32-year-old woman with PCOS who failed to menstruate after a single cycle of progesterone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the adequacy of the progesterone challenge and consider endometrial status. Next, I will outline first-line cycle regulation with combined oral contraceptives, including formulation choices and contraindication screening. After that, I should address metabolic risk and lifestyle, consider metformin when indicated, and plan endometrial protection if estrogen is contraindicated. Finally, I will set a monitoring and follow-up plan, and clarify when to escalate to ovulation induction if fertility is desired, all while integrating shared decision-making and patient preferences [^1162BSCB] [^114NbQzh].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with PCOS rather than thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, nonclassic CAH, or hypothalamic amenorrhea; in adults, PCOS is diagnosed when at least two of the following are present after excluding other causes: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound, with the 2023 update allowing AMH to substitute for ultrasound in adults only, and with the caveat that if both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound or AMH is not required for diagnosis [^113bZato] [^111T6jk3] [^113NN1jM].

> Wait, let me verify the progesterone challenge details and the endometrial implications of a failed withdrawal bleed, because this affects next steps; a standard medroxyprogesterone acetate dose of 10 mg daily for 10 days should induce a bleed within 7–10 days if the endometrium is adequately estrogenized, and failure to bleed suggests either inadequate endogenous estrogen, endometrial atrophy, or an anatomic outflow obstruction, so I should check endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasound and, if thin, consider hypoestrogenic states or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, whereas if the endometrium is thick, I should consider endometrial sampling to exclude hyperplasia before initiating estrogen-containing therapy [^114qvWu7] [^117NEPPn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also remember that chronic anovulation in PCOS increases endometrial hyperplasia and cancer risk, so even without a bleed, I need to ensure endometrial protection and appropriate evaluation of abnormal bleeding patterns or persistent amenorrhea, especially with obesity or diabetes, and counsel on risk reduction through cycle regulation and weight management [^117NEPPn].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy for cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism; combined oral contraceptive pills are recommended as first-line for adults with PCOS to regulate menses, suppress androgens, and provide contraception, with no specific formulation mandated and a preference for lower ethinyl estradiol doses to balance efficacy and metabolic risk, and I should screen for contraindications using standard criteria before prescribing [^117BX9Sd] [^111c1GZA] [^113CWGcc].

> I need to ensure the formulation choice aligns with symptoms and risk profile; low-dose ethinyl estradiol preparations with a non-androgenic progestin such as desogestrel, norgestimate, or drospirenone are reasonable, and while cyproterone acetate combinations can be considered for refractory hirsutism, they carry higher VTE risk and should generally be second-line, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits, and I should confirm that no absolute contraindications exist such as uncontrolled hypertension, thrombophilia, or migraine with aura [^111c1GZA] [^111myZ3G].

> But wait, what if estrogen is contraindicated or declined; in that case, I should pivot to progestin-only strategies for endometrial protection, using medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily for 10–14 days every 1–3 months to induce a scheduled withdrawal bleed and reduce endometrial risk, and I should double-check that the patient understands this approach treats the uterus but does not address androgen excess or contraception, necessitating separate contraception if needed [^117NEPPn] [^113ZZ6se].

> I will now examine metabolic screening and lifestyle because PCOS carries elevated risks of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease; I should obtain BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and a lipid panel, counsel on a 5–10% weight loss target when overweight, and emphasize sustainable physical activity consistent with population guidelines, noting that no single exercise modality is proven superior and that adherence is key [^114NbQzh] [^114oSg4U] [^1114xTno].

> Let me consider metformin, and I should confirm when it is indicated; metformin is recommended primarily for metabolic features such as impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes, and it can modestly improve menstrual regularity and ovulation, but it is not first-line for hirsutism or acne and should be individualized based on metabolic phenotype and patient preference, with typical dosing of 1.5–2 g daily in divided doses and attention to GI tolerability [^114NbQzh] [^111Jtqeu].

> Next, I should review a monitoring and follow-up plan; I will reassess cycles after 3 months of COCP use, monitor blood pressure annually, and repeat metabolic labs periodically based on risk, and I should remind myself that biochemical hyperandrogen assessment is unreliable on COCPs due to increased SHBG and suppressed gonadotropins, so if androgen testing is imperative, I should hold the COCP for at least 3 months and use alternative contraception during that interval [^114NHTfG].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach if the patient desires pregnancy; ovulation induction should follow a stepwise algorithm, with letrozole as first-line pharmacologic therapy, clomiphene as an alternative, and gonadotropins as second-line with careful monitoring to mitigate multiple pregnancy and OHSS risks, and IVF reserved as third-line or when other therapies fail, with explicit counseling on OHSS risk and single embryo transfer to minimize multiples [^1166Mcnz] [^112YVDhs] [^115fGpFR].

> I should double-check gonadotropin specifics; a low-dose step-up FSH protocol starting at 37.5–75 IU daily with small increments and strict cancellation criteria when more than two follicles reach 14 mm or when three or more intermediate follicles develop helps achieve monofollicular ovulation and reduce multiple gestation, and cycles should be managed by clinicians with appropriate expertise and ultrasound monitoring [^111U5gLy] [^113fzJzv] [^117MrqFK].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps for this 32-year-old; I will confirm the diagnosis with appropriate exclusions, assess endometrial thickness and perform endometrial sampling if indicated before starting estrogen-containing therapy, initiate a low-dose COCP for cycle control and hyperandrogenism if no contraindications, screen and address metabolic risks with lifestyle and metformin as indicated, arrange follow-up in 3 months to evaluate bleeding control and tolerability, and if fertility is desired, pivot to letrozole-based ovulation induction with appropriate monitoring and counseling, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^113bZato] [^117BX9Sd] [^114NbQzh] [^1166Mcnz].

---

For a 32-year-old woman with PCOS who failed to menstruate after one cycle of progesterone, the next step is to **confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics** (TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, androgens, and pelvic ultrasound) [^113bZato] [^111T6jk3]. If PCOS is confirmed, **initiate a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)** as first-line therapy for cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism; if estrogen is contraindicated, use cyclic progestin (e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily for 10–14 days every 1–3 months) [^117BX9Sd] [^111c1GZA]. Address **metabolic risks** with lifestyle changes and consider metformin if insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome is present [^114NbQzh]. If fertility is desired, use letrozole as first-line ovulation induction; if cycles remain irregular after 3–6 months of therapy, reassess and consider gonadotropins or IVF [^112YVDhs] [^1166Mcnz].

---

## Confirm diagnosis and exclude other causes

Before proceeding, **confirm PCOS and exclude other causes** of amenorrhea:

- **TSH and prolactin**: Rule out thyroid disease and hyperprolactinemia [^113bZato].
- **17-hydroxyprogesterone**: Exclude congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^111uWCrD].
- **Total/free testosterone, androstenedione, DHEAS**: Assess hyperandrogenism [^1166eTPA].
- **Pelvic ultrasound**: Evaluate endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology [^113NN1jM].

---

## First-line management of menstrual irregularity

If PCOS is confirmed, **initiate first-line therapy**:

- **Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)**: First-line for cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism; use low-dose estrogen (20–30 µg) with a progestin (e.g. drospirenone, desogestrel) [^117BX9Sd] [^111c1GZA].
- **Cyclic progestin**: If estrogen is contraindicated, use medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily for 10–14 days every 1–3 months to induce withdrawal bleeds and protect the endometrium [^113ZZ6se] [^117NEPPn].
- **Metformin**: Consider if insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome is present; improves menstrual regularity and metabolic parameters [^114sxcpZ].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle changes are foundational; **weight loss of 5–10%** significantly improves menstrual regularity, insulin sensitivity, and androgen levels. Physical activity of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise is recommended, and dietary patterns emphasizing a balanced, low-glycemic diet with reduced refined carbohydrates are preferred [^114oSg4U].

---

## Management of hyperandrogenism

For hirsutism and acne, **COCPs are first-line**; add anti-androgens (spironolactone, finasteride, or flutamide) if needed, with strict contraception due to teratogenicity [^113CWGcc] [^113ZZ6se] [^1166eTPA].

---

## Fertility management (if desired)

If fertility is desired, **letrozole is first-line** for ovulation induction; alternatives include clomiphene citrate, metformin, or gonadotropins, with careful monitoring to avoid multiple pregnancy and OHSS [^112YVDhs] [^111U5gLy].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential; **reassess menstrual regularity, metabolic parameters, and treatment response every 3–6 months**, and adjust therapy based on response and patient preferences [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| COCP | Menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism | First-line |
| Cyclic progestin | Estrogen contraindicated | Induce withdrawal bleed every 1–3 months |
| Metformin | Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome | Consider |
| Lifestyle | All patients | - Weight loss <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Diet |
| Letrozole | Ovulation induction | First-line |
| Anti-androgens | Refractory hyperandrogenism | Add to COCP |

---

If menstruation fails after one progesterone cycle, **confirm PCOS, exclude mimics, and start COCP or cyclic progestin**; address metabolic risks and use letrozole if fertility is desired.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — irregular menstrual cycles and adolescent risk: Irregular menstrual cycles are defined as 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days, 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year, 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle, and Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche (breast development). When irregular menstrual cycles are present a diagnosis of PCOS should be considered and assessed according to these PCOS Guidelines, and for adolescents with features not meeting diagnostic criteria an increased risk could be considered with reassessment advised at or before full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche; ovulatory dysfunction can still occur with regular cycles and serum progesterone levels can be measured to confirm anovulation.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic algorithm (Figure 1): Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents ultrasound is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, and adults - request ultrasound for PCOM#, if positive (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. The algorithm notes that PCOM = polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and specifies exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing's Syndrome, adrenal tumours); for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, usually due to low body fat or intensive exercise, exclude clinically and with LH/FSH.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1166Mcnz]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Infertility management pathway for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follows a stepwise medical approach beginning with diagnosis/baseline investigations and lifestyle optimization, then first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Baseline investigations include an endocrine profile, pelvic ultrasound, BMI/BP/glycemic assessment, routine preconception checks, and consideration of semen analysis and tubal patency assessment. Healthy lifestyle "should be recommended in all those with PCOS". First line medical treatment is letrozole with dose escalation, with off-label status noted and clinicians advised to inform women of evidence, concerns, and side effects; metformin and gonadotrophins have differing efficacy, cost, and multiple pregnancy profiles, and either may be an alternative first-line choice for informed women. If further treatment is required, second line is gonadotrophins with US monitoring or consideration of laparoscopic ovarian surgery. If needed, third line is in vitro fertilization with PCOS-specific protocols to minimize ovarian hyperstimulation risk and consideration of in vitro maturation; the pathway also includes repeated cycles with shared decision-making considering age and resources then to IVF.

HCs: indications and screening

3.1 We recommend HCs (ie, oral contraceptives, patch, or vaginal ring) as first-line management for the menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne of PCOS (refer to hirsutism guidelines in Ref. recommendation 2.1.1), which treat these two problems concurrently (1|⊕⊕○○).

3.2 We recommend screening for contraindications to HC use via established criteria (see Table 6 and Ref.) (1|⊕⊕⊕○). For women with PCOS, we do not suggest one HC formulation over another (2|⊕⊕○○).

3.1–3.2 Evidence

In women with PCOS, the progestin in HCs suppresses LH levels and thus ovarian androgen production, and the estrogen increases SHBG, thus reducing bioavailable androgen. In addition, some progestins have antiandrogenic properties, due to their antagonizing effects on the androgen receptor and/or to the inhibition of 5α-reductase activity, which have led to claims of increased efficacy for specific formulations without supporting level 1 clinical trial evidence. The choice of oral vs parenteral HC (ie, patch or vaginal ring) is uncertain, although risk-benefit ratios may vary among preparations and with different progestins in oral contraception. There is some evidence that extended-cycle HCs (vs cyclic therapy) offer greater hormonal suppression and prevent rebound ovarian function during the pill-free interval.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^1166DBVf]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — menstrual irregularity — PCOS commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, while obesity and insulin resistance are commonly encountered but are not required for diagnosis. Amenorrhea is generally defined as intervals between periods exceeding 199 days, whereas oligomenorrhea involves intercycle intervals between 35 and 199 days; spontaneous ovulations can occur, with a placebo-arm randomized controlled trial reporting ovulation in 32% of cycles. In women with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, there is an approximately 90% chance that PCOS will also be diagnosed.

### What is the best management strategy for a 20-year-old woman with premature ovarian failure? [^111sJ6XK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of premature ovarian failure (POF) for a 20-year-old woman is devastating and will impact on many areas of her life. She deserves prompt confirmation of the diagnosis and accurate, honest information about the condition including the chances of conception and long-term health issues. She should be offered investigation of aetiology, although this may be hard to establish, and assessment of associated medical conditions. Oestrogen replacement should be advised for long-term use until the normal age of menopause, and she should be fully counselled on the benefits and risks of hormone replacement and her options of which preparation to take. Long-term follow-up is needed, and this is likely to require multidisciplinary input, including that from a gynaecologist, clinical psychologist and fertility team. POF may not be the appropriate terminology for this condition. Ovarian function often fluctuates in young women with POF, who may continue to menstruate occasionally and even conceive spontaneously. In view of this unpredictability, 'premature ovarian insufficiency' is a better description of the condition and carries a less negative connotation than 'ovarian failure' which can cause great distress. We recommend that the condition is termed 'premature ovarian insufficiency' (Clinical Endocrinology 2008;68:499).

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NHTfG]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — androgen assessment while on combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and monitoring: It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the COCP as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotropin-dependent androgen production, and if assessment is imperative the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time. For follow-up, repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role, and in development, in most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12–15 years of age.

### Update on PCOS: consequences, challenges, and guiding treatment [^1111HKxW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis, and less-than-optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. The International PCOS network, consisting of geographically diverse international experts in PCOS as well as consumers, engaged in a multi-year international evidence-based guideline development process that was jointly sponsored by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The guideline was published in 2018 and endorsed by more than 40 international societies involved in PCOS. Translation of this evidence-based guideline to medical practice and consumer groups remains a priority. However, there remain many challenges to both understanding the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Evidence suggests that both clinicians and consumers are not satisfied with the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment options. This review summarizes the important findings for diagnosis and treatment from the guidelines and expands on recent developments in the literature since its publication. Special attention to diagnosis at the ends of the reproductive spectrum are discussed and remaining areas of controversy are noted. Additionally, the review highlights some of the remaining challenges in the understanding and management of PCOS to help guide clinicians and investigators in this perplexing condition.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### Current perspectives in polycystic ovary syndrome [^115ibuw7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome has been viewed primarily as a gynecologic disorder requiring medical intervention to control irregular bleeding, relieve chronic anovulation, and facilitate pregnancy. A large body of evidence has demonstrated an association between insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome. The former condition has an established link with long-term macrovascular diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atherosclerotic heart disease, consequences that also are observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In addition, chronic anovulation predisposes women to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The purpose of this review is to examine the clinical course of this syndrome, which spans adolescence through menopause, and suggest a simple and cost-effective diagnostic evaluation to screen the large numbers of women who may be affected. Therapy, which should be individualized, should incorporate steroid hormones, antiandrogens, and insulin-sensitizing agents. Weight loss by way of reduced carbohydrate intake and gentle exercise is the most important intervention; this step alone can restore menstrual cyclicity and fertility, and provide long-term prevention against diabetes and heart disease. Treatment alternatives should be directed initially toward the most compelling symptom. Longitudinal care is of paramount importance to provide protection from long-term sequelae.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that most likely represents a heterogenous disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. Recent findings suggest PCOS has substantial metabolic sequelae, including risk of diabetes and possibly cardiovascular disease, and that primary treatment should focus on metabolic sequelae. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence on the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

2.2–2.3 Evidence

Infertility was one of the original symptoms of PCOS described by Stein and Leventhal and is a common presenting complaint. Among a large series of women presenting with PCOS, close to 50% reported primary infertility, and 25% reported secondary infertility. Population-based studies of infertility have suggested that anovulatory infertility (encompassing PCOS) is common, accounting for 25–40% of cases. Furthermore, PCOS is estimated to be the most common cause of ovulatory dysfunction, accounting for 70–90% of ovulatory disorders. Prolonged periods of anovulation are likely associated with increased infertility. Women with PCOS had a monthly spontaneous ovulation rate of 32% on placebo in a multicenter trial that randomly assigned subjects to placebo or troglitazone. Nevertheless, lifetime fecundity in Swedish women with PCOS was similar to controls, and almost three-fourths of women with PCOS conceived spontaneously.

Some women with PCOS and a eumenorrheic menstrual history may still experience anovulation, and a midluteal serum progesterone may be helpful as an additional screening test. Although the primary mechanism of infertility is presumed to be oligo- or anovulation, there are other potential factors including diminished oocyte competence and endometrial changes discouraging implantation. Other factors associated with PCOS, such as obesity, have also been associated with subfertility and delayed conception. Male factor infertility or tubal occlusion must also be considered (one study in PCOS found a nearly 10% rate of severe oligospermia and a 5% rate of bilateral tubal occlusion).

2.2–2.3 Values and preferences

In making this recommendation, we emphasize the overall increased infertility burden among women with PCOS and ovulatory dysfunction, although there are spontaneous conceptions, which may increase with improved menstrual frequency and aging. The natural history of fertility in women with PCOS and the influence of milder phenotypes lacking ovulatory dysfunction are not well understood or described.

Pregnancy complications

2.4 Because women with PCOS are at increased risk of pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and pre-eclampsia) exacerbated by obesity, we recommend preconceptual assessment of BMI, blood pressure, and oral glucose tolerance (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length > 35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women < 17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112wF9NW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114H2gM1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive-aged women, with impacts across the lifespan from adolescence to post menopause. PCOS prevalence is between 10% to 13% as confirmed in the guideline process. PCOS aetiology is complex; clinical presentation is heterogeneous with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Women internationally experience delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS remains inconsistent, with ongoing key evidence-practice gaps. Following on from the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, independently evaluated as high quality, this extensive update integrates current literature with previous systematic reviews and extends to new clinical questions prioritized by consumers. Ultimately, we aim to update, extend and translate rigorous, comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and treatment, to improve the lives of those with PCOS worldwide.

To do so, the Guideline leverages substantive government and society investment and brings together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. This comprehensive evidence-based Guideline is constructed from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality clinical service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The Guideline is supported by a multifaceted international translation programme with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of healthcare professionals and to empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program. Here, we summarize recommendations from the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1117JkvU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — postmenopause diagnosis and evaluation states that a diagnosis of PCOS could be considered as enduring / lifelong, and healthcare professionals could consider that both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism persist in the postmenopause for women with PCOS; PCOS diagnosis could be considered postmenopause if there is a past diagnosis, or a long-term history of oligo-amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the earlier reproductive years (age 20–40), and further investigations should be considered to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis in postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism.

### A 27-year-old woman with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111P3mHA]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Ms R, a 27-year-old woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed after irregular menses, hirsutism, and polycystic ovaries, is concerned about weight gain despite regular exercise and watching her diet. Prescribed oral contraceptives to regulate her menses and help reduce her androgen levels, she wants to know the alternatives for treatment of PCOS. The varying definitions of PCOS and its heterogeneity confound the interpretation of studies on PCOS. Specific diagnostic criteria have been established based on expert opinion but have not been validated. Several commonly performed laboratory tests are generally unhelpful and the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Treatment options for Ms R, including those that may affect her weight gain, are reviewed and implications for future fertility are discussed.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: a review of diagnosis and management, with special focus on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention [^114SDtFX]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy worldwide with a heterogeneous clinical presentation including reproductive, metabolic, and endocrine elements. However, the assessment and management of PCOS remains inconsistent, with many women undiagnosed and untreated. We now also understand that the management of PCOS should extend throughout a woman's lifespan as many elements of the syndrome persist after menopause. Management has traditionally focused on the treatment of hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea. Women with PCOS often have dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, which may be worsened by the hormonal abnormalities, and are therefore at higher risk for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, a risk that increases after menopause. While treatment with hormonal therapy, in particular combined oral contraceptives, may improve cardiovascular risk factors, management plans should incorporate specific diagnosis and management of these factors, if present, because of the strong contribution to the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Given the complexities of the syndrome, optimal management often requires a multi-disciplinary approach including the lipid and cardiometabolic specialist to provide counseling and support for lifestyle modification along with pharmacologic therapy as indicated to address the full range of any reproductive, endocrine, and cardiometabolic abnormalities.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114XiTQi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Despite affecting ~11–13% of women globally, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a substantially understudied condition. PCOS, possibly extending to men's health, imposes a considerable health and economic burden worldwide. Diagnosis in adults follows the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, requiring two out of three criteria - clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and/or specific ovarian morphological characteristics or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone. However, diagnosing adolescents omits ovarian morphology and anti-Müllerian hormone considerations. PCOS, marked by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, strongly contributes to early-onset type 2 diabetes, with increased odds for cardiovascular diseases. Reproduction-related implications include irregular menstrual cycles, anovulatory infertility, heightened risks of pregnancy complications and endometrial cancer. Beyond physiological manifestations, PCOS is associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosexual dysfunction and negative body image, collectively contributing to diminished health-related quality of life in patients. Despite its high prevalence persisting into menopause, diagnosing PCOS often involves extended timelines and multiple health-care visits. Treatment remains ad hoc owing to limited understanding of underlying mechanisms, highlighting the need for research delineating the aetiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome. Identifying factors contributing to PCOS will pave the way for personalized medicine approaches. Additionally, exploring novel biomarkers, refining diagnostic criteria and advancing treatment modalities will be crucial in enhancing the precision and efficacy of interventions that will positively impact the lives of patients.

### Contemporary management of the patient with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1155nWRE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex syndrome that affects menstrual regularity, causes hyperandrogenism, increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction and infertility, and is associated with higher rates of mental health disorders. The symptoms of PCOS are unique to each individual and will evolve throughout their reproductive lifespan and beyond. Thus, care should be personalized and provided by an appropriate team of multidisciplinary physicians and clinicians, such as dieticians and psychologists.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111c1GZA]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) for non-fertility features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) could be recommended in reproductive age adults with PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles. The COCP could be considered in adolescents at risk or with a clear diagnosis of PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles. Healthcare professionals could consider that there is no clinical advantage of using high dose ethinylestradiol (≥ 30 μg) versus low dose ethinylestradiol (< 30μg) when treating hirsutism in adults with PCOS. General population guidelines should be considered when prescribing COCP in adults and adolescents with PCOS as specific types or doses of progestins, estrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended. The 35μg ethinyl estradiol plus cyproterone acetate preparations should be considered as second-line therapy over other COCPs, balancing benefits and adverse effects, including venous thromboembolic risks. Progestin only oral contraceptives may be considered for endometrial protection, based on general population guidelines, acknowledging that evidence in women with PCOS is limited.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^112N5i71]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) during adolescence is challenging because features of normal pubertal development overlap with adult diagnostic criteria. The international evidence-based PCOS Guideline aimed to promote accurate and timely diagnosis, to optimise consistent care, and to improve health outcomes for adolescents and women with PCOS.

Methods

International healthcare professionals, evidence synthesis teams and consumers informed the priorities, reviewed published data and synthesised the recommendations for the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied to appraise the evidence quality and the feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and strength of the recommendations.

Results

This paper focuses on the specific adolescent PCOS Guideline recommendations. Specific criteria to improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid over diagnosis include: (1) irregular menstrual cycles defined according to years post-menarche; > 90days for any one cycle (> 1year post-menarche), cycles < 21 or > 45days (> 1 to < 3years post-menarche); cycles < 21 or > 35days (> 3years post-menarche) and primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3years post-thelarche. Irregular menstrual cycles (< 1year post-menarche) represent normal pubertal transition. (2) Hyperandrogenism defined as hirsutism, severe acne and/or biochemical hyperandrogenaemia confirmed using validated high-quality assays. (3) Pelvic ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis of PCOS within 8years post menarche. (4) Anti-Müllerian hormone levels not recommended for PCOS diagnosis; and (5) exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. For adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet diagnostic criteria an 'at risk' label can be considered with appropriate symptomatic treatment and regular re-evaluations. Menstrual cycle re-evaluation can occur over 3years post menarche and where only menstrual irregularity or hyperandrogenism are present initially, evaluation with ultrasound can occur after 8years post menarche. Screening for anxiety and depression is required and assessment of eating disorders warrants consideration. Available data endorse the benefits of healthy lifestyle interventions to prevent excess weight gain and should be recommended. For symptom management, the combined oral contraceptive pill and/or metformin may be beneficial.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement accompanied by rigorous processes honed both diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for PCOS during adolescence.

Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM PCOS consensus — this third consensus report summarizes current knowledge and knowledge gaps on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), covering adolescence, hirsutism and acne, contraception, menstrual cycle abnormalities, quality of life, ethnicity, pregnancy complications, long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health, and malignancy and stroke risk. PCOS is described as the most common endocrine disorder in women, with prevalence between 6% and 10% using U.S. National Institutes of Health criteria and as high as 10% to 15% with Rotterdam criteria. PCOS is typically first identified during the early reproductive years, and clinical expression commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism (either clinical or biochemical), and the presence of polycystic ovaries. This work follows earlier ESHRE/ASRM workshops that focused on diagnosis (2004) and infertility management (2008).

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: "Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion", whereas "the Rotterdam definition… allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities [^111NnsYL]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic goals

Difficulty in losing weight, irregular menses, infertility, and excessive hair growth were the most important health problems reported by patients with polycystic ovary syndrome in an international survey. These problems should therefore represent the main targets for therapeutic intervention, although priority setting partnerships are still needed to help focus research priorities. Existing drug treatments have not been licensed specifically for polycystic ovary syndrome and are used off-label to target symptoms. Also, previous studies have not emphasised health related quality of life measures when evaluating response to treatment. An ideal treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome should look at the health risks, reduce key processes in the pathogenesis of the disease, and be responsive to the symptom profile and needs of the individual. Where relevant, treatments should reduce clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, restore ovulatory cycles and fertility, normalise the length of the menstrual cycle, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce weight and cardiometabolic risk, and improve condition specific quality of life.

Appendix 2

Summary of treatment options in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea

- Lifestyle change (5% to 10% weight loss and structured exercise).

- Oral contraceptive pill (OCP; low oestrogen doses, for example 20 μg may be preferable).

- Cyclic progestins (for example, 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate for 14 days every 2 to 3 months).

- Metformin (improves ovulation and menstrual cyclicity).

Hirsutism treatment recommendations

- Cosmetic therapy.

- Laser treatment.

- Eflornithine cream can be added and may induce a more rapid response.

Pharmacological therapy

- Medical therapy if patient concerned about hirsutism and cosmetic therapy ineffective, inaccessible or unaffordable.

- Primary therapy is the OCP (monitor glucose tolerance in those at risk of diabetes).

- Antiandrogen monotherapy should not be used without adequate contraception.

- Trial therapies for ≥ 6 months before changing dose or medication.

- Combination therapy: if ≥ 6 months of OCP is ineffective, add antiandrogen to OCP (daily spironolactone 50 mg twice a day or cyproterone acetate 25 mg/day for days 1 to 10 of the active OCP tablets).

Infertility

- Obesity independently exacerbates infertility and reduces effectiveness of interventions. Maternal and foetal pregnancy risks are greater and long-term metabolic outcomes in the child are related to maternal weight at conception. Consistent with international guidelines, women who are overweight prior to conception should be advised on folate, smoking cessation, weight loss and optimal exercise, prior to additional interventions.

- Given age-related infertility, advise women to optimise family planning.

- Infertility therapies may include clomiphene, gonadotrophins and in vitro fertilisation.

Metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk

Obesity independently causes metabolic complications; lifestyle/exercise is critical:

- Lifestyle change with a 5% weight loss reduces diabetes risk by approximately 50% to 60% in high-risk groups.

- Metformin* reduces the risk of diabetes by approximately 50% in high-risk groups.

*Metformin and the OCP are not currently approved for use to manage PCOS by many regulatory bodies. The OCP is primarily indicated for contraception and metformin for diabetes. However, their use is recommended by international and national specialist societies and is evidence based.

Consensus Recommendations (CR) state "In the absence of adequate evidence, a consensus recommendation has been made by the guideline development group, also informed by evidence from the general population". Practice Points (PP) indicate "Evidence not sought. A practice point has been made by the guideline development group where important issues arose from discussion of evidence-based or consensus recommendations".

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — oral contraceptives (OCPs): Overall, the benefits of OCPs outweigh the risks in most patients with PCOS (level B), and in the absence of other risk factors there is no evidence that women with PCOS are at increased risk with OCPs compared with normal women (level C), although women with PCOS are more likely to have contraindications for OCP use than normal women (level C). There is no evidence for differences in effectiveness and risk among the various progestogens and when used in combination with a 20 versus a 30 μg daily dose of estrogen (level B), and subsequent fertility is not negatively affected by OCPs (level C); there is also no definitive evidence that the type of OCP determines efficacy of hirsutism control (level C). Evidence on metabolic effects is limited; a Cochrane review concluded that OCP use does not increase metabolic risk, and small studies suggest long-term OCP use either does not change or improves cardiometabolic risk parameters, while there are few randomized double-blind trials assessing these outcomes. Key research needs include that head-to-head blinded trials comparing different OCP strategies are lacking and that there is a lack of longitudinal follow-up studies after a course of OCPs.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113k9CJ8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

2 | INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% to 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. – Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, – resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, AGREEII-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to upskill health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1147rL4E]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

3.1 Ovulatory dysfunction

Women with PCOS commonly present with irregular menstrual cycles and anovulation, although neither of the criteria are mandatory for the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam consensus. As follicle development is slowed down by low action of follicle‐stimulating hormone partly due to high anti‐Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, menstrual cycles tend to be longer in women with PCOS, thus resulting in oligomenorrhea. In cases with a more severe PCOS phenotype, women may also experience amenorrhoea. Indeed, a previous study showed that women with anovulation present more often with amenorrhoea (23.6%) compared to women with oligoovulation (10.3%). The cycle length on average is 60 days for women with anovulation and 43 days for women with oligoovulation. The women with anovulation and amenorrhoea also have higher androgen levels and waist circumference. In line with this, another study reported cycle length reflects the severity of the syndrome, with the women with amenorrhoea representing a more severe phenotype. Even though longer cycle length seems to predict anovulation, normal cycles may also present with anovulation. Interestingly, a study with over 3700 spontaneously menstruating women, aged 20–49.9 years and regular cycles, showed that as high as 26%–37% of cycles were anovulatory when validated against serum progesterone < 3 ng/ml during the luteal phase. In clinical practice, measuring luteinizing hormone surge that occurs one to one and a half days before expected ovulation (ovulation occurring 14 days before expected menses) or luteal phase serum progesterone (≥ 3 ng/ml 7 days prior expected menses and ± 3 days) can assist in cases where ovulation is uncertain despite normal cycle length. Moreover, a previously published clinical review suggests cycle length > 35 days being indicative for chronic anovulation, whereas in cases of cycle length that is slightly longer than normal (32–35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days), assessment for OD should be evaluated if only one other signs of the syndrome is present. It has to be noted though, that when establishing the diagnosis, ovulation assessments are quite rarely needed as usually other characteristics (PCOM and HA) are present (Phenotype C). There are also some challenges in diagnosing anovulation and irregular menses especially in adolescents and young women as OD may persist long after menarche. The international guideline, therefore, calls for caution in diagnosing PCOS in young women less than 8 years from menarche. It has to be noted also that affected women gain regular cycles with ageing. Whether this results in more frequent ovulation or increased likelihood of spontaneous pregnancies is unclear and needs to be determined in future studies. The international PCOS EBG supports retrospective diagnosis if the woman has a history of irregular cycles in the presence of other diagnostic PCOS features (e.g. clinical/biochemical HA, PCOM). Considering this, regular cycles in an older woman may not prevent establishing the diagnosis.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) exercise intervention — Healthcare professionals and women could consider that there is a lack of evidence supporting any one type and intensity of exercise being better than another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive or psychological outcomes. Any physical activity consistent with population guidelines will have health benefits and, within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable physical activity based on individual preferences and goals.

The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict of interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before they are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict of interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.

Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (eg, stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through The Endocrine Society office.

Funding for this guideline was derived solely from The Endocrine Society, and thus the Task Force received no funding or remuneration from commercial or other entities.

1.0 Diagnosis of PCOS

Diagnosis in adults

1.1 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or PCO (Tables 1 and 2), whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded. These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum 17-OHP) (Table 3). In select women with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes, we suggest more extensive evaluation excluding other causes (Table 4) (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial carcinoma [^112RPsro]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

An association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)and endometrial carcinoma was first suggested in 1949, 14 years after the original description of the syndrome. Since then several studies have been published that seem to support this association. The prescription of hormonal treatment to reduce the risk of this complication is supported by the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, the Health Information website of the National Library of Medicine, USA, and in textbooks of gynaecological oncology.

Starting Point

A recent practice bulletin from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on the clinical management of PCOS (Obstet Gynecol 2002; 100: 1389–402) says that there is still no consensus on the "optimal progestin, duration and frequency of treatment to prevent endometrial cancer in women with PCOS". Chronic anovulation, obesity, and hyperinsulinaemia are all associated with PCOS as well as with endometrial carcinoma. It has been assumed that PCOS predisposes to endometrial cancer. However, the evidence for such an association is inconclusive. Although PCOS is associated with risk factors for endometrial cancer, it does not necessarily follow that the incidence or mortality from endometrial cancer is increased.

Where Next

Large-scale studies of morbidity and mortality in unselected populations of women with PCOS are needed. Women with PCOS are increasingly aware of the possible risks, and it will be necessary to identify which of them, if any, are at increased risk and how this risk can be effectively reduced.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in diagnosis states that serum AMH could be used for defining PCOM in adults and should only be used in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm, noting that in patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an AMH level is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis. We recommend that serum AMH should not be used as a single test for the diagnosis of PCOS, and serum AMH should not yet be used in adolescents. Either serum AMH or ultrasound may be used to define PCOM; however, both tests should not be performed to limit overdiagnosis. Laboratories and healthcare professionals need to be aware of factors that influence AMH in the general population including that serum AMH generally peaks between the ages of 20–25 years in the general population, serum AMH is lower in those with higher BMI in the general population, serum AMH may be suppressed by current or recent COCP use, serum AMH may vary across the menstrual cycle, and that laboratories involved in AMH measurements in females should use population and assay specific cut-offs.

Bariatric/metabolic surgery in polycystic ovary syndrome — Bariatric/metabolic surgery could be considered to improve weight loss, hypertension, diabetes (prevention and treatment), hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS, and bariatric/metabolic surgery in women with PCOS should be informed by general population guidelines. PCOS is a metabolic condition and could be considered an indication at a lower BMI threshold for bariatric/metabolic surgery similarly to other metabolic conditions including diabetes. Women should be strongly counselled on the likelihood of rapid return of fertility and the need to commit to effective contraception, ideally prior to surgery, and even when pregnancy is desired, contraception should be continued until a stable weight is achieved, usually after one year, to avoid significantly increased risk of growth restriction, prematurity, small for gestational age, pregnancy complications, and prolonged hospitalization of the infant.

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^11131eWW]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — contraception with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) encompasses chronic management benefits and mechanisms: OCPs are the mainstay for women not seeking pregnancy, improve hyperandrogenic skin manifestations, regulate menstrual cycles, and lower endometrial carcinoma risk; they suppress LH, increase SHBG with decreased free T, antagonize androgen action, and may decrease adrenal androgens. Progestin androgenicity varies (norethindrone, norgestrel, levonorgestrel more androgenic; desogestrel, norgestimate, gestodene less), and antiandrogenic progestin combinations (ethinyl estradiol with cyproterone acetate) have been most studied, with few studies of drospirenone or chlormadinone and none with dienogest in PCOS. Overall, OCPs are effective for long-term management, but concerns remain about potential long-term risks related to cardiovascular disease and glucose intolerance.

### Use of exogenous gonadotropins for ovulation induction in anovulatory women: a committee opinion [^113fzJzv]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Gonadotropin regimens for ovulation induction in PCOS should therefore only be used by clinicians having the requisite training and experience, with the goal to promote the growth and development of a single mature follicle; women with PCOS may begin after a menses induced by brief exogenous progestin, though progestin withdrawal bleed may decrease pregnancy rates, and baseline ultrasonography should be performed to exclude ovarian cysts; exogenous FSH alone can induce ovulation in PCOS and there is no significant advantage to using any specific gonadotropin preparation, with outcomes similar for human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) versus FSH alone and for recombinant versus urinary FSH; the first dose-finding cycle typically uses 37.5–75 IU/day with small increments after 7 days or more if no follicle ≥ 10 mm has developed, 7–12 total treatment days are typical though longer may be required, and once a mature follicle has developed, exogenous hCG is administered to stimulate ovulation.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^116XxaTQ]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Adolescent PCOS — management considerations: Generally, combined steroid oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) — either containing or not containing an antiandrogen — may be safely used, but the usual contraindications to administration should be carefully considered, and lipid patterns should be evaluated before and after a few months of treatment. Special attention should be given to body weight because obesity during adolescence may influence ovarian function; psychological and dietary treatment should be used in obese adolescent girls, and in some patients, especially if glucose intolerance is present, metformin may be added. Many patients with milder phenotypes may only need symptomatic treatment of hirsutism, and cardiovascular and metabolic risks are much lower in patients with mild PCOS phenotypes.

Adolescents 'at risk' of PCOS

A practice point for this section is that, for adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet the diagnostic criteria, the 'at risk' of PCOS label could be considered and reassessment is advised at or before full reproductive maturity. This timing is at 3 years post menarche in relation to menstrual cycle irregularity and at 8 years post menarche in relation to the use of pelvic ultrasound to identify a polycystic ovarian morphology, as described in the ultrasound section. The timing of reassessment in relation to menstrual cycles was based on physiological maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary ovarian axis and the likelihood of having ovulatory cycles matching those of women in reproductive age. Reassessment is particularly important for adolescent girls with persisting PCOS features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence and should occur after hormonal therapy washout of at least 3 months if this therapy has been commenced (whilst ensuring contraceptive needs are met). This recommendation is based on the need to address isolated symptoms, such as irregular menstrual cycles or clinical hyperandrogenism, where the diagnosis of PCOS remains unclear as pelvic ultrasound is not recommended at this life stage. PCOS cannot be diagnosed during adolescence unless both irregular menstrual cycles or hyperandrogenism are present. It was recommended that these adolescents be made aware of their 'at risk' status for PCOS and that future re-evaluation may be needed if both features persist beyond 3 years post menarche. This recommendation emerged from published evidence as well as from strong and consistent feedback from women with PCOS, who had a poor diagnostic experience and often failed to be diagnosed during adolescence, remaining unaware of this potential diagnosis until seeking treatment for infertility (see Section 1.1 in the Technical Report). Adult physicians and reproductive endocrinologists also expressed significant concern over delayed diagnosis. All GDGs highlighted the need to acknowledge 'risk' yet avoid over-diagnosis or premature labelling. Another practice point for this section is that, in adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles and 'at risk', the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the adolescent and their families, considering all diagnostic challenges at this life stage as well as psychosocial and cultural factors.

Lifestyle Interventions

Nine CPGs recommended lifestyle treatments (LSTs) as first-line intervention in adolescents and adult women with PCOS. The majority of these CPGs recommended a mixture of calorie-restricted diet, exercise, and behavioral interventions as the main features of LSTs. Four CPGs recommended a weight loss target between 5% and 10% with LSTs. There were no clear recommendations on the type of diet to offer women with PCOS with varied recommendations for hypocaloric diet (deficit between 500 and 700 kcal/day) and a focus on low glycemic index food intake. Similarly, there was no clear consensus on the optimal duration or type of physical exercise to recommend. Three CPGs recommended 150 min/week and 90 min/week of aerobic moderate-high intensity exercise for weight maintenance. Three CPGs recommended combining LSTs with pharmacological treatments such as metformin to optimize weight loss after 6 months, and 3 recommended bariatric surgery in obese women with PCOS if LST alone failed to achieve sufficient weight loss.

Management of Menstrual Irregularity

Six CPGs recommended the use of hormonal contraceptives as first-line of treatment for managing menstrual irregularity in adult women with PCOS and 5 recommended their use in adolescents with suspected/confirmed PCOS diagnosis. The use of metformin, cyproterone acetate, and drospirenone was recommended as a second-line treatment for menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and acne in 3 CPGs. Most of these CPGs recommended using the same screening criteria as for safe use of hormonal contraceptive in the general population. The use of progesterone to induce regular withdrawal bleeds in amenorrheic women with PCOS was recommended in 3 CPGs.

Management of Hirsutism and Acne

Only 5 CPGs made direct recommendations on treatments for hirsutism and acne with 3 CPGs recommending photoepilation and topical eflornithine as the first line of treatment. By contrast, the Endocrine Society guideline recommended using hormonal contraceptives as the first-line treatment in adolescents with suspected PCOS to treat acne, hirsutism, and anovulatory symptoms. Antiandrogen medications alone or combined with hormonal contraceptives were recommended as second-line treatments in 4 CPGs.

### A woman with polycystic ovary syndrome treated for infertility by in vitro fertilization [^114Xn4Gx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 25-year-old South Asian woman presented at an infertility unit with a 2-year history of anovulatory infertility. She had experienced irregular and infrequent periods for over a decade.

Investigations

Endocrine profile (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-function test, prolactin, testosterone), oral glucose tolerance test and pelvic ultrasonography were performed.

Diagnosis

Polycystic ovary syndrome, in accordance with the recent Rotterdam consensus (2004) criteria.

Management

The patient failed to conceive by conventional ovulation-induction therapies with clomifene and gonadotropins. She subsequently underwent an in vitro fertilization cycle, to which she over-responded and developed a severe form of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was based on clinical and ultrasonographic features. She was hospitalized and needed extensive supportive care, including insertion of chest and abdominal drains.

### Use of exogenous gonadotropins for ovulation induction in anovulatory women: a committee opinion [^117MrqFK]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Gonadotropin ovulation induction — practice management and dosing guidance specifies that gonadotropin cycles should be managed by a clinician with the requisite training and experience, with the goal of developing a single mature follicle; monofollicular development sometimes can be difficult to achieve and decreases the risk of multiple gestation and OHSS, which cannot be completely eliminated. Patients should be counseled on risks prior to cycle start. Gonadotropins should be started at a low dose of 37.5–75 IU a day and cautiously increased as needed for monofollicular development. Cycle cancellation should be considered if more than two follicles ≥ 16 mm develop or if three or more intermediate-sized follicles develop. Luteal support is beneficial after ovulation induction with gonadotropins in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, while in PCOS there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

In the present study we demonstrate that using a weekly incremental dose as small as 8.3 IU of FSH in a chronic ultra low-dose step-up protocol for anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) produces very good clinical results with an excellent safety profile. Although using a significantly lower incremental (16.6% of the initial dose) and total (622 ± 286 IU) gonadotropin dose, compared with the widely used and accepted low-dose gonadotropins regimen, a clinical pregnancy rate (PR) of almost 30% per started cycle has been achieved with just one twin gestation and no case of even mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

In those cases in which there is overlay between functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), options include medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 to 10 mg/d for 5 to 10 days), norethindrone acetate (5 mg/d for 5 to 10 days), or micronized progesterone (200 to 300 mg/d for 10 days). Progestins are not well tolerated by some patients, so some clinicians may start with a shorter, 5-day course and repeat in a few weeks if there is no withdrawal bleed; follow-up with a pelvic ultrasound may be necessary to assess endometrial thickness and Müllerian tract integrity, and the latter may require confirmation with MRI.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^116nbmP1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

During adolescence, accurate diagnostic criteria and/or identification of adolescents "at risk" of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are critical to establish appropriate screening, treatment, and lifelong health plans. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS aimed to provide the most up-to-date evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes for individuals with PCOS, emphasizing accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS from adolescence.

Methods

The best practice methods following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) criteria were applied. Healthcare professionals and patients/consumers reviewed extensive evidence synthesis/meta-analysis for 55 prioritized clinical questions. Databases (OVID MEDLINE, All EBM, PsycInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched until August 2022 as part of the 2023 update of the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework guided experts on evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength.

Results

This manuscript focuses on the adolescent-specific recommendations of the 2023 Guideline. The diagnosis is based on the presence of both irregular menstrual cycles (defined according to the time postmenarche) and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. Adolescents with only one of these features can be considered "at risk" of PCOS requiring the management of symptoms and ongoing follow-up. Polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasonography or anti-Müllerian hormone levels should not be used for diagnosis during adolescence. Lifelong health planning is recommended to include healthy lifestyles, screening for depression and metabolic features and the transition to adult care, all underpinned by shared decision-making. Healthcare professionals should explain weight-related health risks to adolescents, while minimizing weight stigma. In adolescents with PCOS or "at risk" of PCOS, combined oral contraceptive pills are indicated for menstrual irregularity and clinical hyperandrogenism, focusing on low dose preparations, and metformin could be considered for metabolic features and cycle regulation. Overall, the evidence is limited in adolescents with PCOS, and recommendations are based on low to moderate certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement and rigorous processes generated International Guideline diagnostic criteria for adolescents that differ from adult criteria and clarified appropriate screening and management strategies for PCOS during adolescence.

### A comparison study of a novel stimulation protocol and the conventional low dose step-up and step-down regimens in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing in vitro fertilization [^1124tBQ6]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of a sequential step-up/step-down protocol with the conventional low dose step-up and the step-down regimens in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing IVF.

Design

Prospective randomized study.

Setting

Private fertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Two hundred twenty-five, 30-year-old or younger, women with PCOS.

Intervention(S)

The low dose step-up, the step-down, and a sequential step-up/step-down regimens were used.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ovarian response, pregnancy (PR) and miscarriage rate.

Result(S)

Patients in group A (low dose step-up) exhibited the highest cancellation rate, whereas subjects in group C (sequential regimen) the lowest. The hormonal dosage (ampules) and duration of stimulation (days) was higher in group A patients and lower in group B (step-down regimen). The follicular growth uniformity was superior in group C patients who also achieved a higher number of eggs at retrieval, better fertilization and embryo development rates. The sequential group yielded the highest pregnancy and the lowest miscarriage rate.

Conclusion(S)

The sequential step-up/step-down stimulation protocol is superior to the low dose step-up and step-down regimens with regard to ovarian response, PR and miscarriage rate in 30-year-old or younger patients with PCOS undergoing IVF.

### Approach to the patient: contraception in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115kDTyM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive and metabolic disorder. Patients with PCOS present with clinical signs of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism and acne), menstrual irregularities, and infertility. Combined oral contraceptive (OC) pills are the first-line medical therapy for the long-term management of PCOS. Containing a combination of estrogen and progestin, OCs restore regular menses, improve androgen excess, and provide effective contraception and protection from endometrial cancer. The benefits of hormonal contraception outweigh the risks in the vast majority of women with PCOS. However, concerns have been raised about potential adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects of OCs. Currently available evidence indicates an increased relative risk of venous thrombosis associated with OCs varying among different formulations. Arterial thrombosis risk attributable to OCs does not appear to be significantly increased in young nonsmoking women. OC use might be associated with increased risk of diabetes in morbidly obese women with PCOS with severe insulin resistance. A tailored clinical approach to oral contraception in women with PCOS requires individualized risk stratification and management by determination of each PCOS patient's personal cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline and during follow-up. Before prescribing an OC, clinicians should document individual risk factors including age, smoking, obesity, any degree of glucose intolerance including prediabetes and diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, thrombophilia, and personal or family history of a venous thromboembolic event.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review summarizes the knowledge of COCP treatment in PCOS compared with no medical treatment. These results form part of the evidence included in the 2023 update of the International Evidence‐Based Guidelines on the assessment and treatment of PCOS. As expected, COCP improved cycle regularity compared with control; however, here with low certainty of evidence. Additional evidence regarding COCP treatment versus no medical treatment (controls/placebo/lifestyle) is currently only available at a very low certainty of evidence in women with PCOS.

### Combined oral contraceptive pill compared with no medical treatment in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review [^114zzMJV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

PCOS is a common, complex reproductive, metabolic and psychological condition which impacts many aspects of a woman's life. Here we have identified that only a few studies exist with all outcomes having low to very low certainty of evidence reflecting that research in PCOS has been underfunded and underprioritised, with limited high‐quality studies. Thus, the pending 2023 updated PCOS guidelines encompassed evidence from the general population when making recommendations. Based on this combined data, COCP use in women with PCOS is recommended to provide contraception, cycle regulation and to treat clinical hyperandrogenism. Further studies are needed in PCOS to understand the nuances of COCP efficacy, safety and adverse effects in this common and neglected condition to promote individualised therapeutic interventions.
