## Question

High-dose vitamin D for myasthenia gravis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-dose vitamin D has a therapeutic role in myasthenia gravis, what the efficacy and safety look like, and how to translate that into a clinical recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current MG guideline-based standard of care and whether vitamin D appears anywhere in that pathway. Then, I should verify if there is any MG-specific clinical trial evidence for vitamin D, especially at high doses. Next, I will review mechanistic plausibility versus clinical outcomes and consider related autoimmune data. After that, I need to examine the safety profile of high-dose vitamin D, particularly hypercalcemia and its immunologic consequences. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation, including when standard replacement might be appropriate and how to monitor safely [^115tWNob] [^115vXcS7] [^112Fht4Q] [^11261QAQ].

> Let me first confirm the standard treatment framework for MG and whether vitamin D is included at all, because I need to ensure I am not missing a guideline-endorsed niche use. The international consensus guidance emphasizes pyridostigmine for symptomatic control, corticosteroids and nonsteroidal immunosuppressants for disease control, and advanced biologics or IVIG for refractory disease, with thymectomy in selected patients; vitamin D is notably absent from these algorithms, which signals no established disease-modifying role in MG management per current standards [^115tWNob] [^115vXcS7] [^112Fht4Q] [^11261QAQ].

> I will now examine MG-specific clinical evidence for vitamin D, and I should double-check whether any trials used high-dose strategies. The single MG study available is a small, uncontrolled pilot that gave cholecalciferol 800 IU/day and reported improved fatigue and modest increases in 25(OH)D over about six months; however, there was no control arm, the sample was tiny, core MG outcomes were limited, and importantly, this was standard replacement, not high-dose therapy, so it cannot justify high-dose use in MG at all [^115MJgFV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from mechanistic hypotheses; I need to check how plausibility aligns with human outcomes. Vitamin D can downregulate adaptive immune responses and promote tolerogenic dendritic cells and Treg activity, and large primary prevention data suggest reduced risk of some autoimmune diseases with supplementation, but there are no MG-directed interventional data to support a therapeutic effect, so plausibility alone should not drive off-label high-dose practice in MG [^116MtQJ2] [^113Go8Pg] [^116fiStm].

> Next, I should review safety signals from high-dose strategies, because even a biologically plausible agent can be counterproductive if toxicity amplifies immune activation. Calcitriol and vitamin D overdosing are well known to cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and related complications requiring prompt cessation and monitoring, underscoring the narrow therapeutic window when pharmacologic activation of the vitamin D axis is excessive [^112Nbuvs] [^112Fktmf] [^1165vUWT].

> Let me consider adjacent evidence from severe illness and neuroinflammation to gauge external safety and efficacy signals. In the VIOLET RCT, a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU vitamin D3 in critically ill vitamin D–deficient adults did not improve mortality, which tempers enthusiasm for empiric high-dose regimens and highlights the potential for harm without clear benefit in stressed physiologic states where calcium balance is fragile [^113Raj3k].

> Now, mechanistic autoimmunity models are informative but I should verify directionality carefully. One murine study showed that moderate vitamin D reduced EAE severity and expanded Tregs, whereas very high 25(OH)D levels (> 200 nmol/L) triggered fulminant EAE via hypercalcemia that heightened T-cell excitability and proinflammatory trafficking; the text even suggests that vitamin D at moderate levels may exert a dire impact on T cell activation, but wait, that cannot be right given the earlier protective effect at moderate dosing, so the harm signal is actually tied to high-dose–induced hypercalcemia rather than physiologic replacement, which is the critical distinction for clinical safety [^114npqfW].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the recommendation is tightly evidence-based and clinically safe. There is no evidence to support high-dose vitamin D as a treatment for MG, and there are credible mechanistic and regulatory safety concerns that high-dose regimens can provoke hypercalcemia and potentially worsen autoimmune activation, so high-dose vitamin D should not be used as disease-modifying therapy in MG; however, standard-dose vitamin D can be appropriate for bone health in patients on long-term corticosteroids as per neurologic guidance, typically in the 400–800 IU/day range with calcium if indicated and with appropriate monitoring [^115tWNob] [^117QMcSZ].

> For practical management, I should confirm deficiency and risk before supplementing beyond routine bone protection, then monitor carefully. Use cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol per Endocrine Society guidance to treat vitamin D deficiency, consider risk factors like chronic steroid use and malabsorption, avoid unmonitored high-dose loading outside clear indications, aim for sufficiency thresholds defined by bone guidelines, and monitor serum calcium and 25(OH)D to avoid hypercalcemia, especially during dose adjustments [^114GRJMf] [^114tvLJq] [^113zRN7e] [^112Fktmf].

> Let me also ensure we are maximizing MG-directed options that actually reduce steroid burden and improve outcomes, since the impetus for high-dose vitamin D may be to find a steroid-sparing path. Evidence-based steroid-sparing and refractory options include azathioprine and other conventional IS agents, FcRn antagonism with efgartigimod, and complement inhibition with agents like zilucoplan and ravulizumab or eculizumab, which have demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in MG outcomes in randomized trials and are aligned with guideline pathways [^112Fht4Q] [^112MgmuD] [^116Bf541] [^111u5TPs] [^111nDSvb].

> In conclusion, I should reiterate the key checks: no MG guideline supports vitamin D as therapy, no high-dose MG trials exist, and high-dose supplementation carries real hypercalcemic risk with potential autoimmune exacerbation, so I do not recommend high-dose vitamin D for MG; reserve vitamin D for standard bone health prophylaxis with steroids or for documented deficiency, and if uncertainty remains, consider endocrinology input and avoid exceeding physiologic replacement while continuing guideline-concordant MG treatments and monitoring [^115tWNob] [^115vXcS7] [^114npqfW] [^117QMcSZ] [^114GRJMf].

High-dose vitamin D is not recommended for myasthenia gravis because there is **no clinical evidence** of benefit and **significant risks** [^112Fktmf] of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment. MG guidelines do not include vitamin D as **therapy** [^112Fht4Q]; standard care remains pyridostigmine [^111WPcn9], corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants [^113ssjRj]. Vitamin D should be used **only to correct deficiency**, with monitoring of serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels to avoid toxicity [^114GRJMf] [^113zRN7e].

---

## Evidence for high-dose vitamin D supplementation in MG

Clinical evidence does not support **high-dose vitamin D** for MG, and current **guidelines** [^115tWNob] do not recommend it as therapy.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation

High-dose vitamin D supplementation carries **significant risks**, particularly in patients with autoimmune disorders such as MG [^114npqfW]:

- **Hypercalcemia**: Excessive vitamin D intake can cause hypercalcemia [^112Nbuvs], leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and confusion.

- **Hypercalciuria**: Elevated calcium levels can result in hypercalciuria [^112Fktmf] [^1165vUWT], increasing the risk of kidney stones and renal impairment.

- **Renal impairment**: High-dose vitamin D supplementation can cause renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions.

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D supplementation can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias [^112Fktmf], especially in patients on digitalis therapy.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines for MG management **do not include vitamin D supplementation** as a standard treatment:

- **Pyridostigmine**: Recommended as initial symptomatic therapy for MG [^115tWNob].

- **Corticosteroids**: Recommended for patients who do not achieve treatment goals with pyridostigmine alone [^114GeJBr] [^112Fht4Q].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and other immunosuppressants are recommended for long-term management of MG [^112MgmuD] [^112Fht4Q].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

High-dose vitamin D supplementation is **not recommended** [^115tWNob] for patients with MG because efficacy is unproven and there are significant risks of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment [^112Fktmf] [^112Nbuvs]. Current clinical guidelines do not include vitamin D supplementation as standard treatment for MG [^112Fht4Q]. Therefore, vitamin D should be used only to correct deficiency [^114GRJMf], with careful monitoring of serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels [^113zRN7e] to avoid toxicity.

Overdosage

Administration of calcitriol to patients in excess of their daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are the same as for an overdose of vitamin D [see adverse reactions]. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with calcitriol may lead to similar abnormalities. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg²/dL². High levels of calcium in the dialysate bath may contribute to the hypercalcemia [see warnings].

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in dialysis patients and hypoparathyroidism patients**: General treatment of hypercalcemia (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of the normal range) consists of immediate discontinuation of calcitriol therapy, institution of a low-calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be determined daily until normocalcemia ensues. Hypercalcemia frequently resolves in 2 to 7 days. When serum calcium levels have returned to within normal limits, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dose of 0.25 mcg/day less than prior therapy. Serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly after all dosage changes and subsequent dosage titration. In dialysis patients, persistent or markedly elevated serum calcium levels may be corrected by dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^115tWNob]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of myasthenia gravis, specifically concerning acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend administering pyridostigmine as part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. It is important to adjust the pyridostigmine dose as needed based on symptoms. Recognize that the ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can indicate that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^113ssjRj]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Symptomatic and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) involves several key steps:

1. Pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. The dose of pyridostigmine should be adjusted as needed based on symptoms. The ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can indicate that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or IS therapy should be used in all patients with MG who have not met treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine.

2. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used alone when corticosteroids are contraindicated or refused. It should be used initially in conjunction with corticosteroids when the risk of steroid side effects is high based on medical comorbidities. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be added to corticosteroids when:
	- **Steroid side effects**: Deemed significant by the patient or the treating physician, develop.
	- **Response to corticosteroids is inadequate**: After an adequate trial (Table e-1).
	- **Inability to reduce corticosteroid dose**: Due to symptom relapse.

3. Nonsteroidal IS agents that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. The following factors should be considered in selecting among these agents:
	- **Variation in practice**: There is widespread variation in practice with respect to choice of IS agent since there is little literature comparing them.
	- **First-line IS agent**: Expert consensus and some RCT evidence support the use of azathioprine as a first-line IS agent in MG.
	- **RCT evidence**: Supports the use of cyclosporine in MG, but potential serious adverse effects must be considered.

### Calcitriol [^112Fktmf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Excessive dosage of calcitriol injection can lead to hypercalcemia and, in some cases, hypercalciuria. Therefore, during the early stages of treatment, while adjusting the dosage, it is crucial to determine serum calcium and phosphorus levels at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia develops, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Calcitriol injection must be administered cautiously to patients on digitalis, as hypercalcemia in these patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

Patients and their guardians should be informed about the importance of following dietary instructions and calcium supplementation guidelines. They should also be advised to avoid the use of unapproved non-prescription drugs, including magnesium-containing antacids. Additionally, they should be educated on the symptoms of hypercalcemia.

Essential laboratory tests include determining serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase levels, as well as 24-hour urinary calcium and phosphorus, at regular intervals. During the initial phase of treatment, serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be checked more frequently (twice weekly).

Adynamic bone disease may develop if parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are suppressed to abnormal levels. In cases where a biopsy is not conducted for diagnostic purposes, PTH levels can be used to indicate the rate of bone turnover. If PTH levels fall below the recommended target range (1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) in patients treated with calcitriol injection, the dosage should be reduced or the therapy discontinued. Discontinuation of calcitriol therapy may result in rebound effects.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: A supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113Nq6E5]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Active thymopoiesis in thymomas occurs under conditions favoring autoimmunity: thymomas exhibit defective expression of the autoimmune regulator AIRE, which normally drives 'promiscuous' expression of peripheral tissue autoantigens (including the AChR α-subunit) in thymic epithelial cells. Thymomas also have reduced or absent thymic myoid cells. Neoplastic epithelial cells variably express striational antigen epitopes, including epitopes of titin and various AChR subunits (but not whole receptors) together with reduced levels of MHC-class II. These altered properties of neoplastic epithelial cells can profoundly interfere with both positive and negative selection of maturing thymocytes and the activation status of mature T cells.

Moreover, in concert with reduced levels of AIRE, these alterations result in defective generation of regulatory T cells by thymomas. Together, these changes in the thymic microenvironment favor the export of substantial numbers of naïve and pre-primed auto-reactive T cells into the periphery. These cells gradually replace the patient's native, more tolerant T cell repertoire in the periphery. In the peripheral lymphatic tissue, they apparently stimulate the pathogenic B cell response after appropriate activation. This usually occurs before, but rarely after, thymoma resection. This impact of the thymoma on the peripheral immune system explains why TAMG, once initiated, is self-sustaining even after complete thymoma removal, which is typically accompanied by resection of the residual thymus.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from the binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000 and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^1123ddQ1]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, specifically concerning corticosteroids, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend reducing the dose slowly to the minimum effective dose administered on alternate days when remission occurs, usually after 4–16 weeks.

### Initial treatment response in ocular myasthenia gravis: A comparison between low and moderate doses of prednisolone [^1118hKcM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment recommendations in ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) are generally based on low-level evidence guidelines from clinical experiences, expert opinions, and consensus reports. Further prospective and randomized controlled studies to compare the efficacy of low-dose and moderate-dose prednisolone are encouraged to confirm our results. These could lead to a new standard treatment guideline being established to address this disease with optimism, maximize therapeutic responses, and minimize adverse events.

### Methylprednisolone sodium succinate [^111gAXMi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g. myasthenia gravis) or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g. pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevations of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Additionally, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

- **Ophthalmic**: Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: In post-marketing experience, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients with malignancies, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors, following the use of systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Patients at high risk of TLS, such as those with tumors that have a high proliferative rate, high tumor burden, and high sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions should be taken.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly to avoid potential adverse effects.

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^113G69mB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

We examined the correlation between the dosing regimen of oral prednisolone (PSL) and the achievement of minimal manifestation status or better on PSL ≤ 5 mg/day lasting > 6 months (the treatment target) in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (MG). We classified 590 patients with generalised MG into high-dose (n = 237), intermediate-dose (n = 187), and low-dose (n = 166) groups based on the oral PSL dosing regimen. We compared the clinical characteristics, previous treatments other than PSL, and prognosis between the three groups. The effect of oral PSL dosing regimen on the achievement of the treatment target was followed for 3 years of treatment.

To achieve the treatment target, odds ratios (ORs) for the low-dose versus high-dose regimen were 10.4 (P < 0.0001) after 1 year of treatment, 2.75 (P = 0.007) after 2 years, and 1.86 (P = 0.15) after 3 years. Those for low-dose versus intermediate-dose regimen were 13.4 (P < 0.0001) after 1 year, 3.99 (P = 0.0003) after 2 years, and 4.92 (P = 0.0004) after 3 years. Early combined use of fast-acting treatment (OR: 2.19 after 2 years, P = 0.02; OR: 2.11 after 3 years, P = 0.04) or calcineurin inhibitors (OR: 2.09 after 2 years, P = 0.03; OR: 2.36 after 3 years, P = 0.02) was associated positively with achievement of the treatment target.

A low-dose PSL regimen with early combination of other treatment options may ensure earlier achievement of the treatment target in generalised MG.

### Delving into immune modulation: Thymectomy in myasthenia gravis [^115hdE8N]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This study still has several limitations: the sample size was relatively small, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the results. Second, the follow-up period was 12 months, and longer-term studies are required to fully understand the lasting effects of thymectomy on immune function. Additionally, we did not measure regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in immune tolerance and could provide further insights into the immune modulation effects of thymectomy.

### Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis [^116jhCBY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination of the nerve sheaths, which can result in varying levels of disability. Disease occurrence and progression are considered by some to be associated with low serum levels of vitamin D. Studies investigating vitamin D supplementation in MS patients have illustrated a noticeable improvement in the course of the disease.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vitamin D in the management of multiple sclerosis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conferences.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing vitamin D with placebo or any other treatment for the management of multiple sclerosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data independently. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Trialists were contacted for clarification of study details.

- **Main results**: We included a single trial (49 participants) conducted over 52 weeks, which treated 25 patients with escalating doses of vitamin D compared with control (24). The trial provided some evidence of the potential benefit of the intervention on several outcomes, i.e. the annualized relapse rate; EDSS scores; suppression of T-cell proliferation, and illustrated a measure of comparative safety in the relative effectiveness of the treatment.

### Safety and efficacy of zilucoplan in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (RAISE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study [^111u5TPs]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Generalised myasthenia gravis is a chronic, unpredictable, and debilitating rare disease, often accompanied by a high treatment burden and an unmet need for more efficacious and well-tolerated treatments. Zilucoplan is a subcutaneous, self-administered macrocyclic peptide complement C5 inhibitor. This study aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR)-positive generalised myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: RAISE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted at 75 sites in Europe, Japan, and North America. Patients aged 18–74 years with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America disease class II-IV), a myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score of at least 6, and a quantitative myasthenia gravis score of at least 12 were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg once daily by self-injection, or matched placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in MG-ADL score in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-dosing MG-ADL score). Safety was primarily assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all patients who had received at least one dose of zilucoplan or placebo. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04115293. An open-label extension study is ongoing (NCT04225871).

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^112kqWTB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Of 590 patients, 237 were classified in the high-dose group, 187 in the intermediate-dose group, and 166 in the low-dose group. Significant differences were observed in various characteristics among these groups: the age of onset (high-dose group vs. intermediate-dose group vs. low-dose group: 42.3 ± 16.8 years vs. 46.4 ± 16.9 years vs. 51.1 ± 19.4 years, P < 0.0001), the rate of thymectomy (83.1% vs. 65.8% vs. 36.1%, P < 0.0001), and the prevalence of thymoma (29.1% vs. 38.5% vs. 22.9%, P = 0.006).

Disease duration was significantly longer in the high-dose group, averaging 15.0 ± 10.0 years [P < 0.0001]. The prevalence of AChRAb positivity was notably lower in the low-dose group at 76.0% [P = 0.002]. The daily dose of PSL was significantly higher in the intermediate-dose group (7.1 ± 5.8 mg, P < 0.0001) compared with the other two groups; however, it was not different between the high-dose and low-dose groups (4.5 ± 5.1 mg vs. 4.8 ± 3.2 mg).

Additionally, the daily dose of pyridostigmine was 58.2 ± 79.4 mg in the high-dose group and was significantly lower [P = 0.003] than the 80.7 ± 77.7 mg in the intermediate-dose group. There were no significant differences in the MuSKAb-positive rate, postintervention status, combination of CNIs, and the daily dose of tacrolimus among the groups.

### Treatment of refractory myasthenia: "rebooting" with high-dose cyclophosphamide [^114A6pHs]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) who do not respond to conventional immunotherapeutic agents or cannot tolerate their side effects are considered "refractory". Ablation of the immune system followed by bone marrow transplant has been shown to cure experimental MG in rats. It is now known that immunoablative treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide does not damage hematopoietic "stem cells", permitting repopulation of the immune system without bone marrow transplant. Recent evidence indicates that this treatment can induce durable remissions in autoimmune diseases.

We treated three myasthenic patients, for whom treatment with thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and conventional immunotherapeutic agents failed, by using high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day intravenously for 4 days) followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. All three patients tolerated the treatment well and have had marked improvement in myasthenic weakness, permitting reduction of immunosuppressive medication to minimal levels. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels decreased in two AChR antibody-positive patients, and anti-MuSK antibody levels decreased in one "AChR antibody-negative" patient. The patients have been followed for up to 3.5 years, with no recurrence of symptoms. High-dose cyclophosphamide treatment appears to be an effective and safe treatment for selected patients with refractory MG. Further follow-up of these and additional patients will be needed to determine whether the benefit is durable.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117GUmKc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically in relation to empiric supplementation, the Endocrine Society 2024 guidelines recommend considering empiric vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. This supplementation may potentially lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113Go8Pg]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Conversely, from the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D in animal models. Thus, vitamin D deficiency might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases. Observational studies have suggested this effect might apply to humans.

The VITAL RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased the risk of autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, and at least 8 large MR studies all agree that genetically predicted lower 25(OH)D levels increased the risk of developing multiple sclerosis either during adolescence or adulthood. In any case, the low number of intervention studies conducted so far does not allow clarification of the relationship between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. However, these studies, at the time of writing, seem promising.

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^114qDxns]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Among patients who underwent early fast-acting treatment (EFT), there were at least two distinct types of dosing regimens used for the combined oral prednisolone (PSL) therapy.

- **Low-dose regimen**: In the patient cohort treated with EFT combined with a low-dose PSL regimen, improvements in myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms associated with living difficulties were primarily due to the introduction of fast-acting therapy sets at the early stages of treatment and the use of low-dose (≤ 10 mg/day) oral PSL as maintenance therapy. If symptoms worsened again during follow-up, patients were readmitted for a shorter treatment period of 2–7 days and underwent further fast-acting therapy sets one or two times. In the majority of cases, it was unnecessary to increase the dose of oral PSL. Patients receiving oral PSL ≥ 20 mg/day for > 3 months were excluded from this category.

- **High-dose regimen**: For those treated with EFT combined with a high-dose PSL regimen, symptom improvement was achieved through both fast-acting therapy sets and high-dose oral PSL. The oral steroids were often administered using a dose-escalation schedule until sufficient symptom improvement was noted or until a maximum dose of 50–60 mg/day was reached. These treatments were maintained at the highest dose required, after which doses were tapered.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^116UsxBC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

After the diagnosis of MG, informed consent was obtained from each patient and medical treatment was initiated. Depending on the patient's age, clinical history, MG status, and the presence of thymoma, the neurologists considered therapeutic options, including the administration of anti-cholinesterase, high-dose PSL, thymectomy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or plasma exchange. Patients with less severe MG, such as MGFA I or IIA, were likely to undergo only thymectomy with or without anti-cholinesterase. In cases with advanced thymoma, thymectomy was considered a priority, and high-dose PSL was not administered. Patients with severe MG status, including MGFA IIB or more, were likely to have ph-PSL therapy after obtaining the patients' consent.

The operative method was extended thymectomy in all cases, regardless of open chest surgery with sternotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Extended thymectomy consisted of thymectomy with removal of all mediastinal fatty tissue between the two bilateral phrenic nerves from the top of the horns of the thymus to the diaphragm.

In order to manage the risk of worsening MG symptoms due to steroid effects, oral PSL was initiated at 10 to 20 mg and gradually escalated to 100 mg on alternate days. Once patients had achieved stable disease status and had been maintained on high-dose PSL for two to four weeks, extended thymectomy was performed. When anti-cholinesterase was used as an initial treatment, it was reduced and discontinued after stabilization.

### Correlation of quantitative myasthenia gravis and myasthenia gravis activities of daily living scales in the MGTX study [^1148JzJm]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

**Methods**: MGTX was a multicenter, international, rater-blinded, randomized, 3-year clinical trial followed by a voluntary 2-year extension for patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody–positive MG without thymoma. A total of 126 participants were enrolled and randomized: 66 to the thymectomy-plus-prednisone treatment (TPP) group and 60 to the prednisone-alone (PA) group. All participants in the trial received high-dose, alternate-day prednisone on a predefined titration and tapering schedule based on achieving minimal manifestation status (MMS). Minimal manifestation status was defined as having "no symptoms or functional limitations from myasthenia gravis, but there may be some weakness on examination of some muscles". The protocol prescribed thymectomy to be performed within 30 days for those randomized to the TPP group. Study-blind raters assessed the participants at baseline and from month 3 onward up to 60 months. The detailed protocol of the MGTX trial and results have been published elsewhere.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, "Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management", in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, leading to inconsistent clinical practice. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians.

- **Serum 25 (OH) vitamin D measurement**: It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; and musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.

- **Routine testing and treatment recommendations**: The guideline states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned. It sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. Loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent.

- **Monitoring**: For monitoring, serum calcium levels (adjusted for albumin) should be considered.

### High dose vitamin D exacerbates central nervous system autoimmunity by raising T-cell excitatory calcium [^114npqfW]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Poor vitamin D status is associated with a higher relapse rate and earlier disability in multiple sclerosis. Based on these associations, patients with multiple sclerosis are frequently supplemented with the vitamin D precursor cholecalciferol, although it is unclear whether this regimen is of therapeutic benefit. To model consequences of this common practice, mice were fed for more than 3 months with a low, medium, or high dose of cholecalciferol, representative of vitamin D deficiency, modest, and disproportionately high supplementation, respectively, in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Compared to vitamin D-deprived mice, its moderate supplementation reduced the severity of subsequent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which was associated with an expansion of regulatory T cells. Direct exposure of murine or human T cells to vitamin D metabolites inhibited their activation. In contrast, mice with 25-(OH) vitamin D levels above 200 nmol/l developed fulminant experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with massive CNS infiltration of activated myeloid cells, Th1, and Th17 cells.

When dissecting this unexpected outcome, we observed that high, but not medium dose vitamin D had caused mild hypercalcemia, which rendered T cells more prone to pro-inflammatory activation. Exposing murine or human T cells to equivalent calcium concentrations in vitro enhanced its influx, triggering activation, upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene products, and enhanced transmigration across a blood-brain barrier model. These findings suggest that vitamin D at moderate levels may exert a dire impact on T cell activation.

### Vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dMKWA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is an immune modulator which might be linked to disease severity by SARS-CoV-2.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients.

- **Results**: A total of 5 studies, including 3 RCTs and 2 quasi-experimental studies comprising n = 467 patients, were included. Vitamin D did not reduce mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.39, p = 0.21), ICU admission rates (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.26, p = 0.3), and the need for invasive ventilation (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.89, p = 0.42).

- **Conclusion**: There was no significant difference in major health-related outcomes in COVID-19 with vitamin D supplementation. Well-designed RCTs are required to address this topic.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^112CBsun]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status.

- **Results**: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative %FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 ± 2.3% versus 99.5 ± 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037, FEV1.0%: 85.2 ± 1.3% versus 81.4 ± 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables including presence of thymoma and operative procedure. In the treatment group, disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001). Moreover, the treatment…

- **Baseline cumulative hazard curves**: Displayed for both the EFT and non-EFT groups, excluding the effects of covariables as a function of time.

Comparative analysis is further refined in Figure 2, where the baseline cumulative hazard curves demonstrate trends for both EFT and non-EFT groups, excluding covariable influences over time.

- **Differences between low-dose and high-dose regimens in EFT patients**
	- **Differences in background and therapies utilized**:
		- Table 3 provides comparisons of characteristics and therapies used for EFT-treated patients with either low- or high-dose PSL regimens. Symptoms, when conditions were at their worst (worst QMG), were more severe (P < 0.0001), with longer durations of immune treatment (P < 0.0001), and a higher frequency of thymectomy (P < 0.01) in the high-dose PSL regimen group.
		- Severity (QMG), MG-QOL15-J score, and the percentage of patients achieving MM-or-better-5mg for ≥ 6 months were similar between the two groups. Despite a much higher maximum PSL dose and longer duration at doses ≥ 20 mg in the high-dose PSL group (P < 0.0001), there was no significant difference between groups regarding the dose of oral PSL and frequency of CNI use. Notably, in the low-dose PSL group, only one patient received ≥ 20 mg.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^112MgmuD]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend administering azathioprine together with corticosteroids. In patients requiring long-term immunosuppression, this combination allows tapering the corticosteroids to the lowest dose possible while maintaining azathioprine.

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^111n74fG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term full remission without treatment is uncommon in myasthenia gravis (MG). Only less than 10% of patients with MG achieve Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) postintervention status of complete stable remission (CSR). Therefore, treatment strategies should consider the probability of prolonged treatment and aim for maintaining health-related quality of life (QOL) and mental health. The recent international consensus guidance for the management of MG proposes minimal manifestation (MM) status or better as a goal for the treatment of MG. Our research group has also proposed that MM status or better with prednisolone (PSL) 5 mg/day or lower (MM-or-better-5mg) may be a more practical treatment goal than CSR and achievable by more patients, and that this goal yields patient satisfaction essentially equivalent to CSR based on patients' QOL.

Among the various immunosuppressive therapies, oral corticosteroids remain the most common agent used for long-term immunosuppression in the management of MG. In traditional therapy, oral corticosteroids have been used at high doses in an escalation and de-escalation fashion. However, there are no reported data supporting the claim that treatment with high-dose oral steroids increases the rate of complete remission in MG, and epidemiological research shows no change in complete remission rate before and after the use of oral steroids became widespread. Many patients continue to have impaired QOL because of insufficient improvement and long-term steroid-related adverse effects. Furthermore, our previous survey showed that higher PSL doses are associated with long-term adverse outcomes.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with myasthenia gravis and improvement of fatigue after supplementation of vitamin D3: A pilot study [^115MJgFV]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. Vitamin D plays important roles in both the autoimmune response and skeletal muscles. This study determined the levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] in patients with MG and in healthy subjects to assess whether vitamin D deficiency is present in MG and if vitamin D supplementation has beneficial effects on fatigue.

- **Methods**: Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were analyzed in 33 patients with MG (22 males; mean age, 58 years) and in 50 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors who were not on vitamin D3 medication. Fatigue was assessed using the MG Composite (MGC) score. Thirteen patients with MG, who were not previously on vitamin D3 supplementation, were started on cholecalciferol (800 IU/day) with a follow-up examination after 2.5 to 10 months (mean, 6 months).

- **Results**: Patients with MG without pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation (N = 16) had a mean MGC of 4.5 and lower plasma 25(OH)D levels (mean, 51 ± 19 nM) than healthy controls (69 ± 21 nM) (P = 0.017). Seventeen patients had pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation due to corticosteroid treatment, with a mean 25(OH)D of 79 ± 22 nM and a mean MGC of 5.5. In the 13 patients who received cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D levels increased by 22% at follow-up (P = 0.033) and the MGC score improved by 38% (P = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Plasma 25(OH)D levels are significantly lower in patients with MG compared with healthy controls. As vitamin D has beneficial effects on the autoimmune response and fatigue scores in patients with MG, we suggest monitoring vitamin D levels in these patients.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^116fiStm]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

There is much less consensus about the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D because of the broad range of its putative actions. Biochemical and genetic data clearly demonstrate that the vitamin D endocrine system could regulate, in a coherent fashion, a very large number of genes (approximately 3% of all genes). Evidently, this includes mostly genes not related to calcium or bone homeostasis.

Animal data largely confirm a coherent action at the cellular, tissue, or total-body level of the vitamin D endocrine system on cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and the immune, muscular, cardiovascular, and other systems. These preclinical observations were made either in situations of total absence of vitamin D action or by exposure to supraphysiologic concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D or its analogs.

A wealth of human cross-sectional and long-term prospective studies have linked poor vitamin D status with a variety of human diseases as predicted on the basis of preclinical data. These include a higher risk of cancer, infections, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors and events, and muscle dysfunction and falls. This has generated intense interest and even irrational enthusiasm about the possible health effects of vitamin D supplements.

Most governmental and scientific societies are more prudent and await further proof of causality before formulating optimal thresholds for serum 25OHD or optimal dosages beyond what is needed for skeletal effects. The proof of causality ultimately has to come from RCTs, but the recent introduction of MR studies has opened up new avenues for research.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: A supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^117QMcSZ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The number and severity of side effects of glucocorticosteroids (GCS) increase with the duration and cumulative dosage. Patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, are at special risk. If the estimated therapy duration is longer than three months with a dosage of more than 7.5 mg prednisolone equivalent, patients should be treated with calcium (1000–1500 mg/day) and vitamin D (400–800 IU/day) to prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D levels should be determined before initiating therapy and monitored throughout. In post-menopausal women, bisphosphonates can be used to prevent GCS-induced osteoporosis. The evidence for the prophylactic effect of bisphosphonates against GCS-induced osteoporosis and bone fractures in men is currently insufficient for a general recommendation. Moreover, stomach protection using proton-pump inhibitors or other drugs may be warranted.

To reduce side effects, some centers switch from every-day to alternate-day oral GCS treatment during long-term application in the low-dose range. The usefulness of this approach needs to be validated in individual patients as systematic data are lacking.

Azathioprine

Azathioprine (AZA) is the most frequently used immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). Azathioprine is a purine analogue that is rapidly metabolized to the cytotoxic and immunosuppressant derivatives 6-mercaptopurine and thioinosinic acid. These derivatives inhibit purine synthesis and impair the activation and proliferation of T cells and B cells, leading to apoptosis due to their lack of metabolic pathways for nucleotide salvage ('recycling').

Center of Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis, People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang, China

Background and aims: High‐dose glucocorticoid pulse (IVMP) is effective in treating generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG), but early treatment may cause transient aggravation, with some patients experiencing MG crisis. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod combined with different doses of IVMP in gMG patients.

Methods: Myasthenia gravis patients treated at Shijiazhuang People's Hospital from December 2023 to May 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received efgartigimod (D1, D8) combined with IVMP or IVMP alone. Efficacy was assessed using the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMG) at baseline, 2 weeks, and 12 weeks.

Results: A total of 57 patients were included: 20 in the 1000 mg IVMP group (A), and 7, 10, and 20 in the 1000 mg (B), 500 mg (C), and 250 mg (D) IVMP combined with efgartigimod groups, respectively. QMG scores for groups A, C, and D gradually decreased over 12 weeks. Group B showed an increase in QMG score at week 12 compared to week 2 but remained below baseline. There was a significant difference between group A and group B at week 2 in QMG score reduction. Group A had a significantly higher incidence of transient exacerbations than groups C and D. The incidence of adverse reactions was higher in group A than in the other three groups, especially in the development of osteoporosis and electrolyte disturbances.

The Vivacity-MG3 study was published in 2025 in the journal The Lancet Neurology. This study focuses on myasthenia gravis and investigates the effect of nipocalimab in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.

- **Study design**: The Vivacity-MG3 was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study included 153 patients (92 female, 61 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis inadequately controlled with standard-of-care therapy were included.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Individuals with clinical immunodeficiency not related to the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis, or a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency (unless confirmed absent in the patient), thymectomy in the past 12 months, allergies or hypersensitivity to nipocalimab or its excipients, myocardial infarction, unstable ischemic heart disease, or stroke in the past 12 weeks were excluded.
- **Interventions**:
	- n = 77 received nipocalimab (nipocalimab 30 mg/kg loading dose, then 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks for maintenance plus standard-of-care therapy for 24 weeks)
	- n = 76 received placebo (matching placebo infusion every 2 weeks plus standard-of-care therapy for 24 weeks)
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the least-squares mean reduction in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living score over weeks 22–24 in antibody-positive patients, with scores of 4.7 points versus 3.25 points (MD 1.45, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.38).

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, particularly in the context of immunosuppressants, the EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend acknowledging the relatively high risk of toxicity. This includes bone marrow suppression, opportunistic infections, bladder toxicity, sterility, and neoplasms, which limits the use of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is considered for patients with myasthenia gravis who are intolerant or unresponsive to corticosteroids plus azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil.

### An update on treatments in myasthenia gravis [^112gPbss]. Journal of Neurology (2017).

This month, we discuss three papers which publish the results of trials into potential treatment approaches to myasthenia gravis (MG). When treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors alone fails to control symptoms, treatment with steroids may be required, often at high doses which are associated with adverse side effects both in the short and long term. All the studies explore treatments that may replace or reduce the need for steroids in MG and use the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and prednisone dose requirement as primary or secondary outcomes.

- **Routine thymectomy**: The first paper reports results of a randomized trial of routine thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG patients, the results of which may see this procedure incorporated into routine management of non-thymomatous MG.

- **Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents**: The second and third papers explore alternative steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. At present, the only medications shown to be effective in randomized placebo-controlled studies are azathioprine and cyclosporine, but both carry the risk of adverse reactions and require close monitoring. The second study compares methotrexate and prednisone treatment to prednisone alone, and the final study assesses the effectiveness of leflunomide.

All three studies represent a valuable addition to the literature on treatment of a condition that currently has limited alternatives to long-term immunosuppression with steroids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine.

### Calcitriol [^1165vUWT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day, administered in the morning. If there is no satisfactory response in biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations, the dose may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. During the dosage titration period, serum calcium levels should be monitored at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia is observed, calcitriol should be discontinued immediately until normocalcemia ensues. Consideration should also be given to lowering dietary calcium intake. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium should be determined periodically.

Most adult patients and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older respond to dosages ranging from 0.5 mcg to 2 mcg daily. Pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years with hypoparathyroidism have usually been given 0.25 mcg to 0.75 mcg daily. The number of treated patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism less than 6 years of age is insufficient to make dosage recommendations. Malabsorption is occasionally noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism; therefore, larger doses of calcitriol may be required.

- **Predialysis patients**: The recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day for adults and pediatric patients aged 3 years and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day. For pediatric patients less than 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.

### Vitamin D and autoimmunity: New aetiological and therapeutic considerations [^1133cdAu]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is frequently prescribed by rheumatologists to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Several observations have shown that vitamin D inhibits proinflammatory processes by suppressing the enhanced activity of immune cells that take part in the autoimmune reaction. Moreover, recent evidence strongly suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be therapeutically beneficial, particularly for Th1-mediated autoimmune disorders. Some reports imply that vitamin D may even be preventive in certain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes type 1. It seems that vitamin D has crossed the boundaries of calcium metabolism and has become a significant factor in a number of physiological functions, specifically as a biological inhibitor of inflammatory hyperactivity.

### Corticosteroids for myasthenia gravis [^1124c8Zd]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Although widely accepted as an appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, the efficacy of glucocorticosteroid treatment has only rarely been tested in controlled studies.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of glucocorticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) medication in autoimmune myasthenia gravis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register in July 2004, MEDLINE (from January 1966 to June 2004), and EMBASE (from January 1980 to June 2004). We also checked the bibliographies in reviews and the randomized trials and contacted their authors to identify additional published and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: From the articles identified, we selected those open or controlled studies which allowed us to assess the outcome of treated and untreated patients at definite endpoints. Types of studies: quasi-randomized or randomized controlled trials.

- **Types of participants**: Patients with myasthenia gravis of all ages and all degrees of severity.

- **Types of interventions**: Any form of glucocorticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone treatment.

- **Types of outcome measures**:
	- Primary outcome: Improvement after at least three months in either the weakest muscles or all muscles.
	- Secondary outcomes:
		1. Proportion of patients improved after at least six months
		2. Proportion of patients in remission
		3. Number of episodes of worsening during the first six months
		4. Acetylcholine receptor antibody titres after at least three months of therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors extracted the data from the selected articles.

### New and emerging treatments for myasthenia gravis [^111nDSvb]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The role of eculizumab in AChR+gMG is still being determined; currently, this treatment tends to be reserved for those with refractory symptoms. Patients receiving eculizumab have shown benefit as early as one week after the start of treatment, suggesting it might eventually have a role in treating myasthenia gravis crisis.

An unwanted complication of complement inhibition is a greatly increased risk of infection caused by encapsulated bacteria, particularly Neisseria meningitidis. Patients receiving complement inhibitors should receive double meningococcal vaccination with ACYW conjugate and serogroup B vaccine at least two weeks before the first drug infusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory if the drug is started within two weeks of vaccination.

- **Ravulizumab**: Ravulizumab is a long-acting C5 complement inhibitor engineered over the backbone of eculizumab. The phase 3 CHAMPION study (Safety and Efficacy Study of Ravulizumab in Adults With Generalised Myasthenia Gravis) evaluated the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in patients with AChR+gMG. It showed significant improvement in the total score on the MG-ADL scale (P < 0.001) and in the quantitative myasthenia gravis score from baseline to week 26 (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. The benefits were seen within one week after the start of treatment and were sustained up to week 26. Ravulizumab is well tolerated and has the advantage of dosing every eight weeks, compared with every two weeks for eculizumab. The FDA approved its use for the treatment of AChR+gMG in April 2022.

- **Zilucoplan**: Zilucoplan is a small 15 amino acid macrocyclic peptide.

### Regulatory function of CD4+CD25++ T cells in patients with myasthenia gravis is associated with phenotypic changes and STAT5 signaling: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulates the suppressor activity [^113257FP]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Regulatory T cells were investigated in early-onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) myasthenia gravis patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-MG). Alterations in PD-1 and PD-L1 on CD4(+)CD25(++) (Treg) and responder T cells (Tresp, CD4(+)CD25(-)) were observed in LOMG patients. GITR was decreased on CD4(+)CD25(++) of all patients. Decrease of FOXP3 was associated with lower phosphorylation of STAT5. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD3) increased suppression in co-culture with a stronger effect in patients by acting possibly both on cell groups. Changes in surface molecules and intracellular pathways contribute to the defects of Treg in non-thymomatous AChR-MG, and VitD3 can have modulatory effects.

### Low and high doses of ursolic acid ameliorate experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis through different pathways [^111cskEH]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, especially inhibiting IL-17. We found that UA ameliorated the symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), a rat model of MG. Although both the low and high doses of UA shifted Th17 to Th2 cytokines, other mechanisms were dose-dependent. The low dose enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas the high dose up-regulated Treg cells and reduced the concentrations of IgG2b antibodies. These findings suggest a new strategy to treat EAMG and even human MG.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^111SV3dw]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Juvenile myasthenia gravis (MG): See also Thymectomy in MG, no. 2.

- **Acquired autoimmune ocular MG**: Children with acquired autoimmune ocular MG are more likely than adults to enter spontaneous remission. Thus, young children with only ocular symptoms of MG can be treated initially with pyridostigmine. Immunotherapy can be initiated if the goals of therapy are not met.
- **Steroid side effects**: Children are at particular risk of steroid side effects, including growth failure, poor bone mineralization, and susceptibility to infection, due in part to a delay in live vaccinations. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids should use the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects.
- **Alternatives to immunosuppressive (IS) drugs in juvenile MG (JMG)**: Maintenance plasmapheresis (PLEX) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are alternatives to IS drugs in JMG.

MG with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies:

- **Response to cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs)**: Many patients with MuSK-MG respond poorly to ChEIs, and conventional pyridostigmine doses frequently induce side effects.
- **Response to corticosteroids and IS agents**: Patients with MuSK-MG appear to respond well to corticosteroids and many steroid-sparing IS agents. They tend to remain dependent on prednisone despite concomitant treatment with steroid-sparing agents.
- **PLEX and IVIg efficacy**: MuSK-MG responds well to PLEX, while IVIg seems to be less effective.
- **Rituximab as a therapeutic option**: Rituximab should be considered as an early therapeutic option in patients with MuSK-MG who have an unsatisfactory response to initial immunotherapy.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^115KQZdd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status.

- **Results**: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative %FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 ± 2.3% versus 99.5 ± 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037; FEV1.0%: 85.2 ± 1.3% versus 81.4 ± 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables, including the presence of thymoma and operative procedure. In the treatment group, the disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001).

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^116MtQJ2]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity:

Preclinical data indicates that since the 1980s, it has been understood that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in T lymphocytes and that 1,25(OH)₂D acts as an inhibitor of T cell proliferation and activation. T lymphocytes are composed of several subsets, such as CD4+ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer cells, γδ T cells, and memory cells. The effects of vitamin D signaling on these T cell subtypes have been reviewed extensively elsewhere.

In general, vitamin D suppresses T cell-driven inflammation and enhances the effects of suppressive Treg cells. The communication between antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells is crucial in this regard. The intracrine production of 1,25(OH)₂D induces a more tolerogenic DC phenotype, characterized by the production of IL-10, which stimulates the production of Treg cells. Recent studies suggested that 1,25(OH)₂D controls the phenotype of DCs by altering their metabolic profile.

These anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D signaling on DCs and T cells have sparked significant interest in the relationship between vitamin D status, inflammation, and autoimmunity. In autoimmune diabetes-prone NOD mice, vitamin D deficiency early in life, even with normal intake later, significantly increased disease risk in two independent studies. Additionally, dietary 1,25(OH)₂D was shown to reduce arthritic lesions in two mouse models of autoimmune arthritis, including murine Lyme arthritis and collagen-induced arthritis.

### Frequency and clinical features of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis [^112VQa1Y]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction with a prevalence of around 16 per 100,000. Patients are grouped according to the age at onset, presence of a specific antibody, thymus pathology, and distribution of symptoms. The majority of patients (approximately 80%) have antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), while in a small subset of patients, antibodies against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or other postsynaptic structures of the neuromuscular junction are detected. In about 5% of patients, no antibodies are found. Additionally, paraneoplastic disease can occur in patients with thymoma, leading to generalized thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis with the detection of AChR-antibodies in nearly all patients.

The natural, untreated course of myasthenia gravis has been associated with high mortality and persistence of symptoms in most patients. However, the introduction of immunosuppressive treatments, thymectomy in selected patients, modern intensive care medicine, as well as the availability of rescue treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange therapy (PLEX), or immunoadsorption (IA) has greatly improved the outcome across all subgroups of patients. Despite these advancements, approximately 10–15% of patients still show a poor response to available standard treatments and consequently continue to suffer from disabling symptoms. They also experience frequent disease exacerbations, leading to a reduced quality of life and frequent admissions to hospitals.

### A phase 3 trial of inebilizumab in generalized myasthenia gravis [^1149FaBo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The MINT study, published in 2025 in the New England Journal of Medicine, addresses myasthenia gravis. It investigates the role of inebilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD19-positive B cells, in patients with AChR antibody-positive or MuSK antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 236 patients (144 female, 92 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with AChR antibody-positive or MuSK antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Recent receipt of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate (past 4 weeks), and use of corticosteroids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil.
- **Interventions**:
	- 119 patients received inebilizumab (intravenous dose of 300 mg administered on days 1 and 15 for all, and additionally on day 183 for AChR antibody-positive patients: 52 weeks; MuSK antibody-positive patients: 26 weeks).
	- 117 patients received placebo (matching placebo duration: 52 weeks for AChR antibody-positive participants, 26 weeks for MuSK antibody-positive participants).
- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living scale score at week 26 in the overall population (4.2 points vs. 2.2 points; MD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.9).

Secondary outcomes were not fully provided in the original text.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and cholinergic modulation in myasthenia gravis and neuroinflammation [^112cBSPL]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2008). Low credibility.

The cholinergic network affects various cellular functions, including neurotransmission and immune reactions. In Myasthenia Gravis (MG), diagnosis and symptomatic therapy are based on cholinergic modulation by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI). In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with inflammatory pathology, cholinergic systems cell loss occurs early. Treatments with specific AChEI enhance cholinergic transmission and may act as anti-inflammatory agents via immunocompetent cells expressing the alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR).

In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory T-cell-mediated disease, demyelination and neurodegeneration follow neuroinflammation. MS treatment includes anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs. AChEI can induce cholinergic upregulation with subsequent effects on neuroinflammation via alpha-7-AChR expressing cells. These effects are additional to the cognitive benefits induced by AChEI.

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A randomised clinical trial [^115gWvNw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system with known environmental and genetic risk factors. Vitamin D is a known immunomodulator, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with a higher risk of developing MS and with increased clinical and radiological activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). However, most evidence suggesting a role for vitamin D in MS activity arises from observational studies with inherent possible limitations, including confounding and reverse causality.

Two early pilot trials demonstrated potential promise but had limitations and were not designed as definitive trials, so it remained unclear after their completion if vitamin D supplementation impacts the course of established RRMS. Three randomised clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation did not demonstrate an apparent benefit with respect to the primary outcome but also were limited in duration or size and had some other limitations that reduce confidence in the results. These trials also tested the effect of vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to interferon beta as the MS disease-modifying therapy, where there is a possible interaction between vitamin D and interferon beta, underscoring the importance of evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the context of other MS therapies.

We sought to test whether vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to a first-line disease-modifying therapy (DMT) reduces disease activity among people with active MS.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that…

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^11756drW]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of myasthenia gravis, specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend selecting the immunosuppressive agent dosage and complete duration of treatment as follows:

- **Taper corticosteroid dose**: Gradually reduce the corticosteroid dose once patients achieve treatment goals. Recognize that continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help maintain the treatment goal in many patients.

- **Taper nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agent dose**: Slowly reduce the dose of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents to the minimal effective amount once treatment goals have been achieved and maintained for 6 months to 2 years. Make dosage adjustments no more frequently than every 3–6 months.

- **Risk of relapse with tapering**: Recognize that tapering immunosuppressive drugs is associated with a risk of relapse, which may necessitate upward adjustments in dose. The risk of relapse is higher in symptomatic patients and following a rapid taper.

- **Necessity of long-term immunosuppression**: It is usually necessary to maintain some level of immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life.

### Safety, efficacy, and tolerability of efgartigimod in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (ADAPT): A multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^116Bf541]. The Lancet. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The ADAPT study was published by James F. Howard Jr. and colleagues in 2021 in the journal Lancet Neurology. This study is related to myasthenia gravis. The trial question was: What is the role of efgartigimod in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis? The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The population included 167 patients (118 female, 49 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with myasthenia gravis and a Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score of ≥ 5. Key exclusion criteria were receipt of rituximab or eculizumab within 6 months, thymectomy within 3 months, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange within 1 month, active hepatitis B, hepatitis C seropositivity, HIV seropositivity with low CD4 count, serum IgG levels < 6 g/L, and pregnancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- Efgartigimod: n = 84, intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg, administered as four infusions per cycle (one infusion per week).
	- Placebo: n = 83, intravenous administration of matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in positive anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibody patients with a clinically meaningful reduction in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score at cycle 1 (68% vs. 30%; OR 4.95, 95% CI 2.21 to 11.53).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase in patients with a clinically meaningful reduction in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (63% vs. 14%; OR 10.84, 95% CI 4.18 to 31.2).

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^112ArZmf]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Planning for pregnancy should be instituted well in advance to allow time for optimization of myasthenic clinical status and to minimize risks to the fetus. Multidisciplinary communication among relevant specialists should occur throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and in the postpartum period. Provided that their myasthenia is under good control before pregnancy, the majority of women can be reassured that they will remain stable throughout pregnancy. If worsening occurs, it may be more likely during the first few months after delivery.

Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment during pregnancy. Intravenous ChEIs may produce uterine contractions and should not be used during pregnancy. Thymectomy should be postponed until after pregnancy as benefit is unlikely to occur during pregnancy. Chest CT without contrast can be performed safely during pregnancy, although the risks of radiation to the fetus need to be carefully considered. Unless there is a compelling indication, postponement of diagnostic CT until after delivery is preferable. Prednisone is the immunosuppressive agent of choice during pregnancy.

Information indicates that azathioprine and cyclosporine are relatively safe in expectant mothers who are not satisfactorily controlled with or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Evidence indicates that mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate increase the risk of teratogenicity and are contraindicated during pregnancy.
