## Question

how should siadh hyponatremia without moderate symptoms be managed with a sodium level of 121

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage SIADH-related hyponatremia with a sodium level of 121 mmol/L in a patient without moderate symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying severity and chronicity. Then, I should verify the immediate safety assessment and whether hypertonic saline is indicated. Next, I will outline first-line therapy, monitoring cadence, and correction-rate limits. After that, I should consider predictors of fluid restriction failure and second-line options if needed. Finally, I will address special populations, overcorrection mitigation, and a concise decision algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and practical caveats.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity framework. SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by hypotonic hyponatremia with inappropriately concentrated urine, euvolemia, and exclusion of adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism; I should double-check urine osmolality and urine sodium, and confirm euvolemia on exam before labeling SIADH, because misclassification drives mismanagement. Sodium 121 mmol/L falls in the moderate range (120–129 mmol/L), and with only mild symptoms this is not an emergency; I need to ensure we do not overreact with hypertonic saline in the absence of severe features such as seizures, coma, or severe confusion, which would change the approach entirely [^113nG35Z] [^113AzQy2].

> Wait, let me verify the acute versus chronic distinction because it governs correction targets. If the onset is unknown or presumed chronic (> 48 hours), I should cap the sodium rise at ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours and ≤ 8 mmol/L in each subsequent 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk; if acute (< 48 hours) with severe symptoms, a carefully controlled 4–6 mmol/L early rise is acceptable, but that is not the scenario here with mild symptoms at 121 mmol/L [^114Xdtdc] [^113cgXyq]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating acute correction limits with chronic limits; yes, the conservative caps apply to chronic or unknown-duration cases, which fits this presentation [^114Xdtdc].

> Next, I should review immediate safety and whether hypertonic saline is warranted. Hypertonic saline is reserved for severe symptoms or very low sodium, typically < 120 mmol/L with moderate–severe symptoms; with sodium 121 mmol/L and only mild symptoms, urgent hypertonic therapy is not indicated, though I will keep a low threshold if symptoms progress or sodium falls further [^112fRiGi]. I need to ensure I'm not missing evolving neurologic deterioration; if mental status worsens, I should escalate promptly per severe-symptom protocols [^114yeaQw].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. Fluid restriction is the recommended initial treatment for SIADH with moderate hyponatremia; I should start at about 800–1,000 mL/day and adjust based on response, while counseling on adherence and avoiding hypotonic fluids and high water-content foods [^114FHDD2] [^114FHDD2]. Hold on, let me verify expected efficacy; fluid restriction often yields only modest gains, with median rises around 3–5 mmol/L over days, and failure is common when urine osmolality is high or the sum of urine Na+K exceeds serum sodium, so I should set expectations and plan early reassessment [^114FHDD2] [^113rohyY].

> Next, I should review the monitoring cadence and correction-rate guardrails. I need to check sodium frequently at the outset: every 6–12 hours initially until stable, then daily; this cadence helps detect both under- and overcorrection early and allows timely adjustments [^114Mqs3L] [^112TiQzY]. I should confirm that the lab method is consistent and that there are no sample handling errors to avoid spurious changes that could mislead therapy [^1156N96o].

> Let me consider predictors of fluid restriction failure so I can anticipate next steps. High urine osmolality (> 500 mOsm/kg), a urine electrolyte sum (Na+K) greater than serum sodium, low 24-hour urine volume (< 1,500 mL), and minimal sodium rise (< 2 mmol/L) in the first 24–48 hours portend poor response. If two or more are present, I should prepare to escalate rather than persist with restriction alone [^114FHDD2] [^113rohyY]. But wait, what if the patient is already at 500 mL/day and still not improving? That strengthens the case for second-line therapy rather than further tightening fluids, which risks nonadherence and limited incremental benefit [^114FHDD2].

> Now, I should evaluate second-line options if fluid restriction fails or is not feasible. Oral urea at 30–60 g/day in divided doses is guideline-endorsed and supported by observational data showing meaningful sodium increases with good safety; palatability is the main limitation, so I should counsel and consider flavoring strategies [^112MGZPb] [^112fRiGi] [^114aNjKF]. Alternatively, a combination of loop diuretic with oral sodium chloride can increase free water clearance while replacing solute; I need to ensure close monitoring for overcorrection and volume shifts with this approach [^112MGZPb]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overlooking vaptans; European guidance advises against routine vaptan use in moderate hyponatremia, whereas US-oriented reviews and real-world series suggest vaptans can be effective but carry a higher risk of overcorrection in practice, so if considered, I would use the lowest effective dose with strict monitoring and allow ad libitum fluids to mitigate abrupt aquaresis [^115Rs8Kk] [^112C1CHA] [^115KMrVW] [^112fRiGi].

> I need to ensure I have a plan to prevent and manage overcorrection. If sodium rises too quickly, I should stop active therapy and administer desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to safely relower sodium; in higher-risk patients or when using therapies prone to brisk aquaresis, a reactive desmopressin strategy is prudent to cap the rise within guideline limits [^112sZjn1]. Let me reconsider whether a proactive desmopressin approach is warranted here; current evidence is limited and not generalizable to chronic SIADH, so I will favor reactive rescue rather than routine prophylaxis in this case [^115eEJTN].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In cancer-associated SIADH, fluid restriction underperforms and delays in hyponatremia correction can postpone chemotherapy. Thus, earlier escalation to urea or carefully monitored vaptan may be justified to stabilize sodium and facilitate oncologic care, with day-care initiation strategies described in observational cohorts [^114FMjeQ] [^113bi1DC]. In post-pituitary surgery SIADH, similar principles apply, but I should also remain vigilant for dynamic transitions between DI and SIAD and avoid scheduled desmopressin in the early postoperative week to prevent rebound hyponatremia [^114FHDD2] [^113uBiYF].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm and sanity-check each branch. Confirm SIADH and exclude endocrine mimics; if sodium is 121 mmol/L with mild symptoms, start fluid restriction at 800–1,000 mL/day and monitor sodium every 6–12 hours with a hard limit of ≤ 10 mmol/L rise in 24 hours; if sodium fails to rise adequately or predictors of failure are present, escalate to urea or loop diuretic plus NaCl while maintaining close monitoring; if symptoms progress to severe, pivot to hypertonic saline with bolus strategies and frequent checks, then transition back to restriction/uera once safe [^113nG35Z] [^114FHDD2] [^114Mqs3L] [^114Xdtdc] [^112MGZPb] [^114yeaQw]. Hold on, I should verify that I've integrated the overcorrection rescue steps; yes, desmopressin plus hypotonic fluids should be ready if the rise exceeds targets, especially in chronic cases [^112sZjn1].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and longitudinal considerations. Once sodium stabilizes above 130 mmol/L, I can relax fluid restriction and extend monitoring intervals, but I need to continue addressing the underlying cause of SIADH and reassess medications that potentiate ADH action. Persistent or recurrent hyponatremia warrants re-evaluation for missed hypovolemia, hypervolemia, endocrine disorders, or alternate diagnoses [^112fRiGi] [^1154k2ap]. I should double-check that the patient understands adherence to fluid targets and recognizes symptom red flags that would prompt urgent reassessment, reinforcing safety and preventing delays in escalation if the trajectory worsens.

For SIADH-related hyponatremia at 121 mmol/L without moderate symptoms, **fluid restriction to 800–1,000 mL/day** [^114FHDD2] is first-line therapy, with close monitoring of sodium every 6–12 hours [^112TiQzY] and strict adherence to a correction limit of ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours [^117M8SDu] to avoid osmotic demyelination [^111fLWER]. If sodium does not rise by ≥ 2 mmol/L in 24–48 hours, add **oral urea 30–60 g/day** [^112MGZPb] or a loop diuretic with oral NaCl [^112MGZPb]. Reserve tolvaptan for refractory cases due to overcorrection risk [^115KMrVW] and monitor sodium every 6 hours initially [^114Mqs3L]; avoid hypertonic saline unless severe symptoms develop [^114hmeK4]. Address the underlying cause and discontinue offending drugs [^112uhRxs] [^1154k2ap].

---

## Initial assessment and monitoring

- **Confirm SIADH**: Ensure euvolemia, low serum osmolality, high urine osmolality, and high urine sodium [^113nG35Z].
- **Baseline labs**: Measure serum sodium, osmolality, urine sodium, and urine osmolality [^113nG35Z].
- **Monitoring**: Check serum sodium every 6–12 hours initially [^117Nardw], then daily once stable [^notfound].

---

## First-line therapy: fluid restriction

- **Fluid restriction**: 800–1,000 mL/day of all fluids [^114FHDD2].
- **Diet**: Maintain normal salt and protein intake to support free water excretion [^111Fe3u4].
- **Adherence**: Emphasize strict adherence; poor adherence is a common cause of failure [^notfound].

---

## Second-line therapy if fluid restriction fails

If sodium fails to rise by ≥ 2 mmol/L in 24–48 hours, **add oral urea 30–60 g/day** [^112MGZPb] in divided doses [^112fRiGi] or use a loop diuretic (e.g. furosemide 20–40 mg/day) with oral NaCl (9 g/day) [^notfound]. These options increase free water excretion and solute intake, aiding correction [^notfound].

---

## Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)

Reserve **tolvaptan** for refractory cases or when fluid restriction is not feasible; start at 7.5–15 mg/day and titrate to 30 mg/day if needed. Monitor sodium closely due to overcorrection risk [^115KMrVW] and avoid in liver disease or with CYP3A4 inhibitors [^notfound].

---

## Hypertonic saline

Reserve **hypertonic saline** for severe symptoms (e.g. seizures, coma) or sodium < 120 mmol/L with moderate symptoms [^114yeaQw]; it is not indicated for mild, asymptomatic hyponatremia [^111Fe3u4].

---

## Correction limits and safety monitoring

Limit correction to **≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours** [^117M8SDu] to prevent osmotic demyelination [^112sZjn1]. If overcorrection occurs, administer desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to safely lower sodium [^112sZjn1].

---

## Addressing underlying causes

Identify and treat **underlying causes** (e.g. malignancy, CNS disease, medications) [^1154k2ap] and discontinue drugs that worsen SIADH (e.g. SSRIs, carbamazepine, thiazides) [^112uhRxs] [^114FHDD2].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Educate patients on **strict fluid restriction**, symptom recognition, and when to seek care [^111fLWER]. Arrange close follow-up with frequent sodium checks until stable, then monitor periodically [^114Mqs3L].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fluid restriction | First-line | 800–1,000 mL/day | Sodium every 6–12 h |
| Oral urea | Second-line | 30–60 g/day | Sodium every 6–12 h |
| Loop diuretic + NaCl | Second-line | Furosemide 20–40 mg + NaCl 9 g/day | Sodium every 6–12 h |
| Tolvaptan | Refractory | 7.5–15 mg/day | Sodium every 6 h |
| Hypertonic saline | Severe symptoms | 3% saline bolus | Sodium every 2–4 h |

---

Fluid restriction is the cornerstone of therapy for SIADH-related hyponatremia at 121 mmol/L without moderate symptoms; escalate to urea or loop diuretic plus NaCl if sodium fails to rise, and reserve tolvaptan for refractory cases. Strictly adhere to correction limits and monitor closely to prevent overcorrection and osmotic demyelination [^114Xdtdc] [^112sZjn1].

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^114FMjeQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The Hyponatremia Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Although patients were subject to adjudication by experts, some uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the diagnosis "cancer-related SIADH". Furthermore, potentially hyponatremia-inducing drugs are highly prevalent and interfere with diagnostic precision. However, since the study's intent was to capture "real-world" practice, this limitation does not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH in the oncology setting is managed. As in other hyponatremia trials, numerical changes of [Na +] were used as the primary measure of effectiveness; neither symptoms nor clinical outcome after therapy were reported routinely as it is extremely difficult to assign these unambiguously to hyponatremia, especially in the oncology setting.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of hyponatremia and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current management of hyponatremia in cancer-related SIADH are evident. Hyponatremia in a cancer patient is readily assumed by clinicians to be due to SIADH without sufficient attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Moreover, many patients correctly diagnosed with SIADH do not receive any treatment for hyponatremia at all, and a considerable number of patients are discharged with unresolved hyponatremia. FR and NS are the two most frequently used therapies but are ineffective in about two thirds of cases. Of note, this lack of efficacy is more pronounced in cancer patients than in non-cancer-related SIADH. With the vaptans, a group of highly effective and yet safe compounds is available and the findings of this analysis strongly suggests that they should be viewed as first-line choice of treatment. However, they are only used in the minority of cases in current practice. We therefore conclude that there is a need to focus educational efforts on (1) how to diagnose SIADH correctly, (2) the lack of uniform efficacy of FR and NS, (3) the use of active treatments, and (4) increasing awareness of risk factors for overcorrection. Despite clear evidence that hyponatremia is associated with poor prognosis in particular in cancer patients, proof of causation is still lacking. Future research efforts should, therefore, focus on which cancer patients will benefit most from correction of hyponatremia.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### A review of drug-induced hyponatremia [^115oCpKe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium level < 134 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients. Certain drugs (eg, diuretics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics) have been implicated as established causes of either asymptomatic or symptomatic hyponatremia. However, hyponatremia occasionally may develop in the course of treatment with drugs used in everyday clinical practice (eg, newer antihypertensive agents, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors). Physicians may not always give proper attention in time to undesirable drug-induced hyponatremia. Effective clinical management can be handled through awareness of the adverse effect of certain pharmaceutical compounds on serum sodium levels. Here, we review clinical information about the incidence of hyponatremia associated with specific drug treatment and discuss the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. Briefly, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN were enrolled from 146 US sites and patients with euvolemic HN were enrolled from 79 EU sites. We excluded patients with hypovolemic HN because this disorder should respond readily and completely to treatment of volume deficits, and it therefore poses no therapeutic dilemma. We excluded patient with hypervolemic HN from the EU study centers because tolvaptan is only approved in the EU for euvolemic patients. Inclusion of hypervolemic patients treated with tolvaptan would have created a regulatory burden for the sponsor. At each site, approval was sought from the appropriate research ethics review boards as required. After informed consent, absent a waiver, investigators prospectively recorded patient data. To ascertain patients, some centers systematically reviewed hospital laboratory-generated lists of patients with HN. Others enrolled only patients referred to or managed by the investigator personally. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed. Investigators simply recorded the choices made by the physicians responsible for the patient's hospital care.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To assure that HN was clinically significant, the study required an entry [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/l. Patients were excluded if < 18 years old, hypovolemic, hypervolemic (EU only), using an investigational agent or device, or if hyperglycemic enough to interfere with assessment of [Na +] or receiving renal replacement therapy while hyponatremic. As indicated in Supplementary Table S3 online, euvolemia was defined as the absence of clinical and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or sequestration, and the absence of edema and ascites, or on the basis of the treating physician's diagnosis of SIADH. Hypervolemia was defined as excess extracellular fluid volume manifesting as dependent edema or ascites. Although not a specified exclusion criterion originally, we subsequently decided to exclude any patient who was receiving a thiazide at the time the treating physician made a diagnosis of SIADH. It would be difficult to assure that such patients were not in fact hypovolemic, and diuretic use is generally considered to be an exclusion to the proper diagnosis of SIADH. This decision was made prior to data analysis. A complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as published previously, is provided as Supplementary Table S3 online.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116omhxd]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting more than 15% of patients in the hospital. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the most frequent cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, mediated by nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP, previously known as antidiuretic hormone), which acts on the renal V2 receptors to promote water retention. There are a variety of underlying causes of SIAD, including malignancy, pulmonary pathology, and central nervous system pathology. In clinical practice, the etiology of hyponatremia is frequently multifactorial and the management approach may need to evolve during treatment of a single episode. It is therefore important to regularly reassess clinical status and biochemistry, while remaining alert to potential underlying etiological factors that may become more apparent during the course of treatment. In the absence of severe symptoms requiring urgent intervention, fluid restriction (FR) is widely endorsed as the first-line treatment for SIAD in current guidelines, but there is considerable controversy regarding second-line therapy in instances where FR is unsuccessful, which occurs in around half of cases. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of SIAD, and summarize recent evidence for therapeutic options beyond FR, with a focus on tolvaptan, urea, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

Initial Evaluation and Treatment of Hyponatremia

Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Initial management of hyponatremia includes assessment of neurological symptoms and signs to determine whether urgent treatment of severe hyponatremia with hypertonic saline is required. As discussed in "Acute Severe Hyponatremia", severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema leading to seizures, coma, or death, and urgent intervention is recommended with a 100-mL bolus of hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride administered over approximately 15 minutes. An initial dose should be followed by clinical reassessment and a repeat dose if no clinical response, until this target increment has been achieved (Fig. 8). The goal is to achieve an initial sodium increase of 4 to 6 mmol. According to the Adrogué-Madias formula to estimate the effect of fluid administration on pNa, 100 mL of NaCl 3%, containing 51.3 mmol of Na +, may be expected to increase serum sodium by 1 to 1.5 mmol/L in most adults of average size (50–80 kg) (assuming no urinary electrolyte-free water clearance in the same interval) (see Fig. 2).

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### SIADH-related hyponatremia in hospital day care units: clinical experience and management with tolvaptan [^114zTYqv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (Na ˂135 mmol/l) is the most frequent electrolyte disorder in clinical practice, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the commonest cause of hyponatremia in cancer patients. Correcting hyponatremia in these patients can reduce morbidity and mortality, increase the response to anti-cancer agents, and help reduce hospital length of stay and costs. Tolvaptan is an oral medication used to treat SIADH-related hyponatremia patients that needs to be initiated at hospital so patients can have their serum sodium monitored. If tolvaptan could be initiated in hospital day care units (DCUs), performing the same tests, hospitalization could be avoided, quality of life improved, and costs reduced. This is the first publication where a panel of oncologists are sharing their experience and making some recommendations with the use of tolvaptan to treat SIADH-related hyponatremia in DCU after collecting and examining 35 clinical cases with these type of patients. The conclusion from this retrospective observational analysis is that the use of tolvaptan in DCU is safe and effective in the therapeutic management of SIADH-related hyponatremia.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^111WR71R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia based on syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH) is observed in up to 15% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The electrolyte imbalance is associated with a high morbidity and mortality and often delays appropriate treatment. Management of hyponatremia proved to be challenging until new vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists such as tolvaptan became available. This is the first report which presents a prospective case series with an efficient management of hyponatremia including tolvaptan in ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l).

Methods

Ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH were followed after the onset of clinical symptoms of SIADH. Patients were chosen on the basis of histological proven diagnosis of SCLC and the clinical picture of a neurocognitive deficit caused by SIADH-related hyponatremia. All patient data were monitored for clinical improvement based on ECOG status, commencement of chemotherapy and correction of sodium levels.

Results

The treatment followed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm and lead to a rapid and efficient correction of both clinical symptoms and plasma sodium level.

Conclusions

Based on this algorithm all patients started chemotherapy in time. Subsequently, the treatment with tolvaptan lead to an improvement of the ECOG-performance status. In addition, all patients benefit from the effective management of SIADH which omitted prolonged hospital stays and non-elective hospitalizations due to an unstable clinical condition due to severe hyponatremia. These observations add new insight to management of SIADH in thoracic oncology and are of interest for specialists in oncology, endocrinology and pulmonary medicine.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1116ARCm]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The HN Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Patients with hypovolemic HN were excluded, as were those with hypervolemic HN in the EU cohort. A large number of patients were excluded at the time of adjudication. Sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the major outcomes when patients with suspected hypovolemia were restored to the analysis. We believe that the exclusion of these patients represents a conservative approach. Ascertainment varied from center to center; enrollment of consecutive cases was not required. Consequently, the study provides no information about relative prevalence of different etiologies of HN. Accurate determination of clinical volume status is difficult under the best of circumstances. The selection of diagnostic studies and treatments was left up to the clinicians responsible for patients, and the study relied on treating clinicians to make a diagnosis. Neither a fluid challenge nor a urine sodium determination was required as an entry criterion for putatively euvolemic patients. This limited our ability to exclude hypovolemia and independently confirm the presence of SIADH with precision. Because the study's intent was to capture 'real-world' practice, this limitation did not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH is treated. Indeed, a principal conclusion is that diagnostic rigor in the case of SIADH is severely lacking, even in a study situation where some treating physicians were aware that their diagnostic choices were being observed. Some therapies were used too infrequently to assess. For example, urea, a treatment shown to be effective in SIADH, and recommended in recent EU guidelines, was used in only 10 patients. Because of the large number of combinations used at low frequency, analysis focused on monotherapy and initial therapy episodes. The study did not specify, much less randomize, treatment choices. We were unable to determine the rationale for choosing a particular treatment. In particular, we could not determine how often NS was used initially in a diagnostic trial to exclude volume depletion in patients suspected of SIADH, a reasonable strategy for its use. Choice of treatments was likely confounded by indication, and the study cannot accurately assess whether any particular treatment shortened hospital stay. We were not able to fully assess how maneuvers such as discontinuation of a HN-inducing medication or treatment of CHF affected [Na +] changes or the decision to add another treatment maneuver. As a result, even the limited comparisons showing superiority or inferiority of particular treatments that were feasible must be interpreted with much circumspection.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^114yfTid]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertonic (3%) saline was prescribed in 6 patients, whose median baseline serum Na was 114.5 mmol/L (111–117). The cause of hyponatraemia was polydipsia in 3 patients, SIADH in 2 patients and was not documented in 1 patient. The median volume infused was 305 mL (300–528). The median Na post treatment was 121 mmol/L (119.3–126.5). The median Δ Na was 11 mmol/L (5–13).

Inappropriate rapid correction of serum Na with a > 10 mmol/L increase in the first 24 h occurred in 13 patients (8.6%), 11 of whom had chronic or an unknown duration of hyponatraemia. Treatment was given for over correction in 3 patients (2%). The treatment utilised was Desmopressin and intravenous 5% dextrose in 2 patients and intravenous 5% dextrose alone in 1 patient. Two patients had a > 18 mmol/L increase in sodium over 48 h, 1 of which had chronic hyponatraemia. Neither of these patients received treatment for over correction.

Outcomes

There were no cases of osmotic demyelination. The median length of stay was 8 days (4–18.5). There was no significant correlation between nadir serum Na and length of stay using Spearman's rank order correlation, R = 0.003, P = 0.97. Mortality of the whole cohort was 11.2% (17 pts). There was a weak but statistically significant correlation between nadir serum Na and mortality (R = 0.18, P = 0.031) using logistic regression modelling.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114Kd17F]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains.

The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^111Fe3u4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", that is, early empirical coadministration both of desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach would be that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with. However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolonging of hyponatremia symptoms — especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (eg, paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue. The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with pNa less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics, treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours, 2 patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and 2 patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium greater than 10 mmol/L at 24 hours, but no adverse effects were reported. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support this strategy, and instead we endorse a "reactive" or "rescue" approach to desmopressin therapy, in keeping with current guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^112C1CHA]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, several real-world studies have reported a substantial risk of overly rapid hyponatraemia correction, estimated at around 25% for individuals with a starting serum sodium of 120 mmol/litre. This significantly greater magnitude of sodium rise in real-life data compared with RCTs, as summarised in Table 1, is most likely explained by real-life tolvaptan use in individuals with much lower baseline serum sodium levels. The underlying explanation may be that patients starting with lower serum sodium have higher volumes of excess body water, which becomes available for renal excretion after tolvaptan administration, leading to a more pronounced aquaresis and a greater increase in serum sodium.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^115odXCh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Short treatment periods of tolvaptan (15 mg/d) were sufficient to stabilize sodium levels in the majority of the cases. Correction of sodium and the amelioration of the clinical symptoms may help to improve the prognosis in patients with extensive disease. In addition, hyponatremia management may shorten inpatient treatment periods and minimize emergency room calls. Furthermore, treatment with tolvaptan is a recommendable and safe treatment option for terminally ill patients who require emergency treatment in a palliative situation.

Further studies are necessary to analyze whether lower doses of tolvaptan (< 15 mg/d) are sufficient for an effective treatment of severe SIADH in SCLC, as these patients responded very efficient to the dose of 15 mg/d. It is reasonable to imagine that tolvaptan may become a standard treatment option in primary or recurrent SCLC patients with SIADH, especially in patients with bulky disease and severe hyponatremia.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

Recommendations for treating hyponatremia in cancer patients in hospital day care units

To summarize, it is suggested to administer 15 mg of tolvaptan at hospital DCU with a control of the natremia 6 h after. If the control shows worsening or over correction of serum sodium levels, the patient should be hospitalized for closer monitoring. If the patient shows improvement, another control should be performed 18 h after. If the control shows improvement, chemotherapy can be started after 24 h in those patients that are candidate for it and withdrawal of tolvaptan will be considered as previously described. In those not candidate to chemotherapy, tolvaptan therapy should be continued until symptoms improve. In all cases, another control of serum sodium levels should be performed 3–10 days after.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^112zFnMM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

However, no prospective studies for the treatment of hyponatremia in SCLC patients have been reported on a larger scale, due to the lack of a standardized hyponatremia therapy. Recently, the vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan has been approved for the treatment of severe SIADH-associated hyponatremia. An efficient correction of hyponatremia by tolvaptan has been found in a subgroup of SIADH patients out of mixed etiologies. New data has shown that intervention with tolvaptan may be effective for correction and stabilisation of acute onset hyponatremia in SIADH patients.

Up to now, only few data exist for SCLC patients with SIADH and sodium levels below 125 mmol/l and no data showing a long term follow-up of treatment with tolvaptan. This analysis shows a prospective case series for hyponatremia management with tolvaptan in ten SCLC patients with severe SIADH.

### SIADH-related hyponatremia in hospital day care units: clinical experience and management with tolvaptan [^114uV8DZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (Na ˂ 135 mmol/l) is the most frequent electrolyte disorder in clinical practice, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the commonest cause of hyponatremia in cancer patients. Correcting hyponatremia in these patients can reduce morbidity and mortality, increase the response to anti-cancer agents, and help reduce hospital length of stay and costs. Tolvaptan is an oral medication used to treat SIADH-related hyponatremia patients that needs to be initiated at hospital so patients can have their serum sodium monitored. If tolvaptan could be initiated in hospital day care units (DCUs), performing the same tests, hospitalization could be avoided, quality of life improved, and costs reduced. This is the first publication where a panel of oncologists are sharing their experience and making some recommendations with the use of tolvaptan to treat SIADH-related hyponatremia in DCU after collecting and examining 35 clinical cases with these type of patients. The conclusion from this retrospective observational analysis is that the use of tolvaptan in DCU is safe and effective in the therapeutic management of SIADH-related hyponatremia.

SIADH-related hyponatremia

SIADH is commonly caused by cancers, certain medications, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, pulmonary diseases, or other causes (AIDS, idiopathic, etc.).

In cancer patients, SIADH is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with a wide range of tumors but about 75% of all cases are encountered in SCLC. SIADH may be a result of ectopic arginine vasopressin (AVP) production by tumor cells or a result of stimulation of AVP secretion or potentiation of AVP effects by some anti-cancer drugs as well as by other factors like diarrhea or vomiting (Table 1).

Before turning the diagnosis of SIADH, other clinical entities need to be excluded like hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, severe emotional or physical stress, and medications that stimulate AVP release. Several consensus documents have established the diagnosis criteria of SIADH in cancer patients (Table 2).

Clinical consequences of hyponatremia due to SIADH

Hypotonic hyponatremia causes cerebral oedema, intracranial hypertension, and risk of brain injury. Patients with mild hyponatremia are traditionally asymptomatic. At serum concentrations between 125 and 130 mmol/l, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may develop. As serum sodium concentration falls, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, incontinence, and other neurological symptoms predominate. Hyponatremia below 115 mmol/l may induce serious neurological squeals and constitutes a medical emergency.

Treatment of SIADH-related hyponatremia in cancer patients

Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. Some recently published guidelines have reviewed the management of SIADH in cancer patients (Fig. 1).

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115KMrVW]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Postapproval observational studies of tolvaptan have reported efficacy in hospitalized patients with lower serum sodium concentrations than the SALT trials but have identified potential risks. While the SALT trials reported excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia (defined as an increase in sodium > 12 mmol in 24 hours) in 1.7% of overall tolvaptan-treated patients (5.6% in the SIAD subgroup), observational studies of tolvaptan in moderate to profound hyponatremia have reported highly variable rates of biochemical overcorrection (variably defined, usually ≥ 12 mmol/L over 24 hours) in patients with initial pNa less than 125 mmol/L, ranging from 0% to 30% of cases (Table 7). The largest data sets are an international hyponatremia registry that included 225 patients with SIAD treated with tolvaptan, which observed overcorrection (pNa > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours) in 12.1% of cases, and an international pharmacovigilance study of 252 tolvaptan-treated patients that observed overcorrection in 24.6% of cases. One reason for the higher rates of overcorrection in clinical practice compared to the SALT trials may be that in clinical practice tolvaptan is used second-line, which selects for patients with more severe SIAD. Some of these studies describe use that differs from standard practice, including combining tolvaptan with FR, or the concurrent use of additional therapies. Higher rates still of overcorrection are reported in observational studies in which tolvaptan has been used in less highly selected patient groups, including those likely to contain participants with acute hyponatremia, post pituitary surgery, or in emergency department populations, which are likely to contain individuals with readily reversible SIAD.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11183jyJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

There is little high-level evidence to guide chronic SIAD treatment because of the difficulty of conducting randomized trials due to the heterogeneity of patients with this condition, severity of illness that makes placebo therapy ethically difficult, and the potential for resolution of conditions perpetuating the nonosmotic release of AVP, which can confound trials of SIAD treatments. However, this tendency for "autocorrection" of hyponatremia due to SIAD, if caused by a reversible underlying condition, makes rigorous RCTs even more important to confirm any apparent benefits in observational studies. A 2017 systematic review of chronic hyponatremia treatments did not identify RCTs of any treatments other than vaptans, but since then new RCTs have emerged. Published RCTs of therapies for chronic hypotonic hyponatremia to date are summarized in Table 6.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^113nG35Z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is defined by a serum sodium (Na) concentration < 135 mmol/L. It is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalised patients at a rate of 15–30%. A prospective cohort study of 98,411 hospitalised patients demonstrated that even mild hyponatraemia (Na 130–134 mmol/L) is associated with increased mortality in hospital (OR 1.37), at 1 year (OR 1.35) and at 5 years post discharge (OR 1.24).

Traditionally, hyponatraemia is classified clinically by volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. The most common cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is characterized by dysregulated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and water retention, despite low serum Na and osmolality. Diagnostic criteria include: euvolaemic state, normal thyroid hormone and cortisol levels, serum Na < 135 mmol/L, reduced serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/Kg and urine Na > 30 mmol/L.

### Therapy for SIAD: what does the future hold? [^113rohyY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia, the most frequent electrolyte abnormality, is defined as serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l and is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality, with its commonest cause being SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Except for patients with severe symptoms requiring treatment with hypertonic saline, the vast majority of patients with SIAD experience mild to moderate symptoms and receive fluid restriction as first-line therapy. The last major international guidelines, published in 2014, agreed on the limited evidence base of therapeutic approach, while they led to diverging recommendations with regard to the suggested second-line therapies. A US consensus statement suggests the use of tolvaptan as second-line agentin contrast to the European guidelines which do not recommend its use, suggesting oral urea instead. In the era of evidence-based medicine, there has been surprising sparsity of high-quality data for the treatment of SIAD until 2020, with the exception for placebo-controlled trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Fluid restriction, the mainstay treatment for SIAD in the last decades, had not been prospectively evaluated until recently. Real-world data have recorded its limited efficacy, with a response rate estimated at around 50%. Fluid restriction is also unlikely to achieve significant sodium correction in cases of limited free water excretion, such as when urine osmolality exceeds 500 mOsm/kg or the serum to urine electrolyte ratio is greater than 1. In 2020, the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fluid restriction for SIAD was published, showing significant, but modest, efficacy, as evidenced by a median sodium rise of 3 mmol/l over a 72-h period, with one third of patients being non-responders. These data highlight the need for additional therapies in a substantial proportion of patients. The choice of second-line therapy has been a subject to great debate with options including tolvaptan, urea, combination of furosemide and sodium chloride, demeclocycline, and, recently, empagliflozin.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

Treatment dose

After establishing the diagnosis and verifying the selection criteria are met, treatment with tolvaptan can be initiated in DCU at a dose of 15 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 60 mg once daily as tolerated to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. Patients may drink fluids freely after treatment initiation.

Analytical controls after the first tolvaptan dose

An analytical control (for serum sodium and volume status) is recommended no later than 6 h after. If there is no over rapid serum sodium correction, the patient can be sent home and have another control 24 h after treatment initiation. If it shows worsening of the patient's condition or serum sodium correction exceeds 6 mmol/l within 6 h, the patient should be hospitalized for closer monitoring and administration of hypertonic fluids.
If serum sodium increases ≥ 12 mmol/l within 24 h or ≥ 18 mmol/l within 48 h or there is a hypernatremia > 145 mmol/l, tolvaptan treatment needs to be interrupted or discontinued followed by administration of hypotonic fluid. If it increases < 136 + ≤ 5 mmol/l within 24 h, the tolvaptan dose should be increased.
Further controls will be done after 3–10 days depending on patients' overall condition and serum sodium correction as well as circumstances like the date of their next appointment.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Urea to treat hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aNjKF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The use of urea to treat hyponatremia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has not been universally adopted due to questions about effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addresses these questions.

Study Design

This PRISMA-guided study examined published research across 4 electronic databases.

Study Populations

Patients with SIADH-related hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria

Clinical trials and observational studies reporting at least 1 outcome related to serum sodium concentration, symptom resolution, or adverse effects after oral or nasogastric urea administration.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers using a standardized form recording study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and treatment outcomes.

Analytical Approach

A meta-analysis was conducted using the restricted maximum likelihood method for the random effects model to assess the effect of urea treatment on serum sodium and serum urea compared with other treatment modalities. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on treatment duration and SIADH severity.

Results

Urea treatment significantly increased serum sodium (mean difference [MD], 9.08 [95% CI, 7.64–10.52], P < 0.01) and urea (MD, 31.66 [95% CI, 16.05–47.26], P < 0.01) in patients with SIADH, albeit with significantly high heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on the treatment duration showed a significant rise in the serum sodium level after 24 hours and 2, 5, 7, and 14 days, as well as after 1 year of treatment. Greater increases in serum sodium levels after treatment with urea occurred in patients with severe (< 120 mEq/L) (MD, 18.04 [95% CI, 13.68–22.39]) than with moderate (120–129 mEq/L) (MD, 7.86 [95% CI, 6.78–8.94]) or mild (130–135 mEq/L) (MD, 8.00 [95% CI, 7.31–8.69]) SIADH-induced hyponatremia. Urea treatment was comparable to fluid restriction (MD, 0.81 [95% CI, -0.93 to 2.55], P = 0.4) and vaptans (MD, -1.96 [95% CI, -4.59 to 0.66], P = 0.1) but superior to no treatment (MD, 7.99 [95% CI, 6.25–9.72], P < 0.01). Urea was associated with minor adverse events, with poor palatability being the most common.

Limitations

As no randomized controlled trials investigating urea as a treatment for hyponatremia were identified for inclusion, these analyses were based on observational studies.

Conclusions

Urea is safe and effective for managing SIADH-induced hyponatremia. These finding suggest that urea may be a useful treatment modality in resource-limited settings or when other treatments are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.

### Disorders of salt and water balance after pituitary surgery [^112fRiGi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

We propose an algorithm for the management of delayed hyponatremia after pituitary surgery (Fig. 2). Asymptomatic mild to moderate hyponatremia (sodium ≥ 125 mmol/L) can often be managed as an outpatient, with strict fluid restriction of 500 to 1000 mL/24 hours and close monitoring of plasma sodium until improvement is seen. In patients who have symptomatic or profound hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L), hospitalization is recommended.

Figure 2.
Proposed algorithm for the management of delayed hyponatremia secondary to SIAD following pituitary surgery. a Secondary to postoperative SIAD, exclude other causes first, including adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, infection, exogenous desmopressin administration, or other medications. b If chronic hyponatremia (> 48 hours duration, or unknown duration), avoid overcorrection and aim increase in plasma sodium by < 10 mmol/L over the initial 24 hours, and < 18 mmol/L over the initial 48 hours. c When used in combination with frusemide, fluid restriction < 1000 mL/day has been associated with acute kidney injury. d Urea 30 to 60 g daily in divided doses. e Monitor kidney function (using creatinine, not urea) in patients taking urea. f Tolvaptan 7.5 mg as single dose (can be repeated if required) if low risk of complications from overcorrection of plasma sodium (including acute hyponatremia of known < 48 hours duration, plasma sodium > 120 mmol/L). g Hypertonic saline recommended as per guidelines.

Patients with moderate asymptomatic hyponatremia (sodium 125–129 mmol/L) can be managed with aggressive fluid restriction (500 mL/24 hours) initially, with or without the addition of oral urea therapy, if available. In those with inadequate improvement on fluid restriction alone, or with profound hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) who remain asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, combined treatment with fluid restriction and urea remains appropriate. Fluid restriction and urea can be relaxed once the plasma sodium exceeds 132 mmol/L, or if there are signs of DI developing. Patients with plasma sodium < 120 mmol/L or neurological symptoms should be managed with hypertonic saline with the aim to raise the plasma sodium promptly and improve symptoms. Thereafter, fluid restriction and urea may be sufficient as continuing therapy. Tolvaptan may also be considered for moderate hyponatremia depending on availability. If tolvaptan is administered, the patient should be encouraged to drink to thirst to limit overcorrection from induced aquaresis.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^1126c3pz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

Management

SIAD after pituitary surgery should be managed similarly to that from other causes. Management options include fluid restriction, oral urea, oral tolvaptan, and administration of 3% hypertonic saline in severely symptomatic cases. Patients with acute hyponatremia of < 48 hours duration are often severely symptomatic if the plasma sodium falls to < 120 mmol/L and benefit from a prompt increase in plasma sodium to reduce cerebral edema. In comparison, those with hyponatremia of > 48 hours duration with minimal neurological symptoms require a slower correction, to avoid the risk of osmotic demyelination. A correction rate of no more than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours is recommended in this cohort (75,76).

Fluid restriction is often first-line therapy for mild to moderate hyponatremia where the plasma sodium is 125 to 135 mmol/L. Although there are no randomized controlled trials proving the efficacy and safety of fluid restriction in the postpituitary surgery setting, clinical experience supports its continuing use. However, fluid restriction alone is often ineffective or slow at correcting hyponatremia (66,67,77,78). A recent randomized controlled trial in people with chronic SIAD demonstrated a median rise in plasma sodium by 3 mmol/L after 3 days of fluid restriction (1000 mL/day) compared with 1 mmol/L without any specific treatment. Thereafter, minimal increase in plasma sodium occurred, with the rise from baseline being 4 mmol/L vs 1 mmol/L after 30 days in the fluid restriction and no intervention groups, respectively. Similarly, another randomized controlled trial showed a rise in plasma sodium of 4.9 mmol/L after 4 days of fluid restriction (500–1000 mL/day), and by 5.7 mmol/L after 28 days. Data from a hyponatremia registry of over 3000 patients also showed only a very modest rise in plasma sodium of 2 mmol/L over the initial day of fluid restriction monotherapy. In a review of SIAD following pituitary surgery, monotherapy with fluid restriction achieved a mean rise in plasma sodium of 3.3 mmol/L over 72 hours and 32% of patients did not achieve any increase in plasma sodium. Predictors of failure of fluid restriction include urine osmolality > 500 mOsmol/kg, sum of the urine sodium and potassium exceeding plasma sodium, 24-hour urine volume < 1500 mL, and increase in plasma sodium < 2 mmol/L within the initial 24 to 48 hours of fluid restriction < 1000 mL/day. Fluid restriction should be at least 500 mL less than the estimated 24-hour urine output.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

SCLC belongs to a class of the most malignant solid tumours. At the time of diagnosis most of the patients (90%) have to be classified as patients with limited, palliative treatment options. Due to the advanced age of this cohort (median 70 years) comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases or respiratory insufficiency influence the therapeutic strategies. Paraneoplastic syndromes, hyponatremia in particular, is common in SCLC (up to 15% of all patients). In 1957, Schwartz and Bartter described this clinical phenomenon of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion in patients with lung cancer and introduced the term SIADH.

In general, SIADH can be diagnosed on the basis of plasma and urine sodium levels and osmolality. Treatment of SIADH should always be set in correlation with the clinical picture of hyponatremia before the treatment option is chosen. Chronic hyponatremia (plasma Na < 125 mmol/l) in lung cancer can often be oligosymptomatic. Acute loss of sodium in hyponatremia is, in contrast, associated with agitation, lack of concentration or compliance and requires urgent control of the symptoms. Therefore, before treatment options are chosen in individual cases, and especially in clinical presentations such as fatigue or wasting syndrome, the concerted action of specialists in the field such as endocrinologists and pulmonologists is sought.

As Hansen et al. pointed out, hyponatremia in lung cancer patients is not only confined to the diagnosis of paraneoplastic SIADH. Other causes such as co-medications should be checked and considered to optimize the therapeutic goal. Hyponatremia treatment is based on clinical and biochemical parameters. The diagnostic and treatment algorithm given in Figure 1 proved to be helpful for a standardization of the hyponatremia management.

SIADH in SCLC is up to now a therapeutic challenge. Treatments with conventional therapeutic options such as fluid restriction or sodium chloride substitution, as well as with oral or intravenous medications, are often insufficient. Therapeutic oral drug preparations, such as demeclocycline, show only a slow and delayed increase in sodium levels in SIADH-associated hyponatremia. Fluid restriction or 3% hypertonic saline infusions is left as an option to reduce clinical symptoms which are required to start treatment. As most patients were in stage IV, an early commencement of chemotherapy was sought. A poor control of hyponatremia in this cohort may induce delays in the initiation of chemotherapy and consequently raise the disease-related morbidity and possibly mortality.

Background

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death for cancer-related mortality worldwide. In 2007 1.3 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is found in up to 15–20% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases. The highly malignant SCLC tumor consists of primitive cells derived from the neuroendocrine lung and is associated with paracrine and paraneoplastic syndromes. Smoking, sex, initial tumor burden and LDH levels have been found to play a role in the outcome and prognosis of the patients. As recently demonstrated, persistent hyponatremia also appears to be a negative prognostic marker for overall survival in SCLC patients.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with lung cancer. Clinical symptoms such as dizziness, tremor, agitation and other neuropsychiatric symptoms have to be taken into consideration for the diagnosis of clinically relevant hyponatremia. Mild symptoms such as fatigue occur in mild (plasma sodium = 130–134 mmol/l) and in moderate hyponatremia (plasma sodium = 125–129 mmol/l). Clinical symptoms can aggravate in hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l). The SIADH is a common finding in SCLC patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

SIADH as a hallmark of SCLC can be found in 10–15% of all SCLC patients, but only in 2–4% of all non-small cell lung (NSLC) cancer patients, as recent retrospective series demonstrated. In SCLC patients SIADH is diagnosed predominantly in advanced stages and may induce a significant reduction in plasma sodium levels. Retrospective data point out that hyponatremia and the lack of correction of sodium can lead to a poor outcome in SCLC patients. Furthermore, these data suggest that the correction of hyponatremia may affect the prognosis of the patients. Correction and stabilisation of the sodium levels are required to initiate chemotherapy treatment and finally for the successful treatment of the underlying disease.

At the time of diagnosis SCLC patients in advanced stages of disease are often in a very limited performance status. In addition, comorbidities such as hyponatraemia or cardiovascular disease may delay the initiation of systemic chemotherapy and increase early mortality. Historical cohorts have shown that up to 40% of patients will not receive an effective primary chemotherapy due to a low Karnofsky-Index. New, supportive therapeutic options such as the rapid stabilization of the sodium metabolism could be helpful in this context.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (chronic setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum sodium concentration every 6 hours until the serum sodium concentration has stabilized in patients with moderate or profound hyponatremia.

The Hyponatremia Intervention Trial (HIT) is a large, international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) currently underway aiming to recruit 2278 hospitalized participants with pNa less than 130 mmol/L to be allocated 1:1 to receive either targeted correction of sodium concentration or standard care. The trial will include patients with hyponatremia irrespective of underlying cause or volume status. Targeted correction will aim to be achieved by adhering to predetermined diagnostic and treatment algorithms. The primary outcome will be death or rehospitalization within 30 days, and secondary outcomes will include measures of falls, fractures, hyponatremia recurrence, quality of life, and adverse events (eg, ODS). The results of this trial will provide high-quality evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that intervention to correct hyponatremia improves clinical outcomes.

Data regarding the mortality risk of SIAD specifically are conflicting, with some studies showing increased mortality and some potentially showing reduced mortality compared with other causes of hyponatremia. A prospective observational study in Ireland evaluated mortality outcomes in 1323 hyponatremic patients (43.3% with SIAD) compared to matched controls. SIAD was associated with increased mortality compared to normonatremic controls (RR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08–2.8). However mortality risk in SIAD was not as high as for other causes of hyponatremia. Hypervolemic patients had an RR of mortality of 2.9 compared to SIAD, and hypovolemic patients had an RR of 1.6. A recent Swiss retrospective population-based cohort study of 47 176 medical inpatients with hyponatremia (11.9% with SIAD) using propensity-score matching found no significant effect of hyponatremia on mortality as a whole, but sensitivity stratification by non-SIAD and SIAD hyponatremic patients showed opposing results. While non-SIAD hyponatremic patients had a 10% higher risk for in-hospital mortality, SIAD seemed to be associated with reduced mortality — however, 30-day readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay were all increased in SIAD. SIAD is known to be underrecorded in hospital coding, hence the accuracy of SIAD classification in this study may be low. This is particularly relevant when assessing mortality rates, as if a patient dies of an underlying malignancy, anecdotally, the hospital discharge documentation is even less likely to record comorbid SIAD.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112sZjn1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Methods

In ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH (pNa < 125 mmol/l), diagnosed in the Evangelische Lungenklinik Berlin between June 2010 and April 2012, HN treatment including tolvaptan was monitored. An ethics committee approval was sought and granted (EV.-No.EA1–289–09). All patients provided consent for publication of individual clinical details in this manuscript.

SIADH was confirmed by the measurement of plasma and urine sodium and plasma and urine osmolality. Hypo- and hypervolemic hyponatremia were excluded as well as hyponatremia due to other endocrine causes such as adrenal insufficiency based on adrenal gland metastasis or hypothyroidism. Hyponatremia-inducing medication such as thiazides or carbamazepine were discontinued.

For management of hyponatremia, a diagnostic and treatment algorithm was designed (see Figure 1). All patients with hyponatremia were treated according to this algorithm.

Figure 1
Diagnostic and treatment algorithm.

When standard hyponatremia treatment such as fluid restriction or 3% hypertonic saline infusions failed to improve the clinical condition, patients received an initial dose of 15 mg/d tolvaptan. Alternative hyponatremia treatment options were stopped 12 hours beforehand. During tolvaptan treatment, no fluid restriction was enforced.

All patients with tolvaptan treatment were monitored as inpatients. Weight and the clinical status were assessed frequently and the clinical and laboratory data were registered and analyzed. The ECOG performance status was surveyed as a scale for quality of life. Follow-up data were collected for outcome analyses. Deadline for follow-up was December, 31 in 2012.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

Introduction

Hyponatremia (Na < 135 mmol/l) is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical practice, affecting around 15–28% of hospitalized patients and occurring in up to 44% in certain cancers, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The most frequent cause of hyponatremia in the hospital setting is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is also the commonest cause of hyponatremia in cancer patients, representing around 30% of the total.

Hyponatremia is associated with high morbidity and mortality and poorer response to anti-cancer agents. It causes longer hospital length of stay and increases medical costs.

Tolvaptan is an oral treatment indicated for adult patients with hyponatremia secondary to SIADH. This is the first publication about the use of tolvaptan in hospital day care unit (DCU).

Definition, classification, and diagnosis of hyponatremia

Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l. It is considered "mild" if values are between 130 and 135 mmol/l, "moderate" if between 120 and 129 mmol/l, and "severe" if below 120 mmol/l. As for the symptoms, it can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to their intensity. Hyponatremia is considered "acute" if developed in less than 48 h or "chronic" if developed over a longer period of time. Also, it can be classified as iso-osmolar, hyperosmolar, and hypotonic or hypo-osmolar. Hypotonic hyponatremia is most frequently encountered in clinical practice (60% of all cases), especially in cancer patients, and the commonest cause of hypotonic hyponatremia with euvolemia is SIADH.

The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia can be performed with an exhaustive anamnesis, physical examination assessing the extracellular fluid volume status, and simple blood and urine laboratory tests.

Table 2.
Prevalence of hyponatremia — summary of key studies in adults

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands of nearly 3000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250 000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%. An outlying US study of nearly 200 000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring 2 sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L. There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia — for example, following pituitary surgery, where a meta-analysis showed 5.6% cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies do seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia such as increased serum lipids or proteins, or erroneous results from hemolyzed or contaminated blood samples, are not specifically excluded.
