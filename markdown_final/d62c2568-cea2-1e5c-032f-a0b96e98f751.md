## Question

Explain mri physics to me

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to explain MRI physics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational NMR phenomenon and why hydrogen dominates clinical MRI. Then, I should verify the three magnetic fields used in MRI and their roles. Next, I will examine resonance, excitation, and relaxation, including T1, T2, and T2✱. After that, I need to check spatial encoding and k-space, followed by pulse sequences and contrast weighting. I will then review advanced contrasts like diffusion, perfusion, and susceptibility, and finally consider safety, artifacts, and the evolving role of low-field and quantitative MRI, making sure each step is supported by appropriate references and that I correct any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: MRI exploits nuclear magnetic resonance of certain nuclei, with hydrogen overwhelmingly dominant in clinical imaging because of its abundance and high gyromagnetic ratio, which yields a strong signal at typical field strengths of 1.5–3 T, though lower and higher fields are also used depending on the application and trade-offs in SNR, speed, and artifacts [^112bZ92w] [^116YuAh3] [^113dHEuJ].

> I need to verify the three magnetic fields that make MRI work: a strong static B0 field polarizes tissue and aligns hydrogen spins, gradient coils apply linear B0 gradients along x, y, and z to encode position, and a time-varying RF B1 field perturbs magnetization to create transverse coherence and receive the signal; this triad is the backbone of image formation and must be coordinated precisely in time and space [^114XNVA3] [^116YuAh3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about resonance; I should confirm the Larmor relationship. Resonance occurs when the RF frequency matches the Larmor frequency, which is proportional to B0 and the gyromagnetic ratio, so at 1.5 T hydrogen resonates near 64 MHz and at 3 T near 128 MHz, enabling efficient excitation and signal reception when the RF is tuned to that frequency [^116TjNAh].

> Next, I should review relaxation, and I need to ensure I distinguish T1 from T2 correctly. T1, spin–lattice relaxation, describes the recovery of longitudinal magnetization back toward equilibrium along B0 and is driven by interactions with the molecular environment; T2, spin–spin relaxation, describes the decay of transverse magnetization due to irreversible dephasing from local magnetic fields and molecular interactions; T2✱ additionally includes reversible dephasing from B0 inhomogeneity and susceptibility effects, which is why T2✱ is shorter than T2 and why gradient-echo sequences are sensitive to these inhomogeneities [^112xQDtq] [^116mR7j6].

> Wait, let me verify the spatial encoding step because it's easy to misstate. Position is encoded by applying linear B0 gradients that make the Larmor frequency vary with position; frequency encoding in one direction and phase encoding in another allow 2D mapping, and slice selection uses a gradient combined with a shaped RF pulse to excite only a slab; the raw data live in k-space, where lines are filled sequentially and Fourier transformation converts k-space to image space, so k-space traversal and sampling determine resolution, FOV, and artifacts [^112xQDtq] [^115VtrBw].

> I will now examine pulse sequences and contrast, and I should double-check that I'm aligning TE and TR correctly. Spin echo refocuses transverse dephasing with a 180° pulse and is robust to B0 inhomogeneity, while gradient echo does not refocus and thus shows T2✱ weighting; adjusting TR and TE changes T1 versus T2 weighting, with short TR/short TE favoring T1 weighting and long TR/long TE favoring T2 weighting; inversion recovery adds a 180° prepulse to null specific tissues, and fat suppression techniques exploit frequency differences or inversion to suppress fat signal [^114XNVA3] [^111sznH1].

> Let me consider diffusion MRI carefully, because the link to microstructure is indirect. Diffusion-weighted imaging sensitizes the signal to water molecule displacement, with the b-value controlling diffusion weighting; diffusion is anisotropic in white matter, enabling DTI to infer fiber orientation and connectivity, though tractography remains probabilistic and model-dependent; diffusion metrics like ADC and kurtosis reflect cellularity, barriers, and tissue organization, supporting applications such as ischemia detection and tumor characterization [^117XgHaP] [^111xfrNd] [^111Z3wEU].

> I should confirm perfusion principles next. Perfusion MRI assesses tissue blood flow, most commonly with dynamic susceptibility contrast using gadolinium to track bolus passage and derive relative cerebral blood volume and flow, or with dynamic contrast enhancement to estimate capillary permeability and leakage; arterial spin labeling uses endogenous water as a tracer and avoids contrast, though SNR is lower and labeling efficiency varies with field strength and physiology [^111FyhhY].

> But wait, what if susceptibility effects are confounding the image rather than adding diagnostic value; I need to check how we leverage them. Susceptibility-weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping exploit local field distortions from iron, deoxyhemoglobin, calcium, or contrast agents to depict hemorrhage, venous structures, iron deposition, and calcification; these contrasts are inherently T2✱ weighted and can be optimized or minimized depending on the clinical question [^116mR7j6] [^112PoNi8].

> Next, I should review safety, and I must ensure I separate myth from fact. The static B0 field poses projectile risks for ferromagnetic objects and can displace or torque certain implants, while time-varying gradients can cause peripheral nerve stimulation and acoustic noise, and RF fields can cause tissue heating quantified by SAR; rigorous screening, zoning, and device labeling are essential, and anesthesia providers need specialized training for the MR environment [^116YuAh3] [^112QATXX] [^111fb4RV].

> Hold on, I should verify common artifacts and their physics-based solutions. Motion causes ghosting and blurring, susceptibility differences create signal loss and distortion, chemical shift causes fat–water misregistration, and aliasing reflects undersampling; protocol adjustments such as motion correction, shimming, fat suppression, and oversampling mitigate these, and recognizing artifact patterns prevents misinterpretation of pathology [^113jSqRs] [^111vBubB].

> Let me reconsider the role of field strength, because I initially thought higher field always means better images; wait, that's too simplistic. While higher B0 increases polarization and theoretical SNR, it also increases susceptibility artifacts, RF inhomogeneity, and SAR, and low-field systems have experienced a renaissance with improved gradients, coils, and deep-learning denoising, achieving clinically useful contrast with fewer artifacts and lower cost in many scenarios [^113dHEuJ] [^114jrA62].

> I should double-check the trajectory toward quantitative MRI, since qualitative contrast is increasingly supplemented by metrics. Quantitative mapping of T1, T2, PD, diffusion, and susceptibility enables reproducible tissue characterization and cross-site comparisons, though standardization of methods and reporting is critical; multidimensional correlation MRI and nonlinear inversion approaches are pushing toward faster, joint estimation of multiple parameters in a single acquisition [^114kPfFZ] [^1136gZ94] [^113ZuVaH].

> In summary, MRI works by aligning hydrogen spins with B0, perturbing them with resonant RF to create transverse magnetization, encoding position with gradients, and detecting the signal as it relaxes back toward equilibrium; tissue contrast arises from differences in proton density, T1, T2, T2✱, diffusion, perfusion, and susceptibility, and the clinician's task is to select sequences and parameters that emphasize the biology of interest while managing trade-offs in speed, SNR, and artifacts [^112xQDtq] [^114XNVA3].

MRI uses a **strong magnetic field** to align hydrogen protons, then applies a **radiofrequency pulse** to tip them into the transverse plane. When the RF pulse stops, protons relax back, emitting signals that are spatially encoded by gradients and reconstructed into images [^112xQDtq]. Image contrast depends on **tissue-specific T1 and T2 relaxation** and proton density, with sequences tailored to highlight pathology [^114XNVA3]. MRI is non-ionizing and versatile but requires strict safety screening for implants and ferromagnetic objects [^116YuAh3] [^112kASfq].

---

## Basic principles of MRI

### Magnetic field and alignment of protons

- **Static magnetic field (B0)**: Typically 1.5–3 Tesla in clinical scanners, aligning hydrogen protons parallel or antiparallel to B0 [^116YuAh3].
- **Net magnetization**: Slightly more protons align parallel, creating a small net magnetization along B0 (longitudinal magnetization) [^112xQDtq].

---

### Radiofrequency (RF) excitation

An **RF pulse** at the Larmor frequency (proportional to B0) tips the net magnetization into the transverse plane, creating transverse magnetization and phase coherence [^114XNVA3]. Resonance occurs when the RF frequency matches the Larmor frequency, enabling efficient energy transfer [^114XNVA3].

---

### Relaxation and signal generation

When the RF pulse ends, protons **relax back to equilibrium**, emitting RF signals detected by the coil [^112xQDtq]. T1 (spin–lattice) relaxation is the recovery of longitudinal magnetization as protons realign with B0, whereas T2 (spin–spin) relaxation is the decay of transverse magnetization due to dephasing from local magnetic field inhomogeneities [^112xQDtq].

---

## Spatial encoding and image formation

### Gradient magnetic fields

Linear **gradient coils** superimpose small, position-dependent magnetic fields along x, y, and z, making the Larmor frequency vary with position [^112xQDtq]. Frequency encoding assigns a unique frequency to each position along one axis, while phase encoding assigns a unique phase to each position along another axis [^notfound].

---

### K-space and Fourier transform

Raw data are stored in **k-space**; a 2D Fourier transform converts k-space into the image [^115VtrBw]. Image resolution and contrast depend on how k-space is sampled and the sequence parameters [^111sznH1].

---

## MRI contrast mechanisms

MRI contrast reflects tissue-specific **relaxation and proton density** [^114XNVA3]:

| **Contrast mechanism** | **Description** | **Clinical applications** |
|-|-|-|
| T1-weighted | Emphasizes T1 differences; fat bright, fluid dark | - Anatomy <br/> - Fat <br/> - Gadolinium enhancement [^notfound] |
| T2-weighted | Emphasizes T2 differences; fluid bright, fat intermediate | - Edema <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Demyelination [^notfound] |
| Proton density | Reflects hydrogen content | - Cartilage <br/> - Brain <br/> - Musculoskeletal imaging [^notfound] |
| Diffusion-weighted | Sensitive to water molecule mobility | - Acute ischemia <br/> - Tumor cellularity <br/> - Infection [^114RMopE] |
| Perfusion-weighted | Assesses blood flow and capillary permeability | - Stroke <br/> - Tumor grading <br/> - Functional assessment [^111FyhhY] |

## MRI safety considerations

MRI is non-ionizing, but **significant safety issues** require strict protocols:

- **Static field hazards**: Ferromagnetic objects can become projectiles; thorough screening is essential [^116YuAh3].
- **Gradient field effects**: Rapid switching can cause peripheral nerve stimulation and loud noise [^112kASfq].
- **RF heating**: RF energy can cause tissue heating; SAR limits are monitored [^117C1J1C].
- **Implant safety**: Many devices are contraindicated; MR-conditional devices require specific protocols [^114y9rJw].

---

## Advanced MRI techniques

- **Functional MRI (fMRI)**: Detects BOLD signal changes for brain function mapping [^116mR7j6].
- **Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)**: Measures metabolites for tissue characterization [^117MfLWV].
- **MR angiography (MRA)**: Visualizes blood vessels without invasive catheterization [^114LivBq].
- **MR elastography**: Assesses tissue stiffness for fibrosis and tumor characterization [^1152yRYi].

---

MRI leverages magnetic fields, RF pulses, and gradients to generate **soft-tissue images** with versatile, noninvasive contrast, enabling detailed anatomical and functional assessment across clinical domains [^112bZ92w].

### Quantitative MR imaging: physical principles and sequence design in abdominal imaging [^114kPfFZ]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging seeks to quantify fundamental biologic and MR-inducible tissue properties, in contrast to the routine application of MR imaging in the clinic, in which differences in MR parameters are used to generate contrast for subsequent subjective image analysis. Fundamental parameters that are commonly quantified by using MR imaging include proton density, diffusion, T1 relaxation, T2 and T2✱ relaxation, and magnetization transfer. Applications of these MR imaging-quantifiable parameters to abdominal imaging include oncologic imaging, evaluation of diffuse liver disease, and assessment of splenic, renal, and pancreatic disease. An understanding of the inherent physical principles underlying the basic quantitative parameters as well as the commonly used pulse sequences requisite to their derivation is critical, as this field is rapidly growing and its use will likely continue to expand in the clinic. The full potential of quantitative MR imaging applied to abdominal imaging has yet to be realized, but the myriad applications reported to date will undoubtedly continue to grow.

### Magnetic resonance imaging: the underlying principles [^114xYRHg]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

The creation of a magnetic resonance image (MRI) and its inherent contrast are controlled by a variety of anatomical structure- and sequence-dependent parameters. While these may seem confusing to the uninitiated, they provide MRI with great flexibility and make it a powerful clinical tool. This article describes the principles of basic physics behind magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging, including a basic description of the properties of magnetic resonance compatible nuclei, how a radiofrequency (RF) pulse produces a signal, and how this signal can be spatially encoded to produce an image. The relaxation properties of the MRI signal depend on biological tissue type and can provide information on tissue composition, environment, and pathological changes. The contrast properties within an image can be manipulated based on the relaxation properties of the anatomical sample and the nature of the imaging sequence. The benefits of T1- and T2-weighted images in musculoskeletal imaging and the common sequences used (including turbo spin echo [TSE], fat suppression sequences such as STIR, and rapid breath-hold sequences such as HASTE and FISP) are discussed. The principles behind contrast agents and diffusion-weighted imaging and how they can be applied in the body are considered.

### An image-based approach to understanding the physics of MR artifacts [^113jSqRs]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

As clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging becomes more versatile and more complex, it is increasingly difficult to develop and maintain a thorough understanding of the physical principles that govern the changing technology. This is particularly true for practicing radiologists, whose primary obligation is to interpret clinical images and not necessarily to understand complex equations describing the underlying physics. Nevertheless, the physics of MR imaging plays an important role in clinical practice because it determines image quality, and suboptimal image quality may hinder accurate diagnosis. This article provides an image-based explanation of the physics underlying common MR imaging artifacts, offering simple solutions for remedying each type of artifact. Solutions that have emerged from recent technologic advances with which radiologists may not yet be familiar are described in detail. Types of artifacts discussed include those resulting from voluntary and involuntary patient motion, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic field inhomogeneities, gradient nonlinearity, standing waves, aliasing, chemical shift, and signal truncation. With an improved awareness and understanding of these artifacts, radiologists will be better able to modify MR imaging protocols so as to optimize clinical image quality, allowing greater confidence in diagnosis.

Three-dimensional imaging has become an essential tool in modern health care, enabling accurate diagnosis and treatment planning for a wide range of conditions. In particular, computed tomography (CT) and MRI stand out in providing detailed cross-sectional images of the human body. While both modalities serve critical roles in clinical practice, they rely on fundamentally different physical principles. This review explores the fundamental physics and image acquisition techniques of CT and MRI, including basic principles, technological advancements, advantages, and limitations.

### The physics of magnetic resonance imaging safety [^115TrVua]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging relies on a strong static magnetic field in conjunction with careful orchestration of pulsed linear gradient magnetic fields and radiofrequency magnetic fields in order to generate images. The interaction of these fields with patients as well as materials with magnetic or conducting properties can be a source of risk in the MR environment. This article provides a basic review of the physical underpinnings of the primary risks in MR imaging to foster development of intuition with respect to both patient and risk management in the MR environment.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^115CqsBQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

All substances exert magnetic properties in some extent when placed in an external magnetic field. Magnetic susceptibility represents a measure of the magnitude of magnetization of a certain substance when the external magnetic field is applied. Depending on the tendency to be repelled or attracted by the magnetic field and in the latter case on the magnitude of this effect, materials can be classified as diamagnetic or paramagnetic, superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic, respectively. Knowledge of type and extent of susceptibility of common endogenous and exogenous substances and how their magnetic properties affect the conventional sequences used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help recognize them and exalt or minimize their presence in the acquired images, so as to improve diagnosis in a wide variety of benign and malignant diseases. Furthermore, in the context of diamagnetic susceptibility, chemical shift imaging enables to assess the intra-voxel ratio between water and fat content, analyzing the tissue composition of various organs and allowing a precise fat quantification. The following article reviews the fundamental physical principles of magnetic susceptibility and examines the magnetic properties of the principal endogenous and exogenous substances of interest in MRI, providing potential through representative cases for improved diagnosis in daily clinical routine.

### Cardiovascular magnetic resonance: physics and terminology [^113MPz8y]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the branch of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whose acquisition methods are adapted to surmount the particular challenges caused by motion of the heart and blood in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging is supremely flexible; it can produce images showing the spatial distribution of diverse tissue characteristics, for example, proton density, T(1), T(2), T(2)(⁎), fat concentration, flow rate, and diffusion parameters. The image contrast may usefully be modified by intravenous infusion of contrast agents. Magnetic resonance imaging permits 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional acquisitions with arbitrary slice orientation. Unfortunately, MRI's flexibility is matched by a remarkable complexity not only in its fundamental principles but also in the optimization of applications in the clinic. This article attempts to demystify the basic principles of CMR and provides a primer on the terminology used in CMR. Complete confidence in the principles of CMR is not essential to use the technology. Nevertheless, knowledge of the principal terminology of MRI is a valuable first step when seeking to understand and apply modern methods in a clinical or research setting. Thus, the article closes with a glossary of terminology and references to high-quality educational resources.

### ESR essentials: basic physics of MR safety-practice recommendations by the European society for magnetic resonance in medicine and biology [^111xx3yw]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in modern healthcare is both essential and increasing and often considered as a safe imaging procedure due to the lack of ionizing radiation. However, although there are no known cumulative risks associated with MRI there are several acute risks. To address the safety of patients, personnel, and equipment, an organizational structure including the implementation of strict routines and procedures by everyone involved in the process is required. Here we will focus on the essentials of MRI safety, primarily focusing on the risks related to the three electromagnetic fields in the MRI environment (Zones III and IV), methods for minimizing those risks, and related risk-benefit assessments.

### Progress in MRI is NOT ubiquitous [^113RXFAM]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

There has been tremendous progress in MRI over the past 40+ years, driven by advances in technology as well as human ingenuity, with considerable impact in medicine. However, our understanding of how to account for, and interpret, MRI properties quantitatively lags behind these technical advances. This lack of understanding will limit our ability to make full use of quantitative metrics in the future, and much more work is needed to bridge this knowledge gap.

### Magnetic resonance imaging: fundamental safety issues [^115UHoEQ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Synopsis

Medical practitioners have a variety of imaging modalities at their disposal. The exquisite soft tissue delineation available with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has resulted in the rising utilization of this particular modality. Increasingly, physical therapists around the world are actively involved in not only referring patients with musculoskeletal conditions for MRI but also in the acquisition of MRI data in both the clinical and research arenas. The MRI process involves the use of a very strong static magnetic field, time-varying (gradient) fields, and radiofrequency energy. To ensure the well-being of patients, staff, and visitors, an understanding of the primary hazards of this environment and the rigorous safety procedures that must be followed is imperative to the clinician. This paper describes the basic components of an MRI system, discusses various MRI safety issues, and presents the screening procedure necessary prior to using MRI. Primary hazards associated with the imaging process are also reviewed. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2011;41(11):820–828. doi:10.2519/jospt.2011.3906.

### Magnetic resonance imaging methodology [^116b2XP7]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance (MR) methods are non-invasive techniques to provide detailed, multi-parametric information on human anatomy, function and metabolism. Sensitivity, specificity, spatial and temporal resolution may, however, vary depending on hardware (e.g., field strength, gradient strength and speed) and software (optimised measurement protocols and parameters for the various techniques). Furthermore, multi-modality imaging may enhance specificity to better characterise complex disease patterns.

Objective

Positron emission tomography (PET) is an interesting, largely complementary modality, which might be combined with MR. Despite obvious advantages, combining these rather different physical methods may also pose challenging problems. At this early stage, it seems that PET quality may be preserved in the magnetic field and, if an adequate detector material is used for the PET, MR sensitivity should not be significantly degraded. Again, this may vary for the different MR techniques, whereby functional and metabolic MR is more susceptible than standard anatomical imaging.

Discussion

Here we provide a short introduction to MR basics and MR techniques, also discussing advantages, artefacts and problems when MR hardware and PET detectors are combined. In addition to references for more detailed descriptions of MR fundamentals and applications, we provide an early outlook on this novel and exciting multi-modality approach to PET/MR.

### Application of basic physics principles to clinical neuroradiology: differentiating artifacts from true pathology on MRI [^111vBubB]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This article outlines artifactual findings commonly encountered in neuroradiologic MRI studies and offers clues to differentiate them from true pathology on the basis of their physical properties. Basic MR physics concepts are used to shed light on the causes of these artifacts.

Conclusion

MRI is one of the most commonly used techniques in neuroradiology. Unfortunately, MRI is prone to image distortion and artifacts that can be difficult to identify. Using the provided case illustrations, practical clues, and relevant physical applications, radiologists may devise algorithms to troubleshoot these artifacts.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^115ufw9V]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomenon discovered and described simultaneously and independently in January 1946 by two teams led by Felix Bloch at Stanford and Edward Mills Purcell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively. For their discovery, Bloch and Purcell were awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.

The idea of MRI was the brainchild of Dr. Raymond Damadian, who prefigured the possibility of using NMR to discriminate between malignant tumors and normal tissue in 1971. Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield further developed MRI, and in 2003 they both received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

MRI provides information on anatomy and physiological processes using strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the body. More precisely, but in a very simple way, MRI can be defined as a grayscale map of the content of hydrogen protons and of their interactions with the surrounding atomic and molecular tissue environment.

In this review, we examine both theoretically and practically the effects of magnetic properties, and specifically of magnetic susceptibility, of human tissues and various endogenous and exogenous substances on MRI. We discuss the implication of these properties on daily MRI practice so as to obtain, exploiting at best MR sequences, high-quality images, thus potentially improving diagnosis and patients' healthcare.

A complete description of the physical basis of MRI is beyond the scope of this article and has been extensively reviewed in numerous papers. However, some basic concepts of MRI physics will be briefly retrieved for the purposes of discussion.

### Diffusion and perfusion MRI: basic physics [^114RMopE]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Diffusion and perfusion MR imaging are now being used increasingly in neuro-vascular clinical applications. While diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging exploits the translational mobility of water molecules to obtain information on the microscopic behaviour of the tissues (presence of macromolecules, presence and permeability of membranes, equilibrium intracellular-extracellular water, ellipsis), perfusion weighted imaging makes use of endogenous and exogenous tracers for monitoring their hemodynamic status. The combination of both techniques is extremely promising for the early detection and assessment of stroke, for tumor characterisation and for the evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases. This article provides a brief review of the basic physics principles underlying the methodologies followed.

### Optimizing MRI of small joints and extremities [^114YSBbF]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Obtaining optimal images of small joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be technically challenging. The aim of this review is to outline the practical aspects of MRI of small joints, with reference to the underlying physical principles. Although the most important contribution to successful imaging of small joints comes from the magnet field strength and design of the receiver coil, there are a number of factors to balance including the signal-to-noise ratio, image resolution, and acquisition times. We discuss strategies to minimize artefacts from movement, inhomogeneity, chemical shift, and fat suppression. As with all MRI, each strategy comes at a price, but the benefits and costs of each approach can be fine-tuned to each combination of joint, receiver coil, and MRI machine.

### Benefits and risks… [^112kASfq]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Benefits An MRI scanner can be used to take images of any part of the body, in any imaging direction. MRI provides better soft tissue contrast than CT and can differentiate better between fat, water, muscle, and other soft tissue than CT. These images provide information to physicians and can be useful in diagnosing a wide variety of diseases and conditions. Risks MR images are made without using any ionizing radiation, so patients are not exposed to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. But while there are no known health hazards from temporary exposure to the MR environment, the MR environment involves a strong, static magnetic field, a magnetic field that changes with time, and radiofrequency energy, each of which carry specific safety concerns:

- The strong, static magnetic field will attract magnetic objects and may cause damage to the scanner or injury to the patient or medical professionals if those objects become projectiles. Careful screening of people and objects entering the MR environment is critical to ensure nothing enters the magnet area that may become a projectile.
- The magnetic fields that change with time create loud knocking noises which may harm hearing if adequate ear protection is not used. They may also cause peripheral muscle or nerve stimulation that may feel like a twitching sensation.
- The radiofrequency energy used during the MRI scan could lead to heating of the body. The potential for heating is greater during long MRI examinations. To produce good quality images, patients must generally remain very still throughout the entire MRI procedure.

Infants, small children, and other patients who are unable to lay still may need to be sedated or anesthetized for the procedure. Sedation and anesthesia carry risks not specific to the MRI procedure, such as slowed or difficult breathing, and low blood pressure.
- The strong, static magnetic field of the MRI scanner will pull on magnetic materials and may cause unwanted movement of the medical device.
- The radiofrequency energy and magnetic fields that change with time may cause heating of the implanted medical device and the surrounding tissue, which could lead to burns.
- The magnetic fields and radiofrequency energy produced by an MRI scanner may also cause electrically active medical devices to malfunction, which can result in a failure of the device to deliver the intended therapy.

### Multidimensional correlation MRI [^113ZuVaH]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Multidimensional correlation spectroscopy is emerging as a novel MRI modality that is well suited for microstructure and microdynamic imaging studies, especially of biological specimens. Conventional MRI methods only provide voxel-averaged and mostly macroscopically averaged information; these methods cannot disentangle intra-voxel heterogeneity on the basis of both water mobility and local chemical interactions. By correlating multiple MR contrast mechanisms and processing the data in an integrated manner, correlation spectroscopy is able to resolve the distribution of water populations according to their chemical and physical interactions with the environment. The use of a non-parametric, phenomenological representation of the multidimensional MR signal makes no assumptions about tissue structure, thereby allowing the study of microscopic structure and composition of complex heterogeneous biological systems. However, until recently, vast data requirements have confined these types of measurement to non-localized NMR applications and prevented them from being widely and successfully used in conjunction with imaging. Recent groundbreaking advancements have allowed this powerful NMR methodology to be migrated to MRI, initiating its emergence as a promising imaging approach. This review is not intended to cover the entire field of multidimensional MR; instead, it focuses on pioneering imaging applications and the challenges involved. In addition, the background and motivation that have led to multidimensional correlation MR development are discussed, along with the basic underlying mathematical concepts. The goal of the present work is to provide the reader with a fundamental understanding of the techniques developed and their potential benefits, and to provide guidance to help refine future applications of this technology.

### AAPM / RSNA physics tutorial for residents: fundamental physics of MR imaging [^114XNVA3]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Learning the basic concepts required to understand magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a straightforward process. Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of MR imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets MR images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences.

### Multiparametric imaging analysis: magnetic resonance spectroscopy [^117MfLWV]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a magnetic resonance-based imaging modality that allows noninvasive sampling of metabolic changes in normal and abnormal brain parenchyma. MRS is particularly useful in the differentiation of developmental or non-neoplastic disorders from neoplastic processes. MRS is also useful during routine imaging follow-up after radiation treatment or during antiangiogenic treatment and for predicting outcomes and treatment response. The objective of this article is to provide a concise but thorough review of the basic physical principles, important applications of MRS in brain tumor imaging, and future directions.

### Fundamentals of diffusion MRI physics [^117XgHaP]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

Diffusion MRI is commonly considered the "engine" for probing the cellular structure of living biological tissues. The difficulty of this task is threefold. First, in structurally heterogeneous media, diffusion is related to structure in quite a complicated way. The challenge of finding diffusion metrics for a given structure is equivalent to other problems in physics that have been known for over a century. Second, in most cases the MRI signal is related to diffusion in an indirect way dependent on the measurement technique used. Third, finding the cellular structure given the MRI signal is an ill-posed inverse problem. This paper reviews well-established knowledge that forms the basis for responding to the first two challenges. The inverse problem is briefly discussed and the reader is warned about a number of pitfalls on the way.

Common causes of MR-accidents

Most of the reported incidents in Sweden involve projectile accidents, and the most often reported MR incidents in the USA and UK are tissue burns. However, and this is important to realize, there appears to be a very large degree of under-reporting. The reasons for this are unclear as in most parts of the world it is a legal requirement to report all incidents, regardless of severity. See Figs. 2 and 3 for an overview of concerns regarding the consequences of improper use of MRI.

### Fast quantitative MRI as a nonlinear tomography problem [^1136gZ94]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on a two-steps approach: estimation of the magnetic moments distribution inside the body, followed by a voxel-by-voxel quantification of the human tissue properties. This splitting simplifies the computations but poses several constraints on the measurement process, limiting its efficiency. Here, we perform quantitative MRI as a one step process; signal localization and parameter quantification are simultaneously obtained by the solution of a large scale nonlinear inversion problem based on first-principles. As a consequence, the constraints on the measurement process can be relaxed and acquisition schemes that are time efficient and widely available in clinical MRI scanners can be employed. We show that the nonlinear tomography approach is applicable to MRI and returns human tissue maps from very short experiments.

### Mapping the microscale origins of magnetic resonance image contrast with subcellular diamond magnetometry [^112Yu6wX]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used biomedical imaging modality, with millions of scans performed each year for medical diagnosis, human neuroscience research, and studies in animal models. The contrast seen in MRI images is strongly influenced by microscale magnetic field gradients in cells and tissues, produced by endogenous substances such as blood, cellular iron deposits, or molecular-imaging agents such as iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) –. The precise dependence of voxel-scale (~0.5 mm) MRI contrast on the microscale magnetic field has been a topic of intense theory and simulation due to its importance for disease diagnosis and contrast agent design. These studies predict, for example, that the spatial frequency of the local magnetic field can significantly impact the T 2 relaxation rate of a tissue, and that optimizing contrast agent size can maximize T 2 contrast for a given set of material and imaging parameters. However, despite its significance for biological imaging, the relationship between microscopic magnetic field patterns in tissue and T 2 relaxation has not been studied experimentally due to a lack of effective methods to map magnetic fields at the microscale under biologically relevant conditions.

### Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: a review of the dangers and difficulties in MR scanning and attempts to improve safety [^114y9rJw]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has steadily increased in use worldwide. We believe that there is a foreseeable increase in the number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) who will require a MRI. An estimated 75% of patients with CIEDs will have an indication requiring MRI during their lifetime.

This review article discusses the safe use of MRI in patients who have implanted CIEDs. Radiologists should have a basic grasp of the principles behind the re-design and engineering of these devices, once considered to be an absolute contraindication to scanning.

The known hazards of MRI unsafe CIEDs are described, followed by guidelines on safe use, indications and limitations of imaging patients with MR conditional CIEDs, including a brief pictorial essay of the radiographic features of these devices.

Finally, we also offer steps to facilitate the safe scanning of patients with MR conditional CIEDs in the form of a proposed guideline, which was adopted in our institution, and a contingency plan if an inadvertent MR scan of a patient with a MRI unsafe CIED should occur. These have been ratified by the authors' institutional medical board review process and have been implemented successfully at the time of writing.

What are MRI safe devices?

Implants, devices or materials should routinely undergo evaluation prior to a MRI procedure if known, and are categorized as safe, conditional or unsafe.

Safe devices are safe within the MR environment. The object is usually made from non-ferromagnetic components. There are no MR safe cardiovascular implantable devices at the time of writing.

Conditional devices are safe for the patient undergoing MRI only if specific conditions are met. This is usually often due to the presence of a weakly ferromagnetic component in the implantable device. Current recommendations support safe scanning at 1.5 T although several studies with scanning at 3 T exists.

Unsafe devices pose potential risk(s) to an individual in the MR environment, for which the physical concepts are discussed below.

### On modeling [^112qq7na]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Mapping tissue microstructure with MRI holds great promise as a noninvasive window into tissue organization at the cellular level. Having originated within the realm of diffusion NMR in the late 1970s, this field is experiencing an exponential growth in the number of publications. At the same time, model-based approaches are also increasingly incorporated into advanced MRI acquisition and reconstruction techniques. However, after about two decades of intellectual and financial investment, microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow progress in clinical translation may signify unresolved fundamental problems. We outline such problems and related practical pitfalls, as well as review strategies for developing and validating tissue microstructure models, to provoke a discussion on how to bridge the gap between our scientific aspirations and the clinical reality. We argue for recalibrating the efforts of our community toward a more systematic focus on fundamental research aimed at identifying relevant degrees of freedom affecting the measured MR signal. Such a focus is essential for realizing the truly revolutionary potential of noninvasive three-dimensional in vivo microstructural mapping.

### PET / MRI of central nervous system: current status and future perspective [^111pwJnV]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Imaging plays an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis, prognosis prediction and therapy response evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The newly emerging hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) can perform "one-stop-shop" evaluation, including anatomic, functional, biochemical and metabolic information, even at the molecular level, for personalised diagnoses and treatments of CNS diseases. However, there are still several problems to be resolved, such as appropriate PET detectors, attenuation correction and so on. This review will introduce the basic physical principles of PET/MRI and its potential clinical applications in the CNS. We also provide the future perspectives for this field.

Key Points

- PET/MRI can simultaneously provide anatomic, functional, biochemical and metabolic information.
- PET/MRI has promising potential in various central nervous system diseases.
- Research on the future implementation of PET/MRI is challenging and encouraging.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^1134fX2z]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The main diamagnetic, paramagnetic, superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic substances of interest in MRI are listed in Table 1. It is important to recall that electron clouds (not nuclei) of atoms and molecules primarily determine magnetic susceptibility of a material. Atomic or molecular orbitals containing paired electrons contribute to diamagnetism; orbitals with unpaired electrons contribute to para-, super- and ferro-magnetism.

Table 1
Principal endogenous and exogenous substances, listed according to their magnetic susceptibility

Other types of magnetism exist, such as ferrimagnetism, antiferromagnetism and metamagnetism, but are of no interest in MRI, and consequently not further considered in this review.

We are now going to discuss the magnetic properties of the primary endogenous and exogenous substances of interest in MRI and how their magnetism influences MR signal, providing numerous examples and focusing on clinical aspects, especially covering less known or less reported applications.

Subsequently, we will examine the principal MRI sequences that can be used to exalt or reduce these phenomena depending on the clinical context, including some practical issues to help radiologists optimize their use and avoid potential errors in interpretation.

### Application of basic principles of physics to head and neck MR angiography: troubleshooting for artifacts [^115ux5sK]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Neurovascular imaging studies are routinely used for the assessment of headaches and changes in mental status, stroke workup, and evaluation of the arteriovenous structures of the head and neck. These imaging studies are being performed with greater frequency as the aging population continues to increase. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic imaging techniques are helpful in this setting. However, mastering these techniques requires an in-depth understanding of the basic principles of physics, complex flow patterns, and the correlation of MR angiographic findings with conventional MR imaging findings. More than one imaging technique may be used to solve difficult cases, with each technique contributing unique information. Unfortunately, incorporating findings obtained with multiple imaging modalities may add to the diagnostic challenge. To ensure diagnostic accuracy, it is essential that the radiologist carefully evaluate the details provided by these modalities in light of basic physics principles, the fundamentals of various imaging techniques, and common neurovascular imaging pitfalls.

### Magnetic resonance imaging T1-and T2-mapping to assess renal structure and function: a systematic review and statement paper [^112xQDtq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETIC RELAXATION MECHANISMS

MRI is a non-invasive technique to map the human body using the interaction of three magnetic fields: (i) a strong static field (B 0 or main magnet) to magnetize the whole sample and to allow the signal to be measured; (ii) gradient coils producing three (G x, y, z) linear, orthogonal gradients to allow the signal to be registered in space; and (iii) a dynamic radio frequency (RF) field (B 1 or excitation field) to change steady-state magnetization produced by B 0 and to enable the readout of the measured signal (using an appropriately frequency-tuned coil or antenna).

When subjects are placed inside the MRI scanner, nuclear spins align with B 0 (Figure 1a and b). The application of an RF pulse (B 1; usually in the range of milliseconds and millitesla) changes this macroscopic magnetization and proton spins are perturbed (i.e. tipped away from B 0). RF pulses are named after their effect on the net magnetization vector, i.e. an RF pulse tilting the net magnetization vector by 90° from the z direction (B 0) into the x / y plane is called a 90° pulse and a 180° pulse inverts the magnetization vector (i.e. z to −z; Figure 1a and b). The return of the tipped net magnetic vector to the steady-state equilibrium along the B 0 axis and the decay of net transverse magnetization, respectively, are two independent processes that can be measured; namely spin–lattice (T 1) and spin–spin (T 2) relaxation time. T 1 and T 2 relaxation times are characteristic for the tissue composition (i.e. local microstructural magnetochemical environment) and provide the main sources of tissue contrast in morphological MRI.

### Review of key concepts in magnetic resonance physics [^115VtrBw]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

MR physics can be a challenging subject for practicing pediatric radiologists. Although many excellent texts provide very comprehensive reviews of the field of MR physics at various levels of understanding, the authors of this paper explain several key concepts in MR physics that are germane to clinical practice in a non-rigorous but practical fashion. With the basic understanding of these key concepts, practicing pediatric radiologists can build on their knowledge of current clinical MR techniques and future advances in MR applications. Given the challenges of both the increased need for rapid imaging in non-sedated children and the rapid physiological cardiovascular and respiratory motion in pediatric patients, many advances in complex MR techniques are being applied to imaging these children. The key concepts are as follows: (1) structure of a pulse sequence, (2) k-space, (3) "trade-off triangle" and (4) fat suppression. This review is the first of five manuscripts in a minisymposium on pediatric MR. The authors' goal for this review is to aid in understanding the MR techniques described in the subsequent manuscripts on brain imaging and body imaging in this minisymposium.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^114gra83]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Types of magnetism

All substances, including human tissues, exhibit some form of magnetism, which is the distortion that a substance immersed in a magnetic field causes on the magnetic field itself.

In electromagnetism, the magnetic susceptibility (symbolized by the Greek letter χ) is a quantitative measure indicating the magnitude of magnetization of a material when an external magnetic field is applied.

The magnetic susceptibility (χ) of a material, which is a dimensionless quantity, is defined by the following equation:where M is the magnetization of the material (quantity of magnetic moment per unit volume), and H is the magnetic field strength, both measured in ampere (A)/meter (m). In MRI, a strictly connected term, magnetizability, is used, which is the ratio of magnetization to magnetic flux density (i.e. the strength of the applied magnetic field B 0, measured in Tesla (T)). For the purposes of this review article, susceptibility and magnetizability will be considered equivalent terms.

Four fundamental types of interaction between magnetic fields and matter exist, which define the magnetic characteristics of substances, dividing them into two groups: on the one hand, diamagnetic substances, which have negative susceptibility (χ < 0) and tend to be repelled by the magnetic field; on the other hand, paramagnetic, superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, which have positive susceptibility (χ > 0) and tend to be attracted by the magnetic field. Specifically, we consider:
Diamagnetism: where χ is slightly negative, in the order of 10–6;
Paramagnetism: where χ is positive and typically in the range of 10–5 –10–3. The magnitude of this susceptibility is less than 0.1% of that of ferromagnetic materials;
Superparamagnetism: where magnetic susceptibility is much larger than the one of paramagnets, but lower compared to ferromagnetic materials;
Ferromagnetism: where χ is positive and extremely large, typically greater than 100.

### Understanding and manipulating the RF fields at high field MRI [^111a2eHm]. NMR in Biomedicine (2009). Low credibility.

This paper presents a complete overview of the electromagnetics (radiofrequency aspect) of MRI at low and high fields. Using analytical formulations, numerical modeling (computational electromagnetics), and ultrahigh field imaging experiments, the physics that impacts the electromagnetic quantities associated with MRI, namely (1) the transmit field, (2) receive field, and (3) total electromagnetic power absorption, is analyzed. The physical interpretation of the above-mentioned quantities is investigated by electromagnetic theory, to understand 'What happens, in terms of electromagnetics, when operating at different static field strengths?' Using experimental studies and numerical simulations, this paper also examines the physical and technological feasibilities by which all or any of these specified electromagnetic quantities can be manipulated through techniques such as B(1) shimming (phased array excitation) and signal combination using a receive array in order to advance MRI at high field strengths. Pertinent to this subject and with highly coupled coils operating at 7 T, this paper also presents the first phantom work on B(1) shimming without B(1) measurements.

### Magnetic resonance water tracer imaging using 17 O-labeled water [^1161fq7D]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial imaging technique for visualizing water in living organisms. Besides proton MRI, which is widely available and enables direct visualization of intrinsic water distribution and dynamics in various environments, MR-WTI (MR water tracer imaging) using 17 O-labeled water has been developed, benefiting from the many advancements in MRI software and hardware that have substantially improved the signal-to-noise ratio and made possible faster imaging. This cutting-edge technique allows the generation of novel and valuable images for clinical use. This review elucidates the studies related to MRI water tracer techniques centered around 17 O-labeled water, explaining the fundamental principles of imaging and providing clinical application examples. Anticipating continued progress in studies involving isotope-labeled water, this review is expected to contribute to elucidating the pathophysiology of various diseases related to water dynamics abnormalities and establishing novel imaging diagnostic methods for associated diseases.

### Calculation of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and their effects in MRI of human subjects [^117C1J1C]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency magnetic fields are critical to nuclear excitation and signal reception in magnetic resonance imaging. The interactions between these fields and human tissues in anatomical geometries results in a variety of effects regarding image integrity and safety of the human subject. In recent decades, numerical methods of calculation have been used increasingly to understand the effects of these interactions and aid in engineering better, faster, and safer equipment and methods. As magnetic resonance imaging techniques and technology have evolved through the years, so to have the requirements for meaningful interpretation of calculation results. Here, we review the basic physics of radiofrequency electromagnetics in magnetic resonance imaging and discuss a variety of ways radiofrequency field calculations are used in magnetic resonance imaging in engineering and safety assurance from simple systems and sequences through advanced methods of development for the future.

### MR pulse sequences: what every radiologist wants to know but is afraid to ask [^111sznH1]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

The use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is growing exponentially, in part because of the excellent anatomic and pathologic detail provided by the modality and because of recent technologic advances that have led to faster acquisition times. Radiology residents now are introduced in their 1st year of training to the MR pulse sequences routinely used in clinical imaging, including various spin-echo, gradient-echo, inversion-recovery, echo-planar imaging, and MR angiographic sequences. However, to make optimal use of these techniques, radiologists also need a basic knowledge of the physics of MR imaging, including T1 recovery, T2 and T2✱ decay, repetition time, echo time, and chemical shift effects. In addition, an understanding of contrast weighting is very helpful to obtain better depiction of specific tissues for the diagnosis of various pathologic processes.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast [^112Zhszh]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

Breast MRI — intended uses and interpretation context are defined, stating that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is a useful tool for the detection and characterization of breast cancer, assessment of local disease extent, evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment response, and guidance for biopsy and localization. MRI findings should be correlated with the clinical history, physical examination findings, and results of any recent breast imaging. The document's scope clarifies that Practice Parameters and Technical Standards are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and are not intended, nor should they be used, to establish a legal standard of care, and that the ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure or course of action must be made by the practitioner considering all the circumstances presented.

### Geometric constraints on human brain function [^115cMqDx]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The anatomy of the brain necessarily constrains its function, but precisely how remains unclear. The classical and dominant paradigm in neuroscience is that neuronal dynamics are driven by interactions between discrete, functionally specialized cell populations connected by a complex array of axonal fibres –. However, predictions from neural field theory, an established mathematical framework for modelling large-scale brain activity –, suggest that the geometry of the brain may represent a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity. Here, we confirm these theoretical predictions by analysing human magnetic resonance imaging data acquired under spontaneous and diverse task-evoked conditions. Specifically, we show that cortical and subcortical activity can be parsimoniously understood as resulting from excitations of fundamental, resonant modes of the brain's geometry (that is, its shape) rather than from modes of complex interregional connectivity, as classically assumed. We then use these geometric modes to show that task-evoked activations across over 10,000 brain maps are not confined to focal areas, as widely believed, but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning over 60 mm. Finally, we confirm predictions that the close link between geometry and function is explained by a dominant role for wave-like activity, showing that wave dynamics can reproduce numerous canonical spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous and evoked recordings. Our findings challenge prevailing views and identify a previously underappreciated role of geometry in shaping function, as predicted by a unifying and physically principled model of brain-wide dynamics.

### Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM): decoding MRI data for a tissue magnetic biomarker [^112PoNi8]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In MRI, the main magnetic field polarizes the electron cloud of a molecule, generating a chemical shift for observer protons within the molecule and a magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity field for observer protons outside the molecule. The number of water protons surrounding a molecule for detecting its magnetic susceptibility is vastly greater than the number of protons within the molecule for detecting its chemical shift. However, the study of tissue magnetic susceptibility has been hindered by poor molecular specificities of hitherto used methods based on MRI signal phase and T2✱ contrast, which depend convolutedly on surrounding susceptibility sources. Deconvolution of the MRI signal phase can determine tissue susceptibility but is challenged by the lack of MRI signal in the background and by the zeroes in the dipole kernel. Recently, physically meaningful regularizations, including the Bayesian approach, have been developed to enable accurate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for studying iron distribution, metabolic oxygen consumption, blood degradation, calcification, demyelination, and other pathophysiological susceptibility changes, as well as contrast agent biodistribution in MRI. This paper attempts to summarize the basic physical concepts and essential algorithmic steps in QSM, to describe clinical and technical issues under active development, and to provide references, codes, and testing data for readers interested in QSM.

### New technologies for human cancer imaging [^113BzhvR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite technical advances in many areas of diagnostic radiology, the detection and imaging of human cancer remains poor. A meaningful impact on cancer screening, staging, and treatment is unlikely to occur until the tumor-to-background ratio improves by three to four orders of magnitude (ie, 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold), which in turn will require proportional improvements in sensitivity and contrast agent targeting. This review analyzes the physics and chemistry of cancer imaging and highlights the fundamental principles underlying the detection of malignant cells within a background of normal cells. The use of various contrast agents and radiotracers for cancer imaging is reviewed, as are the current limitations of ultrasound, x-ray imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography (PET), and optical imaging. Innovative technologies are emerging that hold great promise for patients, such as positron emission mammography of the breast and spectroscopy-enhanced colonoscopy for cancer screening, hyperpolarization MRI and time-of-flight PET for staging, and ion beam-induced PET scanning and near-infrared fluorescence-guided surgery for cancer treatment. This review explores these emerging technologies and considers their potential impact on clinical care. Finally, those cancers that are currently difficult to image and quantify, such as ovarian cancer and acute leukemia, are discussed.

### An introduction to coil array design for parallel MRI [^116wkjs4]. NMR in Biomedicine (2006). Low credibility.

The basic principles of radiofrequency coil array design for parallel MRI are described from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Because parallel MRI techniques rely on coil array sensitivities to provide spatial information about the sample, a careful choice of array design is essential. The concepts of coil array spatial encoding are first discussed from four qualitative perspectives. These qualitative descriptions include using coil arrays to emulate spatial harmonics, choosing coils with selective sensitivities to aliased pixels, using coil sensitivities with broad k-space reception profiles, and relying on detector coils to provide a set of generalized projections of the sample. This qualitative discussion is followed by a quantitative analysis of coil arrays, which is discussed in terms of the baseline SNR of the received images as well as the noise amplifications (g-factor) in the reconstructed data. The complications encountered during the experimental evaluation of coil array SNR are discussed, and solutions are proposed. A series of specific array designs are reviewed, with an emphasis on the general design considerations that motivate each approach. Finally, a set of special topics is discussed, which reflect issues that have become important, especially as arrays are being designed for more high-performance applications of parallel MRI. These topics include concerns about the depth penetration of arrays composed of small elements, the use of adaptive arrays for systems with limited receiver channels, the management of inductive coupling between array elements, and special considerations required at high field strengths. The fundamental limits of spatial encoding using coil arrays are discussed, with a primary emphasis on how the determination of these limits impacts the design of optimized arrays. This review is intended to provide insight into how arrays are currently used for parallel MRI and to place into context the new innovations that are to come.

### Low-field magnetic resonance imaging: its history and renaissance [^113dHEuJ]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems have seen a renaissance recently due to improvements in technology (both hardware and software). Originally, the performance of low-field MRI systems was rated lower than their actual clinical usefulness, and they were viewed as low-cost but poorly performing systems. However, various applications similar to high-field MRI systems (1.5 T and 3 T) have gradually become possible, culminating with high-performance low-field MRI systems and their adaptations now being proposed that have unique advantages over high-field MRI systems in various aspects. This review article describes the physical characteristics of low-field MRI systems and presents both their advantages and disadvantages for clinical use (past to present), along with their cutting-edge clinical applications.

### Understanding different aspects of blood supply of uterine fibroids: an overview of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging techniques [^112u1C5h]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging

A range of imaging modalities are available for the visualization of fibroid's vasculature, blood flow, and mobility of water molecules in the extravascular space. To adequately utilize these imaging modalities, it is pivotal to weigh in the subtle differences in the meaning of terms such as vascularization, perfusion and diffusion (Table 1), as well as the physics underlying the imaging principles.

As ultrasound and MRI are the most commonly applied imaging modalities in fibroids, their available options will be outlined in this section and Table 2 for the visualization and measurement of a fibroid's vasculature, blood flow, and tissue microstructure.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^116xfogS]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

When an external magnetic field is applied, all substances (both endogenous and exogenous) are influenced by, and in turn influence, the magnetic field itself. A measure of the magnitude of magnetization of the substance is provided by magnetic susceptibility.

Diamagnetic substances, which comprise most of biological tissues, tend to be repelled by the magnetic field. An example of diamagnetic susceptibility interactions at molecular level is offered by chemical shift imaging, which, exploiting minimal variations in precession frequency of protons belonging to different molecules, allows to explore the relative ratio between water and fat content within a voxel, thus giving valid support in the diagnosis and characterization of common and uncommon pathologies in MRI in both a qualitative and quantitative way.

Paramagnetic, superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic substances include a wide range of endogenous and exogenous materials which are attracted by the applied magnetic field. Knowledge of these substances, of their magnetic properties and of the effect of these properties on the most commonly used sequences in MRI can help practitioners leverage at best the different sequences in order to identify these substances (even when they are present in minimal quantities), to differentiate them when possible and to enhance or reduce the artifacts they create depending on the clinical scenario.

### Effects of computerized cognitive training on neuroimaging outcomes in older adults: a systematic review [^116mDhCt]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Cognitive training is based on the notion that the brain, even with age, can change for the better, if given the appropriate environmental stimuli, thoughts, and emotions. This capacity of the brain is called "neuroplasticity". In the same way that physical training improves physical abilities, cognitive training (or brain training) may induce neuroplastic changes in the brain, resulting in improved cognitive abilities. One of the fundamental principles of neuroplasticity is the concept of synaptic plasticity – the notion that individual connections within the brain are constantly being removed or recreated, largely dependent upon how they are used. Cognitive training aims to harness this principle of neuroplasticity by using guided practice on a set of tasks related to memory, attention, or other cognitive processes.

To gain more insight in what potential neuroplastic changes CCT may induce; incorporating different neuroimaging techniques in studies could be a good approach to help demonstrate these changes in the brain. For example, synaptic plasticity as a result of stimulation by CCT could potentially be captured by functional connectivity, measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), by strengthening connections within and between networks. To date, it is not well established how CCT impacts regional brain volume, functional activity, and functional or structural connectivity in older adults. Although work has been done among younger adults illustrating changes in functional activity in the middle frontal gyrus and superior and inferior parietal cortices after working memory training, these findings don't necessarily translate to an older adult population. Therefore, gaps remain in understanding the underlying mechanisms of training-induced neuroplasticity in older adults. Addressing this knowledge void, this systematic review aims to ascertain the mechanisms by which CCT exerts an impact on brain structure and function by using different neuroimaging techniques such as volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), task-based functional MRI (fMRI), rsfMRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Through understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of CCT, our goal is to provide knowledge on how to design improved and targeted interventions that help combat or prevent cognitive decline throughout life.

### The prospects for high resolution optical brain imaging: the magnetic resonance perspective [^115XJYDH]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

Various analogs of NMR and MRI are now technically possible in optics; specifically, high-resolution laser-pulse shaping and complex pulse sequence generation with well-defined phase shifts has been demonstrated.

### NMR at very low fields [^1125sGNo]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Although nuclear magnetic resonance in low fields around or below the Earth's magnetic field is almost as old as nuclear magnetic resonance itself, the recent years have experienced a revival of this technique that is opposed to the common trend towards higher and higher fields. The background of this development is the expectation that the low-field domain may open a new window for the study of molecular structure and dynamics. Here, we will give an overview on the specific features in the low-field domain, both from the technical and from the physical point of view. In addition, we present a short passage on the option of magnetic resonance imaging in fields of the micro-Tesla range.

### MR elastography in cancer [^1152yRYi]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The mechanical traits of cancer include abnormally high solid stress as well as drastic and spatially heterogeneous changes in intrinsic mechanical tissue properties. Whereas solid stress elicits mechanosensory signals promoting tumor progression, mechanical heterogeneity is conducive to cell unjamming and metastatic spread. This reductionist view of tumorigenesis and malignant transformation provides a generalized framework for understanding the physical principles of tumor aggressiveness and harnessing them as novel in vivo imaging markers. Magnetic resonance elastography is an emerging imaging technology for depicting the viscoelastic properties of biological soft tissues and clinically characterizing tumors in terms of their biomechanical properties. This review article presents recent technical developments, basic results, and clinical applications of magnetic resonance elastography in patients with malignant tumors.

### Human brain networks function in connectome-specific harmonic waves [^112eEjKr]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Fundamentals of natural processes are expressed by physical laws, quantitative relationships among measured properties that are always true. Although the discovery of the mechanisms of neuronal excitation provided a milestone in explaining single neuron behaviour, a fundamental principle underlying the collective neural dynamics has remained largely elusive.

A characteristic feature of cortical dynamics in mammals is the emergence of behaviour-dependent oscillatory networks spanning five orders of magnitude in the frequency domain. Recently, strong temporal correlation within widely distributed cortical regions has also been discovered in spontaneous slow (< 0.1 Hz) fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This discovery revealed that spontaneous activity, in the absence of any external stimuli or task condition, also exhibits highly structured correlation patterns throughout the brain. Remarkably, the topography of these correlation patterns, termed the resting state networks (RSNs), closely resembles the functional networks of the human brain identified by various sensory, motor and cognitive paradigmsand have been found to relate to electroencephalography microstates, global brain states occurring in discrete epochs of about 100 ms (refs).

### Theoretical models of the diffusion weighted MR signal [^112BhACW]. NMR in Biomedicine (2010). Low credibility.

Diffusion MRI plays a very important role in studying biological tissue structure and functioning both in health and disease. Proper interpretation of experimental data requires development of theoretical models that connect the diffusion MRI signal to salient features of tissue microstructure at the cellular level. In this review, we present some models (mostly, relevant to the brain) for describing diffusion attenuated MR signals. These range from the simplest approach, where the signal is described in terms of an apparent diffusion coefficient, to rather complicated models, where consideration is given to signals originating from extra- and intracellular spaces and where account is taken of the specific geometry and orientation distribution of cells. To better understand the characteristics of the diffusion attenuated MR signal arising from the complex structure of whole tissue, it is instructive to appreciate first the characteristics of the signal arising from simple single-cell-like structures. For this purpose, we also present here a theoretical analysis of models allowing exact analytical calculation of the MR signal, specifically, a single-compartment model with impermeable boundaries and a periodic structure of identical cells separated by permeable membranes. Such pure theoretical models give important insights into mechanisms contributing to the MR signal formation in the presence of diffusion. In this review we targeted both scientists just entering the MR field and more experienced MR researchers interested in applying diffusion methods to study biological tissues.

Introduction to the MR environment, particularly inside the bore of the scanner

The MR environment consists of an extremely strong static magnetic field (B 0) that is always present. In most clinical MR scanners, the static magnetic field strength is either 1.5 T or 3 T, but both higher and lower field strengths exist. Due to the strong static magnetic field, the scanner room (also known as the examination room or magnet room) needs to be a strictly controlled area and only authorized persons should have access. Authorized persons are those who have undergone specific MR safety training. During scanning, two complementary electromagnetic fields are utilized, the time-varying gradient field (dB/dt) and a radiofrequency field (B 1 or RF), each associated with different hazards. These two latter fields are primarily of concern for the patient since they do not reach very far outside of the scanner bore, but nonetheless, safety measures need to be taken.

The length of the electromagnetic coil that generates the strong static magnetic field in the MRI scanner approaches the length of the magnet housing. The gradient coils for generating the time-varying dB/dt in three orthogonal directions (x, y, and z) are somewhat shorter. Finally, the innermost coil in the "magnet" is the built-in RF coil (also known as the "body coil" or the "quadrature body coil", the "QBC"). The length of the B 1 -coil is typically 50–70 cm in conventional clinical scanners. In the following sections, we discuss each of these electromagnetic fields separately, with a specific perspective on the safety aspects.

### What are normal relaxation times of tissues at 3 T? [^115KzHgU]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The T 1 and T 2 relaxation times are the basic parameters behind magnetic resonance imaging. The accurate knowledge of the T 1 and T 2 values of tissues allows to perform quantitative imaging and to develop and optimize magnetic resonance sequences. A vast extent of methods and sequences has been developed to calculate the T 1 and T 2 relaxation times of different tissues in diverse centers. Surprisingly, a wide range of values has been reported for similar tissues (e.g. T 1 of white matter from 699 to 1735ms and T 2 of fat from 41 to 371ms), and the true values that represent each specific tissue are still unclear, which have deterred their common use in clinical diagnostic imaging. This article presents a comprehensive review of the reported relaxation times in the literature in vivo at 3T for a large span of tissues. It gives a detailed analysis of the different methods and sequences used to calculate the relaxation times, and it explains the reasons of the spread of reported relaxation times values in the literature.

### Low-field magnetic resonance imaging: its history and renaissance [^117TejDQ]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Imaging techniques and images in low-field MRI systems are currently more advanced than is commonly recognized. Since the late 1990s, various applications, such as contrast-enhanced MRA and DWI, have become possible. Moreover, it should also be understood that the physical characteristics of low-field systems make them superior to high-field MRI in many ways (eg, T1-shortening effects and low-magnetic-susceptibility artifacts associated with the static field strength). Recent advanced techniques, such as the use of powered gradients, sophisticated radiofrequency coils, and optimized sequences, have shown that the static field strength itself does not necessarily need to be high. In addition, with the recent remarkable developments in deep learning techniques, noise due to low static field strengths can be removed more effectively than before. Clinically, the fundamental value of MRI lies in tissue contrast information, which cannot be replaced by other modalities, such as CT. For this reason, the strength of the static magnetic field and cost are important issues. Overall, we believe that low-field MRI systems will continue to develop and become more widespread in the future.

### The physical basis of diffusion-weighted MRI [^117WPwmw]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only technique that permits a non-invasive in vivo assessment of water molecular diffusion, which reflects tissue configuration at a microscopic level. Therefore, this technique appears to be particularly useful in monitoring brain abnormalities. However, the quantitative measurement of diffusion is not without problems, which may limit the widespread use of diffusion-weighted MRI. In this report, the phenomenon of diffusion is described, together with its effect on the nuclear magnetic resonance signal. The concepts of diffusion anisotropy and diffusion tensor are also introduced, and the technical and hardware requirements are discussed.

### MRI using radiofrequency magnetic field phase gradients [^115cPPX2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conventionally, MR images are formed by applying gradients to the main static magnetic field (B0). However, the B0 gradient equipment is expensive, power-hungry, complex, and noisy and can induce eddy currents in nearby conducting structures, including the patient. Here, we describe a new silent, B0 gradient-free MRI principle, Transmit Array Spatial Encoding (TRASE), based on phase gradients of the radio-frequency (RF) field. RF phase gradients offer a new method of k-space traversal. Echo trains using at least two different RF phase gradients allow spin phase to accumulate, causing k-space traversal. Two such RF fields provide one-dimensional imaging and three are sufficient for two-dimensional imaging. Since TRASE is a k-space method, analogues of many conventional pulse sequences are possible. Experimental results demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional RF MRI and slice selection using a single-channel, transmit/receive, 0.2 T, permanent magnet, human MR system. The experimentally demonstrated spatial resolution is much higher than that provided by RF receive coil array sensitivity encoding alone but lower than generally achievable with B0 gradients. Potential applications are those in which one or more of the features of simplified equipment, lower costs, silent MRI, or the different physics of the image formation process are particularly advantageous.

### MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) [^112bZ92w]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a medical imaging procedure for making images of the internal structures of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to make images. The signal in an MR image comes mainly from the protons in fat and water molecules in the body. During an MRI exam, an electric current is passed through coiled wires to create a temporary magnetic field in a patient's body. Radio waves are sent from and received by a transmitter/receiver in the machine, and these signals are used to make digital images of the scanned area of the body. A typical MRI scan last from 20
- 90 minutes, depending on the part of the body being imaged. For some MRI exams, intravenous drugs, such as gadolinium-based contrast agents are used to change the contrast of the MR image. Gadolinium-based contrast agents are rare earth metals that are usually given through an IV in the arm.

### Dynamic imaging with MRI contrast agents: quantitative considerations [^11262DnE]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

Time-resolved MRI has had enormous impact in cognitive science and may become a significant tool in basic biological research with the application of new molecular imaging agents. In this paper, we examine the temporal characteristics of MRI contrast agents that could be used in dynamic studies. We consider "smart" T1 contrast agents, T2 agents based on reversible aggregation of superparamagnetic nanoparticles and sensors that produce changes in saturation transfer effects (chemical exchange saturation transfer, CEST). We discuss response properties of several agents with reference to available experimental data, and we develop a new theoretical model that predicts the response rates and relaxivity changes of aggregation-based sensors. We also perform calculations to define the extent to which constraints on temporal resolution are imposed by the imaging methods themselves. Our analysis confirms that some small T1 agents may be compatible with MRI temporal resolution on the order of 100 ms. Nanoparticle aggregation T2 sensors are applicable at much lower concentrations, but are likely to respond on a single second or slower timescale. CEST agents work at high concentrations and temporal resolutions of 1–10 s, limited by a requirement for long presaturation periods in the MRI pulse sequence.

### Current status in spatiotemporal analysis of contrast-based perfusion MRI [^114RBBJ9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In perfusion MRI, image voxels form a spatially organized network of systems, all exchanging indicator with their immediate neighbors. Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions‐of‐interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long‐recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between‐voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state‐of‐the‐art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.

Abstract

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in diagnostic imaging. In today's clinical environment, scanners with field strengths of 1.5 to 3 T are most commonly used. However, recent technological advancements might help to augment the clinical usage and availability of MRI via the introduction of high-performance low-field MRI systems (ranging from ~0.1–0.55 T in current systems). The combination of low field strength and high-performance hardware is characterized by increased flexibility, excellent quality of results, and reduced cost. This review discusses the multifaceted potential advantages of a new generation of high-performance low-field MRI systems and presents the potential impact of such systems in terms of socioeconomic benefits as well as positive effects on patient care.

### MRI safety screening of children with implants: updates and challenges [^1114rTXm]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

MRI is the imaging modality of choice for assessing many pediatric medical conditions. Although there are several inherent potential safety risks associated with the electromagnetic fields exploited for MRI, they are effectively mitigated through strict adherence to established MRI safety practices, enabling the safe and effective use of MRI in clinical practice. The potential hazards of the MRI environment may be exacerbated by/in the presence of implanted medical devices. Awareness of the unique MRI safety and screening challenges associated with these implanted devices is critical to ensuring MRI safety for the affected patients. In this review article, we will discuss the basics of MRI physics as they relate to MRI safety in the presence of implanted medical devices, strategies for assessing children with known or suspected implanted medical devices, and the particular management of several well-established common, as well as recently developed, implanted devices encountered at our institution.

Diffusion-weighted images provide a unique contrast that shows the ability to assess tissue structure and condition on a micrometer scale. Notably, these equations are necessary to understand diffusion MR imaging as a theory but not for real imaging, particularly in clinical practice. The diffusion phenomenon can be observed only through MR measurements. One of the emerging fields of diffusion MRI is to probe the tissue microstructure by altering the diffusion time t, the time interval over which spin displacements are sampled. However, the diffusion time is, in a sense, more important than the b-value for diffusion-weighted images and their quantitative metrics.

### Interleaved and simultaneous multi-nuclear magnetic resonance in vivo. review of principles, applications and potential [^1117oVDv]. NMR in Biomedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2 Requirements on the MR scanner

Several prerequisites on the MR scanner's hardware and software have to be met for multi‐nuclear interleaved or simultaneous acquisitions. The system must be able to transmit RF pulses at multiple resonance frequencies within one pulse sequence, either in rapid succession or simultaneously. This requires an RF transmit and receive system (including power amplifiers, multiple‐tuned RF coils, interfaces and the signal acquisition chain from preamplifiers to sampling hardware) that can operate at different Larmor frequencies and allows for rapid switching between nuclei within a pulse sequence. Finally, the pulse sequence and data processing pipeline (e.g. inline image reconstruction systems) have to be implemented so as to drive the RF pulses and to record and store the NMR signal at the required frequencies.

The challenge is that many systems, even when ready for measuring X‐nuclear data, are designed to acquire data of only a single nucleus within a pulse sequence. Most (clinical) MRI systems today are equipped with a power amplifier that can transmit RF within a narrow frequency band at the scanner's 1 H frequency, sometimes wide enough for alternative 19 F excitation. X‐nucleus excitation is usually achieved with an additional broadband amplifier, often with lower peak power and usually lower maximum output frequency than the 1 H amplifier. The MR system's synthesizer frequency is mixed into the RF waveforms and then fed to the respective power amplifier. Transmission at two Larmor frequencies in one pulse sequence is fairly standard with X‐nucleus capable MR systems, for heteronuclear polarization transfer, nOe or indirect detection. Monitoring the specific absorption rate (SAR) is mandatory on human MRI systems and must therefore be readily implemented by the manufacturer, also for multi‐nuclear RF transmit. Therefore, no additional risk arises from using this capability for simultaneous or interleaved acquisitions. However, there is room for improvement in MR system and coil vendors' SAR management, which may often be too conservative because local SAR differs between 1 H and X‐nuclei, and flip angle measurements are challenging with lower sensitivity. Unfortunately, systems capable of multi‐nuclear transmit cannot necessarily receive signals from different nuclei in one scan and may require hardware modifications in addition to the adaptations of pulse sequences and reconstruction pipelines. Handling the timing within the sequence, increased complexity (e.g. when parametrizing the protocol), additional data reconstruction steps and higher total SAR demand may also constitute additional challenges, depending on the application.

### Multimodal integration of diffusion MRI for better characterization of tissue biology [^111ujPG7]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The contrast in diffusion-weighted MR images is due to variations of diffusion properties within the examined specimen. Certain microstructural information on the underlying tissues can be inferred through quantitative analyses of the diffusion-sensitized MR signals. In the first part of the paper, we review two types of approach for characterizing diffusion MRI signals: Bloch's equations with diffusion terms, and statistical descriptions. Specifically, we discuss expansions in terms of cumulants and orthogonal basis functions, the confinement tensor formalism and tensor distribution models. Further insights into the tissue properties may be obtained by integrating diffusion MRI with other techniques, which is the subject of the second part of the paper. We review examples involving magnetic susceptibility, structural tensors, internal field gradients, transverse relaxation and functional MRI. Integrating information provided by other imaging modalities (MR based or otherwise) could be a key to improve our understanding of how diffusion MRI relates to physiology and biology.

### Minimum reporting standards for in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRSinMRS): experts' consensus recommendations [^116TjNAh]. NMR in Biomedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

Full and accurate description of the MR system and MR hardware allows for appropriate comparison across studies.

Field strength. First and foremost is the field strength of the MR system utilized, expressed in tesla. This allows a reader to position the results in the wider literature. Field strength also has implications for the sensitivity of the MRS approaches employed, and for problems or issues that may exist,(eg increased chemical shift displacement error with higher field strength, differences in spectral dispersion and hence appearance). Specifying the exact resonance frequency in megahertz in addition to the field strength may be useful, in particular for meta‐analyses and data sharing purposes, because the field strength is usually indicated with zero‐ or single‐digit precision only. Indicating the resonance frequency is particularly encouraged where the actual field strength deviates considerably from the rounded value indicated for B 0 (eg 123.06 MHz with 2.89 T instead of 127.74 MHz at 3.0 T).
Manufacturer. While the physical principles governing MRS are well understood, different vendor approaches can lead to systematic differences in results, and therefore manufacturer information should be included.
Model. Hardware differences exist depending on the model of the scanner, for example the bore size and gradient hardware, which impact on B 0 homogeneity and echo‐planar spectroscopic imaging performance, respectively. The software version is often omitted, but should also be given whenever possible, as some special features such as frequency correction and shimming algorithms may differ between different software versions.
RF coils. The RF coil information should include the nuclei the coil is tuned to so that it is clear which nuclei are observed. For double‐tuned coils, both nuclei should be indicated with a forward slash in between. As the coil design can have a major impact on the data acquired, it is important to include all the relevant details of the coil such as whether a single coil was used for transmit and receive and/or the number of channels for phased array receive and transmit coils. If it is not a standard manufacturer product coil, further details such as the design of the coil should be included and a reference for a previous publication that may provide more detail.
Additional hardware. Finally, details should be included of any additional hardware used, such as shim/gradient inserts, dielectric pads, or any other modification of the hardware used for data acquisition.

### Technical aspects of MR perfusion [^111FyhhY]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The most common methods for measuring perfusion with MRI are arterial spin labelling (ASL), dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC-MRI), and T(1)-weighted dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE-MRI). This review focuses on the latter approach, which is by far the most common in the body and produces measures of capillary permeability as well. The aim is to present a concise but complete overview of the technical issues involved in DCE-MRI data acquisition and analysis. For details the reader is referred to the references. The presentation of the topic is essentially generic and focuses on technical aspects that are common to all DCE-MRI measurements. For organ-specific problems and illustrations, we refer to the other papers in this issue. In Section 1 "Theory" the basic quantities are defined, and the physical mechanisms are presented that provide a relation between the hemodynamic parameters and the DCE-MRI signal. Section 2 "Data acquisition" discusses the issues involved in the design of an optimal measurement protocol. Section 3 "Data analysis" summarizes the steps that need to be taken to determine the hemodynamic parameters from the measured data.

### Building connectomes using diffusion MRI: why, how and but [^111Z3wEU]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Why has diffusion MRI become a principal modality for mapping connectomes in vivo? How do different image acquisition parameters, fiber tracking algorithms and other methodological choices affect connectome estimation? What are the main factors that dictate the success and failure of connectome reconstruction? These are some of the key questions that we aim to address in this review. We provide an overview of the key methods that can be used to estimate the nodes and edges of macroscale connectomes, and we discuss open problems and inherent limitations. We argue that diffusion MRI‐based connectome mapping methods are still in their infancy and caution against blind application of deep white matter tractography due to the challenges inherent to connectome reconstruction. We review a number of studies that provide evidence of useful microstructural and network properties that can be extracted in various independent and biologically relevant contexts. Finally, we highlight some of the key deficiencies of current macroscale connectome mapping methodologies and motivate future developments.

### Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography for the noninvasive assessment of arterial aging: a review by the vascAgeNet COST action [^111qy1LP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are advanced imaging modalities providing a wide range of possibilities to study the cardiovascular system. Despite differing in many ways, both techniques allow for excellent visualization of deep arteries, thus providing a window over their structure and function. This is particularly relevant for the study of arterial aging as arterial dimensions, shape, and mechanical properties as well as the increasing presence of calcium plaques are among the most described arterial characteristics associated with age.

The present narrative review aims to firstly introduce the reader to the basics of the functioning of MRI and CT, providing the interested reader with further specialized literature. Then, in‐depth descriptions of the most important quantities related to aortic aging are provided. For each potential biomarker, a brief introduction on the physical or clinical principle supporting its meaning as a descriptor of arterial state is followed by a summary of its predictive value for relevant end points. Key information on the required image characteristics and their analysis, as well as their association with age, is briefly described. Lastly, when available, reference values and reproducibility studies are reported along with a list of current limitations.

### Low-field magnetic resonance imaging: its history and renaissance [^114jrA62]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, the concept of direct SNR dependence on magnetic field strength has since been determined to be false. – This is because the static magnetic field strength alone does not determine the image SNR, and advances (since the late 1990s) in software (including various sequences) and hardware (including gradients and imaging coils) have made balanced sequences and high-speed contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) possible in low-field systems. In the past, imaging sequences for low-field MRI systems were relatively limited and basic, but now they have become quite sophisticated and are comparable to the imaging sequences of 1.5-T MRI systems that are widely used clinically. In addition, the low SNR inherent in low-field MRI systems has been improved by image reconstruction methods using deep learning and denoising techniques. This has resulted in high image quality that is sufficient for clinical applications. – Considering these factors, low-field MRI systems can be expected to become very popular tools in regions of the world where MRI is difficult to install or access owing to cost, especially in terms of maintenance. – In addition, another clear benefit of low-field systems is the reduced weight of the systems, perhaps even facilitating mobility.

However, it is important to understand that low-field MRI systems are different from 1.5-T or 3-T MRI systems, which are the backbone and accepted standard of the MRI technique and scanner configuration. The so-called physical characteristics (eg, differences in longitudinal relaxation [T1] values and chemical shifts) will cause image differences that cannot be altered by the aforementioned deep learning techniques. It is critical to understand these differences before imaging. Nonetheless, despite these differences, a low static magnetic field strength can be advantageous.

In this review, we discuss both the advantages and drawbacks of low-field MRI systems.

### Principles, techniques, and applications of T2✱-based MR imaging and its special applications [^116mR7j6]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

T2✱ relaxation refers to decay of transverse magnetization caused by a combination of spin-spin relaxation and magnetic field inhomogeneity. T2✱ relaxation is seen only with gradient-echo (GRE) imaging because transverse relaxation caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities is eliminated by the 180 degrees pulse at spin-echo imaging. T2✱ relaxation is one of the main determinants of image contrast with GRE sequences and forms the basis for many magnetic resonance (MR) applications, such as susceptibility-weighted (SW) imaging, perfusion MR imaging, and functional MR imaging. GRE sequences can be made predominantly T2✱ weighted by using a low flip angle, long echo time, and long repetition time. GRE sequences with T2✱-based contrast are used to depict hemorrhage, calcification, and iron deposition in various tissues and lesions. SW imaging uses phase information in addition to T2✱-based contrast to exploit the magnetic susceptibility differences of the blood and of iron and calcification in various tissues. Perfusion MR imaging exploits the signal intensity decrease that occurs with the passage of a high concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the microvasculature. Change in oxygen saturation during specific tasks changes the local T2✱, which leads to the blood oxygen level-dependent effect seen at functional MR imaging. The basics of T2✱ relaxation, T2✱-weighted sequences, and their clinical applications are presented, followed by the principles, techniques, and clinical uses of four T2✱-based applications, including SW imaging, perfusion MR imaging, functional MR imaging, and iron overload imaging.

American Thoracic Society and Fleischner Society joint workshop — quantitative imaging (QI) for pulmonary pathophysiology summarizes fundamental "good practice" stereological principles, evaluates technical capabilities and limitations of imaging modalities, and assesses major QI endpoints to link structure to function in lung disease. Volumetric computed tomography (CT) renders three-dimensional maps and may be combined with positron emission tomography (PET) to obtain dynamic physiological data, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using ultrashort-echo time (UTE) sequences has improved signal detection from lung parenchyma; contrast agents are used to deduce airway function, ventilation–perfusion–diffusion, and mechanics, and proton MRI can measure regional ventilation-perfusion ratio. QI-derived endpoints include air–blood–tissue volume partition, bronchovascular remodeling, emphysema, fibrosis, and textural patterns indicating architectural alteration; coregistered landmarks on paired images at different lung volumes are used to infer airway caliber, air trapping, gas and blood transport, compliance, and deformation. The goal is to promote unbiased quantification and interpretation of in vivo imaging data, compare metrics obtained using different QI modalities to ensure accurate and reproducible metric derivation, avoid misrepresentation of inferred physiological processes, and emphasize imaging-based computational modeling, with principles described as critical for all forms of QI irrespective of acquisition modality or disease entity.

### A hyperpolarized equilibrium for magnetic resonance [^112LeJzm]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging (MRI) play an indispensable role in science and healthcare but use only a tiny fraction of their potential. No more than ≈10 p.p.m. of all 1 H nuclei are effectively detected in a 3-Tesla clinical MRI system. Thus, a vast array of new applications lays dormant, awaiting improved sensitivity. Here we demonstrate the continuous polarization of small molecules in solution to a level that cannot be achieved in a viable magnet. The magnetization does not decay and is effectively reinitialized within seconds after being measured. This effect depends on the long-lived, entangled spin-order of parahydrogen and an exchange reaction in a low magnetic field of 10 −3 Tesla. We demonstrate the potential of this method by fast MRI and envision the catalysis of new applications such as cancer screening or indeed low-field MRI for routine use and remote application.

### A ranking of diffusion MRI compartment models with in vivo human brain data [^116WUgTp]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) microstructure imaging provides a unique noninvasive probe into tissue microstructure. The technique relies on biophysically motivated mathematical models, relating microscopic tissue features to the magnetic resonance (MR) signal. This work aims to determine which compartment models of diffusion MRI are best at describing measurements from in vivo human brain white matter.

Methods

Recent work shows that three compartment models, designed to capture intra-axonal, extracellular, and isotropically restricted diffusion, best explain multi- b -value data sets from fixed rat corpus callosum. We extend this investigation to in vivo by using a live human subject on a clinical scanner. The analysis compares models of one, two, and three compartments and ranks their ability to explain the measured data. We enhance the original methodology to further evaluate the stability of the ranking.

Results

As with fixed tissue, three compartment models explain the data best. However, a clearer hierarchical structure and simpler models emerge. We also find that splitting the scanning into shorter sessions has little effect on the ranking of models, and that the results are broadly reproducible across sessions.

Conclusion

Three compartments are required to explain diffusion MR measurements from in vivo corpus callosum, which informs the choice of model for microstructure imaging applications in the brain.

### MR imaging at high magnetic fields [^114y5jFV]. European Journal of Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Recently, more investigators have been applying higher magnetic field strengths (3–4 Tesla) in research and clinical settings. Higher magnetic field strength is expected to afford higher spatial resolution and/or a decrease in the length of total scan time due to its higher signal intensity. Besides MR signal intensity, however, there are several factors which are magnetic field dependent, thus the same set of imaging parameters at lower magnetic field strengths would provide differences in signal or contrast to noise ratios at 3 T or higher. Therefore, an outcome of the combined effect of all these factors should be considered to estimate the change in usefulness at different magnetic fields. The objective of this article is to illustrate the practical scientific applications, focusing on MR imaging, of higher magnetic field strength. First, we will discuss previous literature and our experiments to demonstrate several changes that lead to a number of practical applications in MR imaging, e.g. in relaxation times, effects of contrast agent, design of RF coils, maintaining a safety profile and in switching magnetic field strength. Second, we discuss what will be required to gain the maximum benefit of high magnetic field when the current magnetic field (≤ 1.5 T) is switched to 3 or 4 T. In addition, we discuss MR microscopy, which is one of the anticipated applications of high magnetic field strength to understand the quantitative estimation of the gain benefit and other considerations to help establish a practically available imaging protocol.

1 INTRODUCTION

Brain functions in certain aspects are temporal processes of the neural system. The neural bases of brain functions have been documented convincingly via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which is tightly coupled with local average neural activity (Biswal et al; Heeger & Ress; Schölvinck et al.). Therefore, it is significant to clarify the temporal dynamics of blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) signal, that is, to understand how neurons are activated in the brain functioning process. Further, compared to conventional electrophysiology (Murray et al.), fMRI provides valuable resources for demonstrating the functional system of the brain as the hierarchical structure of brain dynamics appears temporally scale‐invariant (Cole et al; Gordon et al; Raut et al; Watanabe et al.). Considering that fMRI signals reflect the temporal activities of neural populations, which component or feature of the signal contributes to the function and large‐scale organization of the functional system? Neural dynamics and its mathematical computations, intraregional temporal features (IRTFs), which were once treated as "noise", now have important and independent roles in understanding our brain functions (Uddin).

Generally, the brain system works in a hierarchical pattern, in which unimodal‐to‐transmodal hierarchy constitutes a core organizing principle of brain cortex (Huntenburg et al.). Unimodal areas are those respond to sensory inputs in a single modality (such as visual and auditory) and motor areas, while transmodal areas always integrate information across multiple modalities and long timescales. And ventromedial‐to‐dorsolateral hierarchy (or posterior‐to‐anterior hierarchy) was usually reported as the second intrinsic dimension of brain organization (Huntenburg et al.). Interestingly, patients with cognitive impairment always exhibit disrupted spatial organization of temporal dynamics (Dai & He; Kabbara et al.), so when detecting how neural dynamics are impacted by neuropathology, we should also note how the spatial organization of IRTFs is impacted. While other brain properties, such as myelination and cortical expansion, also span hierarchical patterns (Glasser & van Essen; J. Hill et al.); to obtain a complete and multiscale description of the brain system, efforts are made to integrate various brain properties into a common coordinate system, although incompatibility between different methods still occurs (Baum et al; Shafiei et al; Vázquez‐Rodríguez et al.).
