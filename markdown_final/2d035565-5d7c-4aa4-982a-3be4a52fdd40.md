## Question

Is a scorpion sting an emergency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a scorpion sting is an emergency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline severity spectrum and how often stings are mild versus severe. Then, I should verify which populations are high risk for deterioration. Next, I will identify systemic red-flag symptoms that mandate emergency activation. After that, I need to consider geography and species-specific toxicity. Then, I will apply commonly used severity grading frameworks and the time course of progression. Finally, I will align resource needs and treatment decisions, including antivenom, with the clinical picture before summarizing a clear answer and safety net guidance [^1156G1FM] [^1164LFcS].

> Let me first confirm the baseline severity spectrum, because I need to ensure I am not overstating the emergency risk. Most scorpion stings produce local, self-limited pain, swelling, erythema, and paresthesia; only a minority progress to systemic envenomation with neuromuscular and autonomic toxicity, myocarditis, pulmonary edema, or shock, and this minority is typically estimated around 5–10 percent, meaning the vast majority are not emergent if symptoms remain local only [^1156G1FM] [^114tMeMf]. Hold on, I should verify the range; yes, multiple clinical reviews affirm that while most cases are mild, a clinically important subset becomes severe and life-threatening due to systemic effects, which reframes the question from "is any scorpion sting an emergency" to "is this sting showing systemic envenomation" [^1156G1FM] [^114tMeMf].

> Now, I need to check which patients deteriorate faster, because that lowers the threshold to activate emergency care. Children, particularly the very young, are disproportionately vulnerable to neurotoxic effects from Centruroides stings and can develop respiratory failure requiring intensive support, so pediatric age is a key high-risk factor warranting early escalation and consideration of antivenom if systemic signs appear [^113pRXf8] [^115Wj8ec]. I should also verify adult risk factors; data from Argentina with Tityus trivittatus identified older age over 50 years, delayed presentation beyond 2 hours, and pre-existing hypertension as independent predictors of severe envenomation, so elderly patients and those with cardiovascular comorbidities merit heightened vigilance and a lower bar for ED evaluation [^116Errrx].

> Next, I will now examine red-flag systemic features that convert a local sting into a medical emergency, and I should double-check these against first aid guidelines. Immediate emergency activation is warranted for any systemic involvement such as difficulty breathing, muscle rigidity or fasciculations, cranial nerve dysfunction with dysphagia or blurred vision, seizures, confusion, hemodynamic instability, dysrhythmias, pulmonary edema, or progressive weakness, as emphasized by the 2024 AHA/ARC first aid guidance and emergency medicine reviews [^1164LFcS] [^1156G1FM]. But wait, what if the presentation is anaphylaxis rather than venom neurotoxicity; in that case, treat as anaphylaxis with prompt intramuscular epinephrine, supportive care, and transport, as per allergy practice parameters, since systemic allergic reactions to stings are themselves emergencies independent of envenomation grade [^115rF6Mj] [^114pcum4].

> Hold on, I should verify geographic and species-specific toxicity because this changes the emergency calculus. In the Southwestern United States, Centruroides sculpturatus can cause dramatic neuromotor toxicity with respiratory insufficiency, and antivenom has been shown to rapidly resolve symptoms in critically ill children, so any neurotoxicity in this setting should be treated as an emergency with consideration of antivenom [^113pRXf8] [^1156G1FM]. In India and parts of the Middle East, Mesobuthus tamulus can precipitate an autonomic storm with cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema where early prazosin and, when available and appropriate, antivenom shorten recovery, while Hemiscorpius lepturus is associated with hemolysis, DIC, and renal failure, all of which justify emergency care thresholds at lower symptom burdens than with less toxic species [^111miuSk] [^114tMeMf]. In South America, Tityus species have been linked to severe cardiopulmonary complications and fatalities, reinforcing that regional epidemiology should modulate triage decisions toward ED evaluation when systemic symptoms are possible or evolving [^1171iZuc] [^116Errrx].

> Let me think about how to standardize severity, because misclassification can delay care. Common grading schemas categorize stings as grade 1 with local findings, grade 2 with regional paresthesias or pain dissemination, grade 3 with systemic neurologic or autonomic features, and grade 4 with life-threatening cardiorespiratory failure; grades 3 and 4 are unequivocal emergencies typically requiring ICU-level monitoring and potential antivenom where indicated [^1118pcAw] [^1156G1FM]. Wait, I should confirm the proportion that reaches severe grades; the literature suggests only a minority progress to grade 3–4, but that subset drives most morbidity and requires prompt escalation to advanced care settings [^114tMeMf] [^1156G1FM].

> I should now review the time course, because rapid progression is a signal to act even before full-blown toxicity emerges. Rapid worsening over the first 2–4 hours after the sting, delayed presentation beyond 2 hours in higher-risk species or hosts, and biphasic or delayed complications such as ischemic stroke reported 12–48 hours post-sting all argue for early ED evaluation and observation when systemic features are suspected or evolving, rather than watchful waiting at home [^116Errrx] [^111AMgHt]. Let me double-check pediatric cerebrovascular risks; case reports from the Americas also document delayed ischemic stroke following suspected Tityus stings in children after initial cardiopulmonary and pancreatic involvement, underscoring the need for close monitoring when systemic toxicity is present [^115t1D5x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some toxidromes mimic scorpion envenomation in children, and I need to ensure we consider confounders. Methamphetamine toxicity in infants can replicate the cranial nerve abnormalities and autonomic findings seen with Centruroides, so when the history is unclear or the ecology is inconsistent, clinicians should broaden the differential while still treating airway, breathing, and circulation threats emergently if present [^114SomLZ] [^1156G1FM].

> Next, I should align resource needs with clinical severity, and I will verify this against first aid and emergency care guidance. Local symptoms alone can usually be managed with home measures and outpatient analgesia, whereas uncontrolled severe pain, spreading regional symptoms, or any systemic signs should prompt medical evaluation, and definitive emergencies with neurologic, respiratory, or cardiovascular involvement warrant ED transport, continuous monitoring, and readiness for ICU-level care and antivenom where indicated [^1164LFcS] [^1156G1FM]. I need to check supportive options for local pain in non-systemic cases; topical or regional measures and systemic analgesics, including IV paracetamol or dexketoprofen, have evidence for short-term pain reduction, while adjuncts like ice may be offered if skin is intact per first aid guidance, although topical lidocaine may not outperform placebo in early pain windows [^1146Dyuq] [^113QEGPR].

> I will now examine treatment implications that validate emergency designation, and I should confirm where evidence is strongest. For Centruroides neurotoxicity, randomized data show scorpion-specific F(ab')² antivenom leads to rapid resolution of the clinical syndrome in critically ill children, supporting early administration in grade 3–4 presentations or in rapidly progressing cases with airway risk, alongside benzodiazepines and supportive care as needed [^113pRXf8] [^1156G1FM]. For Mesobuthus tamulus with autonomic storm phenotypes, timely prazosin is foundational and antivenom within the first 6 hours hastens recovery and shortens hospitalization in systemic cases, though practice should account for local availability and cost constraints, and hemodynamic or ventilatory support may be required for cardiopulmonary complications [^111miuSk] [^113N8cUo]. But wait, let me verify the broader antivenom evidence base; meta-analytic data suggest heterogeneity, with clear benefit in Arizona Centruroides envenomation and mixed or non-significant effects in Old World species overall, reinforcing species-specific decision-making and the primacy of supportive care where antivenom benefit is uncertain or unavailable [^1174HUCk] [^1156G1FM]. I should confirm that when an allergic mechanism predominates, immediate epinephrine and transport are indicated per anaphylaxis parameters, independent of envenomation grade [^115rF6Mj] [^114pcum4].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a concise, clinically safe answer. A scorpion sting becomes a medical emergency when there is any evidence of systemic envenomation or anaphylaxis, especially neuromuscular or respiratory compromise, cardiovascular instability, severe autonomic dysfunction, or evolving central nervous system involvement; children, older adults, patients with comorbidities, and stings in regions with highly toxic species warrant lower thresholds for ED evaluation and observation, even with early or subtle systemic signs [^1164LFcS] [^1156G1FM]. While most stings remain localized and self-limited, the minority that progress can deteriorate rapidly, and early recognition, species-aware management, and timely use of antivenom where indicated can be lifesaving; therefore, any deviation from purely local pain and swelling should prompt urgent medical assessment, and confirmed systemic features mandate emergency activation and advanced care pathways [^113pRXf8] [^111miuSk].

---

Yes, a scorpion sting is an **emergency** [^1164LFcS] in children, older adults, patients with comorbidities, or when **systemic symptoms** develop (difficulty breathing, muscle rigidity, confusion, severe pain, or vomiting) [^114tMeMf]. Most stings cause only local pain and swelling, but severe envenomation can rapidly progress to **life-threatening complications**, especially in children [^115Wj8ec] [^114tMeMf]. Immediate medical evaluation is essential for **high-risk patients** or anyone with **systemic symptoms**; **antivenom plus supportive care** are indicated for severe cases [^115XrUnH] [^113pRXf8].

---

## Clinical presentation and severity

Scorpion stings present with a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild local reactions to **severe systemic toxicity** [^1156G1FM]. Severity depends on the scorpion species, the amount of venom injected, and the patient's age and health status [^114tMeMf].

- **Local symptoms**: Pain, swelling, erythema, paresthesia [^114tMeMf], and muscle fasciculations are common localized reactions.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Severe envenomation can cause neuromuscular toxicity (cranial nerve dysfunction, somatic neuromuscular dysfunction), autonomic dysfunction (cholinergic or adrenergic effects), and cardiovascular complications (tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, myocarditis, cardiogenic shock) [^114tMeMf] [^1156G1FM].

- **Severe complications**: Respiratory distress, pulmonary edema [^114tMeMf], acute pancreatitis, myocardial infarction [^111wPmpx], stroke [^111AMgHt], and multi-organ failure have been reported, particularly in children and vulnerable populations.

---

## Risk factors for severe reactions

Certain populations are at **higher risk for severe reactions** and complications from scorpion stings [^116Errrx]:

- **Children**: Higher risk due to lower body mass and increased susceptibility to venom toxicity [^114tMeMf].

- **Elderly individuals**: Increased risk due to age-related physiological changes and comorbidities [^116Errrx].

- **Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions**: Cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological conditions increase risk [^116Errrx].

- **Pregnant women**: Rare complications such as eclampsia have been reported [^115L8wV6].

---

## Geographic variation in severity

The severity of scorpion stings **varies geographically**, depending on the species involved:

| **Region** | **Common species** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|
| United States (Southwest) | Centruroides sculpturatus (bark scorpion) | - Potentially severe neurotoxicity <br/> - Especially in children [^114tMeMf] |
| Middle East (Iran) | Hemiscorpius lepturus | - Severe local necrosis <br/> - Hemolysis <br/> - Renal failure [^114tMeMf] |
| India | Mesobuthus tamulus (Indian red scorpion) | - Severe systemic toxicity <br/> - Cardiovascular complications [^113Pd8vs] |
| South America (Brazil, Argentina) | Tityus species | - Severe systemic toxicity <br/> - Neurological and cardiovascular complications [^114tMeMf] [^1171iZuc] |

---

## Immediate first aid and medical management

Immediate first aid and **timely medical management are critical** to prevent severe complications:

- **First aid**: Clean the wound, apply a cold compress [^113QEGPR], immobilize the affected limb, and seek medical attention promptly [^1164LFcS].

- **Medical management**: Supportive care, analgesics [^1146Dyuq], benzodiazepines for neuromuscular symptoms [^113pRXf8], and antivenom administration in severe cases [^115XrUnH].

- **Antivenom**: Effective in rapidly resolving severe symptoms, particularly in children with neurotoxic effects [^113pRXf8] [^111miuSk].

---

## Prognosis and long-term complications

Prognosis following a scorpion sting depends on envenomation severity and the promptness of medical intervention [^114tMeMf]. Mild cases typically resolve without long-term sequelae, whereas **severe cases** may lead to lasting neurological, cardiovascular, or renal complications, particularly if treatment is delayed.

---

## Public health implications and prevention

Scorpion stings are a **significant public health concern** in endemic regions, disproportionately affecting children and other vulnerable populations [^1171iZuc]. Prevention centers on public education about scorpion habitats and protective measures, environmental control to reduce harborage near homes, and ensuring access to medical care and antivenom.

---

A scorpion sting is an **emergency**, especially for children, older adults, and those with pre-existing conditions. Immediate medical attention is **crucial** to prevent **severe complications** and death.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^114tMeMf]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on scorpion envenomation:

- **Definition**: Scorpion stings in the U.S. are caused by Centruroides scorpions from the Buthidae family. Hemiscorpius lepturus, found in the Middle East and native to Iran, is the only scorpion outside the family Buthidae that is venomous to humans.

- **Pathophysiology**: Centruroides venom contains a mixture of different toxins, including α-toxins that affect sodium channels, causing neuromuscular toxicity and autonomic dysfunction.

- **Epidemiology**: Scorpion stings most commonly occur in tropical and subtropical regions, with a global incidence of 20 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Most scorpion stings cause only localized toxin-related cutaneous effects, such as burning pain, swelling, erythema, paresthesia, muscle fasciculations, and necrosis. In severe cases, neuromuscular toxicity may include cranial nerve or somatic skeletal neuromuscular dysfunction, which may be accompanied by autonomic dysfunction, such as cholinergic or adrenergic effects. Hemiscorpius lepturus envenomations can cause local skin necrosis and, in severe cases, hemolysis, DIC, and renal failure.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most scorpion stings are mild, causing only localized reactions, with approximately 5–10% of cases leading to severe envenomation, which is more common in children.

### Antivenom for critically ill children with neurotoxicity from scorpion stings [^113pRXf8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Clinically significant scorpion envenomation by *Centruroides sculpturatus* produces a dramatic neuromotor syndrome and respiratory insufficiency that often necessitate intensive supportive care. We hypothesized that a scorpion-specific F(ab')² antivenom would promptly resolve clinical symptoms in children with this syndrome.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind study, the efficacy of scorpion-specific F(ab')² antivenom, as compared with placebo, was assessed in 15 children aged 6 months to 18 years who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with clinically significant signs of scorpion envenomation. The primary endpoint was the resolution of the clinical syndrome within 4 hours after administration of the study drug. Secondary endpoints included the total dose of concomitant midazolam for sedation and quantitative plasma venom levels before and after treatment.

- **Results**: The clinical syndrome resolved more rapidly among recipients of the antivenom than among recipients of placebo, with a resolution of symptoms in all eight antivenom recipients versus one of seven placebo recipients within 4 hours after treatment (P = 0.001). More midazolam was administered to the placebo recipients than to the antivenom recipients (mean cumulative dose, 4.61 vs. 0.07 mg per kilogram of body weight; P = 0.01). Plasma venom concentrations were undetectable in all eight antivenom recipients but in only one placebo recipient 1 hour after treatment (P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Among critically ill children with neurotoxic effects of scorpion envenomation, intravenous administration of scorpion-specific antivenom resulted in a rapid resolution of symptoms compared to placebo.

Regarding patient education for scorpion envenomation, more specifically with respect to first aid education, the AHA/ARC 2024 guidelines recommend educating patients on the following:

- **Call emergency services**: If a person stung by a scorpion develops symptoms throughout the body, such as difficulty breathing, muscle rigidity, dizziness, or confusion.

- **Seek medical care**: If pain from a scorpion sting extends beyond the site of the bite/sting, becomes severe, and is not controlled by over-the-counter pain medications; if an open wound develops; or if the person experiences systemic symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) sting: Randomised open label clinical trial [^1135jnyv]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

We are not aware of any previous randomised controlled trials comparing the usefulness of mono-specific F(Ab)² scorpion antivenom plus prazosin against prazosin alone in severe scorpion sting by Mesobuthus tamulus. The number of cases of envenoming peaks in the hot months of the year, May and October, because of increased agricultural activities. Men are more prone to these accidents owing to greater environmental exposure. Twenty-eight percent of the study population were younger than 18 years. Our findings in relation to a substantial number of patients with grade 2 envenomation included in this study support a firm conclusion about the efficacy of antivenom plus prazosin in victims reporting within six hours of sting with systemic involvement. Cases of grade 3 and grade 4 envenomation were not included in the present study, as required by the ethics committee. Large randomised trials including victims with grade 3 and 4 envenomation will be needed to demonstrate the effect of antivenom and prazosin on endpoints such as survival.

This study was not blinded, and the primary outcome was evaluated by study investigators with extensive clinical experience with scorpion sting. The determination of the point at which symptoms disappeared was thus subjective, but we think that this was a clinically relevant and pragmatic way of judging the effects of treatment in a trial carried out in challenging circumstances with restricted resources in a rural setting in India.

Scorpion venom evokes transient parasympathetic effects.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) sting: Randomised open label clinical trial [^113Pd8vs]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Scorpion sting can pose a life-threatening acute medical emergency and is a neglected public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries, especially in North Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and India. Mesobuthus tamulus, an Indian red scorpion, is the most lethal species of the Buthidae family in India. Its venom delays the closing of neuronal sodium channels, resulting in an "autonomic storm" owing to the sudden release of endogenous catecholamine into the circulation. This autonomic storm is characterized by transient parasympathetic and prolonged sympathetic stimulation. Similar cardiovascular manifestations are reported in different species of scorpions. Morbidity and mortality due to scorpion sting result from acute refractory pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and multiorgan failure.

Opinions differ about the correct treatment for scorpion sting. In the past, various regimens, including a lytic cocktail, insulin, atropine, β blocker, nifedipine, and captopril, have failed to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, since the advent of the α₁ blocker prazosin, the fatality rate has been reduced to 1%. Scorpion antivenom is a specific antidote capable of neutralizing circulating venom toxins if administered soon after the sting; it is widely used and believed to be effective by experienced doctors in Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Tunisia, and Iran. Serotherapy has been a matter of debate and controversy during the past decade. Whether the antivenom can reverse the cardiac pathophysiological effects of scorpion venom is uncertain. Several studies have shown that antivenom can…

### Black scorpion (Tityus obscurus) fatalities in Guyana and a literature review [^1171iZuc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

More than 1500 scorpion species exist worldwide, with a few potentially lethal to humans. About 1 million stings annually result in over 3000 deaths, but the incidence and mortality vary greatly by species and location. Physicians working internationally must recognize that resulting toxidromes vary significantly by region. Over the past few decades, South America has reported relatively few deaths and low case mortality rates from envenomations. In Guyana, a small tropical country on its northeast coast, they have been extremely rare. A sudden fatal case cluster suggests an extension of the black scorpion's habitat, an increase in venom toxicity, or both.

- **Case reports**: During a 12-month period, Guyana experienced 3 deaths, including 1 adult, from black scorpion (Tityus obscurus) envenomation. The 30-year-old man and 2 young children experienced the same symptom complex, initially appearing well except for pain at the sting site. They soon developed persistent emesis and leukocytosis. All were flown from remote jungle areas to the only public tertiary care hospital where they received maximal available medical support. They gradually developed profound cardiopulmonary failure requiring ventilation and, eventually, dysrhythmias. None had hyperglycemia or pancreatitis, and they had no neurologic abnormalities until developing progressive obtundation immediately before intubation.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Scorpion envenomation symptoms, outcomes, and treatment are geographically specific. Patients benefit when clinicians recognize regional differences in envenomation presentations and management strategies.

### Pediatric scorpion envenomation in the United States: Morbidity, mortality, and therapeutic innovations [^115Wj8ec]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

In the Southwestern United States, the venom of the scorpion *Centruroides sculpturatus* (commonly known as the bark scorpion) can cause serious and potentially fatal neurotoxicity, with young children being most vulnerable to its effects. Historically, advances in the quality of supportive care have significantly improved morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the development of effective antivenom therapies has transformed the care of these patients. This article reviews the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for *C. sculpturatus* envenomation, including recent advances in immunotherapy and their implications for pediatric emergency care providers.

### The natural history and epidemiology of insect venom allergy: Clinical implications [^113dmdzC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Hymenoptera stings can cause severe systemic allergic reactions and occasionally fatal anaphylaxis, significantly contributing to morbidity and deterioration in health-related quality of life. The latest epidemiological data confirm the importance of insect sting allergy as a cause of anaphylaxis. Despite the high prevalence of asymptomatic sensitization, the prevalence of sting-induced systemic reactions (SRs) is low. At the time of writing, no parameter has been identified that can predict who will have a future reaction and whether it will be a large local reaction or anaphylactic.

The combination of several concomitant factors, including environmental, genetic, and individual factors, may account for the occurrence of a systemic reaction in individual patients. Several not completely known factors may be associated with the severity of systemic re-stings. About 50% of subjects with fatal sting reactions had no documented history of a previous SR, indicating that greater insight into the natural history and risk factors is required, especially in asymptomatic sensitized subjects.

For patients with SRs, prevention of future severe allergic reactions should start with referral to an emergency department, correct administration of epinephrine by medical staff, referral to an allergist, and coaching for the self-administration of epinephrine. However, most insect sting victims fail to seek medical advice, and hospital attendance does not always correlate with the severity of the allergic reaction. Moreover, only about one-third of patients received a prescription for self-injectable epinephrine.

Jellyfish have a worldwide distribution, and their stings can cause diverse reactions. These range from cutaneous, localized, and self-limited to serious systemic or fatal ones, depending on the envenoming species. Various first aid treatments are employed to manage such stings, but few have strong evidence supporting their use. This review of the literature describes and discusses the different related first aid and treatment recommendations, concluding with a summarized practical approach. Further randomized controlled trials in this field are necessary.

### Scorpion sting-induced malignant middle cerebral artery infarction [^111AMgHt]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A previously healthy middle-aged man in his 40s, with a history of red scorpion envenomation, presented to the emergency department for the management of an acute stroke syndrome. This involved the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and developed 12 hours after the scorpion sting. He arrived at the hospital 15 hours following the stroke. The activation of the autonomic nervous system by the Indian red scorpion venom is known to produce severe systemic manifestations, including cardiogenic shock and acute pulmonary oedema. Death is a rare consequence. Neurological complications resulting from red scorpion injuries are exceedingly uncommon and inadequately documented in the literature. The patient underwent an emergency decompressive craniectomy due to neurological deterioration despite intracranial pressure-reducing agents. Thrombectomy could not be performed due to the malignant infarct (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of 1), which involved over one-third of the MCA territory. Our patient has made a full recovery, and at a 6-month follow-up, he was capable of walking without assistance. It is essential to promptly identify and manage this under-recognised presentation in order to yield favourable functional outcomes for the patient.

### Identification of allergens in the venom of the common striped scorpion [^11561B7Q]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

The common striped scorpion, Centruroides vittatus, is endemic to the southwestern United States and causes thousands of human stings annually. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to C. vittatus venom have been reported.

- **Objectives**: To identify specific IgE in 11 patients with immediate hypersensitivity to C. vittatus and to characterize the allergens present in the venom.

- **Methods**: Skin testing to dialyzed, filtered venom was performed in 5 patients. Immunoglobulin E immunoblots to whole milked venom were accomplished with serum samples from 8 patients. Enzymatic properties of whole venom were also determined.

- **Results**: C. vittatus venom was found to contain 150 microg/microL of protein. Four of 5 patients tested had positive skin test reactions to the purified venom extract, with no late reactions. In all 8 patients, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated multiple proteins, 9 of which were identified as allergens on IgE immunoblots, ranging in size from 30 to 170 kD. Enzymatic activity was found to include phospholipase A, alkaline phosphatase, esterase, esterase lipase, and acid phosphatase.

- **Conclusions**: C. vittatus envenomation may result in immediate hypersensitivity reactions in susceptible individuals. Venom-specific IgE can be identified by using skin tests and IgE immunoblots. The allergens identified in these patients had molecular weights distinct from those of known scorpion neurotoxins. A safe and effective skin testing extract can be prepared from dialyzed pure venom and may lead to the widespread ability to diagnose these reactions.

### Managing snakebite [^1118UHMm]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Patients usually present with a history of being bitten by a snake, except those who experience painless nocturnal bites by kraits while asleep. Patients are often fearful and anxious. Occasionally, painful bites may be mistaken for a puncture wound from a thorn or sharp stone and may initially be ignored. Some patients, especially children bitten by highly venomous snakes, may present with cardiovascular collapse, unconsciousness, bleeding, paralysis, or respiratory failure and may not provide a clear history of a snakebite. It is important to consider envenoming in these situations in regions where snakebites are common.

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache are non-specific symptoms but must be monitored as these may herald serious complications such as uraemia, acute pituitary or intracranial bleeds, and anaphylaxis.

Regarding medical management for Hymenoptera sting allergy, specifically in relation to venom immunotherapy, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2017 guidelines recommend initiating venom immunotherapy with an initial dose of up to 1 mcg and increasing it to a maintenance dose of at least 100 mcg of each venom. Consider administering a maintenance dose of 50 mcg in pediatric patients.

### Evaluation of scorpion envenomation by Tityus trivittatus in adults: An analysis of variables related to severity of clinical presentation [^116Errrx]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In Argentina, the scorpion species Tityus trivittatus has been most commonly associated with serious injury and death.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of cases of T trivittatus envenomation presented to the emergency department at an infectious disease hospital in Cordoba, Argentina, between December 2014 and February 2015. All cases were taxonomically confirmed using criteria established in the Argentine Ministry of Health national guidelines. The primary outcome was the classification of clinical presentation (mild/moderate/severe). Classification was performed in a post hoc fashion using the national guidelines and compared to the classification given to patients at the time of diagnosis in the emergency department.

- **Results**: We included 450 individuals with T trivittatus envenomation. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range 25–52), and 57% were female. In the emergency department, only 5 patients were diagnosed with severe envenomation, yet severity was associated with patients over 50 years old (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, P < 0.01), a time to presentation of over 120 minutes (OR 2.6, P = 0.02), and pre-existing hypertension (OR = 3.9, P < 0.001).

### Incidence, mechanisms and impact outcome of hyperglycaemia in severe scorpion-envenomed patients [^115riezu]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemia is often observed in severe scorpion-envenomed patients due to a severe autonomic storm with a massive release of catecholamines, increased glucagon levels, cortisol levels, and either decreased insulin levels or insulin resistance. The presence of hyperglycaemia is an indicator of severity in this specific condition. Indeed, hyperglycaemia is associated with the severity of clinical manifestations of severe scorpion envenomation requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In fact, the presence of hyperglycaemia is linked to respiratory failure, pulmonary oedema, haemodynamic instability, neurological failure, multisystem organ failure, and an increased mortality and ICU length of stay.

The presence of hyperglycaemia in scorpion-envenomed patients at the emergency department prompts searching for systemic or cardiorespiratory manifestations. Consequently, hyperglycaemia can help screen severe patients at the emergency department. Management of severe scorpion envenomation involves admission and close surveillance in the ICU, where vital signs and continuous monitoring enable early initiation of therapy for life-threatening complications. The use of antivenom for scorpion stings remains controversial. All patients with pulmonary oedema should receive prazosin and possibly dobutamine, according to the scorpion's species. Mechanical ventilation is usually used in severe cases. Insulin should be reserved for severe cases with confirmed excessive hyperglycaemia.

### Evaluation of scorpion stings in children [^116npTXr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Scorpion stings are a significant public health problem in many parts of the world. Children are at a higher risk of developing severe complications from scorpion envenoming, including cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic complications. In Turkey, members of the Buthidae family are the most common culprits in severe envenoming events.

- **Methods**: This retrospective-descriptive study was conducted in Turkey. Children aged 0 to 18 years admitted to the emergency department of Kahta State Hospital between December 2017 and December 2020 were included in the study. Patient information was reviewed, and 78 patients with complete demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were included.

- **Results**: Out of the 78 patients, 24.4% were six years old or younger, while 75.6% were older than six years. An alpha blocker was administered to 12.8% of the patients, and antivenom was given to 43.6%. Of these patients, 71.8% were followed up in the emergency department, 21.8% in the inpatient unit, and 6.4% in the intensive care unit. Two patients (2.6%) died within one month. There was a significant difference in lactate dehydrogenase values according to the sting site (P = 0.014). Lactate dehydrogenase values of patients stung on the head, neck, and upper extremities were higher than those of patients bitten on lower extremities.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated levels of specific laboratory parameters, such as leukocytes, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase, are linked to worse outcomes. Additionally, stings on the head and neck and upper extremities resulted in higher lactate dehydrogenase values, indicating more severe envenomation.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) sting: Randomised open label clinical trial [^111miuSk]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

Early administration of antivenom within six hours of sting in addition to prazosin hastened recovery and shortened hospital stays in a rural setting. Although rapid recovery in patients treated with antivenom is an advantage, the total cost of treatment with antivenom approaches a month's salary for a laborer in the region — 10 mL of antivenom costs Rs350 (£4.97, €5.82, $7.77) — while the cost of 10 tablets of 1 mg prazosin is Rs32 (£0.49, €0.58, $0.77). The dose of prazosin administered was 250 µg in children up to age 18 and 500 µg in adults. Administration of prazosin at an interval of three hours prevented the development of pulmonary oedema and led to rapid recovery, as reported previously. The results of the present study would be applicable in settings such as primary health centers, where the majority of the victims first present. Scorpion sting is a potentially life-threatening, time-limiting acute medical emergency; hence it would be unethical to withhold standard treatment for want of a scientific trial.

Despite much experience with severe scorpion envenomation in endemic regions worldwide, a standard treatment protocol using drugs and antivenom is lacking. Randomised controlled trials for treating severe scorpion envenomation, on which such guidelines can be based, are scarce.

### Infective endocarditis associated with a scorpion sting [^116RxKAF]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

We report the successful surgical intervention in two cases of aortic valve bacterial endocarditis after scorpion stings. Infective endocarditis developed in both patients several weeks after they suffered repeated scorpion stings. Both patients had similar, but uncommon features:

- **Unusual isolated organisms**: The isolated organisms were unusual causes of infective endocarditis (streptococcus group G and Streptococcus milleri).
- **Annular abscesses development**: Annular abscesses developed that required either aortic root replacement with a homograft or annular patch repair with pericardium.
- **Postoperative complications**: Complete heart block developed postoperatively, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation.

Both patients completed a 6-week postoperative course of antibiotic therapy and are without reinfection.

### Venomous bites, stings, and poisoning [^117DUETa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, first aid, and medical treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, and insects; and poisoning by fish and mollusks, in all parts of the world. Among these envenomings and poisonings, snake bites cause the greatest burden of human suffering, killing 46,000 people each year in India alone and more than 100,000 worldwide, resulting in physical handicaps in many survivors. Specific antidotes (antivenoms/antivenins) are available to treat envenoming by many of these taxa, but supply and distribution are inadequate in many tropical developing countries.

### Suspected stonefish envenomation in Reunion Island: 15 years later [^111V5AHp]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Although marine envenomations are a reason for consultation in tropical emergency departments, stonefish stings are particularly feared. Immediate management focuses on pain control, whereas late management addresses cutaneous complications. This study presents a new series and compares the management of these patients and their outcomes at our center over the past 20 years.

- **Methods**: This study presents a new series of 53 patients treated between 2016 and 2020 at the South Hospital of the University Hospital Center of Réunion following a sting attributed to the stonefish. We compared this new series with a previous series of patients treated at the same center for the same reason between 2001 and 2005.

- **Results**: The series are comparable. Regarding early management, the use of regional anesthesia was more frequent (47% vs. 3.5%). Half of the patients received a strong opioid. Prescription of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids persisted. Exposure to a heat source remained common. Prophylactic antibiotics were prescribed more frequently (64% vs. 35%) and more uniformly with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Regarding late management, the average duration of hospitalization decreased (1.8 vs. 2.6 days). Cutaneous complications were less frequent (9% vs. 25%). No patient managed with regional anesthesia presented cutaneous complications.

- **Conclusions**: The management of patients in Réunion following Scorpaenidae stings has evolved over time. Regional anesthesia has become more widespread, and the prescription of probabilistic preventive antibiotic therapy is more homogeneous.

### Myocarditis and early markers of cardiac response associated with scorpion stings in children [^117V7iRN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A clinical course ranging from mild local findings to life-threatening systemic findings may occur after scorpion stings. The purpose of this study was to identify priority markers indicating scorpion sting-related cardiac involvement.

- **Methods**: Our study was performed between July 2014 and September 2015 in the Çukurova University Medical Faculty Pediatric Emergency Department in Adana, Turkey. Patients admitted with scorpion sting-related cardiac involvement and a control group consisting of patients with no scorpion sting-related cardiac involvement were included in the study. Troponin I at the time of presentation and at 6 and 24 hours, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), ejection fraction as determined by echocardiography at 24 hours, and peak and end of T wave (Tp-e) and Tp-e/QTc ratios with echocardiography at 24 hours were evaluated.

- **Results**: A patient group consisting of 7 cases of scorpion envenomation-related myocarditis and a control group of 30 cases of scorpion intoxication without myocarditis findings were enrolled. Statistically significantly high glucose, white blood cell values, creatine kinase MB, troponin I, and NTproBNP values were identified in the scorpion sting-related myocarditis group (P < 0.05). Ejection fractions determined by echocardiography at the time of presentation were significantly lower in the patients with myocarditis compared with the control group (P < 0.05). A statistically significant difference was identified between Tp-e/corrected QT interval (QTc) ratios investigated in DI and V2 derivations in patient and control groups.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) sting: Randomised open label clinical trial [^113kd8nM]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

Demographic factors and clinical characteristics were summarized as counts (percentages) for categorical variables and as mean (standard deviation; SD) for normally distributed continuous variables. All patients who had been randomly assigned to a treatment group were included in the intention-to-treat analyses.

The groups were compared using χ² test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, unpaired t-test for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for other continuous variables. We analyzed results with SPSS 17 software. Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured at different time points and were repeated factors, and treatment group was included as a between-participant measure. α was set at 0.05. We used the Greenhouse-Geisser P value.

Between March 2009 and February 2010, we recruited patients who reported to Bawaskar Hospital and Mahad research centre after being stung by Mesobuthus tamulus.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) sting: Randomised open label clinical trial [^116aSY2E]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Patients were eligible for enrollment if they reported to the hospital with a Mesobuthus tamulus sting of clinical grade 2 severity, with an interval of less than six hours between the sting and hospital admission, and were older than six months. A Mesobuthus tamulus sting was confirmed if the victim or bystander had seen a red scorpion, brought in the killed specimen, or recognized the hospital's preserved specimen. In this way, we ensured that Mesobuthus tamulus was not confused with Palamneus gravimanus, a larger scorpion that is less lethal and causes only severe local pain without systemic involvement or transient reversible cardiovascular effects. Major exclusion criteria were: reporting six hours after the sting, pregnancy, history of taking prazosin or antivenom, history of bronchial asthma, history of allergic reaction to foreign serum, and refusal to give consent.

Written informed consent was obtained in the local language. For illiterate adults, a literate relative of the patient read the statement out loud to them, and consent was obtained by thumb impression witnessed by the relative. Parent consent was obtained for minor children. The study protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee of Mumbai (registration number 1433/1999G.B.B.S.D, IEC/08/39). All individuals admitted with a scorpion sting between March 2009 and February 2010 were insured by the Oriental Insurance Company Limited clinical trial liability cover policy No 111600/48/2009/227.

### Scorpion stings presenting to an emergency department in Singapore with special reference to Isometrus maculatus [^111DT7qt]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We describe the epidemiology and clinical features of scorpion stings presenting to an emergency department in Singapore, including that of the venomous species Isometrus maculatus. A management approach to scorpion stings is proposed.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted for patients from 2004 to 2009. Cases were identified by searching through emergency department records with ICD code E905, inpatient records, and the hospital toxicology service records. Identification of species was assisted by the Venom and Toxin Research Program at the National University of Singapore.

- **Results**: A total of 13 cases of scorpion stings were identified. Eleven stings occurred locally, and the remaining two stings occurred in neighboring countries. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (92%), numbness (31%), and weakness (23%) confined to the region of the sting. The most common clinical signs recorded were redness (77%), tenderness (77%), and swelling (46%). Only two patients had significant alterations of vital signs: one had hypertension, and the other had hypotension from anaphylaxis. Three patients experienced complications (abscess formation, anaphylaxis, cellulitis) requiring inpatient management. There were no fatalities, and all patients made a good recovery. Three cases were identified to be stings from I. maculatus. These cases occurred locally and mainly had clinical features of pain, redness, and mild regional numbness.

- **Conclusions**: Scorpion stings are uncommon presentations to the emergency department. Most stings cause local reactions that can be managed with appropriate care.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^1156G1FM]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Scorpion envenomation can be associated with a range of symptoms and conditions, including cardiogenic shock, acute pancreatitis, swelling, dystonia, muscle fasciculations, and seizures. Additional symptoms may include tremor, seizure activity, and autonomic dysfunction such as hyperlacrimation, increased blood glucose, burning pain, and skin erythema. It can also lead to abdominal pain, electrocardiographic changes such as right bundle branch block (RBBB), T wave inversion, ST-segment changes, tachycardia, myocarditis, and left bundle branch block (LBBB).

Patients may experience various neurological and systemic reactions, including hemolytic anemia, fever, hyperesthesia, restlessness, increased serum creatinine, paresthesia, positive urine hemoglobin, vomiting, pulmonary edema, and gangrene. Other possible outcomes include numbness, purpura, miosis, diarrhea, priapism, hypersalivation, muscle spasms, pruritus, bradycardia, petechiae, pain, diaphoresis, hypertension, hypotension, and mydriasis.

### Case report: Scorpion envenomation with delayed ischemic priapism in a preadolescent-an unusual presentation [^111phYTN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Low credibility.

Priapism as a complication of scorpionism in children is rare and is categorized as grade II of severity. The pathogenesis involves activation of parasympathetic pathways that stimulate the release of acetylcholine. An 8-year-old boy, with a known case of steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, presented with a history of persistent penile erection for the previous 12 hours. He had a history of being stung by a black scorpion (*Heterometrus swammerdami*) on his right leg 4 days earlier.

He was given adequate analgesia, and prazosin was started at 30 µg/kg/dose due to parasympathetic overactivity. Doppler ultrasonography of the penile shaft showed a bilateral thickened, bulky, and edematous corpus cavernosa and no arterial flow due to venous congestion, suggesting ischemic (low-flow) priapism. Detumescence was not accomplished with saline irrigation and aspiration, or with intracorporeal irrigation with phenylephrine. Thus, a distal T-shunt was performed. This case illustrates an interesting instance of scorpion envenomation with delayed ischemic priapism.

### A relationship between clinical and laboratory characteristics in children with severe scorpion envenomation in Çukurova, Turkey [^116em8Nh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Scorpion stings are an important health problem in many parts of the world. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine cases of scorpion stings to evaluate their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory features, and to determine strategies that can reduce morbidity and mortality in these cases.

- **Methods**: Scorpion stings experienced by children between 2007 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were categorized into groups based on the severity of toxicities, and demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were compared between the groups.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD age of the 189 patients with scorpion stings was 83.43 ± 59.62 months. There was a significant difference between the clinical stages and the age distribution of the cases (P < 0.05). White blood cell counts differed significantly between the groups (P < 0.05). There was not a significant difference in mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width between the groups, but plateletcrit and low platelet count were significantly different between stage 1 and stage 3 cases (P < 0.05). Glucose, creatinine kinase-myoglobin binding, and troponin I were also significantly different (P < 0.05). The mortality rate was 0%.

- **Conclusions**: People living in regions where scorpion stings are frequent should be informed about preventive measures against these stings. Cases of scorpion stings should be monitored in appropriate centers, and staff offering care to these cases should be educated about treatment methods. In addition, treatment protocols should be determined in accordance with regional and clinical characteristics.

### Stingray envenomation: a retrospective review of clinical presentation and treatment in 119 cases [^112WE39u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Stingray stings are common along coastal regions of this country and the world. The tail of the stingray contains a barbed stinger attached to a venom gland and is enclosed within an integumentary sheath. During a sting, the stinger and sheath can become embedded in the soft tissue of the victim, and venom is injected into the wound. Stingray venom most often causes severe pain on contact, although the exact mechanism of toxicity is not certain.

Hot water immersion of the stung extremity has been reported to be effective in relieving pain associated with the envenomation, but large studies of this therapy have not been performed. We retrospectively reviewed stingray stings presenting to our Emergency Department (ED) over an 8-year period.

- **Group categorization**: Cases were divided into acute (group 1, within 24 hours of the sting) and subacute (group 2, 24 hours or more after the sting) presentations.
- **Data abstraction**: Charts were abstracted for information concerning the victim's history, physical examination, treatment, diagnostic imaging, and outcome. This included the effectiveness of hot water immersion as analgesia and the use of antimicrobials.

A total of 119 cases were identified and abstracted: 100 in group 1 and 19 in group 2. Of the group 1 patients initially treated with hot water immersion alone, 88% had complete relief of pain within 30 minutes without the administration of any other analgesic. In patients who initially received a dose of analgesic along with hot water immersion, none required a second dose of analgesics, and all had complete pain relief before discharge. There were no adverse effects, such as thermal burns.

### Scorpion stings in Jordan: An update [^111icjGQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Scorpionism is an endemic public health problem in Jordan encountered by health providers in all parts of the country. This study updates epidemiological data on scorpion sting encounters in Jordan.

- **Methods**: Data on scorpion sting encounters were obtained from government and military hospitals around the country, and the National Drug and Poison Information Center (NDPIC). P values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the SPSS Professional Statistics Package version 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) program.

- **Results**: Epidemiological data on 1,205 scorpion sting cases reported between 2006 and 2012 are presented. The male-to-female ratio was 1.18:1, with ages of 23.3 ± 16 (mean ± SD) and 26.4 ± 16.9 years for males and females, respectively. Age groups between 1 to 20 years old constituted 44.6% of the total sting encounters, while adults aged over 30 years constituted 30%. Scorpion sting encounters peaked in July (22.5%) and August (23%), with the lowest numbers of recorded cases in February (1.6%) and January (1.9%). Scorpion stings occurred mostly outdoors (66%). Medical complications associated with scorpion sting cases included fever, difficulty in breathing, drowsiness and dizziness, and numbness, while severe complications included respiratory failure and tachycardia. Hospitalization required 1 to 3 days among admitted patients with no fatalities.

- **Conclusions**: Scorpion stings remain a medical problem in Jordan that requires more attention from health providers. Reporting of scorpion sting cases should be enforced from all healthcare centers throughout the country.

### Presumed insect sting-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^115ebVV5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

This case posed several clinical dilemmas. First, we asked whether the patient had experienced true anaphylaxis, as her initial presentation was limited to a large local reaction (LLR) with delayed cardiac symptoms that resolved without epinephrine administration. Unfortunately, her serum tryptase level was not measured in the emergency department. Multidisciplinary discussions with academic allergists and cardiologists determined that a plausible explanation for her LLR and delayed-onset Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) was a hypersensitivity reaction to an insect sting.

The second clinical challenge was weighing the risks and benefits of venom immunotherapy (VIT) in a patient with cardiovascular comorbidities (i.e. TCM) who was prescribed an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and β-blocker. To mitigate the risks of systemic reaction to VIT, we modified the venom desensitization protocol and allowed the patient to continue taking her cardioprotective medications.

The third clinical challenge was related to the provision of an epinephrine autoinjector. There are known risks of anaphylaxis and TCM relapse due to catecholamine surge induced by future insect stings and/or epinephrine use. Observational studies have shown an increased risk of systemic reactions with subsequent insect stings in patients who have previously experienced allergic sting reactions and a greater risk in those who have had more severe reactions. Theoretically, our patient had an LLR, which carries a 10% risk of future systemic reaction and less than a 5% risk of anaphylaxis. Nonetheless, the patient expressed a great fear of future stings and made an informed decision to pursue VIT and carry an epinephrine autoinjector.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of pediatric scorpion stings: A report from southern Iran [^114XRgqz]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Scorpion stings are a major public health problem in many countries, particularly where pediatric populations are concerned. Children are more susceptible to severe clinical manifestations of envenomation. This study aims to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric scorpionism in the Hormozgan province of Iran during 2012.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted during 2010 in Hormozgan, the southern province of Iran. We included 350 patients admitted to the emergency units of hospitals in 8 cities of Hormozgan with suspected scorpion envenomation. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, as well as the treatment and outcomes, were recorded.

The prevalence rate of pediatric scorpion stings in the province was 1.8 in 1000 children. The mean age of the patients was 5.75 ± 4.54 years (range, 1–18 years). There were 208 (59.5%) boys and 142 (40.5%) girls among the patients. The most common sting site was from the sole to the knee in 94 cases (26.8%), followed by the hand in 61 cases (17.4%) and fingers in 47 cases (13.4%). The most common presenting symptom was vomiting in 236 cases (67.4%), followed by localized pain in 131 cases (37.3%), erythema in 120 cases (34.2%), and edema in 119 cases (33.9%). The highest frequency of stings occurred in July (17.7%), and the lowest in January (3.2%). Nocturnal envenomations (53.7%) were more common than diurnal stings (46.3%). Most of the scorpionism cases were mild (83.4%) and resolved without fatalities.

The results demonstrate that pediatric scorpionism is a public health problem in the Hormozgan province of Iran, requiring special attention.

### Meta-analysis of controlled studies on immunotherapy in severe scorpion envenomation [^1174HUCk]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Despite conflicting evidence, specific serotherapy is recommended for scorpion envenomation. A meta-analysis of prospective or observational controlled studies was performed, comparing intravenous scorpion antivenin (SAV) with a control. Binary outcomes are reported as risk differences for clinical improvement and mortality rates. The analysis was conducted both for the overall number of included studies and for two subgroups set up according to the geographic origin of scorpions.

Nine studies (four randomized controlled trials and five observational) enrolling 687 patients were identified. Six studies dealt with Old World scorpions, and three originated from Arizona. Overall, the rate of clinical improvement was similar in SAV-treated and untreated patients (risk difference = 0.22, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.79; p = 0.45 for effect). Subgroup analysis showed favorable effects of SAV in Arizona scorpion envenomation (risk difference = 0.53; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91; p < 0.001) and non-significant unfavorable effects in Old World scorpion envenomation (risk difference = -0.05; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.18; p = 0.65; p = 0.003 for z-value, indicating a true heterogeneity of treatment effects). In Old World scorpion envenomation, there was no statistical difference in the risk of death between SAV-treated and untreated patients (risk difference = 0.007, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; p = 0.6 for effect). Overall, administration of scorpion antivenin was associated with a reduction of 13 hours in the mean time of symptom resolution (95% CI -17 to -9; p < 0.0001). Serious adverse events were noted.

### Comparison of intravenous paracetamol, dexketoprofen trometamol, or topical lidocaine use for pain relief in scorpion stings: A placebo-controlled, randomized study [^1146Dyuq]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

After a scorpion sting, patients commonly present to hospitals with pain. Our study sought to compare the analgesic efficacy of IV paracetamol, IV dexketoprofen trometamol, topical lidocaine, and placebo in patients reporting pain after presenting with a history of scorpion sting.

- **Methods**: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital. Adult patients who presented with the complaint of pain following a scorpion sting and did not have systemic findings were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: IV paracetamol, IV dexketoprofen trometamol, topical lidocaine, and placebo. The visual analog scale scores were measured at the time of presentation to the emergency department and at 30 and 60 minutes to determine the pain intensity.

- **Results**: The study included 106 patients, of whom 30 were in the paracetamol group, 26 in the dexketoprofen trometamol group, 25 in the topical lidocaine group, and 25 in the placebo group. We did not find a different analgesic effect among the groups in the first 30 minutes (P = 0.185). IV paracetamol, dexketoprofen trometamol, and topical lidocaine did not show different analgesic effects in the first 60 minutes (P > 0.05). IV paracetamol and dexketoprofen trometamol were found to provide more effective analgesia than the placebo at 60 minutes (P < 0.05). The analgesic effects of topical lidocaine and placebo did not differ (P = 0.330).

- **Conclusions**: IV paracetamol and IV dexketoprofen trometamol provided analgesia in the first 60 minutes, similar to topical lidocaine but superior to placebo.

### Opposing roles of LTB4 and PGE2 in regulating the inflammasome-dependent scorpion venom-induced mortality [^116KHEbS]. Nature Communications (2016). Low credibility.

Incidences of scorpion stings have surpassed 1.2 million a year and are a serious health problem worldwide, resulting in severe wounds and more than 3,000 deaths annually. Clinical manifestations of severe scorpion envenomation include local pain and multi-organ failure, such as cardiogenic shock and pulmonary oedema. Scorpion antiserum is the only available treatment, but it is not always effective and might induce adverse effects. To develop a specific and effective treatment, it is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of the reaction induced by a scorpion sting.

Human envenomation by Tityus serrulatus venom (TsV) induces a massive and fast release of cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α factor. Animal models of envenomation have been instrumental in characterizing the inflammatory response and cell activation induced by TsV. TsV or venom-associated molecular patterns (VAMPs) act in a way analogous to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns. They are also recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in leukocytes. The recognition of TsV by PRRs induces NFκB and AP-1 or PPAR-γ activation, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids.

### Snakebite envenoming in Africa remains widely neglected and demands multidisciplinary attention [^1122KFxv]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Public health measures are inadequate. A key factor of snakebite-related morbidity and mortality in Africa is poverty and unequal access to safe and effective medical care. Snakebite envenoming is rarely fatal if appropriately managed; however, poorly equipped clinics in rural areas and inadequate training in snakebite management for medical professionals negatively affect treatment outcomes following snakebite.

Public healthcare infrastructure and workforce are chronically underfunded in most African countries, and structural and financial barriers impede health-related research, which is much needed with regard to snakebite. Surveys revealed that the utilization of unproven traditional remedies is common, and the practice base, as well as the expertise of healthcare workers, is low in many health facilities. Additionally, late treatment is a common feature after African snakebite incidences, and hospital admission delays frequently exceed 24 hours, amplifying the risk for disabling or life-threatening complications. An underrepresentation in the registration of patients bitten by neurotoxic species in hospital admissions might be a direct consequence of such delays, as these venoms can result in rapid respiratory failure.

Case reports demonstrate that even envenoming by snakes considered less toxic can cause death before patients arrive at a clinic. Once a health facility is reached, treatment options are often suboptimal, with essential medicines such as antivenom lacking.

### A stinging suspicion something was just not right: Methamphetamine toxicity in infant mimics scorpion envenomation [^114SomLZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

The sting from Centruroides sculpturatus, commonly known as the bark scorpion, is a serious medical problem and can be potentially fatal to young children. Centruroides sculpturatus envenomation can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms, often including autonomic dysfunction, cranial nerve abnormalities, and somatic motor abnormalities. We discuss a 6-month-old male infant who presented with signs and symptoms consistent with bark scorpion envenomation, later found to be secondary to methamphetamine toxicity. Emergency pediatricians should be aware of the strong similarities between scorpion envenomation and methamphetamine toxicity in pediatric patients residing in or having visited the southwestern region of the United States. Methamphetamine toxicity should be considered in their differential diagnosis.

### Acute myocardial infarction following scorpion sting in a case with obstructive coronary artery disease [^111wPmpx]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) following a scorpion sting has been very rarely reported in the previous literature. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms include severe hypotension due to hypovolemic shock and coronary spasm with subsequent thrombosis of coronary vessels developed after the release of vasoactive, inflammatory, and thrombogenic substances contained in the scorpion venom. All of the previously reported cases had a normal coronary angiogram. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with a severe scorpion sting and was treated with prazosin, but a few hours later, she developed acute anterior wall MI. The coronary angiogram revealed the presence of significant stenosis in coronary arteries. As acute MI owing to significant coronary artery disease can be evident after severe scorpion envenomation, every case of acute coronary syndrome following a scorpion sting needs early diagnosis, thorough cardiovascular evaluation, and appropriate treatment.

### Scorpionism in the state of Bahia, Brazil: A more neglected problem during the pandemic [^112G195D]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

During the confinement in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the production of urban waste, elevating the risk of accidents caused by scorpions. This study sought to determine the clinical and epidemiological aspects of scorpionism records in the seven mesoregions of the State of Bahia, Brazil, examining differences in periods before and during the pandemic.

Methods: Data were obtained from SINAN, Brazil's Notifiable Diseases Information System (January 2010-December 2021). Measures of morbidity (incidence and lethality) and mortality were evaluated, comparing the averages before (2018 and 2019) and during the pandemic (2020 and 2021). Sociodemographic data (i.e.g.ender, age group, and race) and conditions of care (i.e. time, classification, and evolution) were compared by mesoregion.

Results: A total of 159,982 cases of scorpionism were registered, with a higher proportion in the pre-pandemic period (P < 0.05) and a higher average incidence in the Center South of Bahia (267.32; n = 82,059; 51.29%). Most cases occurred in mixed-race individuals (61.73%), females (n = 81,292; 51.22%), and individuals between 20 and 39 years of age (n = 48,876; 30.55%). Most cases were classified as mild (n = 136,816; 85.52%), were attended to in less than 1 hour (n = 81,941; 51.22%), and progressed to cure (n = 142,082; 88.81%). There were 263 deaths (0.16%), with a mortality rate of 1.77/100,000 inhabitants and a lethality rate of 0.16%.

Conclusion: It is suggested that during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the upward curve of accidents, social isolation measures and collective fear may have decreased the search for medical attention.

### Does this patient have a severe snake envenomation? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^114FGrWo]. JAMA Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Venomous snakebite severity ranges from an asymptomatic dry bite to severe envenomation and death. The clinical evaluation aids in prognosis and is essential to determine the risks and potential benefits of antivenom treatment.

- **Objectives**: To identify historical features, clinical examination findings, basic laboratory testing, and clinical grading scales that will risk-stratify patients with pit viper snake envenomation for severe systemic envenomation, severe tissue injury, and/or severe hematologic venom effects.

- **Data sources**: We conducted a structured search of PubMed (1966-October 3, 2017) and the Embase database (1980-October 3, 2017) to identify English-language studies that evaluated clinical features predictive of severe envenomation.

- **Study selection**: We included studies that evaluated the test performance of at least 1 clinical finding with an acceptable reference standard of severe envenomation for venomous snakes of the Western Hemisphere. Only studies involving the most common subfamily, Crotalinae (pit vipers), were evaluated. Seventeen studies with data were available for abstraction.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The clinical features assessed and severity outcome measures were extracted from each original study. We assessed severity in three categories: systemic toxicity, tissue injury, and hematologic effects. Differences were resolved by author consensus.

- **Results**: The pooled prevalence of severe systemic envenomation was 14% (95% CI, 9%-21%). The pooled prevalence of severe tissue injury and severe hematologic venom effects were 14% (95% CI, 12%-).

### Clinical presentation and outcomes associated with different treatment modalities for pediatric bark scorpion envenomation [^112FuUwh]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Scorpion envenomation is potentially life-threatening and affects children in the Southwestern USA. An FDA-approved antivenom is available, but its high cost has led to the use of off-label antivenom dosing or supportive care alone as alternatives to FDA-recommended dosing. This study sought to determine whether the treatment approach influences outcomes in envenomated children.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study of children with grade III or IV scorpion envenomation was evaluated in Phoenix Children's Hospital ED between September 1, 2011, and March 31, 2014. Patients were grouped based on treatment: group 1, supportive care only; group 2, FDA-recommended dosing (3-vial initial dose); group 3, "off label" dosing (1–2 vial initial dose). Primary outcomes were ED length of stay and hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation and aspiration pneumonia.

- **Results**: One hundred fifty-six patients were included, with 58 patients in group 1, 16 patients in group 2, and 82 patients in group 3. Group 1 was significantly older than the antivenom groups (p < 0.001), and group 2 was younger than group 3 (p = 0.024). Envenomation grade was also different, with group 1 having fewer grade IV patients than groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.001). Three percent of group 1, 56% of group 2, and 28% of group 3 experienced respiratory distress (p < 0.001). ED length of stay was not significantly different between groups. Hospital admission occurred in 3.4% of group 1, no patients in group 2, and 8.5% of group 3. Two intubations and two aspirations occurred in group 3.

### Clinical management of North American snake and marine envenomations [^112TM2wf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Envenomations are the 23rd most common reason for calls to US poison control centers, with over 35,000 incidents reported annually. Snake bites account for over 20% of those calls, while marine envenomations are likely underreported at 3% to 4%. While these types of envenomations may not be encountered on a daily basis for many physicians, the different types of envenomations warrant unique management strategies based on the offending creature and symptom presentation. This text serves as a review of the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and management of endemic North American species of snakes and marine vertebrate and invertebrate envenomations.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) sting: Randomised open label clinical trial [^112rTFPM]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Mesobuthus tamulus is not the only venomous scorpion in the state of western Maharashtra, but it may be the only dangerously venomous scorpion in the Mahad area. Haffkine Biopharma, based in Mumbai, has been manufacturing monovalent anti-scorpion venom serum F(ab)² against Mesobuthus tamulus since 1997, making it available for clinical use in a rural setting since 2002. Studies conducted at different times indicate that the antivenom is potent; 1 mL of reconstituted anti-scorpion venom serum neutralized 1.2 mg of Indian red scorpion venom via the intravenous route in an in vivo study with mice. The maximum volume of venom injected in one sting by the Indian red scorpion is 1.5 mg, and each mL of antivenom is capable of neutralizing 1.2 to 1.5 mg of venom.

A single 30 mL dose of Haffkine Biopharma monovalent antivenom (batch no SS811001, manufacturing date November 2008, expiry date April 2013) was added to 100 mL of normal saline, which was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, irrespective of the patient's age. During the infusion, the patient was closely observed for reactions to the serum, such as sudden onset of vomiting, urticaria, hypotension, tachycardia, bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, or anaphylaxis.

Oral prazosin (batch no ML.NH 138 batch no GK 60372, manufactured 04/2006, expiry 03/2011, and ML.NH 138 batch no GK 80282, manufactured 02/2008, expiry 01/2013) was administered at a dose of 250 µg for children up to 18 years and 500 µg for adults. The same dose was repeated at intervals of 3 hours until the extremities were cold. Similar doses were administered in both rand.

### A clinical score predicting the need for hospitalization in scorpion envenomation [^113hdxys]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Predicting complications is a clinical challenge in the assessment of victims of scorpion envenomation (SE). We sought to develop a clinical score to predict the need for hospitalization following a scorpion sting.

- **Methods**: We prospectively collected data from patients attending the emergency department after SE in derivation (n = 868) and validation groups (n = 435). A score was derived from multiple regression analyses using clinical variables as dependent variables and hospitalization as an independent variable.

- **Results**: The discrimination power of the constructed score was good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 and 0.83 in the derivation and validation groups, respectively. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that the score performed well in both groups (P = 0.88 and P = 0.67, respectively). The score has good sensitivity and a negative predictive value at a cutoff value of 2.

- **Conclusion**: Our clinical score could be used for efficient hospital admission decisions in patients who are victims of SE.

### Ischemic stroke in a child following a probable scorpion sting [^115t1D5x]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Scorpion stings are common emergencies in the tropics. Species-specific antivenom therapies are available; however, fatalities resulting from scorpion stings remain a public health concern in many settings. Children residing in rural towns and peri-urban areas represent the most vulnerable populations.

Delays in the diagnosis of scorpion stings often occur due to the non-specific clinical presentations, which can lead to life-threatening complications. We report a case involving a 2-year-old Venezuelan boy who presented with acute pancreatitis and pulmonary edema without an identifiable cause 48 hours after his initial symptoms. We administered antivenom therapy when an undetected scorpion sting was suspected.

Despite some initial clinical improvement in his acute pancreatitis, pulmonary edema, and coagulation abnormalities, our patient experienced an ischemic stroke. Fortunately, he demonstrated some neurological improvement. Although acute pancreatitis and pulmonary edema are known end-organ damage manifestations of the sting of Tityus in the Americas, our case illustrates the risk of ischemic stroke.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^113aoMeX]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Arthropods, including insects and arachnids, significantly affect humans as vectors for infectious diseases. Arthropod bites and stings commonly cause minor, usually self-limited reactions; however, some species are associated with more severe complications.

- **Spider bites**: Spider bites are rarely life-threatening. There are two medically relevant spiders in the United States. Widow spider (Latrodectus) envenomation can cause muscle spasm and severe pain that should be treated with analgesics and benzodiazepines. Antivenom is not widely available in the United States but may be considered for severe, refractory cases. Recluse spider (Loxosceles) bites are often overdiagnosed, should be treated supportively, and only rarely cause skin necrosis.

- **Scorpion envenomation**: Centruroides scorpions are the only medically relevant genus in the United States. Envenomation causes neuromuscular and autonomic dysfunction, which should be treated with analgesics, benzodiazepines, supportive care, and, in severe cases, antivenom.

- **Hymenoptera stings**: Hymenoptera, specifically bees, wasps, hornets, and fire ants, account for the most arthropod-related deaths in humans, most commonly by severe allergic reactions to envenomation. In severe cases, patients are treated with analgesia, local wound care, and systemic glucocorticoids.

- **Diptera bites**: Diptera include flies and mosquitoes. The direct effects of their bites are usually minor and treated symptomatically; however, they are vectors for numerous infectious diseases.

Arthropod bite and sting prevention strategies include avoiding high-risk areas, covering exposed skin, and wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing.

Evaluation of clinical grade

Cases are graded according to the severity of clinical manifestations on arrival at the hospital. The severity of clinical manifestations, morbidity, and mortality depend on the time lapsed between the sting and hospital admission, as well as the grade of a case on arrival.

Patients with grade 2 signs and symptoms were included in the present study. After giving written consent, all eligible patients were examined by one of the two authors, and baseline data were recorded on a standard form. Data included age, sex, time between sting and hospital admission, and history of any medication before admission, such as vomiting soon after the sting, or paraesthesia (tingling and numbness in the perioral region, or sometimes reported by the patient to be felt all over the body).

One of the authors sat by the side of the patients and closely clinically examined them for signs and symptoms of systemic manifestations:

- **Presence of systemic manifestations**: Profuse sweating all over the body, ropey salivation, priapism in men, heart murmur, coolness of the extremities.

- **Monitoring**: Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored on a multipara monitor. These findings were noted on admission at 00:00, at 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 hours. Subsequent improvement or deteriorations to grade 3 or 4 were closely followed by the author who examined the patient on arrival. Blood was collected from all participants on admission for measurement of haemoglobin, white cell count, and creatine kinase-MB. A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was done on admission.

### Managing snakebite [^11785DX9]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Rural and remote primary care centers are often the first point of medical aid for people with a snakebite. Laboratory and intensive care services at such facilities are often limited. A competent clinical assessment is vital to guide management and referral decisions.

Snakebite envenoming can quickly worsen into a life-threatening emergency. Assess vital parameters to identify if the patient is critical or at risk for shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. Published severity scores for snakebite are unreliable. The Glasgow Coma Scale score and pupillary reactions can be misleading in patients with advanced paralysis who are unable to open their eyes or respond to painful stimuli and should be avoided in these circumstances.

- **History**: Reassure clinically stable patients and ask about their symptoms to determine the presence, nature, and extent of envenoming. Details about the site, circumstances, and timing of the bite can reflect distinctive features of epidemiology, habitats, and periods of activity of medically important snakes locally and help infer likely biting species. Inquire about medications, substance use, and comorbidities as these can influence diagnosis and outcomes. Recent ethanol or recreational drug use may modify presenting symptoms. Antiplatelets or anticoagulants may worsen bleeding and interfere with key blood tests. Shock in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease can precipitate a myocardial infarction.

### Scorpion sting: Eclampsia [^115L8wV6]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Scorpion stings are common in many regions of the world, particularly in rural areas. While most stings are harmless and tend to be milder, some can result in severe clinical complications affecting the neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Although the literature contains many studies related to scorpion stings, there is limited data on the effects of scorpion stings in pregnant women. The authors have not encountered any case reports of eclampsia as a complication of scorpion stings. With this study, the authors aimed to discuss a scorpion sting leading to an unexpected complication: eclampsia.
