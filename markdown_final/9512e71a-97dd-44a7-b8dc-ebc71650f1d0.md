## Question

Which factors underlie paradoxical responses to antihistamines in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which factors underlie paradoxical responses to antihistamines in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what constitutes a paradoxical response and identifying documented pediatric patterns. Then, I should examine patient-related and drug-related contributors. Next, I will consider pharmacologic mechanisms and clinical context that modulate risk. After that, I must appraise the quality of evidence and gaps. Finally, I will derive practical, safety-focused recommendations for clinicians while verifying where the evidence is strong versus uncertain [^111CAvra] [^111YxUfb].

> Let me first confirm the working definition and expected effects. H1-antihistamines are intended to attenuate allergic symptoms, and many first-generation agents also cause sedation due to central H1 blockade; a paradoxical response is when the opposite occurs, such as CNS excitation or even an allergic reaction to the antihistamine itself, particularly reported in pediatrics and in specific contexts like overdose or very young children, so I need to ensure these scenarios are well delineated [^111CAvra] [^112FJJ9p] [^111YxUfb].

> Next, I should review the documented paradox patterns. First, CNS stimulation with first-generation agents is classically described in overdose, with labels explicitly warning that stimulation is particularly likely in pediatric patients, which is the archetypal paradox relative to expected sedation; wait, let me verify the label language before proceeding, yes, the FDA diphenhydramine labeling states this clearly [^111CAvra]. Second, paradoxical excitation and agitation with sedating antihistamines used as sleep aids may occur in children under 5 years, especially in neurodevelopmental populations, which requires caution and close monitoring, and I should confirm that this is guideline-level content, which it is in contemporary pediatric autism pharmacology guidance [^111YxUfb]. Third, although rare, IgE-mediated allergy to antihistamines themselves has been reported, including anaphylaxis to mizolastine, which is paradoxical from an immunologic standpoint and signals idiosyncratic hypersensitivity potential in select children [^115KYwxd]. A small school-based randomized study did not find short-term learning impairment with diphenhydramine versus loratadine, which does not negate paradoxical reactions but reminds me that CNS effects vary among children and across doses and settings [^1147b3CG].

> Now, I will examine patient-related factors that might increase paradox risk. Age is key: infants and preschoolers have developmental pharmacology differences, including immature blood–brain barrier and variable clearance, and the pediatric pharmacokinetics of H1-antihistamines have historically been underinvestigated, especially in infants and young children, which can magnify CNS effects or make dosing imprecise; I should double-check this gap is highlighted in pediatric antihistamine reviews, which it is [^112FJJ9p]. Genetic or immune predisposition may permit antihistamine molecules to act as allergens in a minority of children, consistent with broader pediatric drug hypersensitivity variability and the need for careful diagnostic workup to avoid mislabeling, so I need to keep differential diagnoses open and consider formal allergy evaluation when histories are compelling [^11714iTT] [^1154T6x3].

> Let me consider drug-related contributors next. First-generation antihistamines cross the blood–brain barrier and exhibit anticholinergic effects, which raises the likelihood of CNS excitation at higher exposures, whereas second-generation agents have greater peripheral selectivity and lower CNS penetration, reducing but not eliminating risk for unexpected reactions; I should confirm this generational distinction in pharmacology summaries, which is supported [^112FJJ9p]. Dose clearly matters: paradoxical stimulation is particularly associated with overdosage in pediatrics, so meticulous weight-based dosing and caregiver education are critical to avoid supratherapeutic exposures and dosing errors, and I need to emphasize that stimulant use is not advised in antihistamine overdose management per labeling [^111CAvra]. Additionally, newer antihistamines may involve active metabolites with differing pharmacokinetic profiles, introducing interindividual variability that could contribute to unexpected CNS or peripheral effects in some children [^112FJJ9p].

> I will now examine plausible pharmacologic mechanisms. For centrally acting agents, robust BBB penetration means that at high concentrations or in susceptible brains, net network effects may flip from sedation to paradoxical arousal via complex histaminergic and off-target neurotransmitter interactions, although mechanistic certainty is limited and likely multifactorial in young children; I need to acknowledge this uncertainty explicitly given the evidence base [^112FJJ9p]. Beyond H1 antagonism, off-target or pleiotropic actions may play a role; rupatadine, for example, has dual H1 and platelet-activating factor receptor antagonism, underscoring that some antihistamines modulate multiple inflammatory pathways, which could theoretically alter clinical phenotypes in idiosyncratic ways, though direct links to paradoxical excitation are not established [^11712gB2]. For immunologic paradox, antihistamine molecules can rarely be recognized as allergens and elicit IgE-mediated reactions, situating these events within the broader landscape of drug hypersensitivity seen increasingly in pediatrics and emphasizing the need for structured evaluation to confirm or de-label suspected allergy [^1154T6x3] [^115KYwxd].

> But wait, clinical context can tilt observed responses, so I need to think about how use-case and comorbidities influence risk. When sedating antihistamines are used off-label for pediatric insomnia, especially in children under 5 years or with neurodevelopmental conditions, paradoxical activation is more likely and long-term use is discouraged, so I should counsel families accordingly and prefer behavioral sleep strategies first line [^111YxUfb]. In acute allergy care, sedating antihistamines can mask lethargy or mimic progression during anaphylaxis, complicating recognition; non-sedating agents are preferred only after stabilization, and epinephrine remains primary therapy, which I must reinforce to avoid delays in life-saving treatment [^113NQupb]. Hold on, I initially thought antihistamines might prevent anaphylaxis progression; let me reconsider that — guidelines and systematic reviews emphasize that antihistamines are adjunctive at best and should not be used in lieu of epinephrine, which corrects my earlier assumption [^114iR816] [^111itN3v] [^112hbs19].

> Next, I should review the strength of the evidence and identify gaps. High-credibility labeling provides clear pediatric warnings for CNS stimulation with antihistamine overdose, making that association reliable for clinical decision-making and patient counseling, whereas much of the paradoxical activation data in young children arises from expert guidance and clinical experience rather than randomized trials, warranting caution and shared decision-making with caregivers [^111CAvra] [^111YxUfb]. For anaphylaxis, contemporary practice parameters and systematic reviews confirm the limited role and evidence base for antihistamines during acute management, with a Cochrane review finding no eligible RCTs for H1-antihistamines in anaphylaxis treatment, which signals a critical evidence gap and reinforces epinephrine primacy in emergencies [^114iR816] [^111itN3v] [^112hbs19]. Additional pediatric reviews underscore that outcome measures and high-quality efficacy data for adjunctive therapies are sparse, highlighting a need for better-designed trials across pediatric age strata [^114Y2KbU].

> I should now translate this into practical clinical implications while verifying specific safety points. First, dose carefully and avoid supratherapeutic exposure, especially with first-generation agents in young children; educate caregivers about product strengths, avoid multi-ingredient preparations, and counsel that agitation, insomnia, or unusual behavior may indicate a paradoxical response requiring discontinuation and reassessment, and remember not to use stimulants if antihistamine overdose occurs per labeling [^111CAvra]. Second, when possible for allergy symptoms, prefer non-sedating second-generation antihistamines to reduce CNS penetration and minimize both sedation and paradoxical excitation risk, acknowledging that individual variability persists in pediatrics due to undercharacterized PK/PD [^112FJJ9p]. Third, in suspected anaphylaxis, do not rely on antihistamines for stabilization or progression prevention; administer intramuscular epinephrine promptly, reserve non-sedating H1 antagonists for persistent cutaneous symptoms after stabilization, and avoid sedating agents that can confound clinical monitoring during the acute phase [^114iR816] [^113NQupb] [^112hbs19].

> I need to ensure pathways for evaluation are clear when reactions are atypical. If the clinical history suggests an immediate hypersensitivity to an antihistamine itself, consider referral for structured drug allergy assessment to avoid long-term mislabeling, recognizing the rarity but real possibility of antihistamine-induced IgE-mediated reactions, and tailor future therapy accordingly with safer alternatives and supervised challenges when indicated [^11714iTT] [^115KYwxd]. Conversely, if paradoxical CNS activation occurred without immunologic features, management typically involves discontinuation, selection of a non-sedating alternative, and documentation to prevent re-exposure, with anticipatory guidance for families about recurrence risk and when to seek care [^112FJJ9p] [^111YxUfb].

> Finally, let me highlight unresolved questions and research needs so we do not overstate certainty. We lack age-stratified, high-quality pediatric pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data that link exposure to paradoxical CNS effects across antihistamine classes, as well as robust trials evaluating behavioral versus pharmacologic sleep interventions where antihistamines are often used off-label in young children; this gap warrants well-designed pediatric studies to clarify risk, optimize dosing, and identify predictors of paradoxical responses, as repeatedly called for in pediatric antihistamine and anaphylaxis evidence reviews [^112FJJ9p] [^112hbs19] [^114Y2KbU].

Paradoxical reactions to antihistamines in children are driven by **CNS stimulation from first-generation antihistamines** [^111CAvra] and **immature hepatic metabolism** that increases active drug exposure. Additional contributors include **genetic polymorphisms** in drug-metabolizing enzymes, pre-existing neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions, and drug interactions that alter antihistamine levels. These reactions are **more common with first-generation agents** [^112FJJ9p] due to their CNS penetration and anticholinergic effects [^115X7uR5], and are exacerbated by **higher doses or prolonged use** [^111CAvra].

---

## Pharmacological properties of antihistamines

Antihistamines are classified as first- and second-generation agents with distinct pharmacological profiles [^112FJJ9p]. First-generation antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine) readily cross the **blood-brain barrier** [^112FJJ9p] and can cause prominent **CNS effects**, including sedation, agitation, and paradoxical excitation [^111CAvra]. Second-generation antihistamines (e.g. cetirizine, loratadine) have **reduced CNS penetration** and **fewer sedative effects** [^113NQupb], though paradoxical reactions can still occur less frequently [^112FJJ9p].

---

## Factors contributing to paradoxical reactions

---

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences

- **Immature hepatic metabolism**: Children, particularly infants and young children, have immature hepatic enzyme systems (e.g. cytochrome P450 enzymes), leading to altered drug metabolism and increased exposure to active metabolites, which may cause CNS stimulation and paradoxical reactions.

- **Immature blood-brain barrier**: The blood-brain barrier in children is less developed, allowing greater CNS penetration of antihistamines, increasing the risk of paradoxical excitation.

- **Dose-dependent effects**: Higher doses or prolonged use of antihistamines can lead to accumulation of active metabolites, increasing the likelihood of paradoxical reactions [^111CAvra].

---

### Genetic predisposition

Genetic polymorphisms in **drug-metabolizing enzymes** (e.g. CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and **histamine receptors** may predispose some children to paradoxical reactions by altering antihistamine metabolism and receptor sensitivity.

---

### Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions

Children with **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder** [^115tWfye] may be more susceptible to paradoxical reactions due to underlying neurochemical differences and heightened sensitivity to CNS-active medications. Children with **autism spectrum disorder** may also exhibit increased medication sensitivity, and antihistamines can sometimes provoke agitation and hyperactivity [^111YxUfb].

---

### Drug interactions and concomitant medications

Concomitant use of medications that inhibit or induce hepatic enzymes can alter antihistamine metabolism and increase the risk of paradoxical reactions. Concurrent **CNS stimulants** or other excitatory medications may further exacerbate these reactions.

---

### Environmental and physiological factors

Sleep deprivation or fatigue may increase susceptibility to **paradoxical excitation** from antihistamines. Underlying medical conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis may also alter physiological responses to these agents, increasing the risk of paradoxical reactions.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Paradoxical reactions to antihistamines in pediatric populations have **significant clinical implications**, including increased risk of adverse events, delayed diagnosis, and prolonged hospital stays. Management strategies include:

- **Careful patient selection**: Avoiding first-generation antihistamines in children with known risk factors (e.g. ADHD, ASD, genetic predisposition).

- **Dose adjustment**: Using the lowest effective dose and avoiding prolonged use of antihistamines [^111CAvra].

- **Monitoring and education**: Educating parents and caregivers about the potential for paradoxical reactions and monitoring children closely after antihistamine administration.

- **Alternative therapies**: Considering alternative medications or non-pharmacological interventions for symptom management.

---

Paradoxical reactions to antihistamines in pediatric populations are influenced by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences, genetic predisposition, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, drug interactions, and environmental factors. Understanding these factors is essential for clinicians to **prevent, recognize, and manage paradoxical reactions** effectively [^112FJJ9p] [^1154T6x3].

### New oral H1 antihistamines in children: Facts and unmet needs [^112FJJ9p]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines differ from first-generation ones because of their elevated specificity and affinity for peripheral H1 receptors and because of their lower penetration to the central nervous system, resulting in fewer sedative effects. Over the last few years, new compounds with different pharmacokinetic properties have been synthesized. More recent improvements of the molecules, generally in the form of active metabolites, led to the synthesis of new-generation antihistamines.

- **Methods**: Recommendations on the minimum criteria required for compounds to be classified as new-generation antihistamines have been recently established by a consensus statement. Historically, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of H1 antihistamines have not been optimally investigated in the pediatric population, especially in infants and young children.

- **Results**: The pharmacology of second-generation H1 antihistamines has been investigated relatively more deeply than older antihistamines in children. However, in the pediatric population, clinical studies with new-generation antihistamines are still limited in number and, with rare exceptions, of brief duration. Comparative trials on the efficacy and safety between different compounds are also lacking.

- **Conclusions**: Properly designed, long-term trials with new-generation H1 antihistamines need to be performed in individual age groups to better define the effects of these drugs across the entire pediatric population.

### Diphenhydramine HCl [^111CAvra]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Overdosage reactions to antihistamines can range from central nervous system depression to stimulation, the latter being particularly likely in pediatric patients. Anticholinergic symptoms such as dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, and gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur. It is advised not to use stimulants in cases of overdosage. However, vasopressors may be administered to treat hypotension.

### Synagis [^111xUpTm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, including fatal cases and other severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported. Permanently discontinue Synagis and administer appropriate medications if such reactions occur.

- **Warnings and precautions**: As with any intramuscular injection, Synagis should be used with caution in children with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Cases of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, including fatal cases, have been documented following initial exposure or re-exposure to Synagis. Other severe acute hypersensitivity reactions may occur upon first exposure or re-exposure. Symptoms can include urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, dyspnea, respiratory failure, cyanosis, hypotonia, hypotension, and unresponsiveness. The connection between these reactions and the development of antibodies to Synagis is unknown. If a significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the use of Synagis should be permanently discontinued. If anaphylaxis or another significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administer appropriate medications, such as epinephrine, and provide supportive care as required. For mild hypersensitivity reactions, clinical judgment should guide the cautious readministration of Synagis.

- **Coagulation disorders**: Synagis is for intramuscular use only. As with any intramuscular injection, caution is advised for children with thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders.

Palivizumab may interfere with immunologically-based RSV diagnostic tests, such as some antigen detection assays.

### Long-term outcomes of oral immunotherapy for anaphylactic egg allergy in children [^1172DKZz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

The OIT protocol is illustrated in Fig. 2. Participants were premedicated with an antihistamine during a 5-day admission, and the home starting dose of egg protein was determined according to an 8-step dosing schedule (62.5–1000 mg) [see Table E2 in the online repository]. During hospitalization, participants consumed cooked egg powder daily; if there were mild or no symptoms, they ingested the same dose the next day. If moderate or severe adverse reactions developed, the dose was reduced by 1 or 2 steps, respectively, and they were discharged after confirmation of being asymptomatic.

After discharge, the home starting dose continued once a day for 1 month while the participant was taking an antihistamine. One month later, if a participant could ingest cooked egg powder without symptoms for 5 consecutive days, the ingestion dose was increased by 1 step, up to 1000 mg (the maintenance dose). As during hospitalization, the dose was reduced if adverse reactions developed at home. Premedication with an antihistamine was terminated when a participant remained asymptomatic for 1 month with daily ingestion of 1000 mg of egg protein.

After 1 year of OIT, if a participant was asymptomatic after taking 1000 mg of egg protein for more than 3 months, they underwent OFC with 3100 mg of egg protein during hospitalization after 2 weeks of complete egg avoidance. Participants who passed OFC with 3100 mg of egg protein were permitted to ingest processed foods containing less than 3 grams.

In the context of medical management for anaphylaxis, particularly concerning corticosteroids and antihistamines, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2020 guidelines advise against the routine administration of corticosteroids and/or antihistamines for the prevention of anaphylaxis in patients with a history of radiocontrast hypersensitivity reactions. This applies if the readministration of a low- or iso-osmolar, non-ionic radiocontrast media agent is necessary.

### Drug hypersensitivity in children: Report from the pediatric task force of the EAACI Drug Allergy Interest Group [^11714iTT]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

When questioned, about 10% of parents report suspected hypersensitivity to at least one drug in their children. However, only a few of these reactions can be confirmed as allergic following a diagnostic workup. There is still a lack of knowledge on drug hypersensitivity (DH) epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and appropriate diagnostic methods, particularly in children. Meanwhile, the tools used for DH management in adults are also applied to children. While this approach appears generally acceptable, some aspects of DH and management differ with age.

Most reactions in children are attributed to betalactams. Some manifestations, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated angioedema and serum sickness-like reactions, are more frequent among young patients compared to adults. Risk factors, such as viral infections, are particularly frequent in children, making the diagnosis challenging. The practicability and validity of skin tests and other diagnostic procedures need further assessment in children.

This study presents an up-to-date review on the epidemiology, clinical spectrum, diagnostic tools, and management of DH in children. A new general algorithm for the study of these reactions in children is proposed. Data are presented, focusing on reported differences between pediatric and adult patients, also identifying unmet needs to be addressed in further research.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^114vdbbz]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

- **Key finding**: Thirty-four studies, including a systematic review, evaluated the impact of concomitant atopic disease on severity. While diagnosis of asthma was not a risk factor for more severe reactions, it is unclear whether poor asthma control is. In some individuals, active allergic disease of any type may exacerbate severity, but there are no data to suggest an increased risk of fatal or near-fatal outcomes.

Meta-analysis of studies report the impact of asthma on the severity of food-induced allergic reactions. The analysis includes all studies reporting food triggers (A), studies limited to food-triggered reactions only (B), studies reporting intubation (C), or admission to intensive care (D) as the severity outcome, and studies evaluating the impact of asthma on the occurrence of anaphylaxis at food challenge (E). The area of each square is proportional to the sample size of the study. Confidence intervals and heterogeneity (I² values) are reported in Table 2.

### Acute and preventive management of anaphylaxis in German primary school and kindergarten children [^112U3dqT]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In 88.5% (77/87) of the described cases, the allergen responsible for the allergic reaction was identified, while in 11.5% (10/87) of the cases, the triggering allergen remained unknown. Foods were the most common cause, responsible for 59.8% (52/87) of all reactions. Other prevalent triggers were drugs and Hymenoptera stings, both accounting for 6.9% (6/87) each. Among foods, tree nuts were the leading cause, triggering 23.0% (12 cases) of the attacks, followed by peanuts with 16.1% (8 cases), and hen's egg at 12.6% (7 cases).

In total, 52 out of 87 (59.8%) cases of anaphylaxis were treated by a physician, whereas non-professionals administered treatment in 30 cases (34.5%). There was no data on first aid providers in five cases (5.7%). Among children treated by a physician, 37.9% (19 cases) were attended by a pediatrician, and 31.0% (16 cases) received treatment in a hospital. Of those treated in a hospital, 51.9% (8 children) were admitted, while 44.4% (7 children) received outpatient care. Teachers and child-care providers each reported administering therapy in only one case (1.2%) each. Parents performed treatment in 43 (49.4%) of the cases, often providing first aid before consulting a doctor.

- **Medication administered**: Regardless of who administered the medication, 44 children (50.6%) were treated with antihistamines, and/or 32 (36.8%) with corticosteroids. The third most common treatment was the application of inhalable β2-agonists in 17 (19.5%) cases.

### Update on rupatadine in the management of allergic disorders [^11712gB2]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In a review of rupatadine published in 2008, the primary focus was on its role as an antihistamine, with a thorough evaluation of its pharmacology and interaction with histamine H1-receptors. At the time, evidence was already emerging of a broader mechanism of action for rupatadine involving other mediators implicated in the inflammatory cascade.

Over the past few years, the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a potent mediator involved in the hypersensitivity-type allergic reaction has gained greater recognition. Rupatadine has dual affinity for histamine H1-receptors and PAF receptors. In view of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma group's call for oral antihistamines to exhibit additive anti-allergic/anti-inflammatory properties, further exploration of rupatadine's anti-PAF effects was a logical step forward.

New studies have demonstrated that rupatadine inhibits PAF effects in nasal airways and produces a greater reduction in nasal symptoms than levocetirizine. A meta-analysis involving more than 2500 patients has consolidated the clinical evidence for rupatadine in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in adults and children (level of evidence Ia, recommendation A).

Other recent advances include observational studies of rupatadine in everyday clinical practice situations and approval of a new formulation (1 mg/ml oral solution) for use in children. In this reappraisal, we revisit some key properties and pivotal clinical studies of rupatadine and examine new clinical data in more detail, including studies that measured health-related quality of life.

### Incidence, characteristics and risk factors of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized children - a prospective observational cohort study of 6,601 admissions [^1138zkhh]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Most previous pediatric inpatient studies were carried out in general pediatric settings in which only a small number of patients would have undergone general anesthesias (GAs), thus underrepresenting drugs used in pediatric peri-operative and post-operative management. Rashed et al. conducted a pediatric study on general medical wards and reported that anesthetics, which accounted for only 1% of all prescriptions, were among the drugs most commonly implicated in adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

In the two previous inpatient studies investigating pediatric surgical patients and providing medication details, opiate analgesics were among the two most commonly implicated drugs. However, GAs were not included, perhaps because they were not specifically investigated. The differences in our study population, which included a large number of surgical patients (but not those admitted to the PICU immediately post-operatively), are also reflected in the spectrum and severity of common reaction types observed. Some reaction types, such as urinary retention and respiratory depression/arrest, occurred almost exclusively following GA. Eight of the 12 reactions classified as severe in our study occurred following GA.

### Children's school performance is not impaired by short-term administration of diphenhydramine or loratadine [^1147b3CG]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a second-generation H1 antihistamine produces less sedation in children and permits greater learning in a school setting than a classic antihistamine.

- **Study design**: Sixty-three 8- to 10-year-old children with histories of seasonal allergic rhinitis, but no symptoms at the time of the study, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, diphenhydramine, or loratadine. Medications were administered on 3 of 4 study days, twice, 6 hours apart, while participants attended a laboratory school. Classroom testing at the end of each school day evaluated the children's retention of curriculum material. Potential sedative effects were additionally evaluated by self-report of somnolence and computerized reaction-time testing.

- **Results**: No treatment-related differences emerged on the verbal instruction score, reading test score, reaction time, or somnolence scale.

- **Conclusions**: Learning and response time in children attending a laboratory school were not significantly affected by either antihistamine.

### Recent developments and highlights in drug hypersensitivity [^1154T6x3]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are currently the third most common cause of allergies after rhinitis and asthma, with a significant increase in prevalence in both adults and the pediatric population, especially with the advent of new drugs. DHRs thus represent not only a health problem but also a significant financial burden for affected individuals and health systems. Mislabelling DHRs is proving to be a major issue for both falsely labeled drug-allergic individuals and those misidentified as non-allergic. This highlights the need to improve accurate diagnostic approaches that enable appropriate management.

Additionally, there is a need for training both non-allergist stakeholders and patients to enhance reaction identification and thereby reduce mislabeling. The use of allergy cards has been shown to be effective in avoiding the induction of DHRs due to the prescription of incorrect medications. Recent developments over the past two years have highlighted risk factors, diagnostic approaches, mechanisms involved, as well as prevention and management strategies. These studies underscore the need for correct diagnosis and the de-labeling of patients who were previously falsely reported as allergic, which will improve the management and treatment of patients with DHRs.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^115LteXU]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

The recurrence of anaphylaxis symptoms following initial resolution may be a "biphasic" reaction but can also represent (and be difficult to distinguish from) protracted anaphylaxis with a transient response to adrenaline. In the case of food-induced reactions, further allergen absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is possible. Historical guidelines have suggested a rate of up to 20% for biphasic reactions; however, a recent meta-analysis reported a pooled rate of 4.6% (95% CI 4.0–5.3). A rate of 4.7% has been reported in the European Anaphylaxis Registry. In a prospective case series of anaphylaxis presenting to emergency departments, delayed deteriorations were noted in 17% (55/315) of reactions, of which 29 (9.2%) required treatment with adrenaline.

Contradictory ranges for the onset of biphasic symptoms are reported in the literature. The WAO 2011 guideline states that symptoms can recur within 1–72 h (usually within 8–10 h). Median times reported in the literature range from 1.7 (interquartile range 0.7–4.3) hours to 11 h; that is, 50% of biphasic reactions began more than 11 h after initial symptoms. In the European Anaphylaxis Registry, one-third of biphasic reactions occurred more than 12 h after initial symptoms.

The optimal duration of observation following anaphylaxis is unknown. The previous RCUK guideline recommended patients should be observed for at least 6 h, on the basis of data from the UK Fatal Anaphylaxis Register which found that in cases reported to 2000, death never occurred more than 6 h after contact with the trigger. However, in an updated analysis…

### The risk of recurrent anaphylaxis [^112WKx9v]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

To determine the recurrence rate of anaphylaxis in children who were medically attended in an emergency department (ED), we conducted a prospective cohort study. This study aimed to evaluate prehospital and ED management of children with recurrent anaphylaxis and assess factors associated with recurrence.

As part of the Cross-Canada Anaphylaxis Registry, parents of children with anaphylaxis were identified prospectively in three EDs and through an emergency medical response service. They were contacted annually after presentation and queried on subsequent reactions. Factors associated with recurrence were determined using Cox regression analysis.

Among 292 children registered as having medically attended anaphylaxis, 68.5% completed annual follow-up questionnaires. Forty-seven patients experienced 65 episodes of anaphylaxis during 369 patient-years of follow-up. Food was the trigger in 84.6% of cases, and epinephrine was used in 66.2% of these instances. Of those, 50.8% used epinephrine outside a healthcare facility, and 81.7% were subsequently brought to a healthcare facility for treatment. Factors such as asthma, a reaction triggered by food, and the use of epinephrine during the index episode increased the odds of a recurrent reaction. Conversely, patients whose initial reaction was triggered by peanuts were less likely to experience a recurrent reaction.

We report a yearly anaphylaxis recurrence rate of 17.6% in children. There is substantial underuse of epinephrine in cases of anaphylaxis. Educational programs that promote effective avoidance strategies and the prompt use of epinephrine are necessary.

### Case report: Paradoxical responses to short acting beta-agonists in a pediatric patient [^115coHT9]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Low credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common airway diseases that nearly all pediatricians will encounter in their clinical practice. Using spirometry to compare a patient's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) both pre- and post-bronchodilator administration is the ideal way to document a paradoxical bronchodilator response.

- **Case study**: Here, we present a patient who experienced paradoxical responses to short acting beta-2 agonists (SABAs; albuterol and levalbuterol).

- **Results**: This patient responded to an anti-cholinergic agent (ipratropium bromide) with both subjective as well as objective response. This case highlights the need to include paradoxical response to SABAs in the differential of a patient with poorly controlled asthma. It also provides an example of successful treatment of a pediatric patient with a class of medications previously reserved for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### H1-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis: Cochrane systematic review [^112hbs19]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute systemic allergic reaction, which can be life-threatening. H1-antihistamines are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of anaphylaxis. We sought to assess the benefits and harm of H1-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006); EMBASE (1966 to June 2006); CINAHL (1982 to June 2006) and ISI Web of Science (1945 to July 2006). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. Randomized and quasi-randomized-controlled trials comparing H1-antihistamines with placebo or no intervention were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

- **Results**: We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

- **Conclusions**: Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized-controlled trials are needed, although these are likely to prove challenging to design and execute.

### Paradoxical exacerbation of myoclonic-astatic seizures by levetiracetam in myoclonic astatic epilepsy [^115caSqH]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In both children, withdrawal of LEV and introduction of ethosuximide resulted in total seizure remission and normalization of the EEG. Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE) is notoriously a difficult condition to treat. Although no clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of AEDs in MAE has been conducted, ethosuximide and valproate are usually advocated as first-line therapy, although the percentage of children achieving a remission with valproate monotherapy is quite low. Other drugs that have been anecdotally tried include lamotrigine, zonisamide, LEV, and rufinamide. The ketogenic diet is particularly effective for children with MAE, and although typically used in children refractory to drug treatment, some have advocated for its use earlier in the clinical course.

The efficacy of LEV in MAE was only reported in 9 children, with unimpressive results since only one was reported to achieve seizure freedom with a follow-up of only 3 months. Our data is consistent with those results since two of the four children treated with LEV had no significant change in seizure frequency, while the other two experienced a significant worsening of their myoclonic and atonic seizures, a paradoxical reaction not previously described for LEV in MAE. There is only one reported patient with MAE incompletely controlled on valproate monotherapy who reportedly developed myoclonic status epilepticus after replacing valproate with LEV. This worsening could have been due to the discontinuation of valproate, the introduction of LEV, the natural history of the illness, or any combination of those factors.

### Anaphylaxis: past, present and future [^111YFLA4]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and recent reports suggest increased prevalence. A diverse set of primary genetic and environmental influences may confer susceptibility to anaphylactic reactions. Anaphylaxis presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, often manifesting with a broad array of symptoms and signs that might be similar to other diseases.

The management of anaphylaxis consists of emergency treatment of acute episodes as well as preventive strategies to avoid recurrences. Treatment is complicated by its rapid onset and progression, the presence of comorbid conditions or medications, and the need for long-term allergen avoidance. Health care professionals must be able to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis, treat an episode promptly and appropriately, and provide preventive recommendations. Recognizing the gaps in our understanding and management of anaphylaxis may help identify promising targets for future treatment and prevention and areas that require further study.

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fluticasone propionate and/or salmeterol, regardless of indication. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate and/or salmeterol, or a combination of these factors.

- **Cardiac disorders**: Arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, extrasystoles, supraventricular tachycardia), ventricular tachycardia.

- **Endocrine disorders**: Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, growth velocity reduction in children/adolescents, hypercorticism.

- **Eye disorders**: Glaucoma, blurred vision, and central serous chorioretinopathy.

- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, xerostomia.

- **Immune system disorders**: Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reaction (including very rare anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy).

- **Infections and infestations**: Esophageal candidiasis.

- **Metabolic and nutrition disorders**: Hyperglycemia, weight gain.

- **Musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and bone disorders**: Arthralgia, cramps, myositis, osteoporosis.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^116j6Ehv]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

**Dose**: The relationship between dose/level of exposure and severity is complex and unclear. For accidental reactions in the community setting, it can be very difficult to accurately determine the degree of allergen exposure associated with an event, particularly those associated with fatal outcomes. Most individuals experience mild symptoms at food challenge prior to developing more significant (and less mild) symptoms to a dose sufficient to meet challenge stopping criteria — after all, the basic premise of food challenges is the assumption that incremental dosing effectively dose‐limits severity (see Figure 3). In a small study of 27 children reacting to peanut at food challenge, 21 had anaphylaxis, but only three as initial presenting symptoms; 13 children presented with initial non‐anaphylaxis symptoms but then developed anaphylaxis with further peanut ingestion. This pattern has been reproduced elsewhere: individuals often show a dose‐response between symptoms and level of allergen exposure, at least for the occurrence of any anaphylaxis, but this may not be apparent in larger datasets. In an analysis of 734 double‐blind, placebo‐controlled food challenges from The Netherlands, dose predicted only 4.4% of the variance in reaction severity — in other words, dose was not an important factor. Within a population, there will be a mixture of different allergic phenotypes, with some individuals showing a dose‐response but others not. Most datasets show that severe reactions can occur at all levels of allergen exposure, which further obscures the dose‐severity relationship.

### Cancidas [^116iA4YN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis and possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm, have been reported with the use of Cancidas. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with fatal outcomes, have been reported. Discontinue Cancidas at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Hepatic effects**: Cancidas can cause abnormalities in liver enzymes. Isolated cases of hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluate the risk/benefit of continuing Cancidas. Elevated liver enzymes during concomitant use with cyclosporine necessitates limiting use to patients for whom potential benefit outweighs potential risk. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during concomitant use with Cancidas.

### Premedication with melatonin vs midazolam in anxious children [^112E47b5]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The failure of dental treatment caused by anxiety is a common problem in children. Oral midazolam has been the most commonly used premedication for pediatric patients; however, the use of midazolam may be associated with paradoxical reactions in children. Melatonin may induce natural sleepiness and improve sedation. We have investigated premedication with melatonin compared with midazolam in children under nitrous oxide/oxygen (N₂O/O₂) sedation for dental treatment.

- **Methods**: In a randomized study, 60 children received either 3 mg of melatonin [Melatonina® (3 mg) 60 minutes before the procedure (n = 15); group I], 0.5 mg/kg melatonin 60 minutes before the procedure (n = 15; group II), 0.75 mg/kg midazolam [Dormicum® (15 mg/3 ml) 15 minutes before the procedure (n = 15); group III], or 3 mL of 0.09 NaCl 15 minutes (n = 7) or 60 minutes before the procedure (n = 8; group IV) orally. The children were sedated with 40/60% N₂O/O₂ inhalation. Heart rate and O₂ saturation were monitored during the treatment period. The level of sedation was assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Sedation success during dental treatment was classified, and other sedation-related events were recorded. Comparisons among the four groups were made using one-way ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test; if any significant differences were noted, Tukey's HSD or Mann-Whitney U-test were used for intergroup comparisons. All differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

- **Results**: The evaluation of sedation success was as follows: group I: satisfactory (n = 1), a

### Guiding principles for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of infants with anaphylaxis: An expert panel consensus [^1145Etj9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Infant anaphylaxis is an emerging risk, with food allergy being the most common cause. Although the presentation of anaphylaxis involves the same systems as in older children and adults, there are real-world challenges in identifying symptoms of an allergic emergency in nonverbal children and implementing optimal treatment. Recognition of anaphylaxis in infants can be challenging because allergic symptoms and certain normal infant behaviors may overlap.

Intramuscular epinephrine is the treatment of choice for infants, as it is for older children and adults. An epinephrine autoinjector approved by the Food and Drug Administration is now available for infants weighing between 7.5 and 15 kg. A panel of experts sought to develop guiding principles for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of anaphylaxis in infants and provide a framework for the development of new guidelines and future research. Accordingly, anaphylaxis emergency action planning for infants was addressed by the panel.

In considering the formation of future infant anaphylaxis guidelines, health care providers should be aware of the need to improve the recognition, diagnosis, and management of infants with anaphylaxis. Future research should identify and validate clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in infants, as well as risk factors for the most severe reactions.

### Recognition and management of food-induced anaphylaxis [^1113d5RL]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food-induced anaphylactic reactions are common and increasing in frequency. Despite the existence of a consensus definition of anaphylaxis, many cases are missed; recommended treatments are not given, and follow-up is inadequate. New aspects of its pathophysiology and causes, including atypical food-induced causes, are still being uncovered. Epinephrine remains the cornerstone for successfully treating anaphylaxis; H1 and H2 antihistamines, glucocorticoids, and β-agonists are ancillary medications that may be used in addition to epinephrine. Early recognition of anaphylaxis, appropriate emergency treatment, and follow-up, including prescription of self-injectable epinephrine, are essential to prevent death and significant morbidity from anaphylaxis.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^115pkUGX]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

- **Non-modifiable host factors**: Many studies report an association between age and risk of food anaphylaxis of any severity, but not all. Anaphylaxis is most commonly reported in preschool children aged 0–4 years, although severe or fatal outcomes in this age group are rare. The age group at greatest (although still very low) risk of near-fatal and fatal anaphylaxis to food is adolescents and adults up to age 40 years. Males may be at slightly higher risk of severe anaphylaxis, both pre- and post-puberty. At least one fatal series has reported male sex to be a risk factor. To date, no clear genetic associations have been identified conferring a greater risk of severe allergic reactions to food. Specific HLA haplotypes have been reported for wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA), but for other food allergy phenotypes, data are very inconsistent.

- **Management of allergic reaction**: Delays in symptom recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis have been associated with more severe outcomes in anaphylaxis, including the need for intensive care and length of hospital stay. Whether delays in adrenaline treatment also increase the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis is less clear. There is no evidence that treating non-anaphylaxis reactions with adrenaline helps prevent progression to anaphylaxis. Observational data from food challenges in peanut-allergic adults have shed new light on homeostatic mechanisms which can compensate for anaphylaxis and prevent severe outcomes. One hypothesis is that individuals at greater risk of severe reactions may be less able to compensate for an allergic insult through endogenous mechanisms.

### Paradoxical reaction following intravenous midazolam premedication in pediatric patients - a randomized placebo controlled trial of ketamine for rapid tranquilization [^1139EUBz]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines include restlessness, violent behavior, physical assault, acts of self-injury, and the need for restraints. These may occur at variable times after administration. This study was designed to determine the incidence of paradoxical reactions following intravenous midazolam premedication in pediatric patients and to compare the efficacy of extra doses of midazolam with low-dose intravenous ketamine to rapidly tranquillize them.

- **Methods**: A total of 706 ASA I, II children scheduled for elective surgery were given intravenous midazolam premedication. Children who developed a paradoxical reaction were randomly divided into three equal groups to receive: (i) extra midazolam, (ii) ketamine, or (iii) placebo as the test drug for treatment of paradoxical reaction. Ease of rapid tranquillization and need for a rescue tranquillizer (i.e. ketamine; irrespective of patient group) were compared among the three groups.

- **Results**: Twenty-four (3.4%) children developed a paradoxical reaction after midazolam premedication. Those who received ketamine as the test drug responded rapidly to ketamine, but the responses of the other two groups to their test drug were poor, and the majority of them required ketamine as a rescue tranquillizer (six in the midazolam group, seven in the placebo group, but no patient in the ketamine group; P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study demonstrate that ketamine is an effective drug for the treatment of paradoxical reaction following intravenous midazolam premedication. The exact mechanisms of these reactions and how they are aborted remain to be fully elucidated.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^114Y2KbU]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis can be triggered by food, insect venom, medication, latex, exercise, or unknown causes. Regardless of the inciting cause, the final common pathway is the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils. Anaphylaxis may be fatal within minutes, usually through cardiovascular or respiratory compromise, or both. Biphasic reactions, defined as a recurrence of anaphylactic symptoms after initial resolution, can occur 1 hour to 72 hours after the initial onset of symptoms.

In addition to epinephrine, H1-receptor antagonists and H2-receptor antagonists (i.e. antihistamines such as cetirizine and ranitidine, respectively) and corticosteroids are often used in acute therapy and after discharge. Most experts recommend these additional therapies despite limited data to support their use, since these drugs are thought to be unlikely to cause harm and theoretically have some added benefit in the resolution of symptoms.

The most recent systematic reviews of anaphylaxis treatment, published in the Cochrane Database, indicate an alarming paucity of high-quality evidence supporting currently accepted treatments, including epinephrine, glucocorticoids, antihistamines, and supportive care (e.g. oxygen, fluid resuscitation, raising legs above the head, inhaled bronchodilators).

The present systematic review was planned to identify and assess the outcome measures used in RCTs of anaphylaxis treatment in children. As a secondary objective, this systematic review aimed to assess the evidence for treatment modalities for pediatric anaphylaxis.

### Paradoxical reaction during tuberculosis treatment in immunocompetent children: Clinical spectrum and risk factors [^113dse7P]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Paradoxical reaction (PR) during antituberculosis (TB) therapy, defined as clinical or radiologic worsening of preexisting TB lesions or the development of new lesions, has not been widely studied in immunocompetent children.

Methods: All children (< 17 years) with the diagnosis of TB who sought care at our center between 1994 and 2007 were included in this retrospective study. Data on demographic characteristics, bacteriologic results, medical imaging, treatment regimens, and outcomes were abstracted from medical records. Patients with and without PR were compared.

Results: Of 115 TB cases, 12 (10.3%) developed PR. Children with PR were younger than those with TB without complication: the median age at diagnosis was 26 months (range, 5–148) compared with 66 months (range, 6–205) for those without complications (P = 0.013). None of the children in the PR group had received Calmette-Guérin bacillus vaccination, compared with 34 of 103 (33%) children without PR (P = 0.017). Children with a diagnosis of PR were more frequently symptomatic at diagnosis of TB disease when compared with children without PR (P = 0.028). PR occurred at a median interval of 39 days (range, 15–75) after the initiation of antituberculosis treatment. The most common PR was worsening of preexisting pulmonary lesions (75%). New lesions in anatomical sites other than those observed at initial presentation developed in 3 children.

Conclusion: Paradoxical deterioration during the treatment of TB disease is common in immunocompetent children. Young age and absence of Calmette-Guérin bacillus vaccination app.

### Dupilumab-induced serum sickness-like reaction in a pediatric patient [^113JFicR]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Because of its self-limiting nature, treatment is largely drug cessation and supportive care, including corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antipyretics. The prevalence of SSLR is unknown as it is rarely reported and may be mistaken for other drug-induced cutaneous manifestations. During the clinical trial development of dupilumab, administrators noted one adult with CSS and another with SSLR, both being treated for AD. Since then, two additional adult cases have been reported in the literature: one patient treated for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and allergic rhinitis, and another case treated for AD.

Jung et al. reported a case of a 29-year-old woman who experienced an immediate type I hypersensitivity reaction to dupilumab after first exposure, presenting with diffuse urticaria and asthma exacerbation. After a rechallenge two years later, she experienced symptoms indicative of CSS, including myalgia, facial and hand swelling, arthralgia, rash at the injection site, and elevated inflammatory markers within one to three days, likely due to prior sensitization. Although the presented pediatric patient did not require additional dosages of dupilumab, the development of CSS and SSLR in this adult patient after initial medication sensitization can be helpful in assessing future pediatric prognosis in those who may consider additional dupilumab administration. Treudler et al. reported a case of a 54-year-old man with severe AD who experienced SSLR ten days after his initial dupilumab dose, with symptoms resurfacing after early administration of his second dose on day twelve.

### Downstream consequences of diagnostic error in pediatric anaphylaxis [^111QTAd3]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

While delays in epinephrine administration result in increased hospitalization and fatalities, anaphylactic reactions can naturally resolve without epinephrine. There are no guidelines recommending that anaphylaxis patients who are no longer symptomatic should receive epinephrine. It may be reasonable to withhold epinephrine in asymptomatic patients as long as they are appropriately observed and followed up due to the risks of biphasic reactions.

In our cohort, many cases of anaphylaxis were treated with less effective medications. Notably, 78 (37.0%) patients received pharmacological treatment without epinephrine administration. This included 44 (20.8%) patients receiving steroids and 75 (35.5%) patients receiving an antihistamine without also being given epinephrine. Overall, 55.5% of patients received steroids and 81.5% of patients received an H1 antihistamine at some point in their care. These results are similar to those found in the Australian literature, with steroid rates reported between 44–77% and antihistamine use reported as between 44–88% in pediatric anaphylaxis. Australian guidelines acknowledge that while steroid use is common, their benefits in anaphylaxis are unproven and that antihistamines have no role in the acute management of anaphylaxis.

There were seven biphasic reactions recorded in our study, making up 3% of all reactions. This is at the low end of the 3–14.7% reported in the literature. The biphasic reactions identified in our cohort were clinically significant as five required epinephrine while one patient was admitted to the ICU.

### Positive skin test control - histamine [^112bdPU5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions

Large doses of histamine may precipitate systemic reactions. These reactions may include flushing, dizziness, headache, bronchial constriction, urticaria, asthma, marked hypotension or hypertension, abdominal cramps, vomiting, metallic taste, and local or generalized allergic manifestations. An antihistamine preparation may be given orally, intramuscularly (I.M.), or intravenously (I.V.) to prevent or ameliorate systemic reactions to the drug.

If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur, apply a tourniquet above the site of injection and inject 1:1000 epinephrine hydrochloride intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the opposite arm. Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes. Do not obstruct arterial blood flow with the tourniquet.

- **Epinephrine dosage**:

	- **Adult**: 0.3 to 0.5 mL should be injected. Repeat in 5 to 10 minutes if necessary.

	- **Pediatric**: The usual initial dose is 0.01 mg (mL) per kg body weight or 0.3 mg (mL) per square meter of body surface area. Suggested dosage for infants to 2 years of age is 0.05 mL to 0.1 mL; for children 2 to 6 years, 0.15 mL; and children 6 to 12 years, 0.2 mL. Single pediatric doses should not exceed 0.3 mg (mL). Doses may be repeated as frequently as every 20 minutes, depending on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient.

### Increased prevalence of urticarial diseases and antihistamine/corticosteroid consumption in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^115tWfye]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

A case–control study found that children with a history of antihistamine prescriptions had a 50% higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD later. We too have observed an association between higher consumption of antihistamines and ADHD. It is worth noting that the first-generation antihistamines crossing the blood-brain barrier can produce cognitive/behavioral adverse effects that are similar to some ADHD symptoms and may thus aggravate the ADHD clinical presentation.

The association between ADHD and urticarial diseases, particularly allergic urticaria, may be influenced by environmental factors as well. Exposure to allergens or environmental triggers that induce urticaria may impact neurodevelopment and contribute to the manifestation of ADHD symptoms. Most individuals with ADHD were treated with stimulants; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no solid data on the impact of these medications on the immune system. Thus, it is unlikely that the increased rate of urticaria among individuals with ADHD is related to their treatment. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interplay between genetic, immune, and environmental factors in the relationship between ADHD and urticaria.

The observation of higher rates of urticarial diseases in patients with ADHD raises interesting questions regarding the underlying mechanisms. One possibility may involve neuroinflammation and mast cell activation. Mast cells, known for their central role in the pathophysiology of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), are also involved in neuroinflammatory responses. An abnormal neuroinflammatory state in individuals with ADHD may contribute to these findings.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^111TZ3cc]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Studies have found that, despite epinephrine being the only anaphylaxis treatment with demonstrated efficacy in preventing mortality, it is not used consistently, and second-line or adjunctive medications are more often administered, sometimes before epinephrine. For example, a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients seen in a pediatric emergency department over a 5-year period, with a final diagnosis of anaphylaxis, showed a rate of epinephrine administration of only 54%. This was less than the rate of corticosteroids (78%) and H1 and/or H2 receptor antagonists (92%).

The administration of adjunctive medications can potentially delay the use of other, perhaps more effective, treatment modalities and therefore might contribute to morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, both antihistamines and steroids have adverse effects and costs, and may theoretically mask important markers of ongoing anaphylaxis risk. Redosing of both epinephrine and steroids in the emergency department also carries risks of systemic side effects. These factors need to be weighed against the potential benefit of these treatments.

- **Limitations**: A limitation of the systematic review is that it was limited to studies done in the last twelve years. This time frame was considered acceptable as there are recent systematic reviews investigating anaphylaxis treatments that found no RCTs in databases extending up to thirty years into the past. Further limitations include the exclusion of non-English and non-registered trials.

A cross-sectional study reported that only 4.4% of children with suspected drug allergies received an appropriate diagnosis following evaluation. The most frequently implicated medications were antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antipyretic analgesics. Another study similarly found that only 9.1% of children with suspected drug allergies were accurately diagnosed.

Children with chronic complications and comorbidities are often prescribed multiple medications, making an accurate diagnosis of drug allergies crucial for appropriate treatment. Given the inherent risks of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, drug provocation tests (DPTs) must be conducted more cautiously in these children than in those without underlying conditions. It is not uncommon for such high-risk children to avoid undergoing DPTs owing to safety concerns. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of reports on the application of DPTs in children with chronic complications and comorbidities. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DPTs in children with underlying diseases.

### Management of anaphylaxis in children [^116EkKQr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. The key to successful management involves rapid diagnosis, assessment, and early initiation of therapy. Epinephrine is the undisputed initial therapy for anaphylaxis and its administration should never be delayed. In most cases, additional interventions such as oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, beta-agonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids should be strongly considered.

Although the hospital course must be individualized to meet each patient's needs, a minimum of 4 to 6 hours of observation after complete symptom resolution may be reasonable to monitor for recurrence of symptoms and biphasic reactions. Before discharge, every patient should receive education about anaphylaxis, a prescription for self-injectable epinephrine, and instructions for follow-up care.

### Pediatric drug eruptions [^1164g8TE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Drug eruptions in children are common but generally less studied than their adult counterparts. Besides having a significant impact on the child's health and quality of life, these reactions can restrict what medications the patient can receive in the future. Familiarity with pediatric drug eruptions is important for accurate diagnosis and to prevent future recurrence or ineffective therapy. Our understanding of how drug reactions differ mechanistically between children and adults is poor. Various factors could contribute to the differing incidence, presentation, and treatment modalities offered to pediatric versus adult patients. For many of these cutaneous drug reactions, the treatment regimen is not standardized, being based primarily on case reports. Although not comprehensive, this review highlights common pediatric drug eruption patterns and discusses diagnostic mimickers.

- **Cutaneous adverse drug reactions**: Five types in the pediatric population are presented: morbilliform (exanthematous) eruptions, urticarial eruptions, serum sickness-like reactions, fixed drug eruptions, and DRESS syndrome. Clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management are discussed with an emphasis on the pediatric population.

### Successful flumazenil reversal of paradoxical reaction to midazolam in a child [^116zz2Gj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Greater attention to and management of anxiety and pain in pediatric patients signifies a healthy evolution in the care of children in emergency departments (EDs). Interventions to address such distress may involve unanticipated adverse effects. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine commonly administered to children for anxiolysis, may precipitate paradoxical agitation and delirium, a rare but alarming effect that warrants prompt identification and treatment.

- **Case report**: The case presented is that of a 4-year-old girl who received oral midazolam and developed a paradoxical reaction, which was reversed successfully with flumazenil. This is the first such case report in an ED involving a child. Emergency physicians must stay abreast of the adverse and unintended effects of the treatments provided. The literature on benzodiazepine-induced paradoxical reactions is reviewed, and flumazenil as well as other treatment options and anxiolytic alternatives are presented.

### Therapeutic use of infliximab in tuberculosis to control severe paradoxical reaction of the brain and lymph nodes [^1129bVVq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Paradoxical reactions are immune-mediated exacerbations of disease triggered by tuberculosis treatment. These reactions, particularly those involving the central nervous system, may be life-threatening. Infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor antibody, profoundly inhibits cellular immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We describe a case in which infliximab was used to control a steroid-resistant tuberculosis paradoxical reaction involving the central nervous system.

### Outcomes of drug provocation tests in children with chronic complications and comorbidities: Case series [^113xK9fW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to the National Center for Child Health and Development for undergoing DPTs from January 2019 to December 2023. We collected electronic medical records and analyzed them in January 2024. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at the National Center for Child Health and Development (2023–2024). Informed consent was obtained in the form of an opt-out on the website.

Eligibility criteria included being younger than 18 years and experiencing chronic complications and comorbidities requiring regular outpatient visits for conditions other than allergic diseases. Suspected drugs were classified based on medical history as immediate-type if symptoms appeared within 1 hour, and as non–immediate-type if symptoms appeared after 1 hour. All children underwent skin prick tests (SPTs) for the suspected drug, and if the result was negative, intradermal tests (IDTs) were performed for injectable formulations.

- **Testing procedure**: We conducted SPTs using optimal concentrations of the suspected drug, with histamine and control solutions as comparators. A positive result was defined as a wheal size at least half the diameter of the histamine wheal after 15 minutes. For IDTs, the suspected drug was prepared at an optimal concentration, and 0.02 mL was injected intradermally, with normal saline serving as the control solution. A positive result was defined as the appearance of a wheal with a diameter larger than 9 mm or an erythema with a diameter larger than 20 mm after 15 minutes.

For children suspected of having non–immediate-type reactions, additional procedures were followed as per protocol.

### Predictors of biphasic reactions in the emergency department for patients with anaphylaxis [^111LTpig]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

A biphasic reaction is the recurrence of anaphylaxis symptoms within 72 hours of the initial anaphylactic event, without re-exposure to the trigger. Biphasic reactions are uncommon and unpredictable, and risk factors for biphasic reactions are poorly understood.

- **Objective**: To identify predictors of biphasic anaphylactic reactions in patients with anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: Patients of all ages who presented to the ED and met diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis from April 2008 to January 2013 at an academic medical center with 73,000 annual patient visits were consecutively included. We collected data on patient characteristics, suspected triggers, signs and symptoms, ED management, and disposition. Univariate analyses were performed to estimate the association between potential predictor variables and biphasic reactions. We report associations as odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: Among 541 patients with anaphylaxis, the median age was 34.6 years (interquartile range: 18–52 years), and 320 (59%) were female patients. Twenty-one patients (4%) had biphasic reactions. Two pediatric patients, ages 5 and 16 years old, developed biphasic reactions. The median time between the resolution of initial symptoms and the onset of the biphasic reaction was 7 hours (range: 1–72 hours). Biphasic reactions were associated with a history of prior anaphylaxis (OR 2.6 [95% CI, 1.1–6.4]; p = 0.029), an unknown precipitant (OR 2.6 [95% CI, 1.1–6.2]; p = 0.03), symptoms of diarrhea (OR 4.5 [95% CI, 1.4–14.0]; p = 0.024), and wheezing.

### Paradoxical reaction in HIV negative tuberculous meningitis [^111FamSH]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

This review focuses on paradoxical reactions occurring during the treatment of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in human immunodeficiency virus-negative cases. A paradoxical reaction is defined as the worsening of a pre-existing lesion or the appearance of a new lesion in a patient whose clinical symptoms initially improved with anti-tuberculosis treatment. A number of different paradoxical reactions have been reported in patients with TBM, including the expansion of existing cerebral tuberculomas, the appearance of new tuberculomas, hydrocephalus, and optochiasmatic and spinal arachnoiditis.

While the exact mechanism of paradoxical reactions is uncertain, an exaggerated immune reaction against Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigens is currently the most accepted theory for tuberculous paradoxical reactions. Corticosteroids are considered to have a beneficial effect in the management of paradoxical reactions. Immuno-modulatory drugs, including tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, thalidomide, and interferon-γ, have been used in isolated cases with more severe forms of paradoxical reactions.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113NQupb]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

Oral H1-antihistamines relieve the cutaneous symptoms of anaphylaxis. Combined H1- and H2-antihistamines may be more effective than H1-antihistamines alone, although data are limited. However, cutaneous symptoms are not life-threatening and also respond to adrenaline, although the effect may not be long-lasting. The ASCIA 2020 guideline cautions against the use of sedating antihistamines, as "side effects (drowsiness or lethargy) may mimic some signs of anaphylaxis". Antihistamines may be helpful in treating cutaneous symptoms that persist following the resolution of anaphylaxis symptoms but are not recommended until the acute reaction has been successfully treated with more appropriate interventions. A non-sedating oral antihistamine is preferred to avoid confounding due to the risk of sedation, which can indicate reaction progression.

### Albuterol [^111Dhi9j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: Albuterol tablets can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, albuterol should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy instituted.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Albuterol, like all other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of albuterol tablets at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, albuterol, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.

- **Deterioration of asthma**: Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of albuterol than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g. corticosteroids.

- **Use of anti-inflammatory agents**: The use of beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^111YxUfb]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sleep medications, which are sometimes prescribed for adults with insomnia, such as benzodiazepines or even antihistamines, can cause activation or agitation in some children and should be used with caution. There are no FDA-approved medications for sleep for pediatric insomnia. Antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, are frequently used by pediatricians for the management of sleep onset difficulties, although they might have a paradoxical effect in children under the age of 5 years. Since the long-term use of these medications in young children has yet to be studied, they are not recommended for long-term use for young children. Hydroxyzine can be started at a dose of 10 mg at bedtime and increased up to a maximum dose of 25 mg.

Zolpidem is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist that has received FDA approval for the short-term treatment of insomnia in individuals 18 years and older; it can be considered for sleep in teens and adults. Zolpidem is less useful for children who may be at risk for a paradoxical reaction from benzodiazepines. Zolpidem IR can be dosed at 5–10 mg at bedtime, and zolpidem ER can be dosed at 6.25–12.5 mg at bedtime.

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. While there is no data in the literature for children, the use of amitriptyline in low dosages is often effective for insomnia for children and adults with ASD. Start with a low dose of 5 mg at bedtime and increase weekly by 5 mg. Typically, it is effective in doses ≤ 50 mg at bedtime. Amitriptyline can cause constipation, which is common in individuals with ASD.

### Anaphylaxis in children [^116Rj1WX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening event in children, commonly encountered in prehospital and emergency department settings. Recently published clinical guidelines emphasize early recognition of anaphylaxis and administration of epinephrine as the mainstay of management. Literature regarding adjuvant therapies, biphasic reactions, observation times, and disposition of patients with anaphylaxis remains controversial. This article reviews the background and pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, as well as the diagnostic approach, management, and future directions of anaphylaxis in children.

### Allergic reactions due to mizolastine [^115KYwxd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

An IgE-mediated allergic reaction to an antihistamine sounds like a paradox and is rare.

- **Objective**: To describe two patients with anaphylaxis caused by mizolastine. In one patient, differential diagnosis from food allergy was necessary, whereas in the other patient, the history was clear.

- **Methods**: History and in vivo skin testing were used for diagnosis. A challenge test to mizolastine was also proposed, but both patients refused to give consent.

- **Results**: Skin test results were positive to mizolastine, whereas tests to the inert ingredients of the mizolastine tablets and to other H1 and H2 blockers had negative results.

- **Conclusions**: In vivo tests are highly sensitive, and they confirmed the diagnosis of the uncommon antihistamine allergy.

### Clinical predictors for biphasic reactions in children presenting with anaphylaxis [^1122yncY]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

One of the main reasons for hospital admission once a child has been stabilized following anaphylaxis is to monitor for a biphasic reaction. However, only a small percentage of anaphylactic episodes involve biphasic reactions that would benefit from admission. Identification of predictive factors for a biphasic reaction would assist in determining who may benefit from prolonged observation.

- **Objective**: To determine predictive factors for biphasic reactions in children presenting with anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of children presenting with anaphylaxis to a major paediatric emergency department over a 5-year period.

- **Results**: There were 95 uniphasic (87%), 12 (11%) biphasic, and two protracted reactions (2%). One child with a protracted reaction died. For the management of the primary anaphylactic reaction, children developing biphasic reactions were more likely to have received > 1 dose of adrenaline (58% vs. 22%, P = 0.01) and/or a fluid bolus (42% vs. 8%, P = 0.01) than those experiencing uniphasic reactions. The absence of either factor was strongly predictive of the absence of a biphasic reaction (negative predictive value 99%), but the presence of either factor was poorly predictive of a biphasic reaction (positive predictive value of 32%). All biphasic reactors, in which the second phase was anaphylactic, received either > 1 dose of adrenaline and/or a fluid bolus.

- **Conclusions**: Children who received > 1 dose of adrenaline and/or a fluid bolus for treatment of their primary anaphylactic reaction were at increased risk of developing a biphasic reaction.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^113F7Ego]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Epidemiological data suggests an age-related increase in severe food anaphylaxis in adolescents and young adults. Often, this is assumed to be due to risk-taking behaviors, such as deliberately eating risky food or refusing to carry rescue medication. However, an analysis of national fatal anaphylaxis data from the UK reported that this age-related increase in near-fatal and fatal food anaphylaxis persists well into the fourth decade of life. The authors suggested that there may be an 'age-specific vulnerability to severe outcomes from food-induced allergic reactions in the second and third decades'. Adolescents use a variety of different strategies to manage risk, and most teenagers manage their food allergies well. Risk-taking can be a deliberate act by adolescents to increase their independence, but can be mitigated by 'transitioning' children to self-care (from around age 11 years). Specific educational interventions targeting teenagers and young adults are unlikely to be harmful, but there is an absence of evidence as to whether such strategies reduce the risk of severe outcomes.

### The role of histamine H1 and H4 receptors in allergic inflammation: the search for new antihistamines [^114XqjKb]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2008). Low credibility.

Histamine plays a key role in allergic inflammatory conditions. The inflammatory responses resulting from the liberation of histamine have long been thought to be mediated by the histamine H1 receptor. H1 receptor antagonists, commonly known as antihistamines, have been used to treat allergies for many years. However, the importance of histamine in the pathology of conditions such as asthma and chronic pruritus may have been underestimated. Accumulating evidence suggests that histamine indeed has roles in inflammation and immune function modulation in such diseases. In particular, the discovery of a fourth histamine receptor (H4) and its expression on numerous immune and inflammatory cells has prompted a re-evaluation of the actions of histamine, suggesting a new potential for H4-receptor antagonists and a possible synergy between H1 and H4-receptor antagonists in targeting various inflammatory conditions.

### Biphasic anaphylactic reactions in pediatrics [^116QXFcp]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of biphasic reactions in children with anaphylaxis, establish what risk factors can predict progression to a biphasic reaction, and assess the utility of inpatient observation for patients whose anaphylaxis appears to have resolved.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of all children admitted to the Children's Hospital inpatient service between 1985 and 1999 with acute anaphylaxis. Data were collected from medical records regarding past medical history, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment, and hospital course. Patients were considered to have resolution of anaphylaxis if they were documented to have cessation of all symptoms and needed no therapy for at least 1 hour. Biphasic reactions were defined as a worsening of symptoms requiring new therapy after resolution of anaphylaxis. Significant biphasic reactions were defined as those requiring oxygen, vasopressors, intubation, subcutaneous epinephrine, or unscheduled bronchodilator treatments. Patients were considered to benefit from a 24-hour observation period if they had a significant biphasic reaction within 24 hours of admission.

- **Results**: Of 108 anaphylactic episodes, 2 (2%) were fatal, and 1 (1%) was a protracted anaphylactic reaction. Among the remaining 105 children with resolution of anaphylaxis, 6 (6%) [95% confidence interval (CI): 2, 12] had biphasic reactions, of which 3 (3%) [95% CI: 0.6, 8] were significant. Of those who had biphasic reactions, the median time from the onset of symptoms to the initial administration of su…
