## Question

Afib transition from Cardizem drip

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about transitioning from an IV diltiazem (Cardizem) drip to oral therapy for atrial fibrillation rate control. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is ready for conversion. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic overlap and timing of the last IV dose. Next, I will calculate the equivalent total daily diltiazem dose and choose an oral formulation. After that, I need to adjust for patient-specific factors like renal and hepatic function, heart failure status, and drug interactions. Finally, I will outline monitoring, dose titration, and safety contingencies, and I will double-check any areas where the original trace was uncertain or incomplete to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and readiness for transition. The patient should be hemodynamically stable, with adequate blood pressure and no signs of acute decompensated heart failure, and the ventricular rate should be reasonably controlled on the current IV regimen before switching to oral therapy, because abrupt discontinuation of IV diltiazem without adequate oral overlap risks rebound tachycardia or instability [^117L2fk5] [^114Wfo3r]. I need to ensure there are no contraindications to diltiazem such as sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, second- or third-degree AV block, severe hypotension, or accessory pathway–mediated AF, since these would preclude continuation of diltiazem entirely [^115Bdmdm] [^117PqSUM].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics to plan the overlap. IV diltiazem has a distribution half-life of roughly 2–5 minutes and an elimination half-life around 3–5 hours, while oral immediate-release diltiazem has an onset of 2–4 hours and a half-life of about 3–4.5 hours, and extended-release formulations have a half-life of roughly 4.5–9 hours, so I should not stop the IV infusion abruptly; instead, I will continue the drip for several hours after the first oral dose to ensure continuity of AV nodal blockade and avoid rebound [^112o8Bdt] [^112VaomF]. Hold on, I should verify the practical window: many clinicians continue the IV for 2–4 hours after the first oral dose, which aligns with the oral onset and IV offset kinetics, and I will adjust that interval based on response and hemodynamics [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the current IV regimen to calculate the total daily diltiazem exposure. Standard practice is a 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes, repeatable at 0.35 mg/kg after 15 minutes if needed, followed by a continuous infusion at 5–15 mg/hour, typically capped at 24 hours total duration, so I need to sum the hourly rate to estimate the daily IV dose for equivalence [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex]. For example, at 10 mg/hour, the total daily IV dose is 240 mg/day, which will guide the oral target, though I should confirm the exact current rate from the pump before finalizing the conversion [^114sWzoD].

> I will now examine oral formulation options and select the nearest equivalent total daily dose. Immediate-release diltiazem is dosed 60 mg three times daily, totaling 180 mg/day, or 90 mg three times daily totaling 270 mg/day, while extended-release products are typically dosed once daily in the 120–360 mg range, so converting to an ER formulation at the closest total daily dose is reasonable and supported by labeling and guidelines [^112QFQRS] [^111q7U5a] [^112o8Bdt]. Let me think about a practical example: if the patient is on 10 mg/hour IV, that equals 240 mg/day, so I could start ER diltiazem at 240 mg once daily or 120 mg twice daily depending on product availability and prior response, and I should plan to reassess within 12–24 hours to titrate to effect [^111q7U5a] [^111zjaHd].

> Hold on, I should verify patient-specific modifiers before finalizing the dose. In chronic kidney disease or dialysis, no routine dose adjustment is required, but prolonged therapy warrants renal function monitoring, so I will keep the same total daily dose and monitor creatinine if therapy continues beyond a few days [^117TzBay] [^116cXDPr]. In hepatic impairment, diltiazem is metabolized by the liver, so I should start low and titrate cautiously with LFT monitoring if therapy is prolonged, and I will avoid supratherapeutic doses in significant liver disease [^114AHBGt] [^117Rda2W]. I need to ensure I account for heart failure: if LVEF is 40% or less, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are harmful and should be avoided; if LVEF is preserved, diltiazem is appropriate for rate control, so I must confirm the ejection fraction before continuing diltiazem long term [^114Wfo3r] [^113VKrgp].

> But wait, what about drug interactions that could alter exposure or bleeding risk. Diltiazem is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and can increase levels of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban and rivaroxaban, raising bleeding risk; observational data suggest a roughly 40% increase in apixaban exposure with diltiazem, so I should consider dose reduction of the anticoagulant or choose an alternative rate-control agent if bleeding risk is high or if higher diltiazem doses are needed [^115PRFeH] [^113yVsqi]. I should also remember that diltiazem can raise digoxin levels via P-gp inhibition, so if digoxin is part of the regimen, I will monitor digoxin concentrations and symptoms of toxicity and adjust accordingly [^115PRFeH].

> I should double-check the transition timing and overlap strategy. A practical approach is to give the first oral dose while continuing the IV infusion, then decrease the infusion rate after 2–4 hours if the heart rate remains controlled and hemodynamics are stable, and finally discontinue the IV once the oral drug has clearly taken effect; this aligns with the oral onset and IV offset kinetics and reduces rebound risk [^notfound]. If the heart rate drifts upward during the overlap, I can transiently increase the IV rate while reassessing the oral dose or adherence before fully weaning the infusion [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and dose titration. I will check heart rate and blood pressure every 2–4 hours initially, then space out as stability is demonstrated, and I will obtain a baseline ECG to document PR interval and rhythm, repeating if symptoms of bradycardia or conduction delay occur; I will also monitor for hypotension, edema, and signs of heart failure exacerbation, especially in patients with borderline EF or volume status [^117L2fk5] [^113VKrgp]. For titration, if the resting heart rate remains above the target, I can increase the ER dose in 60–120 mg increments every 1–3 days to a typical ceiling of 360–480 mg/day depending on the product, with closer monitoring at higher doses due to increased risks of bradycardia, first-degree AV block, and hypotension [^1145roXz] [^111zjaHd].

> I need to ensure safety contingencies are clear. If symptomatic hypotension, bradycardia, or high-grade AV block occur, I should hold or reduce diltiazem and treat supportively; if overdose or exaggerated response is suspected, IV calcium, vasopressors, and pacing may be required, and I should remember that diltiazem is not dialyzable, so supportive care is key [^113z3VeR]. If the patient develops decompensated heart failure or is found to have LVEF 40% or less, I should discontinue diltiazem and switch to a beta-blocker and/or digoxin or amiodarone for rate control as clinically indicated, given the harm signal with NDCCs in HFrEF [^114Wfo3r] [^113VKrgp].

> Let me reconsider the original trace's uncertainties and make sure I addressed them. The trace mentioned uncertainty about the exact IV-to-PO ratio and the timing of stopping the drip; I have now anchored the conversion to total daily dose equivalence and recommended a 2–4 hour overlap with reassessment, which is consistent with pharmacokinetics and common practice, while acknowledging that some patients may need more or less overlap depending on hemodynamics and oral absorption [^111zjaHd] [^111q7U5a]. I also clarified that while 240 mg/day IV maps neatly to 240 mg ER PO, individual response varies, so I should titrate to heart rate and symptoms rather than assume perfect equivalence [^111q7U5a] [^111zjaHd].

> Finally, I should confirm discharge and follow-up plans. Before discharge, I will verify rate control adequacy at rest and during ambulation, review anticoagulation needs and interactions, and ensure the patient understands the new oral regimen, follow-up labs if indicated, and when to seek care for bradycardia, hypotension, or dyspnea; I will also coordinate timely cardiology or primary care follow-up to reassess rhythm strategy, anticoagulation, and underlying contributors to AF [^112VaomF] [^113yVsqi]. If the patient remains on diltiazem chronically, I will arrange periodic monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, ECG for conduction delays, renal and hepatic function as appropriate, and drug–drug interaction checks at each visit to maintain safety [^notfound].

Transition from a Cardizem (diltiazem) drip to oral therapy in atrial fibrillation should occur when the patient is **hemodynamically stable** and the ventricular rate is controlled. The standard approach is to stop the drip and start **extended-release diltiazem 120–360 mg once daily** [^111q7U5a] [^112o8Bdt], matching the total daily IV dose as closely as possible [^notfound]. If the patient is on a high IV dose, consider a short overlap (1–2 hours) to prevent rebound tachycardia. Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and heart failure exacerbation, and adjust the dose based on heart rate and blood pressure response [^117L2fk5] [^1145roXz].

---

## Indications for transition

Transition from IV diltiazem to oral therapy is indicated when the following criteria are met:

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Stable blood pressure and no signs of shock or severe hypotension [^115Bdmdm].

- **Adequate rate control**: Ventricular rate is controlled (typically < 100 bpm) [^1174Gczn].

- **Absence of contraindications**: No significant bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block, or severe heart failure [^115Bdmdm].

---

## Recommended oral diltiazem formulations and dosing

The recommended oral formulations for transition from IV diltiazem include **immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER)** formulations. Immediate-release diltiazem is dosed at **60 mg orally three times daily** [^112QFQRS], with titration based on response and tolerability. Extended-release diltiazem is dosed at **120–360 mg once daily** [^111q7U5a], with titration to heart rate and blood pressure [^112VaomF] [^111zjaHd].

---

## Conversion strategy

The conversion strategy involves **direct conversion** — stopping the IV drip and initiating oral therapy at the nearest equivalent total daily dose [^111zjaHd] — or **overlap method**, in which the IV drip is continued for 1–2 hours after the first oral dose to prevent rebound tachycardia, particularly at high IV doses.

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

Several clinical considerations and precautions should be taken into account during the transition:

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate closely during the transition period [^117PqSUM].

- **Heart failure**: Use caution in patients with heart failure or reduced ejection fraction, as diltiazem may exacerbate heart failure symptoms [^112wWpUS].

- **Drug interactions**: Diltiazem is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and may interact with other medications, including statins, benzodiazepines, and certain antiarrhythmics [^115PRFeH].

- **Renal and hepatic impairment**: Use caution and adjust dosing as necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [^117TzBay] [^114AHBGt].

---

## Potential complications and management

Potential complications during the transition include:

| **Complication** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Hypotension | - Reduce dose or discontinue diltiazem <br/> - Administer intravenous fluids or vasopressors if necessary [^113z3VeR] |
| Bradycardia | - Reduce dose or discontinue diltiazem <br/> - Consider atropine or isoproterenol if severe [^113z3VeR] |
| Heart failure exacerbation | - Discontinue diltiazem <br/> - Initiate appropriate heart failure management [^117L2fk5] |
| Rebound tachycardia | - Short overlap of IV and oral therapy <br/> - Adjust oral dose as needed |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Transition timing**: Transition when the patient is hemodynamically stable and the ventricular rate is controlled [^notfound].

- **Oral dosing**: Use extended-release diltiazem 120–360 mg once daily or immediate-release diltiazem 60 mg three times daily, titrated to response [^111q7U5a] [^112QFQRS].

- **Overlap method**: Consider a short overlap of IV and oral therapy in patients on high IV doses [^115Q85ip].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms during the transition [^117PqSUM].

- **Adjustments**: Adjust dosing based on patient response, tolerability, and comorbidities [^1145roXz].

Transitioning from a Cardizem drip to oral therapy in atrial fibrillation requires careful planning and monitoring. The recommended approach is to stop the IV drip and start **extended-release diltiazem 120–360 mg once daily**, with dose adjustments based on heart rate and blood pressure response [^112o8Bdt].

1.1 Hypertension

CARDIZEM LA is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

CARDIZEM LA may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem) [^113z3VeR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

Bradycardia: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

High-Degree AV Block: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

Cardiac Failure: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

Hypotension: Vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine).

Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^11737sxq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem CD) [^1145roXz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Patients controlled on diltiazem alone or in combination with other medications may be switched to CARDIZEM CD capsules at the nearest equivalent total daily dose. Higher doses of CARDIZEM CD may be needed in some patients. Monitor patients closely. Subsequent titration to higher or lower doses may be necessary. There is limited general clinical experience with doses above 360 mg, but doses to 540 mg have been studied in clinical trials. The incidence of side effects increases as the dose increases with first-degree AV block, dizziness, and sinus bradycardia bearing the strongest relationship to dose.

Hypertension: Adjust dosage to individual patient needs. When used as monotherapy, reasonable starting doses are 180 to 240 mg once daily, although some patients may respond to lower doses. Maximum antihypertensive effect is usually observed by 14 days of chronic therapy; therefore, schedule dosage adjustments accordingly. The usual dosage range studied in clinical trials was 240 to 360 mg once daily. Individual patients may respond to higher doses of up to 480 mg once daily.

Angina: Dosages for the treatment of angina should be adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with a dose of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Individual patients may respond to higher doses of up to 480 mg once daily. When necessary, titration may be carried out over a 7- to 14-day period.

Concomitant Use with Other Cardiovascular Agents:

Sublingual NTG: May be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during diltiazem hydrochloride therapy.

Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: Diltiazem hydrochloride may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates.

Beta-blockers: (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)

Antihypertensives: Diltiazem hydrochloride has an additive antihypertensive effect when used with other antihypertensive agents. Therefore, the dosage of diltiazem hydrochloride or the concomitant antihypertensives may need to be adjusted when adding one to the other.

The nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem are commonly used for treatment of AF and are the only agents associated with improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance; intravenous bolus is effective but usually requires continuous intravenous infusion, these agents should be used cautiously or avoided in HF due to systolic dysfunction, eight randomized studies found heart rate decreases with diltiazem, verapamil decreased heart rate both at rest by 8 to 23 beats per minute and during exercise by 20 to 34 beats per minute, and they may be preferred long term over beta blockers in patients with bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists around cardioversion: Therapy with calcium-channel antagonists prior to electrical cardioversion of AF has yielded contradictory results; several studies found that verapamil reduced immediate or early recurrences of AF, yet verapamil and diltiazem may increase AF duration, shorten refractoriness, and increase the spatial dispersion of refractoriness leading to more sustained AF.

Hemodynamic and Electrophysiologic Effects

Like other calcium antagonists, diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations. In the intact animal, prolongation of the AH interval can be seen at higher doses.

In man, diltiazem prevents spontaneous and ergonovine-provoked coronary artery spasm. It causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a modest fall in blood pressure, and in exercise tolerance studies in patients with ischemic heart disease, reduces the heart rate-blood pressure product for any given workload. Studies to date, primarily in patients with good ventricular function, have not revealed evidence of a negative inotropic effect; cardiac output, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure have not been affected. There are as yet few data on the interaction of diltiazem and beta-blockers. Resting heart rate is usually unchanged or slightly reduced by diltiazem.

Intravenous diltiazem in doses of 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods approximately 20%. In a study involving single oral doses of 300 mg of CARDIZEM in six normal volunteers, the average maximum PR prolongation was 14% with no instances of greater than first-degree AV block. Diltiazem-associated prolongation of the AH interval is not more pronounced in patients with first-degree heart block. In patients with sick sinus syndrome, diltiazem significantly prolongs sinus cycle length (up to 50% in some cases).

Chronic oral administration of CARDIZEM in doses of up to 240 mg/day has resulted in small increases in PR interval but has not usually produced abnormal prolongation.

As doses of CARDIZEM CD were increased, overall angina frequency was decreased. CARDIZEM CD, 180 mg once daily, or placebo was administered in a double-blind study to patients receiving concomitant treatment with long-acting nitrates and/or beta-blockers. A significant increase in time to termination of exercise and a significant decrease in overall angina frequency was observed.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Intravenous diltiazem infusions for rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter in the emergency department: a retrospective, exploratory analysis [^112ZnihR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians commonly treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response, and intravenous (IV) diltiazem is the most commonly used medication for rate control of such patients. We sought to compare rate control success and safety outcomes for emergency department (ED) patients with AF or AFL who, after a diltiazem bolus, received a diltiazem drip compared to those who did not receive a drip.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes of ED patients from a single hospital system with AF and AFL and a heart rate (HR) > 100 beats/min who received a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus to those who received no drip. The primary outcome was a HR < 100 beats/min at the time of ED disposition. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and safety (hypotension, electrical cardioversion, vasopressor use, and death). We compared groups using propensity score matching.

Results

Between January 1, 2020, and November 8, 2022, there were 746 AF or AFL patients eligible for analysis. Of those, 382 (51.2%) received a diltiazem drip and 364 (48.8%) did not. In the unadjusted analysis, the last recorded ED HR was < 100 beats/min in 55.2% of patients in the drip group compared to 65.9% in the no-drip group (difference 10.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7 to 17.7). After propensity matching, diltiazem drip use was associated with lower likelihood of rate control in the ED (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.99) and 22.5h (95% CI 12.2–36.8) longer hospital stay.

Conclusions

For patients with AF or AFL, the use of a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus was associated with less rate control in the ED.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — synopsis highlights effective classes and selection considerations. Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control, and these agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control, and selection of specific agents should consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], reactive airway disease) and response.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Diltiazem Hydrochloride Injection or Diltiazem Hydrochloride for Injection are indicated for the following:

Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It should not be used in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome or short PR syndrome.

In addition, Diltiazem Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for:

Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia

Rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. This includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias associated with an extranodal accessory pathway such as the WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome. Unless otherwise contraindicated, appropriate vagal maneuvers should be attempted prior to administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

The use of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection should be undertaken with caution when the patient is compromised hemodynamically or is taking other drugs that decrease any or all of the following: peripheral resistance, myocardial filling, myocardial contractility, or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium.

For either indication and particularly when employing continuous intravenous infusion, the setting should include continuous monitoring of the ECG and frequent measurement of blood pressure. A defibrillator and emergency equipment should be readily available.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Direct Intravenous Single Injections (Bolus)

The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight as a bolus administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second bolus dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized for each patient. Patients with low body weights should be dosed on a mg/kg basis. Some patients may respond to an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg, although duration of action may be shorter. Experience with this dose is limited.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion

For continued reduction of the heart rate (up to 24 hours) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection may be administered. (For reconstitution of diltiazem hydrochloride for injection, see instructions contained within packaging.) Immediately following bolus administration of 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) or 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg) diltiazem hydrochloride injection and reduction of heart rate, begin an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection. The recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection is 10 mg/h. Some patients may maintain response to an initial rate of 5 mg/h. The infusion rate may be increased in 5 mg/h increments up to 15 mg/h as needed, if further reduction in heart rate is required. The infusion may be maintained for up to 24 hours.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. (5.2)
Second-or third-degree AV block. (5.3)
Heart failure. (5.4)
Hypotension. (5.5)

5.1 Tachycardia and Hypotension in patients with AF/AFL and accessory bypass tract

Diltiazem may cause ventricular fibrillation if given to patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome. Distinguish atrial fibrillation with aberrancy (bundle branch block) from pre-excited atrial fibrillation prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Hemodynamic Deterioration in Patients with Wide Complex Tachycardia

Diltiazem may cause hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. Distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 AV Block

Diltiazem prolongs AV nodal conduction and refractoriness that may cause second- or third-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Concomitant use of diltiazem with agents known to affect cardiac conduction may result in additive effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If high-degree AV block occurs in sinus rhythm, discontinue diltiazem and institute appropriate supportive measures [see Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Heart Failure

Diltiazem is a negative inotrope and can cause decreased systolic function and heart failure. Do not initiate in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. If heart failure develops during diltiazem treatment, discontinue treatment and treat heart failure appropriately.

5.5 Hypotension

Diltiazem can cause symptomatic hypotension. Patients with low blood pressure at baseline and those on concomitant medications that decrease blood pressure, intravascular volume, or myocardial contractility are at increased risk for hypotension.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In controlled clinical trials, therapy with antiarrhythmic agents to maintain reduced heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or for prophylaxis of PSVT was generally started within 3 hours after bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride. These antiarrhythmic agents were intravenous or oral digoxin, Class 1 antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), calcium channel blockers, and oral beta-blockers.

### Diltiazem hci [^113B1CAL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem hydrochloride injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

### Evaluation of diltiazem dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^111nKZr6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of treatment failure between oral (PO) immediate release (IR) tablet and continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) diltiazem following an initial loading dose in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This single center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 in AF with RVR who received oral or continuous diltiazem after an initial intravenous loading dose. The primary objective of this study is to identify the percentage of patients with treatment failure four hours after initiation of diltiazem IR PO tablet or continuous IV infusion. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and clinically significant hypotension.

Results

Of the 171 patients included, 85 received PO IR diltiazem and 86 received CIVI diltiazem. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of treatment failure between the PO and CIVI groups (60% vs 59%, p = 0.93). Patients who received PO diltiazem were more frequently discharged from the ED (31.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (6.6 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.06) or clinically significant hypotension (11.7% vs 8.1% p = 0.428).

Conclusion

Initiating immediate-release oral diltiazem after an initial IV bolus does not result in more treatment failures than initiating a continuous infusion.

Acute pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) — agent-specific notes: Intravenous esmolol may have modest efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF, but this has not been established by comparison with placebo; it is not useful in patients with persistent AF, a response may be expected within 1 h after initiation of intravenous infusion, and hypotension and bronchospasm are major adverse effects. Verapamil and diltiazem have not been found effective for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF but act rapidly to control the rate of ventricular response; negative inotropic effects might result in hypotension and caution should be used in patients with heart failure (HF). Digitalis glycosides are generally not more effective than placebo for conversion of recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm, may prolong episodes of paroxysmal AF, and manifestations of digitalis toxicity are dose related. Disopyramide has not been tested adequately for conversion of AF but may be effective when administered intravenously; adverse effects include drying of mucous membranes, constipation, urinary retention, and depression of left ventricular (LV) contractility, making it a relatively unattractive option. Sotalol has no proved efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF when given either orally or intravenously, but it does control the heart rate; in patients who tolerate AF relatively well, a wait-and-see approach using oral sotalol is an appropriate option, and side effects consist mainly of QT prolongation associated with torsades de pointes.

### Impact of an emergency department observation unit management algorithm for atrial fibrillation [^115Q85ip]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Initially, patients were assessed for stability, which was primarily determined by the discretion of the provider, with instability being suggested by chest pain, ST‐segment changes concerning for ischemia, respiratory distress, hypoxia, or hypotension. Patients deemed unstable were excluded from the treatment algorithm and were instead resuscitated as indicated by the clinical scenario.

After the initial evaluation and assessment of stability, intravenous (IV) diltiazem was recommended as the initial medication for rate control at an initial dose of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg or 10 to 20 mg IV over 2 minutes. This dose could be repeated 15 minutes later if the heart rate remained > 110 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure remained adequate. Simultaneously, 30 mg of oral diltiazem was recommended to be administered after the initial bolus was given, which would be scheduled to be given every 6 hours while the patient remained in the ED. If the patient's heart rate continued to be > 110 bpm after 2 doses of intravenous diltiazem and 30 mg of oral diltiazem, providers were instructed to consider initiation of a continuous diltiazem infusion at 5 mg/h titrated to a heart rate of 80 to 110 bpm, increased in increments of 3 to 5 mg/h every 5 minutes, as blood pressure allowed.

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^115iZp3t]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. Acute atrial fibrillation resolves spontaneously within 24–48 hours in over 50% of people, however many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions: to prevent embolism; for conversion to sinus rhythm; and to control heart rate in people with recent onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

### Atrial fibrillation care improvement collaborative [^116LRRX3]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Strategy

The project team began meeting in February 2013. A standardized atrial fibrillation order set was developed for the emergency department, addressing the preferred rate control medication (diltiazem) and an alternative anticoagulant (dabigatran). The calcium channel blocker diltiazem was chosen rather than a beta blocker (such as esmolol) for several reasons including literature support for its use, the ability to use in patients with bronchospastic airway disease, the ability to administer as an IV drip via nomogram, provider familiarity, and ability to easily convert to oral therapy.

Dabigatran, rather than the more complex low molecular weight heparin and warfarin regimen, was offered as an option to patients when appropriate. Dabigatran was the only novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) available for atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis when project planning began, and the project group elected to stay with a single agent through implementation despite availability of other NOACs subsequently. A 30 day supply of dabigatran was provided to patients who chose this option.

The emergency department atrial fibrillation order set also encompassed stroke risk calculation using the CHADS2 score, the role and timing of cardioversion, and utilization of the emergency department observation unit.

Stable local AF patients followed up with their primary care providers, rather than cardiologists, whenever possible. Cardiology and emergency department project champions communicated the order set and practice changes to their providers. Primary care project champions educated family medicine and primary care internal medicine staff via email and intranet, face to face presentations, and educational videos. Project leadership participated in an institution wide panel presentation and question and answer session. Initial rollout took place in July 2013.

The project group continued to meet after rollout to troubleshoot several issues, including the process of developing an AF order set for a busy emergency department. This task was completed within the project timeline. Additionally, providing a 30 day supply of dabigatran to patients proved challenging, but a medication discount applied within the pharmacy system improved access to this medication. Finally, the problematic connections between the emergency department control desk and the primary care practice scheduling desks were improved by providing the ED with phone numbers, electronic message access and clinic hours while at the same time educating primary care schedulers regarding prioritization of follow up for AF patients.

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^117NdQZ7]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute atrial fibrillation is rapid, irregular, and chaotic atrial activity of less than 48 hours' duration.

Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The condition resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours in over 50% of people; however, many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Atrial fibrillation — general antiarrhythmic drug therapy and monitoring: Before administering any antiarrhythmic agent, reversible precipitants of AF should be identified and corrected, and patients who develop HF in association with alcohol intake should abstain from alcohol consumption. When treatment with a single antiarrhythmic drug fails, combinations may be tried; useful combinations include a beta blocker, sotalol, or amiodarone with a class IC agent, and the combination of a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem, with a class IC agent, such as flecainide or propafenone, is advantageous in some patients. A drug that is initially safe may become proarrhythmic if coronary disease or HF develops or with interacting medications; thus, the patient should be alerted to the potential significance of such symptoms as syncope, angina, or dyspnea and warned about the use of noncardiac drugs that might prolong the QT interval. With class IC drugs, prolongation of the QRS interval should not exceed 50%, and for class IA or class III drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, the corrected QT interval in sinus rhythm should be kept below 520 ms; exercise testing may help detect QRS widening that occurs only at rapid heart rates. During follow-up, plasma potassium and magnesium levels and renal function should be checked periodically, and in individual patients, serial noninvasive assessment of LV function is indicated, especially when clinical HF develops during treatment of AF.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

General thoracic surgery (GTS) postoperative atrial fibrillation — calcium-channel blocker prophylaxis (diltiazem): Class IIa recommendation: Diltiazem prophylaxis is reasonable in most patients undergoing major pulmonary resection who are not taking a β-blocker preoperatively, though hypotension may develop and dose reduction or other pressure-elevating therapies may be required (Level of evidence B). Several randomized trials show the incidence of atrial fibrillation is reduced by approximately one half: 10.6% versus 21.5% (relative risk 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.73), and because diltiazem has a far lower rate of hypotension than verapamil, diltiazem is the recommended calcium-blocking agent. Although the only placebo-controlled diltiazem study used an IV load and 24-hour infusion followed by oral therapy, it may be reasonable to administer prophylactic diltiazem orally alone; oral diltiazem begun in the recovery room is reasonable after lung resection at 30 to 60 mg every 6 hours, and orders should include "hold parameters". These data come from a meta-analysis that included 11 studies, with trials collectively including more than 1,300 participants.

Atrial fibrillation rate control — comparative drug effects and emergency department outcomes show heart rate reductions across agents and similar acute care outcomes between classes. In a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, crossover study, the 24-hour mean heart rate was 96 ± 12 bpm at baseline (no treatment), 75 ± 10 bpm with diltiazem, 81 ± 11 bpm with verapamil, 82 ± 11 bpm with metoprolol, and 84 ± 11 bpm with carvedilol, with all drugs significantly reducing heart rate versus baseline. In a retrospective cohort from two urban emergency departments, a total of 259 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 100 receiving calcium channel blockers and 159 receiving beta blockers; twenty-seven percent of patients taking beta blockers were admitted, while 31.0% of patients taking calcium channel blockers were admitted, with no significant differences in emergency department length of stay, adverse events, or 7- or 30-day revisits. A follow-up analysis of the AFFIRM study reported no difference in all hospitalization and all-cause mortality among participants receiving beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin as a single rate-control agent at baseline.

Intravenous magnesium and rate-control agents — evidence in AF with rapid ventricular response: A meta-analysis including '6 RCTs (n = 745 patients)' reported intravenous magnesium superior for rate control '(63% versus 40%; OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.80–3.45])' and modestly effective for rhythm conversion '(21% versus 14%; OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.08–2.84])' versus standard methods, with subgroup results favoring a lower dose '(≤ 5 g) (24% versus 13%; OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.22–3.61])' over a higher dose '(> 5 g) (16% versus 13%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.65–2.32])' for rhythm control compared with placebo.

In HFrEF populations, retrospective analyses associated diltiazem with increased acute kidney injury within 48 hours when 'LVEF ≤ 50%' compared with normal EF '(10% versus 3.6%; P = 0.002)' and with a higher incidence of worsening HF symptoms '(33% versus 15%; P = 0.019)', while 'Neither analysis noted an increase in the in-hospital mortality rate, need for a higher level of care, or hypotension'.

### Safety of diltiazem for acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^116zQBRj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diltiazem is an effective rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF RVR). However, its negative inotropic effects may increase the risk for worsening heart failure in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF).

Objectives

This observational study aims to describe the incidence of worsening heart failure in patients who receive intravenous diltiazem for acute atrial fibrillation management.

Methods

Adult patients that received diltiazem in the emergency department (ED) for AF RVR (heart rate ≥ 100 beats/min) from 2021 to 2022 and had a prior documented EF were included. The primary outcome is worsening heart failure within 24 h of diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes include return ED visits and death within 7 days. EF percentage was compared across outcomes using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Outcomes were compared by reduced EF (< 50%) and preserved EF (≥ 50%). Continuous data were summarized with medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical features were summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for numeric outcomes and chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical outcomes, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

There were 674 patients with AF RVR that received diltiazem, and 386 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Baseline demographics included a median age of 72 (64–81) years, with 14.5% of patients having a prior diagnosis of congestive heart failure. EF < 50% was identified in 13.7% of patients (n = 53), of which approximately 30% of these patients safely discharged home after receiving i.v. diltiazem. The primary outcome of worsening heart failure occurred in 7/41 (17%) and 10/207 (4.8%) patients with reduced and preserved ejection fractions, respectively, who were admitted to the hospital (p = 0.005).

Conclusion

The development of worsening heart failure is multifactorial and may include the use of diltiazem in critically ill patients requiring hospital admission.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117JARSL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Calcium chloride before I.V. diltiazem in the management of atrial fibrillation [^111fxGgX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Diltiazem is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Although it is very effective for rate control, up to an 18% prevalence of reported diltiazem-induced hypotension [defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm Hg], and a mean of 9.7% hypotension have been reported from several studies totaling over 450 patients. This hypotension may complicate therapy. Our objective was to determine if calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) pre-treatment would blunt a SBP drop after i.v. diltiazem, while allowing diltiazem to maintain its efficacy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Seventy-eight patients with AFF and a ventricular rate of ≥ 120 beats per minute were enrolled. Half received i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment; the other half received placebo. All patients then received i.v. diltiazem in a standard, weight-based dose. A second dose of CaCl(2) pre-treatment or placebo and diltiazem was given if clinically indicated for additional rate control. Both CaCl(2) and placebo pre-treatment groups had equal lowering of heart rate (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events in the calcium pre-treatment study arm. One patient in the placebo group became paradoxically more tachycardic and apneic after the diltiazem infusion. Although i.v. CaCl(2) seems to be equally safe compared to placebo as a pre-treatment in the management of AFF with RVR, we were unable to find a statistically significant blunting of SBP drop with CaCl(2) i.v. pre-treatment. Until further research determines a benefit exists, we cannot recommend i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment before diltiazem in the treatment of AFF with RVR.

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^112GLsyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

Orthodromic AVRT ongoing management — Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in patients with AVRT and/or pre-excited AF. Oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are indicated for ongoing management in patients with AVRT without pre-excitation on their resting ECG. Oral flecainide or propafenone is reasonable for ongoing management in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have AVRT and/or pre-excited AF and are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation. Oral dofetilide or sotalol may be reasonable for ongoing management in patients with AVRT and/or pre-excited AF who are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation. Oral amiodarone may be considered for ongoing management in patients with AVRT and/or pre-excited AF who are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation and in whom beta blockers, diltiazem, flecainide, propafenone, and verapamil are ineffective or contraindicated. Oral digoxin may be reasonable for ongoing management of orthodromic AVRT in patients without pre-excitation on their resting ECG who are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation, but oral digoxin is potentially harmful for ongoing management in patients with AVRT or AF and pre-excitation on their resting ECG.

### Low-dose diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1119RNHb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diltiazem is one of the most commonly used medications to control the rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF). The recommended starting dose is an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes. To avoid hypotension, we have empirically used a lower dose of diltiazem. We compared the efficacy and safety of different doses of diltiazem in rapid AF.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken in patients who presented to the emergency department with rapid AF. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to diltiazem dosage: low dose (≤ 0.2 mg/kg), standard dose (> 0.2 and ≤ 0.3 mg/kg), and high dose (> 0.3 mg/kg). We compared the rates of therapeutic response (adequate rate control) and complications (such as hypotension). Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of diltiazem dose on the occurrence of complications.

Results

A total of 180 patients were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of therapeutic response for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups (70.5%, 77.1%, and 77.8%; p = 0.605). The rates of hypotension in the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups were 18%, 34.9%, and 41.7%, respectively. After adjusting confounding variables, the rate of hypotension was significantly lower in the low-dose group in comparison with the standard-dose group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.94).

Conclusions

Low-dose diltiazem might be as effective as the standard dose in controlling rapid AF and reduce the risk of hypotension.

### Evaluation of the blood pressure effects of diltiazem versus metoprolol in the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate [^112Ws4s2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the difference in blood pressure effects of diltiazem intravenous push (IVP) and metoprolol IVP in the acute management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF with RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study evaluating patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between January 2012 and September 2018 in AF with RVR and received either diltiazem IVP or metoprolol IVP as the first agent for rate control. The primary objective was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) within one hour of initial medication administration. Secondary outcomes included repeat doses within one hour, rate control to < 110 beats per minute, and SBP < 90 mmHg or decrease by > 40% within three hours. Subgroup analysis of patients with a baseline SBP < 110 mmHg was conducted.

Results

Of the 160 patients included, 80 received diltiazem and 80 metoprolol. The primary outcome of median change in SBP at one hour was a difference of -9 [-21 to 6] mmHg in the diltiazem group versus a difference of -4 [-18 to 9] mmHg in the metoprolol group (p = 0.102). Subgroup analysis (n = 28) of patients with a baseline SBP < 110 mmHg demonstrated an increase of 7 [-0.25 to 19] mmHg in the diltiazem group versus increase of 7 [0 to 13] in the metoprolol group (p = 0.910).

Conclusion

No significant difference was observed in the blood pressure effects of diltiazem IVP versus metoprolol IVP in the acute management of AF with RVR.

1.4 Arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia seen in older adults with prevalence increasing with age. 43 The primary goals of AF management include prevention of thromboembolic events, primarily ischemic stroke, and reduction of symptoms and hospitalizations. 43

Anticoagulation: Systemic anticoagulation should be considered in all patients with atrial fibrillation; however, concern over falls and subsequent bleeding may lead to under‐prescribing. Implementation of the HAS‐BLED and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc scores may help guide pharmacotherapy decision‐making. 44, 45 Newer agents such as the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now considered the preferred option demonstrating similar efficacy in preventing stroke and systemic embolism, with a lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin. 46 Warfarin also seems to be associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures compared to the DOACs. 47 All DOACs require dose adjustments for renal function. Apixaban is often considered the preferred agent for older adults, as it has lower renal excretion than dabigatran and rivaroxaban. For those with end stage renal disease, either apixaban or warfarin is reasonable.

Rate vs rhythm control: Symptomatic management of AF consists of either rhythm control or rate control. Rhythm control was shown to be inferior to rate control with respect to mortality in older adults and is associated with more adverse drug events and hospitalizations. 48 Moreover, antiarrhythmic agents use is limited in this population due to co‐morbidities including structural heart disease, heart failure, and renal dysfunction. Amiodarone may often be the only appropriate option, although its use is associated with many long term side effects. Once AF becomes permanent and the decision to pursue rate control is made, all antiarrhythmic agents should be discontinued. Rate control is usually achieved with beta‐blockers, or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) such as diltiazem. 49 Atenolol should be avoided in this population due to its renal excretion. Digoxin may also be used for rate control when hypotension limits beta‐blocker or CCB use, but it requires strict monitoring to ensure therapeutic drug levels. Chronic digoxin use appears to be associated with increased mortality. 50 Therefore, initiation of digoxin therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation alone should generally be avoided when possible.

### How to manage atrial fibrillation secondary to ibrutinib [^113G2zRv]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

How Do We Decide on Rate Control Versus Rhythm Control?

There is a paucity of randomized controlled trial data addressing the question of rate versus rhythm control in patients with hematologic malignancy. We typically advise a rate control strategy, because maintenance of sinus rhythm may be less likely in patients being treated with proarrhythmogenic cancer therapies. In specific populations, rhythm control may be more appropriate; for example, in young patients without structural heart disease who have completed proarrhythmogenic therapy or patients who are unable to tolerate their symptom load. When using a rate control strategy, we advise beta-blockers as first-line therapy. This is due to interactions between ibrutinib and calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil), which have a CYP3A4 inhibitory effect resulting in increased levels of ibrutinib and resultant exacerbation of AF and bleeding. Digoxin is also known to have P-glycoprotein interactions resulting in increased plasma levels of digoxin and so should be avoided whenever possible. If there are no other options, we suggest a lower dose of digoxin to be given 6 h before or after ibrutinib.

In our case, a decision was made for a rate control strategy based on: 1) patient's age; 2) need for ongoing Ibrutinib treatment; 3) low symptom burden reported by the patient; and 4) left atrial enlargement on echocardiogram suggesting that a rhythm control strategy was less likely to be successful.

Atrial flutter (acute treatment) — management is stratified by hemodynamic stability: under the "Hemodynamically stable" pathway, rhythm control includes "Synchronized cardioversion; oral dofetilide, IV ibutilide, and/or rapid atrial pacing† (Class I)", and rate control lists "IV beta blockers, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class I)", with "IV amiodarone (Class IIa)" also shown; when "Hemodynamically stable" is "No", rhythm control is "Synchronized cardioversion (Class I)" and rate control again lists "IV amiodarone (Class IIa)". Anticoagulation is mandatory and "for rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion or rapid atrial pacing is not appropriate".

### Serious bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation using diltiazem with apixaban or rivaroxaban… [^115PRFeH]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The median length of follow-up for diltiazem was 100 days for doses of 120 mg/d or lower and 102 days for doses higher than 120mg/d and that for metoprolol was 120 days. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker commonly prescribed for ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, 7 is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. It produced a
4. 05-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam8 and led to dose-dependent increases in the AUC for the substrates nifedipine9 and ranolazine. 10 Diltiazem also may weakly inhibit P-gp; a study reported that concurrent use with the P-gp substrate digoxin increased the digoxin AUC by 22. 4%. 11 Coadministration of diltiazem with apixaban increased the AUC for apixaban by 40%.
12. There was concurrent anticoagulant and rate-control drug use for
83. 4% and 82.

6% of follow-up days in the diltiazem and metoprolol groups, respectively. The most common reasons for ending follow-up were stopping the oral anticoagulant or rate-control drug. Patients receiving diltiazem treatment less frequently stopped the rate-control drug and more frequently switched treatments. For diltiazem treatment with starting doses of less than or equal to 120 mg/d or greater than 120 mg/d, doses during follow-up were concordant for 83. 7% and
94. 3% of prescriptions, respectively. The risk of the primary composite outcome for initial diltiazem doses higher than 120 mg/d was greater than that for lower doses. Although neither diltiazem dose was associated with a significant change in the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism or of death without recent evidence of bleeding, patients receiving doses higher than 120 mg/d had increased risk for major ischemic or hemorrhagic events.
