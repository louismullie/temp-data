## Question

How long is the isolation for C. Diff?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long isolation should last for Clostridioides difficile infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "isolation" entails in guidelines (contact precautions, room placement, hand hygiene). Then, I should verify the minimum duration after symptom resolution. Next, I will consider when to extend precautions to discharge. After that, I need to check what to do while diagnostic testing is pending. Finally, I should review special populations and reconcile any conflicting guidance, anchoring to IDSA/SHEA and CDC/SHEA compendium updates for consistency.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of "isolation" for CDI. In practice, this means contact precautions with gown and gloves on room entry, preference for a private room with dedicated toilet, and hand hygiene with soap and water because alcohol does not inactivate spores; these are strong recommendations in IDSA/SHEA and ASCRS guidance, and reiterated in the 2022 SHEA/IDSA compendium, so I should not understate these fundamentals [^1133QHbt] [^114ynsoo] [^113g9f3A] [^1113Xg9y].

> Now, I should verify the minimum duration. The standard recommendation is to continue contact precautions for at least 48 hours after diarrhea has resolved; this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence in IDSA/SHEA, but it is consistently echoed across SHEA/IDSA compendium updates and contemporary reviews, so I should treat 48 hours after resolution as the baseline minimum [^115Xp3do] [^111UFhtq] [^112VTKaf] [^112sL4yF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some facilities extend precautions beyond 48 hours. I need to check the escalation criteria. If CDI rates remain high despite standard infection control measures, guidelines allow prolonging contact precautions until hospital discharge; this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence, and facilities must balance potential transmission reduction against patient harms from isolation such as falls and psychosocial effects, so extension is situational rather than routine [^115Xp3do] [^114ipHnv] [^112sL4yF].

> Next, I should review what to do while testing is pending, because timing matters for transmission risk. Patients with suspected CDI should be placed on preemptive contact precautions while awaiting test results if results cannot be obtained the same day; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence in IDSA/SHEA, and the 2022 compendium similarly advises placing patients with new-onset unexplained diarrhea on contact precautions promptly because shedding is highest early [^111KfPTx] [^112tPhN8] [^116Viqtr] [^112heLGT].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with infants. Routine testing for CDI in neonates and infants ≤ 12 months is not recommended because colonization is common; if an infant has diarrhea and tests positive, contact precautions are reasonable, but if there is no diarrhea, isolation is not indicated, and in NICU settings, precautions can be discontinued 48 hours after diarrhea resolves with consideration of moving to a new incubator or room, so I should avoid over-isolating colonized babies without symptoms [^113fWLkt] [^112c62jd] [^115Km5Nw].

> Let me consider pediatrics more broadly. Children with CDI should follow the same general principle of contact precautions for at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolution, with attention to developmental factors like continence; the AAP advises excluding from childcare until stools are contained and frequency is no more than two stools above normal, which aligns with a symptom-based approach rather than test-based clearance, so I should not extend isolation beyond clinical resolution absent a compelling institutional reason [^115Xp3do].

> But wait, what if the patient is readmitted after recent CDI — do we isolate again? I should double-check this nuance. There is insufficient evidence to mandate contact precautions solely based on a history of CDI on readmission; decisions should be individualized by current symptoms, recent testing, and local epidemiology, so I should avoid reflex isolation without clinical justification [^112LmXBo].

> I need to ensure I am not conflating colonization with infection. Asymptomatic carriers should not be placed on contact precautions; IDSA/SHEA concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend screening for asymptomatic carriage or isolating carriers, and modeling studies suggesting benefit come with substantial operational burden, so routine isolation of colonized, asymptomatic patients is not advised outside of research or outbreak contexts [^111FuZ9f] [^112jFbp1] [^116LWvzz].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. Minimum isolation: at least 48 hours after diarrhea has resolved, using contact precautions with gown and gloves, private room with dedicated toilet when available, and soap-and-water hand hygiene. Extension: prolong precautions to discharge if institutional CDI rates remain high despite standard measures. Pending tests: start contact precautions for suspected CDI if results won't return the same day. Special cases: avoid routine testing and isolation in infants ≤ 12 months without diarrhea; tailor pediatric and readmission decisions to symptoms and risk, not prior labels alone [^115Xp3do] [^111UFhtq] [^111KfPTx] [^113fWLkt] [^112LmXBo].

Isolation for C. difficile should continue until **diarrhea has resolved for at least 48 hours** [^115Xp3do] [^111UFhtq] and the patient has completed appropriate antibiotic therapy. If CDI rates remain high despite standard measures, **extend precautions until discharge** [^114ipHnv] [^112sL4yF]. For suspected cases, **start contact precautions immediately** [^111KfPTx] and maintain them until CDI is excluded or confirmed and the 48-hour rule is met [^112VTKaf]. Asymptomatic carriers do not require isolation [^111FuZ9f] [^112jFbp1].

---

## Minimum duration of isolation

The minimum duration of isolation for patients with CDI is **at least 48 hours after diarrhea has resolved** [^115Xp3do] [^111UFhtq]. This recommendation is based on evidence that patients continue to shed C. difficile spores even after symptom resolution, albeit at lower levels [^111UFhtq]. The 48-hour rule balances infection control needs with patient safety and comfort.

---

## Circumstances requiring extended isolation

In certain situations, **isolation may need to be extended beyond the minimum 48-hour period**:

- **High CDI rates**: If a healthcare facility experiences elevated CDI rates despite implementation of standard infection control measures, contact precautions should be prolonged until the patient is discharged [^114ipHnv] [^112sL4yF].

- **Severe or complicated cases**: Patients with severe or complicated CDI, such as those with toxic megacolon, severe ileus, or immunocompromised status, may require extended isolation due to increased risk of transmission and prolonged shedding of spores.

- **Outbreak settings**: During outbreaks, healthcare facilities may implement stricter isolation policies, including extending isolation until discharge, to control transmission [^114ipHnv] [^112sL4yF].

---

## Isolation of suspected cases

Patients with suspected CDI should be placed on **contact precautions immediately** while diagnostic testing is pending [^111KfPTx] [^116Viqtr]. If CDI is confirmed, isolation should continue according to the 48-hour rule after diarrhea resolution. If CDI is excluded, isolation can be discontinued [^112VTKaf].

---

## Isolation of asymptomatic carriers

Asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile are **not routinely isolated** [^111FuZ9f] [^112jFbp1]. There is insufficient evidence to support screening for asymptomatic carriage or placing asymptomatic carriers on contact precautions [^116LWvzz]. However, in outbreak settings or facilities with high CDI rates, some institutions may consider isolating asymptomatic carriers as part of enhanced infection control strategies [^114pHk9w].

---

## Role of antibiotic therapy in determining isolation duration

Antibiotic therapy plays a crucial role in managing CDI and indirectly influences isolation duration. Patients should receive appropriate antibiotic therapy (oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin) [^112cv9uq] [^113ue2qN] for the recommended duration (typically 10 days) [^113RMGPc]. Isolation should continue until diarrhea has resolved for at least 48 hours and the patient has completed the antibiotic course.

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: The same isolation principles apply to pediatric patients. Isolation should continue until diarrhea has resolved for at least 48 hours and appropriate antibiotic therapy has been completed [^115yTTfc].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: These patients may require extended isolation due to prolonged shedding of spores and increased risk of transmission.

- **Long-term care facilities**: Isolation policies in long-term care facilities generally follow the same principles, with emphasis on infection control measures and antibiotic stewardship [^1113Xg9y].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Isolation duration** |
|-|-|
| Confirmed CDI | - At least 48 hours after diarrhea resolution <br/> - Extend if CDI rates remain high or in severe cases |
| Suspected CDI (testing pending) | Until CDI is excluded or confirmed |
| Asymptomatic carrier | No routine isolation |
| Severe or complicated CDI | Extended isolation until discharge |

---

Isolation for C. difficile infection should continue until **diarrhea has resolved for at least 48 hours** [^115Xp3do] and the patient has completed appropriate antibiotic therapy. In cases of high CDI rates, severe disease, or outbreaks, isolation may be extended until discharge [^114ipHnv] [^112sL4yF]. Asymptomatic carriers do not require isolation [^111FuZ9f] [^112jFbp1].

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — infection prevention practices context: The guideline notes that although previous ACG guidelines included prevention content, "we chose not to make GRADE recommendations around the subject in this document". It cites external guidance stating that clinical practice guidelines "recommend isolating patients with suspected or confirmed CDI, use of full-barrier precautions (i.e., gowns and gloves) while caring for these patients, and hand hygiene before and after contact with patients with CDI, preferably using soap and water", and that "None of these guidelines recommends contact precautions in asymptomatic carriers". It also states that antibiotic stewardship programs restricting high-risk and unnecessary antimicrobials "were shown to be effective in outbreak and nonoutbreak settings and are recommended to control rates of CDI".

### Risks and preventive strategies for Clostridioides difficile transmission to household or community contacts during transition in healthcare settings [^111NNuEw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides (the genus name of this bacterium was changed from Clostridium to Clostridioides during 2018) difficile infection (CDI) is responsible for almost half a million infections and ≈29,000 deaths in the United States annually. During 2000‒2014, the number of hospitalizations from CDI increased from 134,518 to 361,945, and the financial contribution to inpatient healthcare expenditure increased from $0.5 billion to $3.9 billion. Risk factors for CDI and colonization include older age, recent hospitalization, recent use of antimicrobial drugs, and use of proton-pump inhibitors. Transmission of C. difficile occurs through the spread of spores primarily through environmental contamination, hands of healthcare personnel, and asymptomatic carriers. Several well-established guidelines recommend strategies in the inpatient setting to prevent and treat CDI. Prevention methods strongly recommended in the guidelines within an acute-care setting include isolating patients with CDI in private rooms with private toilets, using gloves and gowns when entering rooms with CDI patients, using soap and water when entering or exiting a CDI patient room, and cleaning reusable equipment with a sporicidal disinfectant. For treatment, the 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommends stopping causing antimicrobial drugs and using oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin, or intravenous metronidazole as a less preferred alternative, in most cases of CDI.

### Prevention of infection due to Clostridium difficile [^115Km5Nw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile in the NICU — contact precautions and isolation: Infants with diarrhea and a positive C. difficile test should be placed on contact precautions, whereas infants without diarrhea who have tested positive for C. difficile do not require contact precautions, and contact precautions can be discontinued 48 hours after diarrhea has resolved with consideration at that time for moving the patient to a new incubator and/or a new room. Patients with asymptomatic C. difficile colonizations shed spores but generally shed fewer spores and cause less contamination than symptomatic patients, and contact precautions are important to preventing transmission from patients with CDI and should be used until 48 hours after resolution of diarrhea, while extending this practice to NICU patients is not recommended.

### Prevention of infection due to Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile [^114EVHok]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile infection (CDI) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States every year. Prevention of CDI is difficult because of spore durability and requires implementation of multipronged strategies. Two categories of prevention strategies are infection control and prevention and risk factor reduction. Hand hygiene, contact precautions, patient isolation, and environmental decontamination are cornerstones of infection control and prevention. Risk factor reduction should focus on antibiotic stewardship to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. If CDI incidence remains higher than the institution's goal despite these measures, then special measures should be considered.

The Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) epidemic has been impacting the world for years. Understanding accurate diagnostics is imperative to allow the appropriate patients to be treated and improve outcomes. This article leverages multiple global societal guidelines to focus on the evolving diagnostic tests available summarizing best diagnostic practices including 2-step diagnostic testing. Therapeutically, guideline recommendations more recently have favored fidaxomicin and incorporated immune-based therapies and microbial restoration therapies. As treatment options and guideline recommendations change, it is imperative to understand why these recommendations have evolved and understand current best diagnostic and therapeutic practices in managing CDI.

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112VTKaf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — contact precautions during testing and duration: The decision to place a patient on contact precautions while testing is pending can be based on likelihood of transmission, CDI test turnaround time, and bed management. Movement to a private or cohorted room while awaiting test results is recommended at centers where C. difficile test turnaround time is > 12–24 hours. If C. difficile testing is negative and another infectious etiology requiring contact precautions is not suspected, contact precautions can be discontinued based on test type and clinical suspicion for CDI; because of its high negative predictive value, patients with a negative NAAT can be removed from contact precautions. For patients with CDI, CDC currently recommends contact precautions for at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves, and it is also stated to prolong the duration of contact precautions after the patient becomes asymptomatic until hospital discharge (Quality of evidence: LOW). Facilities must balance potential reduction in C. difficile transmission with individual patient risk of isolation related to contact precautions, which may include falls and socioemotional stress that can lead to symptoms such as behavior changes, anxiety, depression, and anger.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) control — screening for asymptomatic carriage and placing asymptomatic carriers on contact precautions lacks sufficient evidence; the guideline states, 'There are insufficient data to recommend screening for asymptomatic carriage and placing asymptomatic carriers on contact precautions (no recommendation)'. Evidence indicates that in institutions with higher CDI rates '(7.8–22.5 cases per 1000 discharges), the number of asymptomatic carriers has been found to be considerably higher than the number with CDI', that 'These asymptomatic carriers admitted to a ward could represent an important source of healthcare-associated spread of infection', and modeling suggests 'reductions in CDI incidence by 10%–25% could be achieved by identifying and isolating carriers upon hospital admission'.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Risks and preventive strategies for Clostridioides difficile transmission to household or community contacts during transition in healthcare settings [^111DLmrg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Although classically believed to be a hospital-acquired infection, C. difficile has also proven to be a major community pathogen. Although the 2017 IDSA/SHEA update recognizes the role of CDI in the community, it gives no specific prevention strategies to use at home. Community-acquired C. difficile might account for more than one third of total CDI cases, and patients tend to be younger and have less recent exposure to antimicrobial drugs and less exposure to healthcare settings than other persons who have CDI.

Because many patients hospitalized for CDI are discharged before completing full-course treatment or complete resolution of diarrhea, a common conundrum is deciding what prevention strategies are effective to be recommended at home after discharge to prevent the spread of infection to household or community contacts. Although substantial data and consensus guidelines exist for effective prevention strategies in the inpatient setting, similar data appear more sparse in the community setting. In this study, we systematically assessed data regarding the rate and role of the spread of C. difficile from an index hospitalized patient to the patient's household members and community contacts. We also aimed to identify potential effective preventive strategies within the community.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) prevention research questions focus on strategies to reduce CDI incidence, risk stratification, prophylaxis, and infection control. Topics include effectiveness of probiotics or biotherapeutics, antibiotic stewardship, and transmission prevention measures such as environmental management and isolation. The section asks about a core bundle usable across facilities, potential for vaccination and its composition/route, predictive systemic or mucosal serologic markers, secondary prevention in patients subsequently receiving antibiotics (including drugs, dosages, and duration), and the impact of admission screening for carriage with isolation of carriers on hospital-acquired CDI.

Infection control for hospitalized patients with Clostridioides difficile infection: Infection control measures should be implemented for hospitalized patients with CDI. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Outside the colon, C difficile survives in a spore form that is highly resistant to heat, acid, chemicals, and antibiotics; in hospitals it can readily spread from fomites like clothing or equipment, and contamination can also occur by simple contact with intact skin of infected patients. Alcohol hand rubs do not kill spores and therefore should not be used as a single agent for decontamination purposes under these circumstances; rather, combining contact precautions and hand washing with soap and water is recommended to prevent transmission of CDI in hospital and long-term care facilities.

Prevention

Prevention of CDI is an important goal to protect children and limit healthcare costs. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine, prevention strategies rely on a 2-pronged approach of prevention of spread of C. difficile spores and prevention of factors that promote progression to disease in those with established colonization.

Prevention of Transmission

In healthcare settings, attention to infection control practices and facility cleaning may help to limit the spread of C. difficile. As alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not inactivate spores, exercising meticulous hand hygiene with soap and water after caring for a patient with CDI is recommended. Contact isolation includes the donning of gloves and gowns by healthcare workers, with dedicated use of private patient rooms when available. Gloves have been shown to reduce the risk of hand contamination when caring for patients with CDI. Computer-simulated modeling suggests screening asymptomatic children on admission may decrease hospital onset CDI by 28.5%, but incorporating universal screening as part of a multi-intervention bundle could prove logistically prohibitive for some institutions given the high rates of colonization in some pediatric populations coupled with pediatric bed shortages.

As spores remain hardy in the environment surviving months or longer, environmental cleaning with approved sporicidal disinfectants is advised, as staying in a hospital room previously occupied by a patient with CDI increases risk of the current occupant. Ultraviolet disinfection has become a widely used and promising adjunctive measure.

The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious diseases advises that children with CDI be excluded from child care settings until stools are contained within the diaper or the child is continent and stool frequency is no more than 2 stools above normal frequency.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) prevention — essential practices emphasize antimicrobial and diagnostic stewardship, contact precautions, and environmental hygiene: "Encourage appropriate use of antimicrobials through implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE)", with actions to "Ensure appropriate use of antimicrobials for CDI treatment" and "Ensure appropriate use of non–CDI-treatment antimicrobials". Diagnostic stewardship states "Implement diagnostic stewardship practices for ensuring appropriate use and interpretation of C. difficile testing. (Quality of evidence: LOW)" and, at minimum, "C. difficile testing should be avoided in patients without clinically significant diarrhea, in those who have been tested in the prior 7 days, and in children aged < 1 year". Isolation measures direct "Use contact precautions for infected patients, single-patient room preferred", including to "Perform hand hygiene based on CDC or WHO guidelines before and after entering the room (ie, immediately before donning and after removing personal protective equipment)", to "Place patients with CDI on contact precautions to help reduce patient-to-patient spread of the organism", and that "Cohorting of patients with CDI is acceptable when single private rooms are not available". Environmental measures specify "Adequately clean and disinfect equipment and the environment of patients with CDI. (Quality of evidence: LOW for equipment; LOW for environment)" and to "Dedicate noncritical patient care items, such as blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, and thermometers, to a single patient with C. difficile".

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

### Infection prevention approaches for Clostridioides difficile [^114pUiN1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile prevention is challenging as spores are highly resilient and transmission sources diverse. Hand hygiene, contact precautions, and environmental decontamination are fundamental infection prevention strategies. Antimicrobial stewardship is highly effective at reducing C difficile risk at both the individual and institutional level. Supplemental control measures such as no-touch disinfection technologies and screening/isolation of carriers are generally reserved for situations in which fundamental control measures prove insufficient. Reducing host vulnerability through immunization, prophylactic antibiotics directed against C difficile, or products that protect/augment the microbiome may offer promise in the future.

### Information for clinicians about C. diff… [^116vLCNU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Healthcare Professionals about C. diff Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing puts patients at risk for C. diff infections. More than half of all hospitalized patients might get an antibiotic at some point during their hospital stay, but studies have shown that 30 to 50% of antibiotics prescribed in hospitals are unnecessary or incorrect. Prescribe and use antibiotics carefully. You can inquire about your patient's past history of C. diff infection before prescribing. Other important interventions include:

- assessing patients for CDI risk factors
- timely testing of patients with compatible signs and symptoms
- using contact isolation precautions, including wearing gloves and a gown for patients with unexplained diarrhea
- following hand hygiene practices, including before seeing a patient and after removal of gloves
- daily and terminal cleaning of patient rooms. Information on C.

### Infection control measures to limit the spread of Clostridium difficile [^1172vTra]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) presents mainly as a nosocomial infection, usually after antimicrobial therapy. Many outbreaks have been attributed to C. difficile, some due to a new hyper-virulent strain that may cause more severe disease and a worse patient outcome. As a result of CDAD, large numbers of C. difficile spores may be excreted by affected patients. Spores then survive for months in the environment; they cannot be destroyed by standard alcohol-based hand disinfection, and persist despite usual environmental cleaning agents. All these factors increase the risk of C. difficile transmission. Once CDAD is diagnosed in a patient, immediate implementation of appropriate infection control measures is mandatory in order to prevent further spread within the hospital. The quality and quantity of antibiotic prescribing should be reviewed to minimise the selective pressure for CDAD. This article provides a review of the literature that can be used for evidence-based guidelines to limit the spread of C. difficile. These include early diagnosis of CDAD, surveillance of CDAD cases, education of staff, appropriate use of isolation precautions, hand hygiene, protective clothing, environmental cleaning and cleaning of medical equipment, good antibiotic stewardship, and specific measures during outbreaks. Existing local protocols and practices for the control of C. difficile should be carefully reviewed and modified if necessary.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTION

C. difficile is the most common pathogen to cause HAIs in the United States. Unlike other HAIs, CDI actually slightly decreased during the pandemic. COVID-19 related improvements in hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) practices, and environmental cleaning may have contributed to this decrease.

Strategies to Prevent C. difficile Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update has recently been published. Unlike the other sections, there are fewer changes, and the level of evidence for most recommendations remains low; however, it is well written and contains very useful information. In the 2014 Compendium under basic practice, the authors write to encourage appropriate use of antimicrobials (MODERATE), and under special approaches, they recommended initiation of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP). Although any systemic antibiotic may increase risk of CDI, fluoroquinolones, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and clindamycin are associated with the highest risk of CDI. Studies have demonstrated implementation of an effective ASP can reduce the risk of CDI. The 2022 document combines as an essential practice to encourage appropriate use of antimicrobials through implementation of an effective ASP (MODERATE). The most significant change under essential practices is the addition to implementing a diagnostic stewardship program for ensuring appropriate use and interpretation of C. difficile testing (LOW). This includes working with the clinical microbiology laboratory to develop preagreed criteria for C. difficile testing, and interpretation of C. difficile testing results particularly if NAATs (nucleic acid amplification testing) are used either as a stand-alone test or part of a multistep testing algorithm. Reduction of unnecessary C. difficile therapy is an important ASP target, given its association with increased prevalence of resistant organisms. The new update also moved to assess adequacy of room cleaning from a special approach to essential practice (LOW). The 2022 update continues to recommend contact precautions for patients with CDI for at least 48 h after diarrhea has resolved.

### C. diff: facts for clinicians… [^115TRoAC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Background C. diff is a spore-forming, Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that produces two exotoxins: toxin A and toxin B. Risk factors
- Antibiotic exposure.
- Gastrointestinal surgery or manipulation.
- Long length of stay in healthcare settings.
- A serious underlying illness.
- Immunocompromising conditions.
- Advanced age. Diagnosis Patients with CDI exhibit clinical symptoms and test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin. Colonization vs infection Colonization with C. diff is more common than infection. Colonized patients do not have disease caused by C. diff and often exhibit NO clinical symptoms like diarrhea. Colonized patients do test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin. Treatment and recovery If a patient has had three or more stools in 24 hours:

- Isolate patients with possible C.

diffimmediately, even if you only suspect CDI.
- Order a C. difftest if other etiologies of diarrhea such as stool softener or laxative were not used.
- Wear gloves and a gown when treating patients with potential infectious diarrhea, including C. diff, even during short visits. Gloves are important because hand sanitizer doesn't kill C. diff. In addition, handwashing alone may not be sufficient to eliminate all C. diffspores.
- Reassess appropriateness of antibiotics in. C. diffpatients. If CDI is confirmed:

- Continue isolation and contact precautions.
- Use antibiotics appropriately.
- Clean room surfaces daily with an EPA-approved spore-killing disinfectant while treating a C. diff patientor upon their discharge or transfer.
- When a patient transfers, notify the new facility if the patient has or had a. C. diffinfection.

In about 20% of patients, CDI will resolve within two to three days of discontinuing the antibiotic to which the patient was previously exposed. However, CDI should usually be treated with an appropriate course of treatment, including oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. After treatment, repeat C. diff testing is not recommended if the patient's symptoms have resolved, as patients often remain colonized.

### CDC's hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile prevention framework in a regional hospital network [^115LgzYf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Despite modest reductions in the incidence of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HO-CDI), CDI remains a leading cause of health care-associated infection. As no single intervention has proven highly effective on its own, a multifaceted approach to controlling HO-CDI is needed.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategies to Prevent Clostridioides difficile Infection in Acute Care Facilities Framework (hereafter, the Framework) in reducing HO-CDI incidence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This quality improvement study was performed within the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network from July 1, 2019, through March 31, 2022. In all, 20 hospitals in the network participated in an implementation study of the Framework recommendations, and 26 hospitals did not participate and served as controls. The Framework has 39 discrete intervention categories organized into 5 focal areas for CDI prevention: (1) isolation and contact precautions, (2) CDI confirmation, (3) environmental cleaning, (4) infrastructure development, and (5) antimicrobial stewardship engagement.

Exposures

Monthly teleconferences supporting Framework implementation for the participating hospitals.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were HO-CDI incidence trends at participating hospitals compared with controls and postintervention HO-CDI incidence at intervention sites compared with rates during the 24 months before the intervention.

Results

The study sample included a total of 2184 HO-CDI cases and 7 269 429 patient-days. In the intervention cohort of 20 participating hospitals, there were 1403 HO-CDI cases and 3 513 755 patient-days, with a median (IQR) HO-CDI incidence of 2.8 (2.0–4.3) cases per 10 000 patient-days. The first analysis included an additional 3 755 674 patient-days and 781 HO-CDI cases among the 26 controls, with a median (IQR) HO-CDI incidence of 1.1 (0.7–2.7) case per 10 000 patient-days. The second analysis included an additional 2 538 874 patient-days and 1751 HO-CDI cases, with a median (IQR) HO-CDI incidence of 5.9 (2.7–8.9) cases per 10 000 patient-days, from participating hospitals 24 months before the intervention. In the first analysis, intervention sites had a steeper decline in HO-CDI incidence over time relative to controls (yearly incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.67–0.94]; P = 0.01), but the decline was not temporally associated with study participation. In the second analysis, HO-CDI incidence was declining in participating hospitals before the intervention, and the rate of decline did not change during the intervention. The degree to which hospitals implemented the Framework was associated with steeper declines in HO-CDI incidence (yearly IRR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99]; P = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this quality improvement study of a regional hospital network, implementation of the Framework was not temporally associated with declining HO-CDI incidence. Further study of the effectiveness of multimodal prevention measures for controlling HO-CDI is warranted.

ASCRS Clinical Practice Guidelines — statement of the problem for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) outlines organism features, transmission, burden, carriage, and risk factors, noting that Clostridioides difficile is "an anaerobic, gram-positive, bacillus bacterium" that "is most commonly transmitted via a fecal-oral route", and that U.S. cases appear stable with "estimated 476,400 cases in 2011 associated with 29,000 deaths and 462,100 cases in 2017 associated with an estimated 20,500 deaths". Asymptomatic carriage is frequent, with the bacterium "present in the stool of approximately 3% of healthy adults" and "up to 50% of those exposed to an inpatient facility may be asymptomatic carriers". Antibiotic exposure and comorbidity are implicated, as "Alterations in the bacterial component of the microbiota, most often due to the use of antibiotics, can lead to ecological changes" and "Higher rates of CDI have been reported in patients after exposure to a prolonged duration of antibiotics including perioperative antibiotics and in patients with underlying comorbid conditions such as IBD or immunosuppression".

### Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile infections [^116BowSi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of hospital-associated gastrointestinal illness and places a high burden on our health-care system. Patients with CDI typically have extended lengths-of-stay in hospitals, and CDI is a frequent cause of large hospital outbreaks of disease. This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI as well as for the prevention and control of outbreaks while supplementing previously published guidelines. New molecular diagnostic stool tests will likely replace current enzyme immunoassay tests. We suggest treatment of patients be stratified depending on whether they have mild-to-moderate, severe, or complicated disease. Therapy with metronidazole remains the choice for mild-to-moderate disease but may not be adequate for patients with severe or complicated disease. We propose a classification of disease severity to guide therapy that is useful for clinicians. We review current treatment options for patients with recurrent CDI and recommendations for the control and prevention of outbreaks of CDI.

Guidance cited on the page indicates that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the SHEA/IDSA Compendium recommend the discontinuation of CP 48 hours after the resolution of diarrhea among patients diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, and it states that evidence does not exist supporting repeat laboratory testing for C. difficile to guide decisions regarding discontinuation of CP for patients with CDI.

### Identifying contact time required for secondary transmission of Clostridioides difficile infections by using real-time locating system [^112rPLmA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The duration of person-to-person contact required for CDI transmission in our study was as brief as 113 minutes. Infection dose of C. difficile is known to be low in a laboratory setting, but those results have not yet been supported in vivo. This study investigated the association between contact time and secondary transmission of CDI. A low contact time required for CDI transmission might help explain the absence of differences in CDI incidence rates for genetically related and genetically distant strains, despite the use of contact precautions, as previously described. Short infection periods for multiple C. difficile spreaders have been reported, emphasizing that organism density is more crucial for transmitting the disease than longer contact time. Patients can spread spores, which can be taken up by susceptible patients within hours, depending on organism density. Therefore, once a patient starts showing symptoms, intervention would be considered delayed. Furthermore, multiple CDI cases identified in this study were categorized as asymptomatic transmission, which is a subject of concern. Because of adherence to augmented standard precautions in our hospital throughout the study period and considering the role of indirect contact through environmental CDI transmission, it might be more pragmatic to adopt exhaustive standard preventive measures rather than opting for contact isolation of symptomatic patients with CDI. A comprehensive strategy should encompass additional preventive measures, such as careful excrement management and environmental decontamination.

The overall incidence of CDI in the study institution was ≈19.6 cases/10,000 patient-days in 2021, signifying a notable increase compared with 5.9 cases/10,000 patient-days reported in tertiary hospitals within South Korea during 2020–2021. This study was conducted in an environment marked by substantial transitions from long-term care facilities, resulting in a high incidence of imported cases, which contributed to the elevated overall incidence rate. Despite the high CDI incidence in this study compared with previous research, the effect of secondary transmission via direct or indirect contact on CDI incidence was found to be low. Consequently, factors contributing to disease occurrence that are distinct from CDI patient contact warrant investigation. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of prudent antimicrobial use to diminish spontaneous sporulation of toxigenic C. difficile. Therefore, this precautionary measure should be prioritized, particularly in a setting where a high percentage of patients might experience dysbiosis because of immobility.

### SHEA neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) white paper series: practical approaches to Clostridioides difficile prevention [^112c62jd]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Medium credibility.

SHEA NICU isolation for positive C. difficile tests — diarrhea-directed contact precautions: Infants with diarrhea and a positive C. difficile test should be placed on contact precautions, whereas infants without diarrhea who have tested positive for C. difficile do not require contact precautions. Contact precautions can be discontinued 48 hours after diarrhea has resolved, and at that time consideration can be given to moving the patient to a new incubator and/or a new room. Environmental contamination is higher in rooms of patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea than in rooms of patients who do not have diarrhea, and patients with asymptomatic C. difficile colonization shed spores but generally shed fewer spores and cause less contamination than symptomatic patients. Thus, contact precautions are important to preventing transmission from patients with CDI and should be used until 48 hours after resolution of diarrhea. Extending this practice to NICU patients is not recommended for the following reasons: Determining true CDI rates in the NICU is difficult because testing is not recommended and positive results most likely reflect colonization.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — concurrent or recent non-CDI antibiotics and extended CDI therapy: Some patients need other antibiotics during or shortly after the end of CDI therapy and are at a higher risk of a recurrence and its attendant complications; many clinicians prolong CDI treatment in such cases and lower doses may be sufficient to prevent recurrence (eg, vancomycin 125 mg once daily), but whether this reduces CDI recurrence is unknown and one retrospective study suggested no benefit for extension beyond 10–14 days.

### Impact of isolating Clostridium difficile carriers on the burden of isolation precautions: a time series analysis [^114pHk9w]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The isolation of asymptomatic Clostridium difficile (CD) carriers may decrease the incidence of hospital-associated C. difficile infections (CDI), but its impact on isolation precaution needs is unknown.

Methods

A time series analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of isolating CD carriers on the burden of isolation precautions from 2008 to 2016 in a Canadian hospital. To account for the changes in C. difficile infection control policies, the series was divided into 3 intervention periods: period 1 (2008–2011), isolation of patients with CDI until symptom resolution; period 2 (2011–2013), isolation of patients with CDI until discharge; and period 3 (2013–2016), isolation of patients with CDI and CD carriers until discharge. We compared the prevalence of isolation-days for C. difficile (ie, for either CDI or carriage) per 1000 patient-days between study periods. Changes in trend were analyzed by segmented regression analysis.

Results

A total of 806357 patient-days and 20455 isolation-days were included. Isolation-day prevalence during periods 1, 2, and 3 were 12.9, 26.2, and 37.8 isolation-days per 1000 patient-days, respectively (P < .001 between periods). Isolating CD carriers was associated with an increase in isolation-days' prevalence compared with period 2 (rate ratio [RR], 1.66; P < .001) followed by a significant decrease in trend (RR per 4-week period, 0.97; P < .001). The downward trend was mainly due to decreasing isolation needs for patients with CDI (RR per 4-week period, 0.94; P < .001) rather than for carriage (RR per 4-week period, 0.996; P = 0.21).

Conclusions

Isolating CD carriers led to an initial increase in isolation needs that was partially compensated by a decrease in isolation needs for CDI.
