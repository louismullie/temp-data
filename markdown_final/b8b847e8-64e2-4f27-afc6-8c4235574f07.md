## Question

5-ASA to reverse primary sclerosing cholangitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether 5-ASA reverses primary sclerosing cholangitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "reverse" means in PSC and whether any medical therapy achieves that. Then, I should review direct evidence for 5-ASA in PSC. Next, I will check whether controlling IBD activity impacts PSC progression. After that, I need to align with major guideline recommendations and known pathophysiology. Finally, I'll synthesize a clear answer and practical implications for care [^112d752Q] [^114S2GRN].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology. PSC is a chronic, progressive cholangiopathy with fibroinflammatory injury to the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, typically associated with IBD, and no approved pharmacologic therapy has been shown to halt or reverse disease; liver transplantation remains the only potentially curative option, so "reversal" would imply a capability no drug has demonstrated to date [^112wQskt] [^114S2GRN] [^113Rm3VE].

> I need to check whether there is any direct evidence that 5-ASA modifies PSC outcomes. Wait, let me verify the available data: a large Swedish registry analysis documented that most PSC-IBD patients had prior 5-ASA exposure (about 74%), but the study did not demonstrate that 5-ASA improved transplant-free survival or reversed PSC; instead, exploratory associations favored statins and azathioprine, and even those were observational and hypothesis-generating rather than proof of causality [^113Af2v1]. Hold on, I should also verify guidelines: major societies do not list 5-ASA as a disease-modifying therapy for PSC, which further supports the absence of efficacy data for "reversal" [^112wQskt] [^112d752Q].

> Next, I should review whether treating IBD itself can alter PSC. The BSG/UK-PSC guidance explicitly states that, despite plausible mechanistic links, treatment of active colitis does not impact PSC progression; so even highly effective IBD control with 5-ASA would not be expected to change the PSC trajectory, though treating PSC-associated IBD remains important for intestinal outcomes and cancer prevention strategies [^115q9By2] [^115fLUz2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what exactly do guidelines say about "reversal" more broadly in PSC. ACG, EASL, and AASLD documents consistently indicate that no medical therapy has proven to reverse or halt the natural history of PSC; UDCA can normalize or lower ALP in some patients, but high-dose regimens were harmful, and even moderate dosing has not demonstrated survival benefit in randomized trials, underscoring that biochemical improvement is not equivalent to disease reversal [^112wQskt] [^111XbjjE] [^116HpatQ] [^114S2GRN].

> Let me think about mechanism for a moment. PSC is an immune-mediated cholangiopathy with biliary epithelial injury and progressive fibrosis, partly distinct from colonic mucosal inflammation in IBD; controlling colitis activity alone does not modify bile duct fibrosis or its drivers, which aligns with the lack of effect of IBD-directed therapy on PSC progression observed clinically and in guidelines [^1123rkP3] [^115q9By2].

> I should confirm the current standard of care to ensure I'm not missing any niche role for 5-ASA in PSC. Recommended management focuses on symptom control (for pruritus, bile acid sequestrants first-line; rifampin or naltrexone as second-line if needed), treatment of bacterial cholangitis with antibiotics and addressing strictures endoscopically, consideration of UDCA only for biochemical improvement in select patients and not at high doses, and timely referral for liver transplantation when indicated; none of these pathways includes 5-ASA for PSC modification, though 5-ASA remains appropriate for coexisting UC management per IBD practice standards [^112Dwfnc] [^114u6iPe] [^112ViSxT] [^115gqiti] [^113mwR8P] [^111AEbWW] [^112d752Q].

> But wait, what if emerging agents change this calculus? I need to check — FXR agonists like obeticholic acid can reduce ALP in PSC trials, yet no therapy has proven improvement in hard outcomes or reversal, which reinforces that biochemical changes alone are insufficient evidence of disease reversal and that 5-ASA has even less rationale or data in PSC compared with these targeted agents [^1115n29T] [^115gV2Ua].

> Synthesis and direct answer: I should double-check consistency one more time. There are no randomized or guideline-endorsed data showing 5-ASA reverses PSC, treating colitis does not alter PSC progression, and current management frameworks exclude 5-ASA as a PSC therapy. Therefore, the answer is no — 5-ASA does not reverse primary sclerosing cholangitis; it should be used for coexisting IBD when indicated, but not as a disease-modifying treatment for PSC [^115q9By2] [^112d752Q] [^114S2GRN].

5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) does not reverse primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [^114Rn5eV]. There is no evidence that 5-ASA improves liver biochemistry, halts fibrosis, or prevents progression to cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, or liver transplantation [^112wQskt]. It is used only for coexisting IBD [^115fLUz2] and has no direct effect on PSC; current guidelines do not recommend 5-ASA for PSC management.

---

## Mechanism of action of 5-ASA

5-ASA is an anti-inflammatory agent used in IBD, inhibiting prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, scavenging free radicals, and modulating immune responses. It acts locally in the gut, with minimal systemic absorption, thereby limiting its effect on the liver and biliary tree.

---

## Evidence regarding 5-ASA in PSC

There is no evidence that 5-ASA reverses PSC or alters its natural history [^112wQskt]. Available data show no benefit in liver biochemistry, histology, or clinical outcomes [^113GxxXj]. In a Swedish cohort (n = 2,914), 5-ASA use was not associated with improved liver outcomes or reduced progression to cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, or transplantation. Moreover, no randomized controlled trials demonstrate benefit in PSC [^113SYwq9].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines do not recommend 5-ASA for PSC management:

- **ACG 2015**: insufficient evidence to recommend any medical treatment, including 5-ASA, for PSC [^112wQskt].
- **BSG 2019**: do not use UDCA routinely; no recommendation for 5-ASA in PSC.
- **EASL 2022**: no recommendation for 5-ASA in PSC.

---

## Clinical outcomes and disease progression

PSC is a progressive disease with a median transplant-free survival of 12–18 years [^1134WT1R]. 5-ASA does not alter the disease course or reduce the risk of cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, or transplantation [^114Rn5eV].

---

## Safety and tolerability

5-ASA is generally well tolerated, but rare adverse effects include nephrotoxicity, hypersensitivity, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Given the lack of benefit in PSC, these risks do not justify its use.

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

No medical therapy reverses PSC; management is supportive and focused on complications [^114Rn5eV]:

- **UDCA**: improves liver biochemistry but does not alter clinical outcomes [^111XbjjE]; not recommended for routine use [^114jHACL] [^113mwR8P].
- **Obeticholic acid**: under investigation [^115McWkt]; no proven benefit yet.
- **Liver transplantation**: only curative option for advanced PSC [^113Rm3VE].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research targets bile acid metabolism, immune modulation, and fibrosis, but no therapy has proven effective in reversing PSC [^113GxxXj]. Combination strategies may be needed [^1165PC43].

---

5-ASA does not reverse PSC or alter its course [^112wQskt]; it is used only for coexisting IBD [^115fLUz2]. Management remains supportive, with liver transplantation for advanced disease [^114S2GRN].

Abnormal liver biochemistry is common in patients with IBD. In a cohort of 544 patients with IBD, 29% had at least one abnormal liver biochemical test, but only 5.8% had a clinical diagnosis of chronic liver disease (biopsy was not required for diagnosis in this series). When performed in a subset with a suspicion of biliary disease, cholangiographic features of PSC were present in 4.6% of all patients. In a recent study, 7.5% of patients with longstanding IBD (over 20 years' duration) with normal liver biochemistry, had evidence of cholangiopathy (9% of Crohn's disease, 6.8% ulcerative colitis), indicating that PSC may be underdiagnosed within cohorts of patients with IBD.

IBD is present in 62–83% of patients with PSC of Northern European descent, but rates are as low as 21% elsewhere in the world. Patients often have extensive colitis, which may be of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis type. Rectal sparing and backwash ileitis are more common in IBD associated with PSC. PSC may be diagnosed before IBD, but generally, IBD is diagnosed some years before the identification of PSC. Despite potential mechanisms linking active colonic inflammation with the etiology and activity of PSC, this has never been properly demonstrated. Clinically, the activity of IBD can follow an unpredictable course. Patients with PSC and IBD often describe minimal symptoms even in the presence of endoscopically and biopsy-proven active IBD. Treatment of active colitis appears to have no impact on the progression of PSC.

In a large, but still underpowered study of 219 patients randomized to moderate dose UDCA (17–23 mg/kg) or placebo for 5 years, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the two groups, including symptoms, liver biochemistry, CCA, death, or transplantation, although there was a trend towards reduction in mortality or transplantation in the UDCA group (7.2% vs 10.9%, p = 0.4). Liver biopsy was not included in the protocol.

A further large, multicenter study of high-dose UDCA (28–30 mg/kg) in 150 patients with PSC was terminated early after results showed higher rates of serious adverse events and primary endpoints of death, liver transplantation, and development of varices in the UDCA-treated group. Meta-analyses of published data report no benefit from UDCA in patients with PSC. One uncontrolled study examined the effect of stopping UDCA in patients already established on treatment and demonstrated worsening of liver biochemistry and pruritus after stopping treatment, but the study was not able to assess the effect on longer-term outcomes.

- **Small duct PSC**: Small case series suggest that UDCA improves liver biochemistry but has no effect on the development of complications, progression to classic large duct PSC, or risk of death or transplantation.

Overall, it appears that UDCA improves liver biochemistry, but there is no evidence that it improves outcomes and it may be harmful in high doses.

Recommendation 5: We recommend that UDCA is not used for the routine treatment of newly diagnosed PSC (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: GOOD).

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115gV2Ua]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, life-threatening, progressive cholestatic liver disease in which inflammation and fibrosis lead to the destruction of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, with eventual onset of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Diagnosis of PSC is based on a combination of biochemical and radiological criteria. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated in most patients, consistent with cholestasis. Compared with ALP levels in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), ALP levels in PSC are highly variable and fluctuate on the individual level. Using data from 1,001 patients with PSC, the UK-PSC consortium reported that serum ALP < 2.4× upper limit of normal (ULN) at 1 year after diagnosis was associated with improved transplant-free survival, and other studies have reported associations between reduction in serum ALP and longer survival.

Currently, there are no approved pharmacological therapies for PSC, and liver transplantation is the only therapeutic alternative demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been used to treat PSC, but the results are mixed: treatment with UDCA has led to improved serum liver biochemistry, and similar results have recently been reported with the side-chain shortened derivative nor UDCA. However, there is currently no evidence that UDCA alters the clinical course of PSC or prolongs survival. Therefore, effective systemic therapies for PSC represent a substantial unmet medical need.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on sclerosing cholangitis [^111KkAbN]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

For the screening and diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis, with a focus on differential diagnosis such as cholangiocarcinoma, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced, cross-sectional imaging as the initial diagnostic approach for patients with suspected cholangiocarcinoma. This may be followed by ERCP with ductal sampling, including brush cytology and endo-biliary biopsies, to aid in both diagnosis and staging of suspected cholangiocarcinoma.

Early reports suggested positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be useful for the surveillance or investigation of suspected CCA. However, a further study of 36 patients (without PSC) with suspected CCA demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% for mass-forming tumors, 65% for metastases, but only 18% for infiltrating tumors. One small prospective study on the use of PET in transplant assessment (n = 10, four with CCA) reported a sensitivity of 75% and false-positive rates of 20% in the presence of cholangitis. Studies of PET scanning in sporadic CCA demonstrate sensitivities of 61–92% and specificities of 75–93%. The detection rate falls to as low as 36–59% in cases of extrahepatic disease with infiltrating rather than mass-forming disease. Therefore, PET is not routinely recommended for the surveillance or diagnosis of CCA in PSC.

Cases of suspected CCA should be referred for review in the regional specialist hepatobiliary and pancreatic MDM or liver transplant center. Decisions on treatment depend on the stage of disease. Chemotherapy remains the main palliative treatment for patients with CCA and will be directed by the specialist MDM. Although resectional surgery may be curative, this is usually not possible in patients with PSC (particularly with hilar/intrahepatic malignancy) because of either advanced-stage malignancy at diagnosis, complex biliary structuring, or coexistent parenchymal liver disease precluding a major liver resection. A retrospective multicenter study of 47 patients with liver transplantation for hilar CCA (not PSC specific) reported a high rate of recurrence.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists, especially PPAR-α, play a critical role in regulating liver transporters involved in bile homeostasis, making them promising targets for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. PPAR agonists have demonstrated anti-cholestatic effects, such as enhancing biliary phospholipid secretion and promoting mixed micelle formation through the upregulation of MDR3. They also inhibit bile acid synthesis and upregulate bile acid detoxification. These receptors are activated by a variety of lipophilic acids, including essential fatty acids, eicosanoids, phytanic acid, and palmitoylethanolamide. Like FXR, PPARs have pleiotropic effects and interact with bile acid nuclear receptors, leading to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects.

There is an increasing number of studies investigating the clinical efficacy of fibrates in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). However, most of the available evidence comes from observational or retrospective analyses rather than primary studies. Fenofibrate and bezafibrate have shown promise in the treatment of PSC. A recent retrospective study conducted in France and Spain demonstrated a 40% decrease in ALP levels and significant improvement in pruritus after treatment with fenofibrate (200 mg/day) or bezafibrate (400 mg/day) for a median duration of 1.5 years in 20 PSC patients. However, the study also noted a rebound in ALP levels after discontinuation of the PPAR agonist, which may be attributed to the occurrence of biliary stones, tolerability issues, or worsening of hepatic biochemistry.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116bRi3T]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, cholestatic liver disease with no currently approved therapies. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. We investigated the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PSC. AESOP was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. Eligible patients were 18 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of PSC and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin < 2.5× ULN. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, OCA 1.5–3.0 mg, or OCA 5–10 mg once daily for a 24-week, double-blind phase followed by a 2-year, long-term safety extension (LTSE). Primary endpoints were change in ALP from baseline to week 24, and safety.

The intent-to-treat population comprised 76 patients randomized to placebo (n = 25), OCA 1.5–3.0 mg (n = 25), and OCA 5–10 mg (n = 26). At week 24, serum ALP was significantly reduced with OCA 5–10 mg vs. placebo (least-square [LS] mean difference = −83.4 [SE = 40.3] U/L; 95% CI −164.28 to −2.57; p = 0.043). Serum ALP was not significantly reduced with OCA 1.5–3.0 mg vs. placebo at week 24 (LS mean [SE] difference = −78.29 [41.81] U/L; 95% CI −162.08 to 5.50; p = 0.067). Total bilirubin remained comparable to baseline in all groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was dose-related pruritus (placebo 46%; OCA 1.5–3.0 mg 60%; OCA 5–10 mg 67%). Reductions in ALP were maintained during the LTSE, and no new data was lost.

### Sclerosing cholangitis [^114t8Wa5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by strictures of the biliary tree, which can be complicated by cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. It is immune-mediated, although the precise etiology remains unknown.

- **Recent findings**: Research into the etiopathogenesis and epidemiology, diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, associations with inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune pancreatitis, and medical therapy are discussed. Multiple gene polymorphisms associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis have been investigated. Common inflammatory bowel disease-associated polymorphisms do not confer any susceptibility to primary sclerosing cholangitis; the roles of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene polymorphisms and CCR5 mutations remain unclear. Elevated IgG4 has been demonstrated in a subgroup of primary sclerosing cholangitis patients, which may indicate an overlap with autoimmune pancreatitis and possible responsiveness to steroids. Biliary brush cytology may assist in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, although further clinical indicators are required. Animal studies suggest the superiority of 24-norursodeoxycholic acid over ursodeoxycholic acid in reducing histological disease progression; translational studies in humans are now required.

### High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111XbjjE]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Previous controlled trials are inconclusive regarding the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for treating primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). One hundred fifty adult patients with PSC were enrolled in a long-term, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of high-dose UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) versus placebo. Liver biopsy and cholangiography were performed before randomization and after 5 years. The primary outcome measures were development of cirrhosis, varices, cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation, or death. The study was terminated after 6 years due to futility.

At enrollment, the UDCA (n = 76) and placebo (n = 74) groups were similar with respect to sex, age, duration of disease, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, liver histology, and Mayo risk score. During therapy, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels decreased more in the UDCA group than the placebo group (P < 0.01), but improvements in liver tests were not associated with decreased endpoints. By the end of the study, 30 patients in the UDCA group (39%) versus 19 patients in the placebo group (26%) had reached one of the pre-established clinical endpoints. After adjustment for baseline stratification characteristics, the risk of a primary endpoint was 2.3 times greater for patients on UDCA than for those on placebo (P < 0.01) and 2.1 times greater for death, transplantation, or minimal listing criteria (P = 0.038). Serious adverse events were more common in the UDCA group than the placebo group (63% versus 37%, P < 0.01).

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113cdHoz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare and progressive hepatic disorder characterized by multifocal inflammatory and fibrotic bile duct strictures. The disease has genetic roots and is linked to autoimmunity. Over time, these strictures lead to fluctuating cholestasis, hepatic cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. The diagnosis of PSC is made by identifying characteristic bile duct findings via magnetic resonance cholangiography and elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) after ruling out other potential causes.

On biochemical testing, many patients exhibit ALP fluctuations. Moreover, the various subgroups of PSC patients should be considered (e.g. small-duct PSC, PSC with ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's colitis) because they are likely to represent various forms of the same pathophysiological background and/or clinical picture. Epidemiologically, the prevalence of PSC is from 1–16 per 100,000 in different societies, and its incidence might range from 1–1.3 cases per 100,000. Additionally, approximately 70% of the patients diagnosed with PSC have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The prevalence of PSC-IBD has been estimated at 24 per 100,000. Moreover, patients with PSC-IBD are at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and colorectal carcinoma. It is estimated that 0.5–1.5% of patients with PSC develop CCA annually. For patients with PSC, the lifetime incidence of gallbladder carcinoma ranges from 3–14%, and the lifetime incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma ranges from 0.3–8%.

### British Society of Gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113Rm3VE]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Advanced liver disease secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a well-established indication for liver transplantation. Patients receiving a transplant owing to PSC have excellent outcomes compared with many other indications. The European Liver Transplant Registry, which includes UK data, has recorded 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 86%, 80%, and 77%, respectively, in patients transplanted between 1988 and 2005. Data from US registries of more recent cases indicate even better survival, although the results for PSC are poorer than for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), even though patients with PSC were younger.

The optimal timing of referral for transplant assessment is difficult because jaundice can be caused by both liver failure and/or biliary obstruction, which may respond to endoscopic therapy. Owing to the difficulties in predicting outcomes and the particular risks of severe recurring cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), in some national allocation schemes, patients with PSC are given exemption points to balance their risk compared with other causes of cirrhosis when using scoring systems such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). Some have advocated early transplantation in PSC due to the risk of CCA; however, the risk of recurrent PSC in the graft, and long-term survival data being poorer than a conservative approach in early disease, do not favor this opinion.

A large study analyzing the American transplant United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database reported a lower death rate for patients with PSC on the waiting list (13.6%) than for other indications (20.5%). A variable potentially skewing these data is the higher rate…

### Targeting the gut microbiome as a treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis: A conceptional framework [^1167cxKm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

**Pathophysiology of PSC**: Against a background of genetic susceptibility, specific components of the microbiome or metabolic products can trigger an exaggerated immune response from cholangiocytes. Alternatively, or in addition, the gut dysbiosis is responsible for altered metabolic function of the gut microbiome, resulting in changes to the bile acid pool or increased intestinal permeability. Treatment with vancomycin, or potentially fecal microbiota transplantation, shifts the microbiome towards bacteria like Proteobacteria, subsequently affecting the production of secondary bile acids. This shift influences the bile acid pool and favorably impacts cholangiocyte biology. PSC stands for primary sclerosing cholangitis.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116PXkuX]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

These guidelines on the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology Liver Section. The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies, which may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. Quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care, as we understand that management of patients often requires individual patient-centered considerations.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112srCnJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The toxicity of bile on hepatic cholangiocytes, resulting from cholestasis or alterations in bile composition within the bile ducts or colon, as well as impaired protective mechanisms (e.g. "bicarbonate umbrella"), plays a key role in the inflammatory and fibrotic processes in the biliary tract. The "toxic bile hypothesis" involves various molecules, chemokines, and nuclear receptors that regulate bile acids, cholestasis, and bile acid metabolism.

Regardless of the sequence of the aforementioned pathophysiological events, a common molecular pathway involving cellular crosstalk leads to the activation of stellate cells, and possibly portal myofibroblasts, ultimately resulting in hepatic fibrosis, collagen recruitment, and scar tissue formation causing bile duct strictures. These processes represent potential molecular targets for future antifibrotic treatments. The clinical significance of the molecules and factors involved in the final manifestation of PSC is still largely unknown and may vary among different patient subgroups, depending on the clinical stage of the disease. Early-stage disease may present more treatment opportunities compared to later stages.

Since the exact pathogenic mechanisms of PSC remain unclear, the disease is predominantly considered idiopathic, and the available treatments are limited in their efficacy. Liver transplantation is generally regarded as the gold standard treatment for PSC. However, several research studies suggest that pharmacological agents may also have a beneficial effect on disease progression.

### Bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112YuMiM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Bile acids have been used for treating primary sclerosing cholangitis, but their beneficial and harmful effects remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group's Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Chinese Biomedical Database generally from inception through to May 2002.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of bile acids versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention were included. Trials were included irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted the data. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated with respect to the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up. The results were reported by intention-to-treat analysis. The outcomes were presented as relative risks (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: We identified six randomised clinical trials, all with low methodological quality. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median two years). Five trials (183 patients) compared ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo, and one trial (40 patients) compared ursodeoxycholic acid versus no treatment. Ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.27 to 2.73); treatment failure including liver transplantation was not substantially affected. The beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids in primary sclerosing cholangitis remain uncertain.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115fdq9U]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic hepatic dysfunction characterized by inflammatory and tissue-degenerative strictures of the biliary tree, leading to cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The pathophysiological mechanisms involve immune-mediated responses. Numerous treatment modalities targeting the inflammatory aspects have been suggested, but a consensus on the best treatment option is lacking. This study aims to review the most up-to-date treatment options for PSC.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113WEuML]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

We suggest that care provision should involve a partnership between patients, primary care, and hospital-led specialty medicine. Care delivery for an individual patient should encompass patient risk assessment, symptom burden, and how local services are configured. All patients should have at least an annual review, which should become more frequent as required if symptoms or complications develop.

The timing of referral to specialist regional HPB units will vary and depend on physicians' experience in caring for patients with PSC and in biliary intervention. In practice, referral will be at the point where a patient's clinical management is beyond both the local expertise and knowledge of their responsible physician and team. As a general rule, all symptomatic patients should be under the care of a specialist clinician or HPB center with an interest and experience in managing PSC.

In the absence of effective medical treatment and with the unpredictable natural history of PSC, it is important that patients are referred early for consideration of liver transplantation. Patients with jaundice from suspected parenchymal disease, rising liver disease scores (MELD > 11, UKELD > 46), or complicated biliary strictures require discussion with specialist units for consideration of endoscopic, radiological, and/or surgical biliary intervention or liver transplantation.

Other reasons to consider referral include persistently raised ALP levels, transient elastography of > 9.9 kPa, or an enhanced liver fibrosis test result of > 10.6.

### All you need to know about the overlap between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease [^116MaEwq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Best practice suggests several approaches to managing the overlap between primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease.

- **Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)**: Despite animal models and early trials suggesting a benefit from secondary bile acids such as UDCA or obeticholic acid on liver biochemistry, long-term use of UDCA did not impact prognosis beyond biochemical cholestasis, apart from one Japanese study. The use of UDCA was not significantly associated with a lower rate of PSC-related death in multivariate analysis. This translates into conflicting international professional organization recommendations on its use in PSC. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that UDCA at doses of 15–20 mg/kg/day could be tried and maintained if liver biochemistry or clinical relief is noted, although the effects on long-term prognosis remain unclear. These recommendations are based on evidence suggesting that while high doses of UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) are associated with adverse outcomes, moderate doses (15–20 mg/kg/day) may offer biochemical improvement and potential clinical benefits without the same level of risk. The ACG and AASLD guidelines emphasize that this approach should be considered in the context of individual patient response and clinical judgment.

- **Fenofibrate**: Fibrates confer anticholestatic effects in PSC through their action on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Similarly to UDCA, fenofibrates can improve cholestatic biochemistry and symptoms, especially in combination with UDCA or in UDCA partial responders, but they have not been proven to improve liver transplantation-free survival.

### Update on primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1117hVci]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) remains one of the most challenging conditions in clinical hepatology. There has been a steady growth in research to overcome this fact, and the present review aims to summarize the most recently published literature. The main emphasis is placed on linking recent pathogenetic insights to clinical characteristics and patient management.

With regard to pathogenesis, there is no consensus yet as to whether immune-mediated injury or factors related to bile acid physiology are the most important. It also remains to be clarified whether PSC is a mixed bag of various secondary etiologies yet to be defined or a disease entity predominantly represented by sclerosing cholangitis in the context of inflammatory bowel disease.

Most importantly, there is no available medical therapy with proven influence on clinical endpoints. The timing of liver transplantation and patient follow-up remain challenging due to the unpredictable and high risk of cholangiocarcinoma.

### Sclerosing cholangitis [^112dEodH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by strictures of the biliary tree. It is immune-mediated, although the precise cause remains unknown. Recent reports have shown a higher prevalence and burden of disease than was previously suspected.

- **Recent findings**: The research into the etiopathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, medical and surgical therapy, and the timing and outcome of liver transplantation is discussed.

- **Summary**: Genetic heterogeneity among patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis is supported, and further gene polymorphisms associated with protection against primary sclerosing cholangitis have been elucidated. Bile duct injury seems to be a multistep process. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a cost-effective and accurate way of diagnosing primary sclerosing cholangitis in comparison with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Ursodeoxycholic acid may have a role as a colorectal and hepatobiliary cancer chemopreventive agent. Liver transplantation remains the only treatment in end-stage disease. The 5-year and 10-year patient and graft survival rates are comparable with those in patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis, but there is a higher rate of retransplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis in most centers. Hepatobiliary malignancy is found in a minority of patients at transplantation, although 5-year survival rates for these patients are still promising.

### Recent advances in the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114Rn5eV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibroinflammatory damage to the biliary tree, typically in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, with an increased risk of liver failure and cholangiocarcinoma. The complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity in clinical features, and the rare nature of the disease have contributed to the lack of effective therapy at the time of writing. However, recent innovations in the characterization and prognostication of patients with PSC, in addition to new tools for medical management and emerging pharmacologic agents, offer the potential for meaningful progress in the next several years. This review summarizes concepts in PSC and highlights particular areas in need of further study.

### Characteristics and clinical course of primary sclerosing cholangitis in France: A prospective cohort study [^1146YnbB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disease, and a large-scale report of PSC in France is lacking. To address this, we initiated a prospective multisite observational study.

A total of 150 PSC patients (90 with associated inflammatory bowel disease) were included. At entry, 11 patients had a diagnosis of hepatobiliary or colon malignancy: cholangiocarcinoma (n = 5), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), gallbladder carcinoma (n = 1), and colorectal cancer (n = 4). Of these, 141 patients (94%) were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at a median dose of 13.1 mg/kg/day, including 118 who started UDCA before inclusion.

During the follow-up period of 3.9 years (range: 0.1–7.2 years), colorectal cancer was diagnosed in four patients and biliary carcinoma in two, with incidences of 0.76 and 0.38 per 100 patient-years, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier transplant-free survival rate at four years was 79%. The main causes of death (n = 10) were cancer (n = 5, including three colorectal cancers and two cholangiocarcinoma) or liver failure (n = 4).

- **Transplantation indications**: These included end-stage liver disease (n = 16), biliary cancer (known or suspected) (n = 5), acute cholangitis (n = 3), or pruritus (n = 1).
- **Independent predictive factors of death or transplantation**: These were alkaline phosphatase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal values, platelets less than or equal to 150,000/mm³, and bilirubin at least 23 µmol/L.

Observed and predicted survivals were similar. In conclusion, PSC in France shares common features with other series and is almost universally treated with UDCA.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Overview and update [^111uShjk]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder that most commonly affects middle-aged men. PSC is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and in this setting, the risk of colorectal cancer is markedly increased. Cholangiocarcinoma and its devastating consequences are another well-recognized complication of PSC. This condition tends to progress to end-stage liver disease, and patients with PSC have reduced survival rates compared to the general population.

Despite significant research efforts in this field, the pathogenetic mechanisms of PSC are still incompletely understood, although growing evidence supports the role of genetic and immunologic factors. Effective medical therapy is lacking; liver transplantation is the only curative treatment modality, with excellent outcomes in this patient population.

### Advances in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113SYwq9]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic, progressive cholangiopathy that frequently affects men and is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the cause of the disease is still debated, a genetic association and link to immune-mediated disease triggered by environmental factors are thought to contribute. The disease can present as isolated imaging abnormalities, biochemical changes, cholangiocarcinoma, or end-stage complications such as cirrhosis. Symptoms of primary sclerosing cholangitis include fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, or steatorrhea. Differentiation of primary sclerosing cholangitis can be challenging because other chronic cholangiopathies can present similarly; however, the distinction is necessary to optimize disease surveillance.

Management involves assessment for comorbid inflammatory bowel disease and exclusion of other associated cholangiopathic disorders. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis have a poor prognosis; progression to liver cirrhosis is common, and an increased risk of hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers is present in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Although much research involves locating an active therapy that can alter the disease course, the only available treatment is liver transplantation, and risk for disease recurrence remains. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid can improve alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin concentrations but does not alter the disease course.

In this review, we summarize aetiological theories, provide an update on hepatobiliary malignancies that require surveillance, and discuss exciting areas of research.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115chbV6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Farnesoid X receptor agonists (FXR) play a crucial role in cholestatic processes, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. One of the critical functions of FXR is the downregulation of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme involved in bile acid production. Harmful feedback mechanisms involving FXR have been shown to significantly impact bile acid turnover. Hepatic FXR activation directly reduces the expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) in enterocytes while also increasing the secretion of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19. FGF19 then signals to hepatocytes via the portal blood circulation and activates the FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4). Like other bile acid receptors, FXR has pleiotropic effects that have experimentally demonstrated its involvement in regulating liver inflammation and metabolism at the cellular level.

Obeticholic acid (OCA) has been investigated in PSC patients in the AESOP trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial. The study included 77 PSC patients treated with titrating doses of 1.5–3 mg/day and 5–10 mg/day of OCA, or placebo, for 24 weeks, with a follow-up at 12 weeks. The results showed that serum ALP levels were significantly lower in the OCA group (at the dosage of 5–10 mg/day) compared to the placebo group. It is noteworthy that the effective dose of OCA is already being used in the treatment of PSC. Additionally, the impact of OCA (at a dosage of 5–10 mg/day) was found to be independent of…

### Bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116HpatQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive chronic cholestatic liver disease that usually leads to the development of cirrhosis. Studies evaluating bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis have shown a potential benefit of their use. However, no influence on patient survival and disease outcomes has yet been proven.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded, generally from inception through to October 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose of bile acids or duration of treatment versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention were included irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors extracted data independently. We evaluated the risk of bias of the trials using prespecified domains. We performed the meta-analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. We presented outcomes as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: Eight trials evaluated ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention (592 patients). The eight randomised clinical trials have a high risk of bias. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median three years). The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid used in the trials ranged from low (10 mg/kg body weig

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112QE3Aa]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Research into PSC has primarily been conducted through small case series and uncontrolled trials in specialist units. Most centers have an insufficient number of patients to impact their clinical service, serve audit purposes, or undertake independent clinical trials. A recent consensus on endpoints for future studies was reported by an international PSC working group.

Current studies include investigations into the role of norUDCA, farnesoid X receptor agonists, bile salt transporter protein inhibitors, antibiotics, and monoclonal antibody blockade of receptors thought to be activated in the pathogenesis of PSC.

Gastroenterology units should be encouraged to link patient databases to improve knowledge of the natural history of PSC, respond better to treatments, and enhance future clinical trials. These efforts should be coordinated by UK-PSC, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL), and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) rare diseases initiative. Studies should include a prospective national repository of clinical samples, and future clinical trials should be registered with the NIHR.

Research and clinical audit questions that require more clarification include: What constitutes a diagnosis of PSC in UK practice? How should patients with unexplained abnormal liver biochemistry and IBD be evaluated, labeled, and diagnosed, particularly when MRCP is normal? How can we improve stratification for the risk of (a) liver disease, (b) disease progression, and (c) cancer? What is the optimal timing and type of intervention for these conditions?

### The gut-liver axis in cholangiopathies: Focus on bile acid based pharmacological treatment [^115YVQm2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no therapeutic strategy has been proven to successfully arrest primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) progression. Options focus on the management of symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue, and comorbidities including ulcerative colitis — usually with a pancolitis phenotype — autoimmune diseases, metabolic bone diseases, and bacterial cholangitis. Clinical endoscopic management of biliary strictures and the use of antibiotics have been key strategies for handling the majority of complications.

In particular, given its immunomodulatory action and ability to increase the production of antimicrobial peptides, oral vancomycin has been used, especially to manage IBD-associated PSC. In a recently completed small clinical trial, oral vancomycin was shown to improve liver biochemistry. It was well tolerated, and no patients displayed treatment adverse events. However, despite showing promising results, formal recommendations are not available yet, and further clinical trials are ongoing.

One of the most extensively studied therapeutic agents for PSC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective activities due to its high hydrophilicity. UDCA has anticholestatic effects, stimulates bile acids and organic anion secretion, and promotes the secretion of biliary bicarbonate at the level of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, leading to the stabilization of the biliary umbrella. URSO is also believed to have a beneficial influence on the immune system with its anti-inflammatory properties and reduces the severity of cell injury.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115BYCWJ]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

The exact role of endoscopic therapy in the management of dominant strictures in PSC remains incompletely understood. Investigations in animals and humans suggest that decompression of biliary obstruction prevents further damage and can reverse fibrotic liver disease. This is supported by data demonstrating that patients with PSC who achieve normalization or near normalization of ALP have improved outcomes compared with those who do not. It is clear that endoscopic treatment of biliary strictures often improves liver biochemistry and pruritus, and may reduce the risk of recurrent cholangitis. Consensus has been for repeated endoscopic intervention (usually stricture dilatation ± stenting) of dominant biliary strictures in those with symptomatic disease. Evidence from studies comparing jaundice, cholangitis, transplantation, and actuarial survival rates with figures from prognostic models tends to suggest a benefit of endoscopic intervention for dominant biliary strictures. In contrast, a Swedish study comparing liver biochemistry in those with and without dominant strictures suggested that variations in cholestasis and jaundice are a feature of PSC liver disease and are not a direct consequence of endotherapy of dominant strictures.

The optimum method and frequency of dilatation of dominant strictures are unclear. Plastic stent insertion with or without prior stricture dilatation has been commonly used. The difficulty with this approach is that further ERCPs are required to remove or replace the stent, and there is a high rate of stenosis recurrence.

### Pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis: an attempted network meta-analysis [^113GxxXj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease associated with hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies, which can lead to liver cirrhosis and its complications. The optimal pharmacological treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis by performing a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Given that it was not possible to assess whether potential effect modifiers were similar across comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, but instead used standard Cochrane methods. When trials begin to provide an adequate description of potential effect modifiers, we will attempt to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index - Expanded, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomized controlled trials registers until February 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in which participants were given a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We excluded trials that included previously liver-transplanted participants. We considered various pharmacological interventions.

The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups, as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies that may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. The quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care because we understand that management of patients often requires individual patient-centered considerations.

### British Society of Gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1119yu1u]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

It is difficult to predict the rate of progression or outcome for individual patients with PSC. Asymptomatic patients are likely to have a better prognosis than those with symptoms. Multivariate analyses in a number of series demonstrate clinically predictable parameters as markers of poor prognosis.

- **Prognostic models**: Some groups have devised prognostic models, summarized in various studies, using parameters including age, blood results, liver biopsy staging, cholangiographic findings, and complications such as a history of variceal bleeding. The most widely used is the revised Mayo natural history model for PSC. Like other models, it has a complex formula reflecting the variability and complexity of PSC's natural history. These models likely have little role in ordinary patient care and are rarely used in UK clinical practice. They are mainly used to assist in timing liver transplantation and for research studies.

- **Applicable scores**: The Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and UK Model for End Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) scores may be applied to PSC patients as to those with other liver disease causes. However, both scores can fluctuate significantly and may overestimate liver disease stages due to biliary obstruction's impact on the bilirubin component. The Child-Pugh score has been applied specifically to PSC, showing 7-year survival rates of 90%, 68%, and 25% for scores A, B, and C, respectively. Prognostic models using clinical and laboratory parameters for established PSC do not vary widely from data using the simple Child-Pugh score.

### Glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114bGydX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic disease of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, characterized by chronic periductal inflammation and sclerosis of the ducts. This results in segmental stenoses of bile ducts, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately, liver cirrhosis. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are at a higher risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colonic neoplasia, as it is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in more than 80% of patients. Several therapeutic modalities have been proposed for primary sclerosing cholangitis, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, glucocorticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents, but none has been successful in reversing the disease process. At the time of writing, liver transplantation remains the only definitive therapeutic solution for patients with advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis with liver cirrhosis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from their inception until September 2009, as well as reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of glucocorticosteroids versus placebo, no intervention, or other immunosuppressive agents were included. Trials were considered irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status.

Regarding medical management for primary biliary cholangitis, and more specifically with respect to second-line therapy, the AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend not using obeticholic acid in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis is defined as cirrhosis with prior evidence of liver decompensation, such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy, or portal hypertension, such as ascites, gastroesophageal varices, or persistent thrombocytopenia. Careful monitoring is advised for any patient with cirrhosis, even if not advanced, who is receiving obeticholic acid.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1115n29T]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

This phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that treatment with obeticholic acid (OCA) at doses of 5–10 mg led to significant reductions in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a marker of cholestasis, in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) after 24 weeks. Improvements in ALP levels were apparent as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of OCA and were sustained throughout the treatment period. A subgroup analysis showed reductions in ALP regardless of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) use, although reductions were more robust in patients not receiving UDCA at baseline.

The doses selected for the higher dosing regimen in this study (5 and 10 mg daily) are known to be therapeutic for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). However, lower doses (1.5 and 3.0 mg) were also evaluated. The 1.5 mg dose administered in the first 12 weeks of the study showed no meaningful biochemical response. While the 3.0 mg dose appeared to show additional improvement over the 1.5 mg dose, this was not statistically different from placebo, likely due to the relatively small patient numbers and larger variability in the biochemical data compared to the phase III PBC study with OCA.

Initial doses of 1.5 and 3.0 mg were incorporated to identify the minimally safe and effective dose while further characterizing the exposure-response relationship. The nested, dose-escalation approach allowed for an understanding of the value of titration to address potential concerns about tolerability and intra-subject variability. The relationship between ALP response and OCA treatment was dose-dependent. Reductions in ALP following titration from 1.5 to 3.0 mg suggest that 3.0 mg may represent the minimally effective dose.

### Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis therapy landscape [^116boVs4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are rare chronic cholestatic diseases that can progress to liver failure. The goals of treatment are to halt the progression of liver disease to cirrhosis and/or liver failure and alleviate symptoms associated with these diseases. Ursodeoxycholic acid has historically been the first-line treatment for PBC, with obeticholic acid and fibrates used as second-line or adjunctive therapies. However, the treatment landscape is rapidly expanding.

Recently, two new second-line agents gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of PBC, and several other therapies remain under investigation with promising results. Although significant progress has been made in the development of therapies for PBC, there are no approved treatments for PSC other than liver transplantation. Nonetheless, several emerging therapies have shown encouraging results. This review outlines the current and upcoming treatments for PBC and PSC.

### Management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116Qodam]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are preferable, but reports and expert review articles are also utilized in a thorough review of the literature conducted through the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts.

Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to specialty training or interests. They are intended to indicate the preferable, but not necessarily the only acceptable, approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision.

Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Each guideline has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of their production based on the data available.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: What have we learned and where are we going [^1135WMGN]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

It has proven difficult to establish robust evidence for significant clinical benefits of medical treatment in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). For ursodeoxycholic acid, clinical practice guidelines only offer vague recommendations, leading to a situation of variable prescription rates depending on local reimbursement policies and physician preference. The difficulty in drug development in PSC is partly related to a poor understanding of critical disease processes with failure to identify relevant mechanisms of action of putative drugs. The variable disease course, both intra-individually and between individuals, and the lack of robust definitions of what success looks like for clinical trials in PSC have also contributed to the negative outcomes of trials performed. In this review article, we will discuss these uncertainties and challenges, building on key previous and ongoing clinical trials.

Despite the lack of consensus for ideal phase II and phase III study designs, several trials for diverse compounds are currently ongoing, indicating a shift from therapeutic nihilism toward hope for people with PSC. While waiting for robust efficacy data for drugs currently being tested, the lack of effective interventions should not motivate the prescription of compounds to people with PSC based on low-quality evidence.

### The nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor agonist cilofexor (GS-9674) improves markers of cholestasis and liver injury in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1111oubQ]. Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic and progressive liver disease whose pathogenesis remains poorly understood. PSC is characterized histologically by chronic inflammation and fibro‐obliterative destruction of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic ducts, resulting in progressive biliary fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Although various pharmacologic interventions have been studied, no approved medical therapies exist that have reduced rates of clinical outcomes such as hepatic decompensation, cholangiocarcinoma, transplantation, or mortality. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is associated with improvement in biochemical markers of cholestasis, including a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), in most PSC patients, but the clinical benefits of such responses remain unclear. Recent analyses have identified lower baseline levels and/or improvements in ALP over time as important markers of improved prognosis. A study of high‐dose UDCA demonstrated worse clinical outcomes compared with placebo, despite reductions in serum ALP. These seemingly contradictory findings illustrate the complexity of identifying surrogate markers of clinical benefit in PSC and also highlight the major unmet need for novel therapies to treat this condition.

A hallmark of PSC is the presence of cholestasis. Thus, one potential therapeutic target may be the activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a ligand‐activated nuclear hormone receptor that is the key regulator of bile acid synthesis, conjugation, and excretion. FXR is highly expressed in the liver and gallbladder.

### Increased risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis [^115KBuk6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Published data on the risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis, with and without primary sclerosing cholangitis, are conflicting. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize available publications and compare the risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis, with and without primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Methods**: By using MEDLINE and manual search methods, studies were identified that compared the risk of colorectal neoplasia (dysplasia and carcinoma) in patients with ulcerative colitis, with and without primary sclerosing cholangitis. In addition, citations were reviewed in relevant articles and proceedings from gastroenterology meetings, and investigators were contacted when data were incomplete. The summary odds ratio (OR) was calculated for the risk for patients with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis of developing colorectal neoplasia, compared with that of patients with ulcerative colitis without primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Results**: Eleven studies met all eligibility criteria for the meta-analysis. Patients with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk of colorectal dysplasia and carcinoma compared with patients with ulcerative colitis alone; OR 4.79: 95% CI [3.58, 6.41] with the Mantel-Haenszel method, and OR 5.11: 95% CI [3.15, 8.29] with the Der Simonian and Laird method. This increased risk is present even when the risk of colorectal carcinoma alone is considered; OR 4.09: 95% CI [2.89, 5.76] and OR 4.26: 95% CI [2.80, 6.48] by using, respectively.

Aetiology

PSC is a progressive biliary disorder strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The genetic associations with disease risk, presence of chronic inflammation in the portal tracts, and the strong association with IBD suggest that PSC is an immune-mediated disease in which the biliary epithelial cell is a key cell targeted. However, no reliable autoantibodies have been identified, and there is no significant response to immunosuppression. At the time of writing, genome-wide studies have uncovered susceptibility loci for PSC-IBD, the majority of which have been previously reported as risk factors in other immune-mediated disorders. The strongest association resides within the human leucocyte antigen complex and suggests that disease-specific antigens drive pathogenic immune responses. Genetic determinants account for less than 10% of the total disease liability in PSC-IBD, clearly emphasizing the predominant role of environmental factors on ultimate disease susceptibility.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^112PWpCK]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing colectomy who have co-existent ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) should be advised of an increased risk of pouchitis, to inform decision-making regarding ileoanal pouch formation or permanent ileostomy (Agreement: 100%).

While the occurrence of complications following IPAA surgery in patients with co-existent UC and PSC is high, the risk of pouch failure is low. The most common short- and long-term complication is pouchitis, with acute, recurring, and chronic pouchitis all occurring frequently. The largest published series of 100 patients with co-existent UC and PSC with IPAA, followed for a median of 5.9 years, reports 30-day complication rates of 39% and overall pouchitis rates of 64%. Pouch excision was only necessary in 3% of patients in this series. Other smaller series present similar data with high rates of pouchitis, although whether the rate is higher than in the non-PSC UC cohort is unclear, with data conflicting.

For PSC patients with UC undergoing liver transplantation, graft outcomes are better for those who have an end ileostomy after colectomy compared with colectomy and IPAA. Graft loss was mainly associated with hepatic artery thrombosis and biliary strictures. The risk associated with IPAA is not dependent on the timing of colectomy in relation to the liver transplantation. Patients can be offered pouch formation if they have PSC as long as they understand the potential implications.

### High lifetime risk of cancer in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1134WT1R]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients are at risk for developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The aim of this study was to assess the risk of malignancies and their influence on survival.

Data from PSC patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2006 in two university hospitals were retrieved. The Kaplan-Meier method and a time-dependent Cox regression model were used to calculate risks of malignancies and their influence on survival.

Two hundred and eleven patients were included. Among them, 143 (68%) were male, and 126 (60%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Median transplantation-free survival was 14 years. The risk of CCA after 10 and 20 years was 9% and 9%, respectively. In patients with concomitant IBD, the 10-year and 20-year risks for CRC were 14% and 31%, which was significantly higher than for patients without IBD (2% and 2% respectively, P = 0.008). CCA, cholangitis, and age at entry were independent risk factors for the combined endpoint of death or liver transplantation. Risk factors for the endpoint death were CCA, CRC, age, and symptomatic presentation.

In conclusion, patients with PSC and IBD have a high long-term risk of developing CRC, and this risk is about threefold higher than the risk for CCA. Both malignancies are associated with decreased survival.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115McWkt]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, cholestatic liver disease with no currently approved therapies. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. We investigated the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PSC.

- **Methods**: AESOP was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. Eligible patients were 18 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of PSC and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin < 2.5× ULN. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, OCA 1.5–3.0 mg, or OCA 5–10 mg once daily for a 24-week, double-blind phase followed by a 2-year, long-term safety extension (LTSE). Primary endpoints were change in ALP from baseline to week 24, and safety.

- **Results**: The intent-to-treat population comprised 76 patients randomized to placebo (n = 25), OCA 1.5–3.0 mg (n = 25), and OCA 5–10 mg (n = 26). At week 24, serum ALP was significantly reduced with OCA 5–10 mg vs. placebo (least-square [LS] mean difference = -83.4 [SE = 40.3] U/L; 95% CI -164.28 to -2.57; p = 0.043). Serum ALP was not significantly reduced with OCA 1.5–3.0 mg vs. placebo at week 24 (LS mean [SE] difference = -78.29 [41.81] U/L; 95% CI -162.08 to 5.50; p = 0.067). Total bilirubin remained comparable to baseline in all groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was dose-related pruritus (placebo 46%; OCA 1.5–3.0 mg 60%; OCA 5–10 mg 67%). Reductions in ALP were maintained during the LTSE, and no new safety concerns were identified.

### Statin use is associated with improved outcomes of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113Af2v1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that statins can benefit patients with chronic liver diseases, but their effects have not been studied in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We performed a nationwide study in Sweden to determine the effects of exposure to drugs, including statins, in patients with PSC.

- **Methods**: We studied a population-based cohort of patients in Sweden with PSC and concomitant ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease from 2005 through 2014 (n = 2914), followed through 2016. We collected and analyzed data from the patient register, the prescribed drug register, the death certificate register, and the cancer register. We calculated risk of death, liver transplantation, bleeding of esophageal varices, and cancer in relation to drug exposure.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis with PSC was 41.4 years (inter-quartile range [IQR], 25.6–56.1 years). The total follow-up time was 11,769 person-years, during which 3.4% of patients received liver transplants and 19.9% died. Proportions of patients exposed to drugs were: ursodeoxycholic acid, 60.2%; 5-aminosalicylic acid, 74.4%; azathioprine or mercaptopurines, 33.7%; and statins, 13.9%. Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.88) and death or liver transplantation (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.66). Use of azathioprine was also associated with reduced mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52–0.84) and risk of death or liver transplantation (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.83).

### British Society of Gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1149W8Kg]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

There is little evidence for a beneficial effect of UDCA in reducing the risk of CCA, with no placebo-controlled trials specifically examining this question. Two observational studies reported a lower incidence of CCA in patients taking UDCA compared to previously reported incidence rates. The largest of these studies followed up 150 patients for a median of 6.4 years, with CCA developing in five patients (3.3%), which represents about half the expected incidence of CCA in PSC. The large US randomised control trial of UDCA versus placebo was terminated early, but also failed to show a significant difference in the rate of either CCA (2.6% vs. 2.7%) or colonic dysplasia in either the UDCA or placebo arms, respectively, at 5 years.

- **Recommendation 6**: We recommend that UDCA is not used for the prevention of colorectal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).

### High dose ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is safe and effective [^112e4o1o]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown to improve serum liver tests in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), but controlled trials have shown inconsistent effects on liver histology and did not reveal a survival benefit. This pilot, randomized dose-ranging trial aimed to determine whether further enrichment of the bile acid pool with UDCA would lead to an improvement in outcomes for PSC patients.

- **Methods**: Thirty-one patients with PSC were randomized to treatment with either 10 mg/kg (low dose), 20 mg/kg (standard dose), or 30 mg/kg (high dose) daily of UDCA for 2 years. Patients were assessed every 12 weeks and underwent liver biopsy at the beginning and end of the trial.

- **Results**: Serum liver tests improved in all groups taking UDCA. Survival probability at 1–4 years, as evaluated by the Mayo risk score, tended to improve for all patients and significantly improved for the high dose group (p < 0.02). Only 3 (10%) of all patients had a Ludwig score showing histological deterioration over the trial period.

- **Conclusions**: High dose UDCA is well-tolerated and is associated with an improvement in survival probability. A trend towards stability/improvement in histological stage was also observed. This treatment appears to be effective for PSC and deserves further evaluation.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1165PC43]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

PSC is a rare and partially understood chronic cholestatic and fibroinflammatory liver disorder that can lead to severe complications, such as cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, and cancer. Recent advances in understanding its pathophysiology have identified new potential molecular targets, offering new treatment possibilities. Given the complex nature of the disease, it is unlikely that a single pharmacological intervention can address all the treatment needs of PSC patients. Therefore, future therapeutic strategies for PSC are likely to involve a combination of multiple pharmacological agents targeting different molecular and biochemical pathways at various stages of the disease.
