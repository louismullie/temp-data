## Question

A 43-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after falling off a 10-foot ladder. He has severe pain and swelling of his right ankle and is unable to walk. He did not lose consciousness after the fall. He has no nausea. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows multiple abrasions over both lower extremities. There is swelling and tenderness of the right ankle; range of motion is limited by pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the ankle shows an extra-articular calcaneal fracture. Intravenous analgesia is administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. MRI of the right ankle
B. Long leg cast
C. Open reduction and internal fixation
D. X-ray of the spine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step is most appropriate after confirming an extra-articular calcaneal fracture from a 10-foot fall, with options including MRI, long-leg cast, open reduction and internal fixation, or spine X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism and associated injury patterns that mandate screening. Then, I should verify the immediate complications to exclude, especially foot compartment syndrome. Next, I will review imaging needs for the calcaneus and whether advanced imaging changes acute management. After that, I should consider definitive management pathways for extra-articular versus intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Finally, I will weigh each option against guideline-based priorities and choose the most time-critical, evidence-aligned next step.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and its implications. A fall from height is a classic high-energy mechanism for calcaneal fractures and carries a known association with thoracolumbar spine injuries, so I need to ensure we do not miss a concurrent vertebral fracture, which is often clinically silent early on and can have major consequences if overlooked [^115fQakn].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate priorities in calcaneal trauma. Compartment syndrome of the foot is a time-sensitive complication reported in a meaningful minority of calcaneal fractures, and missing it risks permanent deformity and neurologic deficit; thus, vigilant assessment and early recognition are essential, but that does not make it the most appropriate "next step" imaging choice in this scenario [^113RQAe2] [^112JB9RR].

> Hold on, I should verify whether advanced ankle or foot imaging is needed now. The fracture is already identified on plain radiograph as extra-articular, and the ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend cross-sectional imaging primarily when radiographs are normal or equivocal yet suspicion remains high for occult injury, or for preoperative planning in complex or intra-articular patterns; with a clearly identified extra-articular calcaneal fracture, emergent MRI or CT of the ankle/foot is not indicated acutely [^116B8wWH].

> Let me consider immobilization options. A long-leg cast is generally excessive for an isolated calcaneal fracture; short-leg splinting or a fracture boot with strict non-weight-bearing is the typical initial approach while swelling is controlled and definitive decisions are made, so jumping straight to a long-leg cast would be overly restrictive and misaligned with usual practice patterns for this injury pattern [^notfound].

> I will now examine surgical decision-making. Extra-articular calcaneal fractures are commonly managed nonoperatively unless there is marked displacement, neurovascular compromise, or failure of closed management; randomized and systematic evidence comparing surgery versus conservative care primarily addresses displaced intra-articular fractures and does not support routine operative fixation for extra-articular patterns, so immediate open reduction and internal fixation is not indicated without specific operative triggers [^117D6fkJ].

> But wait, what if I'm underestimating spinal risk because the patient has no back pain yet. Spine injuries from falls from height can be initially asymptomatic due to distracting foot pain, and trauma guidelines explicitly list calcaneal fractures from falls as an indication to evaluate the thoracolumbar spine; therefore, the most appropriate next step is to obtain spine radiographs to screen for associated vertebral injury, which is time-critical and precedes definitive foot management decisions [^115fQakn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost prioritized foot MRI thinking it might better define occult injury; however, with a radiographically confirmed extra-articular calcaneal fracture and no immediate operative indication, MRI would not change acute management and is not the most appropriate next step here compared with spine screening for associated injury [^116B8wWH] [^115fQakn].

> I should double-check that my prioritization aligns with both mechanism-based risk and evidence-based guidance. Mechanism-based spinal risk in fall-from-height calcaneal fractures, coupled with the potential for initially silent thoracolumbar injuries, supports obtaining a spine X-ray now, while advanced foot imaging and definitive operative fixation are not urgent for an extra-articular pattern without specific indications; short-leg immobilization and non-weight-bearing can proceed concurrently while the spine is cleared [^115fQakn].

> Final answer: The most appropriate next step is to obtain an X-ray of the spine to evaluate for thoracolumbar injury given the high-energy mechanism and known association with calcaneal fractures from falls from height [^115fQakn].

---

The most appropriate next step is to obtain an **X-ray of the spine** because calcaneal fractures from a fall from height are associated with a high risk of thoracolumbar spinal injuries, even in the absence of back pain [^115fQakn]. Early detection of spinal fractures is critical to prevent complications and guide management. MRI is not indicated initially, and definitive foot management (cast vs. surgery) should follow after spinal evaluation and compartment syndrome assessment [^113RQAe2].

---

## Clinical reasoning and evidence

- **Association with spinal injuries**: Calcaneal fractures from falls from height are strongly associated with thoracolumbar spinal injuries, including compression fractures and burst fractures [^115fQakn]. The mechanism of injury — axial load transmitted through the heel — can cause concurrent spinal trauma, even in the absence of back pain or neurological symptoms.

- **Importance of early detection**: Spinal injuries, particularly unstable fractures, can lead to significant morbidity if not identified and managed promptly. Early detection through radiographic imaging allows for appropriate immobilization, pain management, and referral to orthopedic or neurosurgical specialists, reducing the risk of complications such as neurological impairment, chronic pain, and deformity [^116b8xx4].

- **Clinical guidelines and recommendations**: Trauma guidelines emphasize the need to evaluate the spine in patients with calcaneal fractures resulting from high-energy mechanisms, such as falls from height [^115fQakn]. Obtaining spinal radiographs is a standard part of the initial evaluation in these patients, regardless of the presence or absence of back pain or neurological symptoms.

---

## Why other options are less appropriate

- **MRI of the right ankle**: MRI is not indicated as the initial imaging modality for calcaneal fractures. Plain radiographs are sufficient for initial diagnosis and management decisions. MRI may be considered later if there is suspicion of soft tissue injury, occult fracture, or complications such as osteomyelitis, but it is not the immediate next step [^114oF9ZC].

- **Long leg cast**: Immobilization with a long leg cast is premature without a thorough evaluation of the fracture pattern, displacement, and associated injuries. Initial management typically involves elevation, ice, analgesia, and temporary immobilization with a splint or short leg cast, followed by definitive management based on orthopedic consultation [^notfound].

- **Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)**: Surgical intervention is not indicated immediately without a comprehensive evaluation of the fracture pattern, displacement, and associated injuries. ORIF is typically reserved for displaced intra-articular fractures or fractures with significant displacement or associated soft tissue injury, and the decision for surgery is made after careful orthopedic evaluation and imaging [^114TDPxW].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the high risk of associated spinal injuries in patients with calcaneal fractures resulting from falls from height, the most appropriate next step is to obtain an **X-ray of the spine** [^notfound]. This approach aligns with trauma guidelines and ensures early detection and management of potential spinal injuries, thereby reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes. After spinal evaluation, management of the calcaneal fracture should follow, including assessment for compartment syndrome and orthopedic consultation for definitive treatment planning [^113RQAe2].

Calcaneal fractures and stress fractures — clinical features and management are outlined as follows: intra-articular fractures involving the subtalar joint result in diffuse pain in the hindfoot that is poorly localized to the heel itself; diagnosis is made by a history of trauma, focal pain upon palpation, and radiographic confirmation of the fracture; treatment may be surgical, although many relatively minor fractures often may occur in older or high-risk individuals for whom nonsurgical management may be the most judicious course; stress fractures of the calcaneus occur as a consequence of repetitive load to the heel, with the most common site of stress fracture immediately posterior and inferior to the posterior facet of the subtalar joint; the physical findings include tenderness to the lateral wall of the calcaneus, swelling and warmth may be present, pain elicited with compression of the calcaneus is highly suspicious of a stress fracture, and frequently the onset of symptoms precedes the radiographic findings, and ancillary measures can assist in early diagnosis, including Technetium bone scans or MRI.

### Compartment syndrome of the foot after calcaneal fracture [^113RQAe2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Compartment syndrome of the foot as a result of a calcaneal fracture has received only occasional consideration in the recent Emergency Medicine literature, yet it remains a challenging diagnosis to make. The devastating consequences of untreated compartment syndrome of the foot include clawing of the lesser toes, stiffness, chronic pain, motor weakness, neurovascular dysfunction, and fixed deformities of the foot. In addition to decreased quality of life, this also leads to lost time at work and lost wages. Calcaneal fractures can lead to devastating long-term disability that is often permanent and life-altering for patients suffering from this injury. Approximately 10% of patients with these fractures develop compartment syndrome of the foot. The pathogenesis of calcaneal fractures is well recognized, and the surgical treatment techniques continue to evolve.

Objectives

The objectives of this case report are to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of compartment syndrome and its short- and long-term consequences, to improve the ability to diagnose compartment syndrome, and to emphasize the need for emergent surgical treatment.

Case Report

A 37-year-old man sustained an isolated comminuted, extra-articular calcaneus fracture that resulted in compartment syndrome of the foot. The diagnosis required measurement of several compartments in the foot. He subsequently received emergent operative decompression and experienced a positive outcome.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of compartment syndrome of the foot is a clinical one, and diagnostic tools such as radiographic imaging and compartment pressure monitoring can help confirm the diagnosis. It is also important to understand the long-term sequelae of this injury and to involve a specialist early in the decision-making and treatment process.

### Surgical versus conservative interventions for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures [^114TDPxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) comprise up to 2% of all fractures. These fractures are mostly caused by a fall from a height, and are common in younger adults. Treatment can be surgical or non-surgical; however, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical compared with conservative treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to July 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948 to July 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 27), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, and Orthopaedic Trauma Association annual meeting archives (1996 to 2011). Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical versus conservative management for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were function (e.g. walking ability) and chronic pain. Risk ratios were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Missing standard deviations were calculated from P values.

Main Results

Four trials were included (602 participants). Three trials were small single-centre trials, and the fourth a large multi-centre trial including 424 participants. All trials had methodological flaws, usually failure to conceal allocation and incomplete follow-up data, which put them at high risk of bias. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 15 years after treatment. Data for functional outcomes, including walking ability, from three trials could not be pooled. The strongest evidence was from the multi-centre trial. This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the surgical and conservatively treated groups at three years follow-up in the "validated disease-specific" score (0 to 100: perfect result; 424 participants; mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to 9.71; P = 0.12). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of chronic pain at follow-up (19/40 versus 24/42; risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.18; 2 trials). The multi-centre trial found no statistically or clinically significant difference between the two groups in health-related quality of life at three years follow-up (SF-36 (0 to 100: best outcome): MD 4.00, 95% CI -1.16 to 9.16; P = 0.13). Two small trials provided some limited evidence of a tendency for a higher return to previous employment after surgery (27/34 versus 15/27; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.81; I² = 55%; 2 trials). One small trial found no difference between the two groups in the ability to wear normal shoes, whereas another small trial found that surgery resulted in more people who were able to wear all shoes comfortably. There was a higher rate of major complications, such as surgical site infection, after surgery compared with conservative treatment (57/206 versus 42/218; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.04; 1 trial). Conversely, significantly fewer surgical participants had subtalar arthrodeses due to the development of subtalar arthritis (7/206 versus 37/218; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; 1 trial). There were no significant differences between the two groups in range of movement outcomes or radiological measurements (e.g. Bohler's angle).

Authors' Conclusions

The bulk of the evidence in this review derives from one large multi-centre but inadequately reported trial conducted over 15 years ago. This found no significant differences between surgical or conservative treatment in functional ability and health related quality of life at three years after displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture. Though it reported a greater risk of major complications after surgery, subtalar arthrodeses for the development of subtalar arthritis was significantly greater after conservative treatment. Overall, there is insufficient high quality evidence relating to current practice to establish whether surgical or conservative treatment is better for adults with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture. Evidence from adequately powered randomised, multi-centre controlled trials, assessing patient-centred and clinically relevant outcomes is required. However, it would be prudent to reassess this need after an update of the review that incorporates new evidence from a currently ongoing multi-centre trial.

### Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures [^117D6fkJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) comprise up to 2% of all fractures. These fractures are mostly caused by a fall from a height, and are common in younger adults. Treatment can be surgical or non-surgical; however, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus conservative treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trials registers in November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing surgical versus non-surgical management of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures in skeletally mature adults (older than 14 years of age). For surgical treatment, we included closed manipulation with percutaneous wire fixation, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) with or without bone graft, or primary arthrodesis. For non-surgical treatment, we included ice, elevation and rest, or plaster cast or splint immobilisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We collected data for the following outcomes: function in the short term (within three months of injury) or long term (more than three months after injury), chronic pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and ability to return to normal activities, as well as complications which may or may not have led to an unplanned return to theatre.

Main Results

We included 10 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with 1097 participants. Sample sizes in studies ranged from 29 to 424 participants. Most participants were male (86%), and the mean age in studies ranged from 28 to 52 years. In the surgical groups, participants were mostly managed with ORIF with plates, screws, or wires; one study used only minimally invasive techniques. Participants in the non-surgical groups were managed with a plaster cast, removable splint or a bandage, or with rest, elevation, and sometimes ice. Risk of performance bias was unavoidably high in all studies as it was not possible to blind participants and personnel to treatment; in addition, some studies were at high or unclear risk of other types of bias (including high risk of selection bias for quasi-RCTs, high risk of attrition bias, and unclear risk of selective reporting bias). We downgraded the certainty of all the evidence for serious risk of bias. We also downgraded the certainty of the evidence for imprecision for all outcomes (except for complications requiring return to theatre for subtalar arthrodesis) because the evidence was derived from few participants. We downgraded the evidence for subtalar arthrodesis for inconsistency because the pooled data included high levels of statistical heterogeneity. We found that surgical management may improve function at six to 24 months after injury when measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score (mean difference (MD) 6.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 12.12; 5 studies, 319 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are not aware of a published minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the AOFAS score for this type of fracture. Previously published MCIDs for other foot conditions range from 2.0 to 7.9. No studies reported short-term function within three months of injury. Surgical management may reduce the number of people with chronic pain up to 24 months after injury (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84; 4 studies, 175 participants; low-certainty evidence); this equates to 295 per 1000 fewer people with pain after surgical management (95% CI 107 to 422 per 1000). Surgical management may also lead to improved physical HRQoL (MD 6.49, 95% CI 2.49 to 10.48; 2 studies, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence). This outcome was measured using the physical component score of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. We used a change in effect of 5% to indicate a clinically important difference for this scoring system and thus judged that the difference in HRQoL between people treated surgically or non-surgically includes both clinically relevant and not relevant changes for those treated surgically. There may be little or no difference in the number of people who returned to work within 24 months (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.68; 5 studies, 250 participants; low-certainty evidence) or who require secondary surgery for subtalar arthrodesis (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.53; 3 studies, 657 participants; low-certainty evidence). For other complications requiring return to theatre in people treated surgically, we found low-certainty evidence for amputation (2.4%; 1 study, 42 participants), implant removal (3.4%; 3 studies, 321 participants), deep infection (5.3%; 1 study, 206 participants), and wound debridement (2.7%; 1 study, 73 participants). We found low-certainty evidence that 14% of participants who were treated surgically (7 studies, 847 participants) had superficial site infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Our confidence in the evidence is limited. Although pooled evidence indicated that surgical treatment may lead to improved functional outcome but with an increased risk of unplanned second operations, we judged the evidence to be of low certainty as it was often derived from few participants in studies that were not sufficiently robust in design. We found no evidence of a difference between treatment options in the number of people who needed late reconstruction surgery for subtalar arthritis, although the estimate included the possibility of important harms and benefits. Large, well-conducted studies that attempt to minimise detection bias and that measure functional outcomes using calcaneal-specific measurement tools would increase the confidence in these findings. Given that minimally invasive surgical procedures are already becoming more prevalent in practice, research is urgently needed to determine whether these newer surgical techniques offer better outcomes with regard to function, pain, quality of life, and postoperative complications for intra-articular displaced calcaneal fractures.

### The operative management of displaced intra-articular fractures of the calcaneum: a two-centre study using a defined protocol [^1124488M]. Injury (2001). Low credibility.

The management of intra-articular calcaneal fractures remains controversial with strong arguments supporting both conservative and operative management. This study assesses the results of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of displaced intra-articular fractures of the calcaneum in two independent centres where the indications for operative management had been strictly defined. Forty-seven patients (51 fractures) who had sustained such injuries underwent an ORIF performed by one of the senior surgeons using the technique described by Eastwood et al. [JBJS 75-B(1993)189] All of the fractures were assessed by plain X-ray and CT scan and graded according to the Sanders classification [Clin. Orthop. 290(1993)97]. Patients were assessed at a minimum of 2 years post-surgery both clinically and with a standardised questionnaire based on that described by Kerr et al. [Injury 27(1996)35]. The mean age at operation was 42 and 50 years for the two centres, and the mean follow-up was 44 months. Seventy-six per cent of the patients were male. Eighty-eight per cent of the injuries were due to a fall from a height. Fifteen patients had contralateral foot/ankle injuries. Thirty-four of 46 patients were in employment at the time of the injury, 24 of these were in physical jobs and 20 sustained their injury whilst at work. Overall, the satisfaction rate was 90%. Ninety-four per cent of patients in work returned to work at a median of 6 months. Bilateral injuries were associated with a significantly poorer outcome as were those with heel pad pain. Delay to operation greater than 14 days was associated with a higher infection rate. Smoking was not related to infection rate.

Foot and ankle injuries are a frequent cause for a visit to the Emergency Department. A thorough evaluation and treatment of these injuries needs to be an area of in-depth familiarity for the Emergency Medicine physician. The key to proper evaluation is first a history and physical examination that focuses on determining what, if any, imaging is required. Subsequently, a focused history, physical examination, and imaging will then determine if an injury is stable or unstable, requiring operative intervention.

### American College of Foot and Ankle SurgeonsClinical consensus statement: perioperative management [^114JDXBf]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons — routine postoperative radiographs: The panel reached consensus that the statement "Foot and ankle surgeons should use routine postoperative radiographs in the absence of a clinical indication to assess osteotomy, fracture, and/or arthrodesis healing" was inappropriate. The panel added that "it was inappropriate to use routine or serial postoperative radiographs in the absence of a specific clinical indication", clarifying that this "does not refer to dedicated postoperative plain film radiographs and/or final intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging or radiographs taken at a postoperative clinical decision point (i.e., the initiation of weightbearing)", but rather imaging "performed without a specific indication and which are unlikely to result in a change in the treatment of the patient". This consensus "would not be expected to interfere with the requirement for foot and ankle surgery board certification", as the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery requires "initial postoperative images" defined as "within 1 week of surgery and/or intraoperative images" and "final outcome images" defined as " > 4 weeks postoperatively and demonstrating radiographic osseous union".

### Evaluation and management of the high-risk orthopedic emergency [^115ohxDM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Orthopedic injuries are frequently seen in the ED. Whereas the diagnosis and management of most of these injuries is straightforward, there are distinct pitfalls to avoid. The common theme among the high-risk "pitfall" injuries discussed in this article, besides a thorough patient history and careful physical examination with appropriate radiographs, is a high suspicion for the presence of these injuries. When the EP is knowledgeable about these orthopedic pitfalls, these injuries are much less likely to slip by in clinical practice.

Clinical Relevance

Currently, there is no standardized ways of early assessing and treating patients with HPI. Lack of well-conducted clinical studies prevents the definition of a shared policy of clinical management and contributes to unjustified heterogeneity in clinical behaviors and patients outcomes.

In particular, clinical evidence is limited to few case series, largely insufficient to guide practice. On the contrary, a number of narrative reviews are available, showing different and sometimes conflicting opinions among experts coming from different specialties, professions, and countries.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute trauma to the ankle [^114Ji2TT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute ankle injuries are frequently diagnosed and treated in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. Recent evidence-based clinical treatment guidelines and systematic review of economic analyses support the use of 3-view (anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise) radiographic evaluation of patients meeting the criteria of the Ottawa ankle rules. Cross-sectional imaging has a limited secondary role primarily as a tool for preoperative planning and as a problem-solving technique in patients with persistent symptoms and suspected of having occult fractures. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Review of the evidence to support major principles and actionable steps in patient management

To establish a treatment target and select initial therapy requires assessment of fracture risk, including vertebral imaging when appropriate, and BMD measurement when available. Indications for BMD testing and vertebral imaging are available in the BHOF Clinician's Guideand the International Society for Clinical Densitometry Position Statements. Treatment targets should reflect the underlying clinical scenarios; specific BMD treatment targets and choice of therapeutic agents should be individualized.

Treatment targets and selection of treatment for patients at imminent risk

Recent fracture and imminent risk of subsequent fracture

Multiple recent studies in different regions of the world confirm the importance of recent fracture as a predictor of subsequent fracture. Overall, these large database studies show that the risk of fracture is increased dramatically for up to 2 yr after the occurrence of the first fracture, with the annual risk remaining high but declining after that time. Risk increases very rapidly after an initial fracture, with the highest risk seen within the first few months after the fracture. One of the most comprehensive studies utilized a Medicare database to evaluate 377,500 women age 65 yr and older who had a first clinical fracture. Women with fractures of the digits, skull, patella, sternum, scapula, and ribs were excluded. Fracture risk was assessed for up to 5 subsequent yr. Average risk of subsequent fracture was 10% in the very next year and 18% in the 2 yr following the first fracture. The site of the first fracture was associated with varying risks of subsequent fracture (Figure 1). The magnified short-term risk was particularly high after vertebral and pelvic fractures and lowest for ankle fractures, though even ankle fractures were still associated with a subsequent 1-yr risk of just below 5% and 2-yr risk of almost 10% (which is still considered imminent risk). Therefore, in patients at imminent risk, especially those with recent fractures of the spine, hip, and pelvis, rapid and maximum fracture risk reduction is the first and most important treatment target.

### Staged reconstruction of a multiplane post-traumatic deformity: a case report [^116q6rAP]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Damaging effects of joint function can occur after fractures of the lower extremity that have healed with an angular malunion. Surgical techniques have been described to restore the normal mechanics and establish a plantigrade foot, including osteotomy and fusion. In the present report, we describe a unique case of a 17-year-old male who had initially experienced a severe injury to his left lower extremity and foot when he had been run over by a jeep. Originally, a Lisfranc injury with navicular and cuboid fractures were surgically corrected. He had also sustained an extra-articular distal tibial and fibular fracture, which had been conservatively managed. Seven months after the initial incident, he underwent 3-staged reconstructive surgery because of a malaligned valgus ankle with fibular malunion and a painful collapsing pes planovalgus deformity. A supramalleolar tibial osteotomy with fibular lengthening was first performed, followed by triple arthrodesis with removal of hardware and then syndesmosis repair. The present report discusses our clinical evaluation and surgical technique for this multiplanar post-traumatic deformity.

### Decision rules for the use of radiography in acute ankle injuries. refinement and prospective validation [^113xpeM4]. JAMA (1993). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Ottawa Ankle Rule" for ankle sprain and ankle fracture.

The Ottawa Ankle Rule is a clinical tool used primarily in emergency medicine to determine the need for radiographic imaging in patients with ankle and midfoot injuries. It is designed to rule out fractures in these areas and thus reduce unnecessary X-rays. The rule applies to patients who have ankle or midfoot pain or tenderness and are unable to bear weight both immediately after the injury and in the emergency department. The Ottawa Ankle Rule is not applicable to patients who are under the age of 18, have other distracting painful injuries, are intoxicated, have diminished sensation in the lower extremities, or are unable to understand the instructions or assessment due to language barriers or cognitive impairment.

The Ottawa Ankle Rule is a clinical guideline to determine whether a patient with an ankle injury needs an X-ray to check for a possible fracture. The decision is made based on the presence of specific symptoms related to pain, tenderness, and weight-bearing ability.

Input options for the Ottawa Ankle Rule include:

- Pain in malleolar zone
- Pain in midfoot zone
- Tenderness at posterior edge or tip of lateral malleolus
- Tenderness at posterior edge or tip of medial malleolus
- Tenderness at the base of the 5th metatarsal bone
- Tenderness at navicular bone
- Inability to bear weight both immediately and in emergency department

The rule is applied by following this logic:

1. **If the patient experiences pain in the malleolar zone**:

- **Consider an ankle X-ray if there is also**:

- Tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral malleolus, or
- Tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of the medial malleolus, or
- Inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department.

2. **Alternatively, if the patient reports pain in the midfoot zone**:

- **Consider an ankle X-ray if there is also**:

- Tenderness at the base of the 5th metatarsal bone, or
- Tenderness at the navicular bone, or
- Inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department.

If none of these criteria apply, then an ankle X-ray is not necessary. By using the Ottawa Ankle Rule, clinicians can effectively minimize unnecessary radiographic imaging, reducing both patient exposure to radiation and overall healthcare costs, while ensuring an accurate assessment based on the individual's symptoms.

### Inpatient management of diabetic foot disorders: a clinical guide [^116YgZne]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of ankle fractures in neuropathic individuals is fraught with complications, resulting in increased potential for catastrophic outcomes leading to amputation, severe deformity, and disability. Rigid internal fixation with augmented methods of achieving stability is indicated in even minimally displaced fractures due to the high risk of progression to the development of CN. The evidence available on managing fractures in the foot is not as clear, as it is difficult to distinguish between an acute foot fracture in a neuropathic patient and an acute presentation of CN. These patients should be treated on an individual basis, attempting to distinguish among acute fracture, neuropathic fracture, and the initial presentation of CN.

### Operative versus non-operative treatment for closed, displaced, intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus: randomised controlled trial [^116Kiyek]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

All of the surgeons who took part were considered to be experts by their peers. They are the surgeons to whom patients with calcaneal fractures are referred from across the United Kingdom. It is possible that a surgeon with an extremely specialised practice, and with a high volume of this type of surgery, could achieve a better outcome. We have no evidence to support this, and such a trial could not be performed in the United Kingdom. This study provides a pragmatic result for the UK National Health Service, which reflects current surgical practice, case mix, and organisation of services in the United Kingdom.

Recruitment rate was 30% among eligible patients, which is at least as high as has been achieved in other surgical trials of operative compared with non-operative care. We are confident that our result is generalisable because those who agreed and those who declined to participate were similar in all factors that we found to be associated with variation in outcome. The follow-up rate was 95% for the primary outcome measure, giving us confidence in our estimate of effect. There was no significant change in this estimate between an intention to treat analysis and a per protocol analysis, indicating that the small crossover rate (5%) did not influence our results.

The observed standard deviation of the primary outcome was 24 points compared with the 20 points we used for the power calculation. However, the confidence interval for the primary outcome excludes a treatment effect of 10 points, which we designed the trial to detect. The sample size was large enough to detect this magnitude of treatment effect if it exists. We cannot exclude a smaller effect, but our data do not suggest that such a benefit exists. Even if it did, a larger trial may not be feasible (a similar Dutch study closed early in 2012 after problems with recruitment), and it seems unlikely that such a small beneficial treatment effect would warrant the increased risk of complications that we observed.

We studied patients with closed, displaced fractures. Forty five (0.2%) open fractures and 57 (0.3%) grossly displaced fractures showing "fibula impingement" were excluded from the study. Most of these were treated operatively. Some were treated by external fixation, some by primary fusion, some by amputation, and some by open reduction and internal fixation. Before the study began, we identified these as types of fracture that were likely to need operative treatment, and our results do not apply to these groups.

A 55-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with radial-sided left wrist pain and swelling after slipping during yoga class. Initial radiography was deemed negative for fracture presence (a). Subsequent cone-beam CT demonstrated a subtle fracture line in the waist of the scaphoid bone (arrowhead), corresponding to a potentially unstable B2 fracture (b). Suggested treatment was upgraded to surgery; however, the patient decided for conservative therapy. MRI follow-up after 1 week confirmed the fracture diagnosis, depicting extensive bone bruise in the distal portion of the scaphoid (c)

A 22-year-old male sprinter was admitted with increasing left ankle pain after an acute sprain in training. He was unable to bear weight on the left foot and stated pressure pain over the proximal first metatarsal. No fracture could be located in anteroposterior and lateral x-ray scans (a, b), whereas ensuing cone-beam CT depicted a medial avulsion fracture of the left navicular bone (c, d). Treatment was upgraded to cast immobilization

Fig. 5
After a fall on the outstretched hand, x-rays of a 63-year-old man exhibited a distal radius fracture with metaphyseal impaction (a). While articular surface affliction could not be ascertained in radiography, the cone-beam CT scan demonstrated involvement of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joint (b). Open reduction was advised irrespective of CT imaging and the reported impaction of the lunate fossa was corrected intraoperatively

Criteria for selecting studies

Type of studies

Published RCTs evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention for PHP were considered for inclusion. No language restrictions were imposed. All other designs including quasi-experimental studies, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, editorials and conference abstracts were considered ineligible.

Characteristics of participants

An RCT was included if the participants were clinically diagnosed with PHP with explicit reference to pain on the underside of the heel that was most noticeable on weight-bearing after periods of rest but also worse following prolonged weight bearing. All participants were over the age of 16 years and had experienced symptoms of any duration. RCTs were excluded if participants' PHP was related to fractures, tumours or infections or confounded by other conditions that might be rheumatological, neural, vascular or dermatological in origin.

Types of interventions

Any RCT that investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of an intervention compared with another intervention, placebo, sham or wait and see was included, provided there was a follow-up of at least 2 weeks.

Outcome measures

Studies that reported at least one of the three outcome measures — patient-reported pain, first step pain or foot-related function — were included. Where multiple methods of quantifying the same outcome were reported, the author's main prespecified outcome metric was accepted, or that of the metric with the lower level of effect. This was done to avoid making recommendations based on type 1 error with the rationale that an intervention which results in a meaningful effect size for a given outcome should be consistent irrespective of the measure used.

Short term was defined as 1 week to 3 months, medium term as > 3 and up to 6 months and long term as > 6 months. Where multiple follow-ups within a time window were reported, the outcome at the latest time point within short and medium term, and closest to 1 year for long term was selected.

Previous experiencesshowed, indeed, negligible improvements in practice after the publication of expert-based recommendations, even when coming from authoritative institutions (e.g. NIH).

### Spine injury [^115fQakn]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Associated injuries indicating spinal risk — consider all trauma patients who present with severe injuries at high risk for associated spinal trauma, and consider specific injuries identified during the primary and secondary survey. Traumatic brain injuries (TBI), manifested by a decreased GCS score, place trauma patients at a high risk for an associated C-spine injury, and complex maxillofacial trauma is another example. A high proportion of patients with a pelvic fracture have associated spinal trauma to the cervical, thoracolumbar and sacral region. Thoracic trauma, including multiple rib fractures, sternal, scapular and clavicular fractures, increases the risk for associated cervical and thoracic spinal injuries. Calcaneal fractures resulting from a fall from height indicate a spinal injury risk, usually at the level of the lumbar region. Patients with a seatbelt-shaped abdominal contusion are also at risk for thoracolumbar spine trauma from a flexion-distraction injury. Also consider patients to be at high risk who require emergent surgical exploration for a gunshot wound or blunt traumatic injury, when an associated spinal injury may be found on postoperative imaging.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^113XFZXW]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging in geriatric patients with low-energy mechanism injuries — elderly persons aged 65 and older face rising trauma burden, with the geriatric population projected to double in size, from 46 million in 2016 to more than 98 million by 2060 and the share of the population expected to grow from 15 percent to nearly 24 percent. The most common injury mechanism is a ground-level fall, accounting for 75 percent of trauma events, and 90 percent of those falls are from the standing position. Injuries are often underestimated and this population is highly susceptible to trauma recidivism due to physiologic and psychosocial vulnerability, while changes in physiology, especially age-related balance and flexibility deficits, are responsible for a higher risk of injury following a low-impact mechanism.

### Minimising negative ankle and foot X-rays in the emergency department – are the ottawa ankle rules good enough? [^112bjBKv]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review fracture rates in patients who had X-rays of either the ankle or foot or both in the Emergency Department of a district hospital.

Method

A retrospective review of 2589 Emergency Department patients who had X-rays of the ankle or foot or both over a 12-month period.

Results

There were 1199 ankle X-rays taken of which 193 (16%) showed a significant fracture. There were 1081 patients who had a foot X-rayed of which 165 (15%) showed a significant fracture. Younger patients had more X-rays but older patients were more likely to have a fracture. There were 309 patients who had an ipsilateral ankle and foot X-rayed at the same time, and of these 42 (14%) showed one fracture and just two (0.6%) showed a significant fracture of both ankle and foot.

Conclusions

The approach to X-raying ankle and feet in this study is probably widespread, and Ottawa Ankle Rules still seem to be of limited use in diagnosing fractures. This low yield of positive X-ray could be accepted or a more sophisticated ankle rule introduced.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute compartment syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for assessment, ALCS-WG 2010 guidelines recommend to assess all patients with limb injuries for ALCS. Assess high-risk patients - having any of the following conditions - for ALCS at least every 4 hours for a minimum of 24 hours after the precipitating injury:

- tibia and or radius/ulna fractures in < 35 years old male patients

- high-energy injuries, such as open fractures and/or severe soft tissue injuries

- soft tissue injuries in < 35 years old male patients with a bleeding disorder or receiving anticoagulants

- crush injuries

- prolonged limb compression, for example, following drug overdose.

### Can initial clinical assessment exclude thoracolumbar vertebral injury? [^112JL23k]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Non-significant fractures were defined as involving only one column (stable fractures) and not requiring operative fixation. Of the above group, 25 (89%) patients sustained non-significant stable fractures including 10 anterior compression fractures, eight superior end plate fractures, four transverse process fractures, one spinous process fracture and two other minor abnormalities.

The remaining three (11%) patients sustained clinically significant fractures defined as those involving two or more columns (unstable fractures according to the Denis classification)or those requiring operative fixation. This included a 25-year-old motorcyclist sustaining a T5 on T6 fracture dislocation, with cord compression, requiring operative fixation. This patient had neurological signs consisting of a T5 sensory level and paraplegia. There was also a 75-year-old patient with a three column fracture from a fall from standing height and a 33-year-old pedal cyclist with a two column fracture. Neither required operative fixation.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^117WjNsq]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Mangled extremity — amputation indications and decision factors: There is limited evidence regarding absolute indications and few well-defined, objective criteria for amputation. Higher energy injuries and presentation with shock increase the probability of amputation but are contributing factors rather than absolute indications. Common indications for amputation include total or near total amputations, warm ischemia time > six hours, complete anatomic sciatic or tibial nerve transection, and/or loss of plantar skin and soft tissues, and inability to re-vascularize an extremity is also predictive of failed limb salvage and the ultimate need for amputation. Evidence suggests a hierarchy that influences decision-making where soft tissue > nerve > bone > artery, and it is important to note that most patients will not have an absolute indication for an amputation but will fall into an indeterminate grey zone.

### Differentiation in an inclusive trauma system: allocation of lower extremity fractures [^113KL8BV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation and specialisation leads to optimization of care. Although there is a diversity in injury type with regard to the complex injuries, the required treatment regime, necessary resources, and flexible logistics make acute complex care of lower extremity fractures a separate entity that requires its own differentiation. Complex lower extremity fracture types were more frequently treated in the L1 centre. Tibial plateau Schatzker types 4 through 6, complex tibial shaft, displaced calcaneal, and complex midfoot fractures were more prevalent in the L1 compared to the L2 centre (Table 3). It is tempting to speculate that these fractures are more frequently the result of high-energy mechanisms and therefore predisposed to presentation to an L1 centre. This is supported by trauma mechanism analysis, as all high incidence complex fracture types in the L1 were related to HET mechanisms, such as a fall from height (e.g. suicide attempts), traffic, and crush mechanisms. This is further illustrated by a higher incidence of open fractures, an increased need for external fixations, fasciotomies, amputations, and other secondary or complication surgeries in the L1 centre. Open lower extremity fractures have a greater likelihood of infection, which makes early soft tissue coverage within hours to days desirable. Vascular damage and neurological damage ought to be treated urgently. Furthermore, soft tissue damage especially in the case of multiple non-contiguous fractures often requires serial operations. As a result, there is a high demand on multiple resources in the L1 centre. In total, 24.9% of all fractures in the L1 required more than one operation. In contrast, only 1.4% of the patients in the L2 centre underwent multiple procedures. The presence of an in-hospital trauma surgeon as well as a dedicated OR team for complex and severely traumatized patients was initiated to improve outcomes, but adds to the costs incurred per patient. Although not all secondary and complication-related surgeries were performed during the initial hospitalization, also in a semi-acute setting, they put pressure on OR capacity and require personnel with a high level of expertise. OR utilization is one of the costliest components in secondary care. As a consequence, treatment of the complex extremity injuries is expensive.

### Efficacy of post-operative X-rays after operatively treated ankle fractures: what is their role? [^111ReVFd]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The utility of routine post-operative imaging in clinically asymptomatic patients is unclear. We sought to determine how frequently X-rays following operatively treated ankle fractures result in a change in management.

Design

Retrospective cohort study conducted with hospital electronic health record SETTING: Single level 1 trauma center in major urban city.

Patients/Participants

193 patients with operatively treated ankle fractures at our institution between January 2020 and December 2021.

Main Outcome Measures

Patient radiographs were categorized as surveillance X-rays and clinically indicated X-rays. Changes in management were defined as alteration in follow-up, deviation from standard post-operative protocols, or revision surgery. A logistic regression was performed looking at factors predicting whether an X-ray changes management. A cost analysis was also performed looking at the financial implications of asymptomatic surveillance of ankle fractures.

Results

438 post-operative X-rays were found and included in analysis. Of these, 391 were considered surveillance X-rays and 47 clinically indicated. 23 X-rays were determined to have resulted in changes in management (18 clinically indicated, 5 taken in asymptomatic patients). The number of management changing X-rays was significantly higher in the clinically indicated group (p < 0.0001). The only factor associated with whether an X-ray changed management was whether the patient was symptomatic at the visit (p < 0.0001). Asymptomatic surveillance X-rays cost our institution 21,825.62 USD per year.

Conclusions

Radiographs in clinically asymptomatic patients with operatively managed ankle fractures have a low likelihood of changing management. Such imaging represents costs to the healthcare system, increased time for patients during clinic visits, and radiation exposure. The use of screening radiographic studies remains commonplace because the risk of delayed diagnosis is great, and the goal of any surgeon should be the swift identification of complications in order to minimize patient morbidity. Future surveillance protocols should consider the findings of this and other studies on the use of screening radiographs and strike a careful balance between minimizing unnecessary imaging, maximizing early complication detection, and ensuring a personalized approach towards patient-level factors to optimize care and efficiency for both patient and health system.

### Overuse of concomitant foot radiographic series in patients sustaining minor ankle injuries [^113GwmPT]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Radiographic series of the foot are often obtained in conjunction with ankle X-rays when the clinical presentation is limited to trauma to the ankle. The Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules were established in 1992 and serve as reliable guidelines to determine when an ankle or foot series is warranted in patients who have sustained minor ankle and/or foot injury. We retrospectively reviewed radiographic studies of all patients over a period of 18 months who simultaneously had ankle and foot plain radiographs performed for acute complaints limited to the ankle alone. Of the 243 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 55 patients had fractures, 46 in or near the ankle joint, and nine which were located at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. No fractures or dislocations were noted elsewhere in the foot. All of the fifth metatarsal fractures were evident on adequately performed ankle series. Our findings suggest that films of the foot are not necessary when trauma is limited to the ankle and when an appropriately performed ankle series has been completed.

### Diagnosis of metacarpal fracture with equivocal X-ray by point-of-care ultrasound: a case report [^113ZJeUK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Metacarpal fractures represent a very common injury among patients presenting to the emergency department. Diagnosis is of utmost importance given the high morbidity associated with lack of full hand function. We report a case of a 37-year-old man who sustained extremity trauma after a mechanical fall. He presented with an examination that revealed diffuse tenderness over the wrist and hand. X-ray of the hand was equivocal for a metacarpal fracture; however, point-of-care ultrasound revealed disruption of the bony cortex confirming the diagnosis. The patient was splinted and referred for follow-up with a hand specialist. Point-of-care ultrasound may be useful for the diagnosis of hand fractures, which may reduce health care costs and radiation exposure in the future.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^1135UA1a]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment and algorithm flow

Our proposed algorithm has two entry points (Figure 1): first, opportunistic case finding, case finding during a health visit or using 'e-health records', and second, when older adults present to healthcare services as a result of a fall or related injury. Opportunistic case-finding is necessary as older adults may not present following a fall and may be reluctant to report falls. Furthermore, recollection of the occurrence or date (e.g. how many months ago) of previous falls is unreliable. Therefore, the 1-year timing is a pragmatic compromise between accuracy of recollection and the natural history of falls risk factor progression.

Opportunistic case finding starts with the single question 'Have you fallen in last 12 months'. This single question is highly specific in predicting future falls but has a low sensitivity as it takes no account of common risk factors, and consequently, results in a high rate of false negatives.

Tools that assess more than one fall risk factor, such as the 'three key questions' (3KQ), have a higher sensitivity. The questions are: (i) Have you fallen in the past year, (ii) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (iii) Do you have worries about falling. If resources are available, we conditionally recommend its use. The Stay Independent self-risk assessment consisting of 12 self-administered questions, which is a component of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's STEADI toolkit, can also be used as a sensitive approach to detecting future fall risk. Age distribution of the older adult population when selecting a fall risk screening tool is important, since sensitivity of the single question 'Have you fallen in the past 12 months' increases from 43% in those between 65 and 74 years old, to 67% in those over 85 years old. Gait or balance disturbances should be assessed following a positive answer to history of fall or any of the 3 key questions.

Strong recommendation. Regarding specific tests, we recommend including Gait Speed for predicting falls risk. GRADE: 1A. As an alternative, the Timed Up and Go Test can be considered, although the evidence for fall prediction is less consistent. GRADE: 1B.

### Comparison of open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and percutaneous fixation for medial malleolus fractures [^115Rb2Wt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Data Collection

Patient information including sex, age, body mass index, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or II, diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, and active use of tobacco was collected from clinical chart review by one of two reviewers not involved in the care of the patient. Other factors related to the injury characteristics were assessed by review of radiographs, clinical notes, and surgical reports. An injury was considered to be high energy if it occurred in a motor vehicle collision or fall from greater than 15 feet, as defined earlier. Clinical chart review was used to determine whether the MM fracture was open or closed and whether external fixation was used. Delay of surgery refers to the time elapsed between the date of injury and the date of definitive fixation.

Review of radiographs was used to determine the presence of fibula fracture, the presence of comminution of the MM fracture, and the orientation of fracture line, as described by Ebraheim et al. Digital measurements were used to determine fracture fragment size and displacement; both were measured from initial injury films. Fragment size was measured as the distance from the tip of the MM fragment to its articular surface on mortise view, and displacement was measured as the greatest distance between the fractured articular surface points as seen on either anterior posterior or mortise views (Figure 1).

Figure 1
AP radiograph of the ankle. The solid line represents the displacement measurement of the articular, and the dashed line represents the measured length of the fractured fragment.

Fixation techniques and outcomes were assessed based on review of surgical reports, postoperative radiographs, and clinical notes by one of two reviewers not involved in the care of the patient. The primary outcome, fracture union, was defined as (1) resolution of the fracture line on radiographs, (2) painless weightbearing, and (3) zero to minimal tenderness to palpation over the fracture site(Figure 2). Nonunion was defined by failure to meet the above criteria by 6 months postoperatively (Figure 3). Although isolated malunion of the MM is rare, we sought to understand the rate at which sustained joint incongruity occurred and thus defined malunion as ≥ 2 mm of articular surface step-off seen radiographically once the fracture had united(Figure 4). Wound complications included any minor or major postoperative wound issue that required extended local wound care, antibiotics, or repeat surgery for incision and drainage.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^117HNFaU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Geriatric hip fracture — injury assessment, imaging, timing, anesthesia, and fracture categorization emphasize early suspicion and coordinated care: when a geriatric patient presents with severe hip pain, particularly following a fall, a hip fracture should be suspected, and a thorough history and physical examination should be performed with evaluation for concurrent injuries; early consultation with an inpatient medical or geriatric specialist may be beneficial, geriatric specialists or hospitalists may help streamline preoperative testing and serve as an effective liaison to the anesthesia team, and a well-coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is encouraged; diagnosis is typically evident on standard radiographic assessment, and when a hip fracture is suspected in the setting of normal radiographs, it is recommended that additional imaging (for example, MRI) be obtained to evaluate for the presence of a nondisplaced fracture; once diagnosed, patients are typically admitted, medically optimized, and should be surgically treated as soon as able, preferably within 48 hours; there is strong evidence that regional anesthesia improves perioperative management in patients with hip fracture and may reduce postoperative delirium and cardiac events; geriatric fractures of the proximal femur broadly fall into three categories: femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures.

### Going toe-to-toe with a rare case of a complex regional pain syndrome limited to the hallux [^115Js474]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old male metalworker was referred to our rehabilitation unit in May 2020 for diagnostic advice and interdisciplinary care due to persistent pain after a contusion of the left forefoot that had occurred 5 months earlier. X-rays did not show any fracture. The initial treatment consisted of the prescription of painkillers, physiotherapy and foot orthoses, but did not bring any improvement. Due to the persistent pain, he had adopted an avoidance step on the heel and the lateral edge of the foot to avoid any contact of the hallux with the ground. A CT scan showed only mottled osteopenia in the first radius of the foot initially suspected to be related to the immobilisation. An MRI showed bone oedema of the first metatarsal, first phalanx and medial sesamoid accompanied by soft tissue swelling predominantly on the plantar side interpreted as the stigmata of the bone contusion (figure 1).

Figure 1
(A, B) The forefoot sagittal (A) and axial (B) T1 fat saturation injected MRI showed a mottled bone oedema of the first metatarsal head and the medial sesamoid, associated with a swelling of the surrounding soft tissues, predominantly on the plantar side. The juxta-articular position at the base of the first metatarsal is particularly noticeable, but also at the base of the first cuneiform and navicular bone.

During our first clinical encounter, the patient reported continuous pain (Numerical Rating Scale: 6/10), sensory disturbances with a neuropathic component (DN4: 7/10), changes in temperature and colour of the hallux, increased sweating and oedema. He described difficulties with moving his toes and used crutches to move around, avoiding any contact with the forefoot (walking and touching). Clinical examination confirmed localised allodynia and asymmetry of the hallux temperature on the infrared thermometer (33.6°C on the affected site vs 32.1°C on the unaffected one), but not the colour change. The other signs were not very pronounced, but could be objectified: oedema (+1 cm), hypersudation (visually and by touch), decreased range of motion (especially for the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal ray of the hallux) and weakness of the flexors and extensors of the hallux.

Another indication is altered level of consciousness after major trauma, and because examination may be unreliable even in awake patients with significant mechanism of injury, WBCT "may be appropriate". Potential early benefits include identification of clinically unsuspected injuries with management changes, reduced time to diagnosis and treatment, earlier discharge of patients with negative CTs, and avoidance of repeat contrast loads, while benefits "must be weighed against" radiation exposure and cost.
