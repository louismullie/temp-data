## Question

Albumin replacement and liver cirrhosis patient after parecentesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to give albumin after therapeutic paracentesis in cirrhosis, including thresholds, dosing, special populations, alternatives, safety, and a practical algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and definition of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and why albumin helps. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend for volumes above and below 5 liters. Next, I will review randomized trials and meta-analyses for efficacy signals, including high-risk subgroups like ACLF and SBP. After that, I need to confirm dosing, timing, and concentration. I will then examine alternatives to albumin and safety concerns, and finally synthesize a pragmatic, risk-stratified approach with built-in monitoring and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its mechanism. Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction is typically defined by a rise in plasma renin activity of at least 50% within 6 days and is associated with faster ascites recurrence, hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, and worse survival; it reflects accentuation of splanchnic vasodilation and arterial underfilling after rapid abdominal decompression, which albumin mitigates by effective plasma volume expansion and possibly nononcotic effects [^1164yn8J] [^113rqwhy] [^115PJ6BY].

> Next, I should review where the guidelines align and where they diverge. Strong consensus supports albumin after large-volume paracentesis greater than 5 liters at 8 g per liter removed using 20–25% solutions, administered immediately after the tap; this is consistently recommended by EASL and BASL/BSG, and conditionally by the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines, whereas the AGA agrees on post-LVP albumin but is more restrictive for volumes under 5 liters in uncomplicated cases [^113rqwhy] [^116GU3w6] [^1132h2bd] [^116pF5Jz] [^111NKKKY].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence backbone for LVP greater than 5 liters before moving on. A meta-analysis of randomized trials shows albumin reduces PICD and hyponatremia versus other expanders and suggests a possible mortality signal when pooled across comparators; Gines et al. demonstrated more PICD with saline than albumin after total paracentesis, with saline appearing acceptable only when less than roughly 6 liters were removed, reinforcing the 5–6 liter inflection point seen in practice [^1119vUKo] [^111VQjb4] [^117B6ugD].

> Now, for paracentesis under 5 liters, I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. The AGA recommends against routine albumin in stable, uncomplicated ascites, but BASL/BSG and EASL allow consideration in high-risk states; small RCTs comparing lower versus standard albumin doses did not show clear differences in PICD and renal outcomes, yet in ACLF even modest-volume taps can precipitate PICD that is significantly reduced by albumin, arguing for a risk-stratified approach under 5 liters rather than a rigid cutoff [^111NKKKY] [^113igVB6] [^115tda4N] [^111BMk6r].

> Wait, let me verify special scenarios where the threshold should drop even further. In spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, albumin is indicated regardless of the paracentesis volume at 1.5 g/kg within 6 hours and 1 g/kg on day 3 because it reduces renal dysfunction and mortality; similarly, in hospitalized cirrhotics with AKI or evolving hemodynamic instability, albumin is first-line volume expander and post-paracentesis use is justified even with lower volumes in many cases, especially when systemic inflammation is prominent as in ACLF [^1162mKa6] [^113hz4jE] [^116sJVkG] [^111BMk6r].

> I will now examine alternatives to albumin, but I should double-check their evidence strength. Small trials suggest vasoconstrictors like noradrenaline, midodrine, or terlipressin may attenuate neurohumoral activation after paracentesis, yet comparative data are limited and heterogeneous; current guidance still places albumin as first-line for PICD prevention, with vasoconstrictors considered adjuncts or second-line when albumin is unavailable or contraindicated, acknowledging low certainty [^114o1NDt] [^1122uBmx] [^112S8mSA] [^114m6SAp].

> Let me consider dosing and timing, and I should confirm specifics. For LVP greater than 5 liters, the standard is 8 g of albumin per liter removed using 20–25% solutions, infused immediately after the procedure; for SBP, dosing is weight-based at 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3. A practical check: removing 6 liters calls for about 48 g albumin, which is roughly 200–240 mL of 20–25% solution, and timely administration matters to blunt the vasodilatory cascade [^116GU3w6] [^1132h2bd] [^1162mKa6] [^113rqwhy].

> But wait, what about safety and the temptation to give more albumin "just to fix the number"? The ATTIRE trial showed that targeting serum albumin levels with repeated high-dose 20% albumin in hospitalized decompensated cirrhosis did not reduce infection, kidney dysfunction, or death and increased pulmonary edema, so repeated albumin to raise albumin concentration above 30 g/L should be avoided outside specific indications; monitoring for dyspnea, crackles, urine output, creatinine, and sodium after paracentesis is essential, especially in older patients or those with cardiac comorbidity and repeated infusions, and cost and supply constraints further support indication-focused use [^116H5zHc] [^1133FEwi] [^114fLvXr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that EASL mandates albumin even when less than 5 liters are removed in all cases, but I should reconsider that reading. EASL firmly recommends post-LVP albumin and emphasizes plasma expansion after complete taps for grade 3 ascites; under 5 liters, the risk of PICD is lower and recommendations become more conditional, aligning with BASL/BSG's case-by-case approach for ACLF or high AKI risk, whereas AGA advises against routine use in uncomplicated, low-volume taps, underscoring how patient context modifies the decision rather than a single rigid threshold [^113rqwhy] [^116ZYzgu] [^116GU3w6] [^111NKKKY].

> Next, I should synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. If more than 5 liters are removed, give albumin at 8 g per liter immediately after the tap. If less than 5 liters are removed, screen for high-risk features including ACLF, AKI or rising creatinine, systemic inflammatory response, or hemodynamic instability; in such cases, favor albumin at 8 g per liter and in SBP apply the 1.5 g/kg then 1 g/kg regimen regardless of the removed volume; in stable, uncomplicated low-volume taps without high-risk features, it is reasonable to withhold albumin, with close follow-up and labs to detect early PICD or AKI [^1132h2bd] [^111BMk6r] [^1162mKa6] [^111NKKKY].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan accounts for alternatives and follow-up. If albumin is unavailable or contraindicated, a vasoconstrictor strategy may be considered with acknowledgment of limited evidence, and the patient should have creatinine, sodium, weight, and urine output reassessed within 24–72 hours; recurrent large-volume needs should prompt evaluation for TIPS candidacy and transplant referral, with the recognition that albumin's role here is supportive and indication-specific rather than disease-modifying in the acute setting after paracentesis [^114m6SAp] [^113rqwhy] [^116GU3w6].

Albumin replacement is **recommended after large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L)** [^1132h2bd] in cirrhosis to prevent paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) [^116GU3w6], acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyponatremia [^1119vUKo]. The standard dose is **8 g per liter of ascites removed** [^116GU3w6], given as 20–25% albumin after the procedure [^113rqwhy]. For smaller volumes (< 5 L), albumin is **generally not required** [^113yAvvp] unless the patient has acute kidney injury, acute-on-chronic liver failure [^115tda4N], or other high-risk features [^111BMk6r]. Albumin is superior to saline or synthetic colloids for preventing PICD and renal dysfunction, and is the preferred plasma expander in this setting [^113igVB6]. Routine albumin use in uncomplicated ascites is not recommended [^113yAvvp] [^1133FEwi].

---

## Indications for albumin replacement after paracentesis

Albumin replacement is **indicated primarily to prevent PICD** [^113rqwhy], a complication marked by effective hypovolemia, neurohormonal activation [^1164yn8J], and increased risks of AKI, hyponatremia, and mortality. It is recommended for **large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L)** to prevent PICD and associated complications [^116GU3w6] [^113rqwhy]. For **smaller-volume paracentesis (< 5 L)**, albumin is generally not required unless the patient has acute kidney injury, acute-on-chronic liver failure, or other high-risk features [^111iKSF8] [^111BMk6r].

---

## Recommended dosing and timing of albumin administration

The **recommended dosing and timing** of albumin administration are:

| **Volume of ascites removed** | **Recommended albumin dose** | **Timing of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| > 5 L | 8 g per liter of ascites removed (20–25% solution) [^116GU3w6] [^113rqwhy] | After completion of paracentesis |
| < 5 L | Generally not required unless high-risk features present [^111iKSF8] | After completion of paracentesis if indicated [^111BMk6r] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with albumin replacement

Albumin replacement after paracentesis has been shown to **significantly improve clinical outcomes** in patients with liver cirrhosis:

- **Prevention of PICD**: Albumin significantly reduces the incidence of PICD [^1119vUKo] compared to no treatment or alternative plasma expanders [^112PX1Z2].

- **Reduction in renal dysfunction**: Albumin administration reduces the risk of renal impairment and acute kidney injury [^113rqwhy].

- **Reduction in hyponatremia**: Albumin infusion decreases the occurrence of hyponatremia compared to alternative treatments [^111VQjb4].

- **Mortality benefit**: Albumin replacement is associated with reduced mortality compared to alternative plasma expanders or no treatment [^1119vUKo].

---

## Risks and adverse effects associated with albumin replacement

While albumin replacement is **generally safe**, potential risks and adverse effects include:

- **Volume overload**: Excessive albumin administration can lead to fluid overload, particularly in patients with cardiac or renal impairment [^113kfjZX].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare allergic reactions may occur, including anaphylaxis.

- **Cost and resource utilization**: Albumin is expensive and may strain healthcare resources if used indiscriminately [^113igVB6].

---

## Alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments

Adjuncts or alternatives to albumin include **vasoconstrictors** such as midodrine [^1122uBmx] and terlipressin [^114m6SAp]; evidence is mixed, and while midodrine may prevent PICD as effectively as albumin in some studies, albumin remains the preferred plasma expander [^113igVB6]. Synthetic colloids, including dextran, gelatin, and hydroxyethyl starch, have been evaluated but are generally **less effective than albumin** [^1119vUKo] and carry **higher risks of PICD and renal dysfunction** [^115PJ6BY].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **strongly recommend** [^116GU3w6] albumin after large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L) [^116pF5Jz] in patients with liver cirrhosis. Albumin is the standard of care for preventing PICD and associated complications [^1119vUKo] [^1132h2bd]. Routine albumin administration is not recommended for smaller-volume paracentesis unless specific high-risk features are present [^113rqwhy].

---

Albumin replacement after large-volume paracentesis in liver cirrhosis **is recommended** [^1132h2bd] to prevent PICD, renal dysfunction, and hyponatremia. The standard dose is 8 g per liter of ascites removed, administered after paracentesis [^116GU3w6]. Albumin is superior to alternative plasma expanders [^115PJ6BY], but routine use in uncomplicated ascites is not recommended [^113yAvvp].

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^113igVB6]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Two small prospective RCTs compared standard dose (6–8 g/L of ascites drained) albumin after LVP with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L). Pooled results from 70 patients suggested no difference in post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 0.89, 9.91) and no development of renal dysfunction (no events in either group). A larger retrospective review of 935 patients found no increase in renal dysfunction when adherence to guidance (8 g/L after 5 L drained) was implemented, but significant cost savings were made because less HAS was used.

Potential cost savings have been proposed in relation to the length of hospital stay in patients with ascites undergoing LVP who are treated with HAS as compared with an alternative plasma expander. However, HAS is more expensive than alternatives and is in worldwide shortage, therefore it should be prescribed according to recommended guidance based on the available evidence. There have been no cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK.

Until further studies are undertaken to compare the efficacy of albumin against clinically available artificial plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains the preferred plasma expander when paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as a 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113rqwhy]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

In the medical management of portal hypertension, specifically concerning the management of ascites and therapeutic paracentesis, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend performing large-volume paracentesis. This involves removing ascites completely in a single session and is considered first-line therapy for patients with large ascites (grade 3 ascites). It should be followed by plasma volume expansion to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction.

### Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction with modest-volume paracentesis is partly ameliorated by albumin infusion in acute-on-chronic liver failure [^111BMk6r]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a serious complication of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis in cirrhosis and is reduced with albumin infusion. There is a lack of data on PICD in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) because ACLF patients have greater hemodynamic derangements than patients with decompensated cirrhosis. We investigated whether PICD could develop with modest-volume paracentesis (MVP) and the role of albumin infusion.

A total of 80 ACLF patients undergoing < 5 L paracentesis were randomized to receive albumin (8 g/dL of ascitic fluid; n = 40) or no albumin (n = 40) and serially followed to detect PICD. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, including the volume of ascitic tap (4.16 ± 0.23 versus 4.14 ± 0.27 L; P = 0.72) and plasma renin activity (PRA; 20.5 ± 7.03 versus 23.2 ± 8.24 ng/mL/hour; P = 0.12). PICD was more frequent in the no-albumin group than in the albumin group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.001), with a higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (50% versus 27.5%; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (67.5% versus 22.5%; P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (62.5% versus 30%; P = 0.001), and in-house mortality (62.5% versus 27.5%; P = 0.003). PRA of 25.15 ng/mL at day 3 had sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 68%, respectively, for development of PICD at day 6. Albumin infusion decreased the incidence of PICD at day 6 (odds ratio, 0.068; 95% confidence interval, 0.011–0.43; P = 0.005).

PICD is common and develops even with MVP in ACLF patients. Albumin infusion decreases the incidence of PICD under these conditions.

### Albumin infusion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1119vUKo]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Albumin infusion reduces the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction among patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites, as compared with no treatment. Treatment alternatives to albumin, such as artificial colloids and vasoconstrictors, have been widely investigated. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether morbidity and mortality differ between patients receiving albumin versus alternative treatments.

The meta-analysis included randomized trials evaluating albumin infusion in patients with tense ascites. Primary endpoints were postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction, hyponatremia, and mortality. Eligible trials were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic and abstract databases and the Cochrane Library. Results were quantitatively combined under a fixed-effects model. Seventeen trials with 1,225 total patients were included. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias.

- **Postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction**: Compared with alternative treatments, albumin reduced the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.55). Significant reductions in that complication by albumin were also shown in subgroup analyses versus each of the other volume expanders tested (e.g. dextran, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch, and hypertonic saline).

- **Hyponatremia**: The occurrence of hyponatremia was also decreased by albumin, compared with alternative treatments (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39–0.87).

- **Mortality**: In addition, mortality was lower in patients receiving albumin than alternative treatments (OR, 0.64; 95% CI).

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^115pcqDQ]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Albumin administration after large-volume paracentesis (LVP) (> 5 L) and in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) has been recommended by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines. It is also advised for use alongside vasoconstrictors in the management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI). Other uses of albumin remain controversial and necessitate further research before wide recommendation.

In a recent European survey completed by 101 hepatologists practicing at 86 centers (75% academic hospitals), the vast majority (93%–97%) of participants reported using intravenous (i.v.) albumin for guideline-recommended settings. These included its use after LVP for the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), prevention of renal failure after SBP, and diagnosis and management of HRS-AKI. However, up to a third of practitioners from tertiary and university hospitals admitted to using albumin in non-recommended situations, such as non-SBP infections, severe hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and long-term treatment of ascites. Interestingly, half of the respondents would recommend i.v. albumin solely for hypoalbuminemia. Furthermore, even for recommended indications, the doses employed were not those recommended based on clinical trials. This highlights the disparity in clinical practice where a drug's label is broad and where costs and perceived benefits influence its use despite lacking supportive evidence.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^116t4VbE]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically concerning diagnostic paracentesis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend performing diagnostic paracentesis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites who present with any of the following conditions:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Patients showing signs of bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Shock**: Cases where the patient is in a state of shock, requiring immediate medical attention.

- **Fever or other signs of systemic inflammation**: Presentation of fever or systemic inflammatory signs.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Presence of symptoms related to the gastrointestinal system.

- **Worsening liver and/or renal function**: Indications that liver or kidney function is deteriorating.

- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Evidence or suspicion of brain dysfunction due to liver insufficiency.

### Alterations in the functional capacity of albumin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis is associated with increased mortality [^111Vkac6]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Albumin concentration is diminished in patients with liver failure. Albumin infusion improves survival of cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is hypothesized that this may be due in part to its detoxifying capabilities. The aim of this study was to perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of albumin function in patients with cirrhosis. Healthy controls and patients with acute deterioration of cirrhosis requiring hospital admission (n = 34) were included. Albumin function was assessed using the affinity of the fatty acid binding sites with a spin label (16 doxyl-stearate) titration and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) was measured.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients developed acute-on-chronic liver failure. Twelve were treated with the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) and 10 with standard medical therapy. For each parameter measured, the patients' albumin had reduced functional ability, which worsened with disease severity. Fifteen patients died, and IMA, expressed as an albumin ratio (IMAR), was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (P < 0.001; area under the receiver operating curve = 0.8). No change in the patients' albumin function was observed following MARS therapy. A significant negative correlation between IMAR and the fatty acid binding coefficients for sites 1 and 2 (P < 0.001 for both) was observed, indicating possible sites of association on the protein.

The results of this study suggest marked dysfunction of albumin function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Alfapump® system vs. large volume paracentesis for refractory ascites: A multicenter randomized controlled study [^113n9Xj3]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with refractory ascites (RA) require repeated large volume paracenteses (LVP), which involves frequent hospital visits and is associated with a poor quality of life. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of an automated, low-flow pump (alfapump® [AP]) compared with LVP as the standard of care [SoC].

A randomized controlled trial was conducted across seven centers with six-month patient observation. The primary outcome was the time to first LVP. Secondary outcomes included paracentesis requirement, safety, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and survival. Nutrition, hemodynamics, and renal injury biomarkers were assessed in a sub-study at three months.

Sixty patients were randomized, and 58 were analyzed (27 AP, 31 SoC, mean age 61.9 years, mean MELD 11.7). Eighteen patients were included in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, the median time to first LVP was not reached after six months in the AP group, indicating a significant reduction in LVP requirement for the AP patients (AP, median not reached; SoC, 15.0 days [HR 0.13; 95% CI 13.0–22.0; p < 0.001]). AP patients also showed significantly improved Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) scores compared with SoC patients (p < 0.05 between treatment arms).

Improvements in nutritional parameters were observed for hand-grip strength (p = 0.044) and body mass index (p < 0.001) in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, more AP patients reported adverse events (AEs; 96.3% vs. 77.4%, p = 0.057) and serious AEs (85.2 vs. 45.2%, p = 0.002). AEs consisted predominantly of acute kidney injury in the immediate post-op period.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^115PJ6BY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection with paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent a reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effects on hemodynamic balance and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, such as other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol, have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov, and www.controlled-trials.com for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma volume expander.

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^111fo5Mp]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

- **Survival and patient outcomes**: There were 4 deaths (13.3%) during the study, with 1 further death occurring 192 days after withdrawal from the study. The causes of all deaths were related to the underlying liver disease or complications related to cirrhosis, and none were attributed to pump implantation or pump therapy. Three patients underwent liver transplant at days 104, 133, and 413 after pump insertion. Of all contactable patients after study completion, there were 17 (56.7%) patients alive at the end of the 12-month period with a pump in situ but without a liver transplant. A total of 3 patients in the United States and 7 patients in Canada were still alive with a functioning pump at more than 24 months. Patients experienced improved nutritional states as documented by an improved prealbumin level at 3 months and maintained at 12 months. No other measurement of nutritional improvement, such as increase in psoas muscle thickness, was available because no serial computed tomography scans were planned for this study. Of all the patients who were alive at the end of the study period, 4 patients had undergone hernia repairs, while 2 were waiting for their operation. Those patients who underwent hernia repairs reported further improvement in their quality of life.

- **Overall survival**: The overall survival for up to 12 months after enrollment in the study is indicated by last contact through study withdrawal, death, or the end of the study.

- **Prealbumin levels**: Prealbumin levels in the study patients are shown as mean ± SD.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: Expert review [^111NKKKY]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It consists of compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages, with median survival rates of more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. Each stage is characterized by progressive worsening of portal hypertension and a vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, resulting in a progressive decrease in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion.

Vasoconstrictors reduce portal pressure via splanchnic vasoconstriction and are used in the management of variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin increases effective arterial blood volume and is utilized in the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis, as well as in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is employed in the reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis. Because a potent vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and recent trials have explored the use of IV albumin in other settings, it was considered pertinent to update best practices regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in the following three specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on these issues.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112q4kTv]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Albumin is commonly used across a wide range of clinical settings to improve hemodynamics, facilitate fluid removal, and manage complications of cirrhosis. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines developed guidelines for the use of albumin in patients requiring critical care, undergoing cardiovascular surgery, undergoing kidney replacement therapy, or experiencing complications of cirrhosis.

- **Study design and methods**: Cochairs oversaw the guideline development process, and the panel included researchers, clinicians, methodologists, and a patient representative. The evidence informing this guideline arises from a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews, with multiple databases searched from inception through November 23, 2022. The panel reviewed the data and formulated the guideline recommendations using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology; the guidelines were revised after public consultation.

- **Results**: The panel made 14 recommendations on albumin use in adult critical care (three recommendations), pediatric critical care (one recommendation), neonatal critical care (two recommendations), cardiovascular surgery (two recommendations), kidney replacement therapy (one recommendation), and complications of cirrhosis (five recommendations). Among the 14 recommendations, two had moderate certainty of evidence, five had low certainty of evidence, and seven had very low certainty of evidence.

### Long-term albumin treatment in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [^116XaDP1]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Although proposed for the first time several decades ago, the potential effectiveness of long-term human albumin treatment for patients with cirrhosis and ascites has garnered significant scientific and clinical attention in the past decade. Long-term albumin administration offers a fundamentally different treatment approach compared to acute or short-term uses of albumin. Findings from the ANSWER and MACHT studies suggest that long-term albumin treatment can be effective, safe, and capable of altering the disease course, provided albumin is administered at a sufficient dose and duration to restore the physiological levels and functions of the circulating molecule, which are at least partially impaired in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Further clinical studies and randomized trials are necessary to confirm the clinical benefits of long-term albumin therapy. Important areas for future research include:

- **Target population**: Determining the precise patient population that would benefit most from this treatment.
- **Biomarkers of response**: Identifying specific biomarkers to predict and monitor treatment response.
- **Optimal dose and frequency**: Establishing the ideal dosage and regularity of albumin infusions.
- **Stopping rules**: Defining criteria for discontinuing treatment.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Evaluating the economic viability of the treatment across different healthcare systems, particularly where periodic intravenous infusions pose logistical challenges and financial constraints.

In this review, we critically analyze the existing data on long-term albumin treatment, concentrating on the differences among studies, contentious issues, and future directions for research and application.

### Human serum albumin, systemic inflammation, and cirrhosis [^112oE5w2]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Human serum albumin (HSA) is among the most common treatments for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. It is primarily indicated for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, prevention of type-1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) associated with bacterial infections, and treatment of type-1 HRS. In these situations, treatment with HSA is linked to improved survival.

Albumin is a stable and flexible molecule with a heart shape, consisting of 585 residues and three domains of similar size, each containing two sub-domains. Many physiological functions of HSA depend on its capability to bind a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands, enhancing their solubility in plasma, transporting them to specific tissues, or facilitating their disposal when toxic.

The chemical structure of albumin can be altered by processes such as oxidation and glycation, leading to rapid clearance and catabolism. A notable feature of HSA is its capacity to bind lipopolysaccharide and other bacterial products (such as lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan), reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, other nitrogen reactive species, and prostaglandins. Binding to nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins is reversible, allowing their transfer to other molecules at different synthesis sites.

Through these functions, HSA modulates the inflammatory reaction. Decompensated cirrhosis is a disease associated with systemic inflammation, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of organ or system dysfunction and failure. Although the beneficial effects of HSA have often been traduced, its impact on systemic inflammation remains an important area of study.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^117X3nQZ]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The survey revealed conceptual differences regarding the mechanism of action of albumin in the management of cirrhosis complications. Some considered the beneficial effect of albumin due to its oncotic properties associated with volume expansion, while others attributed its benefits to nononcotic properties such as antioxidant and scavenging activities, binding and transport of toxins, regulation of endothelial function, modulation of inflammatory and immune responses, and coagulation.

These conceptual differences, along with the possibility of albumin leading to volume overload and respiratory insufficiency, and being solely derived from human sources making it expensive, have rendered its use in cirrhosis controversial and requiring further research. While pharmaceutical agents, particularly expensive or risky ones, have a label defining indications and restrictions, human serum albumin's label indicates it for "restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume, where volume deficiency has been demonstrated and use of colloid is appropriate". This broad and nonspecific label allows the use of albumin for nearly every patient with decompensated cirrhosis and for every cirrhosis complication, even those without evidence of efficacy and lacking formal recommendations from medical societies.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^114m6SAp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction in liver cirrhosis with ascites undergoing large volume paracentesis is a critical concern. Guidance Statement 6 posits that terlipressin could be considered for the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) in cirrhotic patients with ascites undergoing large volume paracentesis (> 5 L).

PPCD is defined as an increase in plasma renin activity of more than 50% from baseline within six days after large volume paracentesis (LVP), where the amount of ascites removed exceeds 5 L in cirrhotic patients with ascites. It is associated with excessive expansion of arterial capillaries after LVP and can lead to rapid re-accumulation of ascites, development of hyponatremia, and renal dysfunction, ultimately increasing mortality.

Human serum albumin is the first-line choice for the prevention of PPCD. LVP should be performed together with the administration of albumin (8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) to prevent PPCD. Several recent studies have also suggested that the use of terlipressin could prevent PPCD. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 40 cirrhotic patients with ascites undergoing LVP, participants were divided into terlipressin (n = 20) and albumin (n = 20) groups. Terlipressin, at a dosage of 1 mg, was administered by intravenous infusion at the beginning of LVP, 8 hours, and 16 hours. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations showed significant improvement 4–6 days after treatment in both the terlipressin and albumin groups, demonstrating similar benefits in preventing PPCD.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^113XBSUk]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Importantly, while serum albumin levels are good biomarkers of outcomes in patients with cirrhosis, they are not good biomarkers of response to albumin therapy. Biomarkers of response to albumin are required in clinical practice and consist of those that will reflect intravascular volume repletion and those that will evaluate the quality of albumin on its capacity to bind toxic metabolites, such as in the Alb-Trial NCT05056220.

In the clinical setting, attention will have to be paid to the logistics of albumin administration, whether it is in the hospital, day clinic, ambulatory services, or in the patient's home, particularly if longer-term use in an outpatient setting is anticipated. The issue of its high cost will need to be redefined, and the development of flexible concentrations per unit or even the use of synthetic albumin or recombinant albumin would be beneficial to the field.

- **Binding capacity and drug transport**: Other qualities of albumin that would need to be further explored include its capacity to bind drugs and transport them to the site of action, even into specific cells. In this setting, albumin would act as a "spacer", allowing the prolongation of circulation times of specific molecules. This is particularly relevant for small molecules that inhibit powerful kinases, such as ROCK (rho-associated protein kinase), that would be transported to their final destination and slowly released from albumin. The same may be true for cancer drugs or other inflammatory diseases.

The field of therapeutics in decompensated cirrhosis has advanced enormously with the goal of preventing or treating further decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: Expert review [^1139h6t9]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, particularly in the context of managing hepatorenal syndrome with pharmacotherapy, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend not using terlipressin in patients with hypoxemia, ongoing coronary, peripheral, or mesenteric ischemia. Caution is advised in patients with grade 3 acute-on-chronic liver failure. It is important to recognize that the benefits may not outweigh the risks in patients with serum creatinine levels greater than 5 mg/dL or those listed for transplantation with a MELD score of 35 or higher.

### Role of albumin in the treatment of decompensated liver cirrhosis [^112YZbG7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Albumin has been used primarily as a plasma expander, as it leads to an increase in circulating blood volume. Recommended indications for albumin therapy in cirrhotic patients include prevention of circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis, prevention of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and management of HRS in combination with vasoconstrictors. New indications for albumin have been tested in recent years and are outlined in this short review.

Recent data show that albumin supports circulation and reduces systemic inflammation. In addition to its oncotic function, it acts as an antioxidant, radical scavenger, and immune modulator. These non-oncotic properties explain why long-term albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis may be useful in the prevention of associated complications such as acute-on-chronic liver failure and infections. Data indicate that long-term albumin therapy in patients with cirrhosis and ascites improves survival, prevents complications, simplifies ascites management, and lowers hospitalization rates. The so-called disease-modifying effects of long-term albumin therapy may favorably influence the course of the disease. Nevertheless, the optimal dosage and administration intervals have not yet been definitively defined.

Albumin therapy is effective in the indications already recommended by guidelines, and there is a possible extension of its indication in non-SBP contexts.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: New concepts and perspectives [^111BivzB]. Gut (2020). High credibility.

Understanding circulatory abnormalities in cirrhosis has led to the development of several therapeutic strategies currently used in clinical practice. These strategies aim to improve or prevent kidney complications and include the blockade of sodium-retaining factors and treatment with vasoconstrictor drugs. Some strategies also involve the intravenous administration of albumin, which aims to improve arterial underfilling. Accepted indications for albumin administration include the prevention of circulatory dysfunction following large-volume paracentesis, prevention of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and management of HRS in conjunction with vasoconstrictor drugs.

Building on this background, the article reviews new concepts on the pathogenesis of cirrhosis progression, focusing particularly on the role of systemic inflammation in the development of cirrhosis complications and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Additionally, the potential role of albumin in preventing disease progression and reducing inflammatory status is explored.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^115J4sRi]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic paracentesis, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend performing diagnostic paracentesis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites in the presence of any of the following conditions:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Bleeding within the digestive tract necessitates immediate diagnostic assessment.

- **Shock**: Hemodynamic instability that could be indicative of severe infection or other complications.

- **Fever or other signs of systemic inflammation**: Indicative of potential infections requiring further investigation.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that suggest potential underlying issues.

- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Neurological impairment related to liver dysfunction warranting further diagnostic evaluation.

- **Worsening liver or renal function**: Deterioration in organ function that could indicate progression of liver disease or complications.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: New concepts and perspectives [^114boUTj]. Gut (2020). High credibility.

In the human Albumin for the Treatment of Ascites in Patients with Hepatic Cirrhosis (ANSWER) study, a non-profit, multicentre, randomised, open-label trial, 431 patients with non-complicated but persisting ascites despite diuretic administration were randomised to receive either standard medical treatment (SMT) or SMT plus albumin (40 g twice a week for 2 weeks and then 40 g/week) for 18 months. A significantly better 18-month overall survival was seen in patients receiving albumin (77%) with respect to those receiving SMT (66%), corresponding to a 38% reduction in the HR for mortality. The multivariable risk analysis for all-cause mortality, considering transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and liver transplantation as competing events, showed that albumin treatment was the sole protective variable.

Long-term albumin use also improved the management of ascites, as the need for paracentesis and the incidence of refractory ascites declined by about 50%. Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of complications of cirrhosis, including SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, episodes of renal dysfunction, as defined by serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dL, HRS 1, and severe hepatic encephalopathy grades III or IV, as well as potential diuretic-induced side effects, such as hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, were reduced by 27%–70% in the albumin group. As a result, patients enrolled in the albumin arm had significantly less liver-related hospitalisations or days spent in hospital, indicating that long-term albumin use proved to be cost-effective.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: New concepts and perspectives [^111DwQq3]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Albumin accounts for approximately 75% of plasma oncotic pressure. A large body of evidence exists for its use as a plasma expander in patients with cirrhosis, but recent data also support other indications. Indeed, albumin exerts several homeostatic functions as a potent scavenger, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory molecule. For example, albumin reversibly binds many molecules, permitting solubilization and transport. This occurs principally at sites I/II but may also occur electrostatically through its negative charge. Therefore, it modulates the activity of many drugs and binds a range of metallic ions, toxic metabolites, and inflammatory mediators potentially affecting systemic inflammation, antioxidant, and endothelial function. In particular, bilirubin, a toxic insoluble metabolite of heme breakdown, is bound and exclusively transported by albumin to hepatocytes for conjugation with glucuronic acid and elimination via the biliary–intestinal system. Moreover, albumin binds bile acids, maintaining their plasma concentration within normal levels and lower than in the portal circulation. In liver cirrhosis, serum bile acid concentrations increase to the levels seen in the splanchnic circulation. In this context, enhanced serum bile acid binding by albumin supplementation may decrease their possible adverse effects. Importantly, albumin possesses about seven binding sites for fatty acids with moderate to high affinity, enhancing the concentration of fatty acids in blood by several orders of magnitude.

### Albumin for bacterial infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis. A randomized, controlled study [^112vrrEt]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with albumin in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prevents renal failure and improves survival. Whether albumin has similar beneficial effects in patients with infections other than SBP is unknown.

- **Methods**: One hundred and ten patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for infections other than SBP were randomly assigned to receive antibiotics plus albumin (1.5 g/kgbw at diagnosis and 1 g/kgbw at day 3) (albumin group; n = 56) or antibiotics alone (control group; n = 54). The primary endpoint was survival at 3 months. Secondary endpoints were effects on renal and circulatory function.

- **Results**: The renal function, as evaluated by differences in changes in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate between the two groups, improved in patients treated with albumin. The circulatory function improved significantly in patients treated with albumin, but not in those from the control group. There was a trend for a lower frequency of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome in the albumin group compared to the control group (1 vs. 4 patients, respectively; p = n.s.). Probability of survival at 3 months was not significantly different among the two groups. However, when adjusted for factors with independent prognostic value, treatment with albumin was an independent predictive factor of survival.

- **Conclusions**: As compared with standard antibiotic therapy alone, treatment with albumin together with antibiotics has beneficial effects on the renal and circulatory function and shows a potential survival benefit. Further studies with…

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^111VQjb4]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

There remains some debate over the use of albumin or artificial plasma expanders for volume expansion. A pooled analysis of 10 studies found that cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis who received albumin were no less likely to develop renal dysfunction than those who received an alternative plasma expander (pooled RR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14).

Further analysis from two other independently conducted systematic reviews is consistent with these findings. Pooled analysis from eight studies showed that cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis who received albumin were no less likely to die than those who received an alternate plasma expander (pooled RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12). This finding is supported by two systematic reviews. However, when all comparators to albumin (including control and vasoconstrictor alone) are pooled (16 RCTs), the RR is 0.77 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00). This translates to 57 to 100 fewer patients per 1000 dying after LVP when HAS is used.

- **Less clinically important outcomes**: Patients treated with HAS versus other plasma expanders show improvement. There is a decreased incidence of post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (defined as a decrease in plasma renin) in patients undergoing LVP treated with albumin compared with an alternative plasma expander in a meta-analysis containing eight RCTs (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.51). Additionally, there is a pooled decrease in hyponatraemia in nine RCTs (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93), both supported in a second independent review.

### Fluids in the ICU: Which is the right one [^1164Rwhh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The effect of albumin on mortality in liver cirrhosis depends on the indication. In contrast to beneficial effects in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, no such benefit has been seen in other infections. In hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis, albumin infusions to raise albumin levels to a target of 35 g/L did not improve outcomes. However, in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock, 5% albumin for volume resuscitation had a beneficial effect on hemodynamics and short-term mortality compared with 0.9% saline. Clear recommendations for albumin are established for large volume ascites paracentesis in hepato-renal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis of patients with advanced liver disease because albumin infusion can reduce the risk of AKI.

Conversely, hypo-oncotic 4% albumin solution can worsen the outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. A landmark study in 2004 showed that 4% albumin for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients produced similar results to 0.9% saline at 28 days, although albumin significantly reduced the total amount of fluid administered (the ratio of saline to albumin was 1.4 for the first four days). Secondary analyses showed an increased risk of mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. In contrast, there was a trend towards lower mortality in septic patients receiving albumin (P = 0.09). This led to the design of a randomized controlled trial in patients with severe sepsis, comparing the replacement of 20% albumin (to maintain plasma levels ≥ 3 g/dL) with crystalloids alone.

### Noradrenaline and albumin in paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhosis: a randomized pilot study [^114o1NDt]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Therapeutic paracentesis in patients with cirrhosis is associated with circulatory dysfunction. Intravenous albumin has been used to prevent this circulatory dysfunction; however, the use of albumin is both controversial and costly. Splanchnic vasodilation is mainly responsible for the circulatory dysfunction in these patients. There are no reports of the use of noradrenaline, a vasoconstrictor, in preventing paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we studied the preventive effect of noradrenaline on paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis after therapeutic paracentesis, comparing it with intravenous albumin in a randomized pilot study.

Forty patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites underwent therapeutic paracentesis with albumin or noradrenaline in a randomized controlled trial at a tertiary center. Effective arterial blood volume was assessed by measuring plasma renin activity at baseline and 6 days after treatment.

Effective arterial blood volume, as indicated by plasma renin activity before and 6 days after paracentesis, did not differ in the two groups (20.62 ± 10.27 to 22.02 ± 10.15 ng mL(-1) h(-1); P = 0.11 in the albumin group and 19.66 ± 8.91 to 20.78 ± 9.41 ng mL(-1) h(-1); P = 0.37 in the noradrenaline group). Plasma aldosterone concentration before and 6 days after paracentesis were also similar in both groups (1196.5 ± 434.2 to 1217.0 ± 405.7 pg mL(-1); P = 0.7 in the albumin group and 1206.0 ± 522.5 to 1273.5 ± 444.8 pg mL(-1); P = 0.22 in the noradrenaline group).

### Randomized trial comparing albumin and saline in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotic patients with ascites [^117B6ugD]. Hepatology (2003). High credibility.

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a recently described complication that can be prevented with the administration of plasma expanders. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of saline versus albumin in the prevention of PICD. Patients were randomized to receive albumin or saline after total paracentesis. Patients readmitted as a consequence of a second episode of tense ascites were treated with total paracentesis and the alternative plasma expander. After randomization, 35 patients received saline and 37 received albumin. Twenty-one patients were readmitted for tense ascites and treated with the alternative expander.

Significant increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) were found 24 hours and 6 days after paracentesis when saline was used (baseline, 5.6 ± 5.7; 24 hours, 7.6 ± 6.9; 6 days, 8.5 ± 8.0 ng x mL(-1). hr(-1); P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 vs. baseline, respectively), whereas no significant changes were observed with albumin. The incidence of PICD was significantly higher in the saline group versus the albumin group (33.3% vs. 11.4%, respectively; p = 0.03). However, no significant differences were found when less than 6 L of ascitic fluid was evacuated (6.7% vs. 5.6% in the saline and albumin groups, respectively; p = 0.9). Similar results were observed when analyzing patients who received 2 consecutive paracentesis (i.e. a significant increase in PRA after saline [P < 0.01] without significant variations after albumin).

In conclusion, albumin is more effective than saline in the prevention of PICD. Saline is a valid alternative to albumin when used appropriately.

### A randomized trial of albumin infusions in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis [^116H5zHc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Infection and increased systemic inflammation cause organ dysfunction and death in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Preclinical studies suggest an anti-inflammatory role for albumin; however, large-scale clinical trials to confirm this are lacking. It remains uncertain whether targeting a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or greater in these patients, using repeated daily infusions of 20% human albumin solution, compared to standard care, would reduce incidences of infection, kidney dysfunction, and death.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial involving hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis who had a serum albumin level of less than 30 g per liter at enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either targeted 20% human albumin solution for up to 14 days or until discharge, whichever came first, or standard care. Treatment commenced within 3 days after admission. The primary composite endpoint was new infection, kidney dysfunction, or death between days 3 and 15 after initiation of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 777 patients underwent randomization, and alcohol was reported as a cause of cirrhosis in most of these patients. A median total infusion of albumin of 200 g (interquartile range, 140 to 280) per patient was administered to the targeted albumin group (increasing the albumin level to ≥ 30 g per liter), compared to a median of 20 g (interquartile range, 0 to 120) per patient administered to the standard-care group (adjusted mean difference, 143 g; 95% confidence interval).

### Comparison of midodrine and albumin in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotic patients: A randomized pilot study [^112S8mSA]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In this pilot study, we compared midodrine and albumin in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD).

PICD with pronounced arterial vasodilatation in cirrhotics with tense ascites can be prevented by the infusion of albumin, which is an expensive treatment modality. Various vasoconstrictors have also been used to prevent PICD, but there are few studies about the usage of midodrine.

Fifty patients with cirrhosis and tense refractory ascites were randomly assigned to be treated with either midodrine (n = 25) (12.5 mg 3 times per day; over 3 days) or albumin (n = 25) (8 g/L of removed ascites) following a large-volume paracentesis. Effective arterial blood volume was assessed indirectly by measuring serum creatinine, serum sodium, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone concentration before and 6 days after paracentesis.

Midodrine therapy was cheaper compared with albumin therapy, but serum creatinine, serum sodium, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration values after treatment [0.99 ± 0.19 to 3.02 ± 2.58 mg/dL (P = 0.001), 132.36 ± 3.2 to 130.2 ± 4.1 mEq/L (P < 0.001), 3.03 ± 0.33 to 4.2 ± 0.76 ng/mL/h (P < 0.001), and 166.72 ± 64.26 to 298.64 ± 130 pg/mL (P < 0.001), respectively] significantly differed in the midodrine group from that in the albumin group [1.10 ± 0.22 to 1.11 ± 0.161 mg/dL (P = 0.885), 132.2 ± 3.524 to 131.88 ± 3.09 mEq/L (P = 0.246), 4 ± 0.91 to 4.11 ± 0.74 ng/mL/h (P = 0.440), and 204.88 ± 115.9 to 177.08 ± 100.5 pg/mL (P < 0.001), respectively]. Seven patients, among whom six were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) positive, in the midodrine group experienced.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^113kfjZX]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Albumin in the prevention of relevant outcomes in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites: The ATTIRE study, which included inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis, hypothesized that albumin infusion would prevent bacterial infection, AKI, and/or death. This was an open-label randomized trial that included 777 patients hospitalized with a decompensating event, mostly new or worsening ascites. Patients were randomized to either standard-of-care (albumin administration for recommended indications: LVP, SBP, AKI, HRS-AKI) or to albumin infusions aimed at maintaining a serum albumin level ≥ 3.0 g/L throughout hospitalization.

The study was negative as it failed to find differences in the composite primary outcome between daily albumin and standard-of-care, with 30% in each group experiencing the primary outcome. Additionally, the experimental group received 10 times the amount of albumin that the standard-of-care group received and consequently had more severe serious adverse events, especially pulmonary edema. Although experimentally, these investigators had shown that albumin could improve immunity by enhancing B-cell function and macrophage-mediated hepatic inflammation, the lack of efficacy of albumin in the ATTIRE trial indicates that in these patients, the severity of disease is more relevant than the experimentally demonstrated potential benefits of albumin.

Importantly, the ATTIRE study demonstrates that targeting albumin administration to reach predefined serum albumin levels is not appropriate for clinical practice and can lead to volume overload.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the international collaboration for transfusion medicine guidelines [^115VYHyv]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Albumin is administered in a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, including complications of cirrhosis, intradialytic hypotension, volume resuscitation, and priming of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Iso-oncotic albumin is often used to maintain intravascular volume in patients with hypovolemia, assuming that crystalloid resuscitation will be ineffective given its shorter intravascular half-life. Hyperoncotic albumin is used to correct low serum albumin levels or to mobilize extravascular fluid.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in acute and chronic illness. Hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia have been described as having greater morbidity compared with patients with preserved albumin levels, promoting the use of IV albumin. In the postoperative period, serum albumin levels decrease precipitously by 10 to 15 g/L. Hypoalbuminemia is thought to be the result of suppressed synthesis by inflammatory cytokines and transcapillary loss. In addition to its use in patients with hypoalbuminemia, edema, or both, albumin is also used for the prevention and treatment of hypovolemia, particularly after administration of large volumes of IV crystalloid solutions.

Practice audits describing the use of albumin show highly variable practice among regions. Albumin is manufactured from large volumes of plasma and is expensive (approximately $130/25 g United States dollars; warehouse acquisition cost of albumin), with the acquisition cost likely a fraction of the total health care expenditure. Albumin can also be associated with adverse consequences, including fluid overload and hypotension.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the international collaboration for transfusion medicine guidelines [^112PX1Z2]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

**Evidence summary**: We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of…

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^112j99iV]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The appearance of ascites in cirrhosis heralds the onset of decompensation; it predisposes the patient to the development of bacterial peritonitis, hyponatremia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) and reduces survival. Abdominal fullness leads to early satiety, reduced caloric intake, and eventual malnutrition, whereas tense ascites predisposes the patient to the development of hernias with their specific complications. Consequently, patients with ascites have a poor quality of life (QoL).

The treatment of ascites refractory to diuretic therapy involves either repeated large-volume paracentesis (LVP) with albumin infusions or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the appropriate patient. The definitive treatment for difficult-to-control ascites with liver dysfunction is liver transplantation. However, patients with ascites and a low Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score have a low priority for liver transplantation. Thus, many patients are dependent on LVP as the only means of managing their ascites, which imposes a significant healthcare burden without improving their long-term QoL.

The automated low-flow ascites pump (alfapump; Sequana Medical NV, Ghent, Belgium) is a subcutaneous, implantable, and rechargeable device that automatically transfers ascitic fluid into the urinary bladder, which is then discharged as urine. The device effectively carries out a continuous low-rate paracentesis for approximately 16 hours per day. With an expected battery life of three years or more, the alfapump can potentially keep patients relatively free from the burdens of frequent large-volume paracentesis and improve their quality of life.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^115tda4N]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the management of ascites, the BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend administering intravenous albumin. For paracentesis involving less than 5 liters of ascites, it is advised to administer a 20% or 25% albumin solution at a dose of 8 g of albumin per liter of ascites removed. This is particularly recommended for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure or those at high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury.

### Understanding the mechanisms of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction [^1164yn8J]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). High credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis induces early beneficial hemodynamic changes that may be shortly followed by a disorder known as paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, characterized by a marked activation of the renin-angiotensin axis. Evidence is accumulating that this disorder is secondary to an accentuation of an already established arteriolar vasodilatation. The causes of this syndrome are probably multiple and may include the dynamics of paracentesis (the rate of ascitic fluid extraction), release of nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, and mechanical modifications due to abdominal decompression. Patients developing this syndrome are prone to a faster reaccumulation of ascites, renal impairment, and shorter survival. Plasma volume expansion after paracentesis reduces the incidence of this disorder. Preliminary evidence suggests that other approaches, such as the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors or modulating the rate of ascitic fluid extraction, could also be effective; however, more studies are needed.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^115cQmtD]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for portal hypertension, particularly for evaluating ascites, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend performing diagnostic paracentesis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites when any of the following conditions are present:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Immediate assessment is necessary.
- **Shock**: Prompt intervention is crucial.
- **Fever or other signs of systemic inflammation**: These symptoms necessitate diagnostic procedures to determine the underlying cause.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such symptoms warrant a closer examination.
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: This condition indicates an advanced stage of liver disease requiring urgent attention.
- **Worsening liver or renal function**: Deterioration in these functions signals the need for further investigation.

### Albumin use in patients with cirrhosis in France: Results of the "ALBU-LIVE" survey: A case for better EASL guidelines diffusion and/or revision [^113aYS3J]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Use of human albumin for the management of cirrhosis has increased. Recommendations have been published for therapeutic paracentesis (TP), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The goal of this survey was to assess the prescription practices of French hepatogastroenterologists.

- **Methods**: All hepatogastroenterologists were contacted. The questionnaire evaluated (1) the use of albumin in validated indications and (2) the prescription of albumin for nonvalidated clinical situations.

- **Results**: Responses were analyzed from 451 (50.1%) practitioners. The mean age was 40 years (range, 24 to 67). Physicians practiced in a university hospital (47.7%) or a general hospital (45.8%). There were 56.7% senior practitioners. Overall, 99.6% of the practitioners compensated for TP. Albumin was used by 87.8% of the physicians, with a fixed dose being used by 84.6%. For SBP, 94% of the physicians used albumin concomitantly with antibiotics. The recommended protocol was followed by 56.2% of the practitioners, more often by senior university hospital practitioners than by senior general hospital practitioners (P = 0.015). About 66.5% used albumin infusion for the diagnosis of HRS, used more often by senior university hospital practitioners (P = 0.0006). Albumin was used concomitantly with vasopressor treatment by 84%; the dose and the duration varied considerably. About 23.5% used albumin for severe bacterial infection, 47.9% for severe hyponatremia, 43.9% for severe hypoalbuminemia, and 65.9% for hydrothorax.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1161qRNC]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically the management of hepatorenal syndrome with pharmacotherapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend the administration of albumin solution (20%) at a dose of 20–40 g/day. It is advisable to obtain serial measurements of central venous pressure or other measures of central blood volume, in addition to routine monitoring, to prevent circulatory overload. This can be achieved by optimizing fluid balance and titrating the albumin dose.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^111W2PAy]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

This raises the question of whether the recommended doses should be lowered. Using the recommended doses in the study by Sort and colleagues, a 75 kg patient would receive 105 g on day 1 and 70 g on day 3. These doses are larger than those recommended after LVP or for AKI and could be even larger with increasing numbers of obese patients with cirrhosis secondary to NASH. It would not be surprising to see an even greater increase in complications due to volume overload in these patients, who are more likely to have cardiovascular disease. As for LVP, a personalized approach to dosing albumin in patients with SBP should be based on daily clinical assessment of volume status and kidney function rather than on a preestablished dose or schedule.

Regarding alternatives to albumin in this setting, the previously mentioned nonblinded randomized study comparing hydroxyethyl starch to albumin in 20 patients with SBP showed albumin to be superior in improving systemic hemodynamics.

Because society guidelines are tied to evidence obtained from RCTs, recommendations are that patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin (1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3) in addition to antibiotics. It is specified that patients with AKI and/or jaundice at the time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. In addition, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in AKI (which involve lower doses of albumin as described below) would also be considered appropriate.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients, and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms.

Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient-important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies.

### Long-term albumin administration in decompensated cirrhosis (ANSWER): an open-label randomised trial [^115Mvv5W]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

The study ANSWER was published in 2018 in the journal *Lancet* and is related to liver cirrhosis and ascites. It addressed the question: What is the effect of long-term human albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis?

- **Study design**:
	- Multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**:
	- 431 patients (135 female, 296 male).
	- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
	- **Key exclusion criteria**: Refractory ascites, recent complications of cirrhosis, TIPS, active HCC, liver transplantation, ongoing alcohol abuse, extrahepatic organ failure, and albumin use for the treatment of ascites.

- **Interventions**:
	- 218 patients received human albumin plus standard medical treatment (40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks and then 40 g weekly plus standard care for up to 18 months).
	- 213 patients received standard medical treatment alone, as indicated by clinical practice guidelines.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- A significant decrease in death at 18 months (23% vs. 34%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.95).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in the cumulative incidence of refractory ascites (0.25 vs. 0.48; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62).
	- Significant decrease in the incidence of first paracentesis (38% vs. 66%; HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.54).
	- Significant decrease in the rate of cumulative incidence of the endpoint need for ≥ 3 paracenteses per month (12% vs. 29%; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.1).

This study demonstrates the efficacy of long-term albumin administration in improving outcomes for patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^116ZYzgu]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, specifically in the management of ascites, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering albumin for plasma volume expansion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis of less than 5 liters of ascites, although the risk of developing post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction is low.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^1119iA4K]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the indication to administer albumin only after 5 L or more of ascites are removed is based on two proof-of-concept small studies that demonstrated a lack of deleterious hemodynamic effects up to 48 hours following a single 5 L paracentesis. One might wonder whether performing daily paracenteses of less than 5 L would negate the need for albumin. The RCT by Gines et al. suggests that this is not the case since patients randomized to daily large-volume paracenteses (LVPs) of 4–6 L who received 40 g of albumin with each paracentesis still had better outcomes than those who did not receive albumin.

As mentioned previously, in the meta-analysis comparing albumin to plasma volume expanders for LVPs less than 5 L, there were no differences in outcomes (mainly post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, PCD) between albumin and plasma volume expanders, indicating that some volume expansion is necessary even with small volumes of ascites removed. It would make rational sense to recommend albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). In fact, a recent study showed that, in patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) per APASL criteria, characterized by jaundice and ascites, paracenteses of less than 5 L were associated with the development of PCD and had a lower survival rate, both of which were improved by the administration of albumin. This is not surprising, as patients with increased systemic inflammation — the hallmark of ACLF — are more vasodilated and are, therefore, more prone to develop PCD. Therefore, in the presence of ACLF (by any definition), albumin administration would be recommended with paracenteses of any volume.

### Can albumin reduce the mortality of patients with cirrhosis and ascites? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112HcBSN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Albumin therapy in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis has always been a controversial issue. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of albumin in reducing mortality and controlling complications in patients with liver cirrhosis and provide a reference for relevant decision-making.

- **Methods**: Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to collect eligible articles published before January 2022, which were analyzed by Revman 5.3.

- **Results**: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials (2040 patients) were included. Based on the meta-analysis results, no significant difference in mortality was shown between the albumin administration group and the control group (HR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97–1.05; P = 0.62). Subgroup analysis showed that albumin administration had no significant short-term or long-term survival benefits in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and increased the risk of pulmonary edema adverse reactions (RR = 3.14; 95% CI, 1.48–6.65; P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis based on albumin administration time showed that short-term (HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76–1.13; P = 0.47) or long-term (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.08; P = 0.58) administration of albumin could not significantly reduce the mortality of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. In contrast, albumin administration could significantly reduce the recurrence rate of ascites (RR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46–0.68; P = 0.000).

- **Conclusion**: Short-term (1 month) administration of albumin cannot significantly reduce the mortality of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.

### The combination of octreotide and midodrine is not superior to albumin in preventing recurrence of ascites after large-volume paracentesis [^113M1oNV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is the treatment of choice for patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. However, LVP can lead to postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), which is associated with faster ascites recurrence and renal failure. PCD results from vasodilatation, which reduces effective blood volume, and is prevented by intravenous administration of albumin. Vasoconstrictors could be used instead of albumin and, with longer use, prevent PCD and delay ascites recurrence.

- **Methods**: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare albumin with the vasoconstrictor combination of octreotide and midodrine in patients with refractory ascites who underwent LVP. Patients in the albumin group received a single intravenous dose of albumin at the time of LVP plus placebos for midodrine and octreotide (n = 13). Patients in the vasoconstrictor group received saline solution (as a placebo for albumin), 10 mg of oral midodrine (3 times/day), and a monthly 20-mg intramuscular injection of long-acting octreotide (n = 12). Patients were followed up until recurrence of ascites.

- **Results**: The median times to recurrence of ascites were 10 days in the albumin group and 8 days in the vasoconstrictor group (P = 0.318). There were no significant differences in PCD between the albumin group (18%) and the vasoconstrictor group (25%, P = 0.574). When ascites recurred, serum levels of creatinine were higher in the vasoconstrictor group (1.2 vs. 0.9 mg/dL in the albumin group; p = 0.051).

### Midodrine versus albumin in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotics: a randomized pilot study [^1122uBmx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). High credibility.

Intravenous albumin has been used to prevent paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) in cirrhotics; however, its use is costly and controversial. Splanchnic arterial vasodilatation is primarily responsible for PICD. There are no reports of the use of midodrine in the prevention of PICD. In this pilot study, we evaluated midodrine and albumin in the prevention of PICD.

Forty patients with cirrhosis underwent therapeutic paracentesis with midodrine or albumin in a randomized controlled trial at a tertiary center. Effective arterial blood volume was assessed by plasma renin activity.

Plasma renin activity at baseline and at six days after paracentesis did not differ in the two groups (43.18 ± 10.73 to 45.90 ± 8.59 ng/mL/h, P = 0.273 in the albumin group and 44.44 ± 8.44 to 41.39 ± 10.21 ng/mL/h, P = 0.115 in the midodrine group). Two patients had an increase in plasma renin activity of more than 50% from baseline in the albumin group, and none in the midodrine group. A significant increase in 24-hour urine volume and urine sodium excretion was noted in the midodrine group. Midodrine therapy was cheaper than albumin therapy.

The study suggests that midodrine may be as effective as albumin in preventing PICD in cirrhotics, but at a fraction of the cost, and can be administered orally. Midodrine also resulted in an increase in 24-hour urine volume and sodium excretion.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: new concepts and perspectives [^113ijocK]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

A better understanding of albumin biology and the contradictory results of the ANSWER and MACHT studies provides the rationale and urgent need to perform further trials of long-term albumin. These trials should better define its potential role in clinical practice by identifying patients who can benefit most from treatment and determining the criteria for selecting dose and frequency of albumin administration as well as its discontinuation. The International PRECIOSA study has started to enroll and will provide the answer to this question (NCT03451292). The ATTIRE study, which explores the role of high-dose albumin administration in patients with acute decompensation (AD), is being performed in the UK and has finished enrolling, randomizing about 800 patients. The results are eagerly awaited.

Further clinical studies attempting to address albumin biology are using albumin in extracorporeal liver assist devices for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) and Prometheus provided proof of concept that such a strategy could be successful but were not found to improve survival; however, MARS reduced the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. A novel device, DIALIVE, aims to remove and replace the damaged albumin while also removing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and performance of DIALIVE in patients with ACLF versus standard care is currently ongoing (NCT03065699).
