## Question

Can an abdominal CT detect pancreatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an abdominal CT can detect pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CT actually visualizes in acute pancreatitis and how diagnostic yield changes over time. Then, I should verify guideline recommendations on when CT is indicated and when it should be avoided. Next, I will examine CT's role in grading severity and detecting complications. After that, I need to confirm how CT fits into the formal diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. I should also consider chronic pancreatitis, where CT has a different role, and compare CT with ultrasound, MRI/MRCP, and EUS as adjuncts or alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize timing, indications, and safety considerations into a clear take-home answer [^1157XcBk] [^112DRa2E].

> Let me first confirm the core capability question: yes, contrast-enhanced abdominal CT (CECT) can detect acute pancreatitis by showing pancreatic and peripancreatic inflammatory changes and by identifying complications, with sensitivity for key features such as necrosis improving with time after symptom onset [^112DRa2E].

> Wait, let me verify a common phrasing that can be misleading: it is often said that CT is "the imaging modality of choice" in acute pancreatitis; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because that does not mean CT should be done immediately at presentation in all comers; rather, guidelines emphasize that early routine CT is low yield and CT is best used selectively or after 72–96 hours in severe or uncertain cases, so I need to correct that initial overstatement and keep the timing and indications front and center [^1157XcBk] [^111f2vmT] [^1138wSCP].

> I will now examine what CT can actually show: pancreatic enlargement, peripancreatic fat stranding, interstitial edema, acute fluid collections, and, on contrast-enhanced scans, nonenhancing parenchyma consistent with necrosis; CT also delineates local complications such as walled-off necrosis, pseudocysts, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, and retroperitoneal gas, and it supports severity grading using the Balthazar CT Severity Index which correlates with morbidity and mortality risk [^112DRa2E] [^116dVuXp] [^114NQTaX].

> I should double-check the crucial timing issue: within the first 48–72 hours, CT may underestimate necrosis because loss of enhancement evolves over several days; sensitivity for necrosis rises substantially by day 4, such that delayed CECT provides a more accurate assessment of extent and complications, which is why guidelines recommend CT at 72–96 hours in severe disease or earlier only if the diagnosis is unclear or complications are suspected [^112DRa2E] [^111f2vmT] [^1138wSCP].

> Hold on, I should verify the impact of early CT on management: multiple studies and guidelines show that routine early cross-sectional imaging rarely changes management in mild, straightforward cases and adds radiation without clinical benefit; early CT within 48 hours led to beneficial changes in only a small fraction of patients with mild AP, and afebrile first-episode patients in the ED seldom have unanticipated findings on early CT, reinforcing a selective approach [^1157XcBk] [^116ZM9Bw] [^1134oknu] [^112juomJ].

> Next, I should review how CT fits into diagnostic criteria: acute pancreatitis is diagnosed when at least two of three are present — typical abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging findings on CT/MRI/US — so CT can be diagnostic when enzymes are equivocal or the presentation is atypical, but it is not required when clinical and laboratory criteria are already met [^111wfzKF] [^113p99NM].

> I need to ensure I align with guideline indications: ACG 2024 advises against routine early CT to determine severity, reserving CT for unclear diagnoses or failure to improve after 48–72 hours; WSES recommends CT/MRI at 72–96 hours in severe acute pancreatitis; Canadian guidance similarly limits CT to broad differentials or suspected local complications and emphasizes ultrasound initially to assess biliary etiology [^1157XcBk] [^111f2vmT] [^1138wSCP] [^111Cgi61].

> Let me think about the initial imaging step: ultrasound is recommended for all patients on admission or early to evaluate for gallstones and biliary obstruction, with repeat ultrasound if the first exam is nondiagnostic; this prioritizes etiologic clarification and avoids unnecessary radiation while reserving CT for when it will change management [^1127rDRD] [^113UkjmJ] [^111f2vmT].

> I will now examine chronic pancreatitis considerations: for CP, CT or MRI is recommended as first-line imaging to identify calcifications, ductal changes, atrophy, and complications, though MRI/MRCP or EUS can be more sensitive for early parenchymal and ductal disease; thus, CT remains valuable but may miss subtle early CP changes [^1133Bmqa] [^1166XDQ4].

> But wait, what if CT is contraindicated or we need better ductal detail? MRI/MRCP is preferred when iodinated contrast cannot be given or when evaluating for ductal disconnection or choledocholithiasis, and EUS complements the workup by detecting occult stones when ultrasound is negative, which can refine etiology and guide interventions without ionizing radiation [^115Mo5in] [^111f2vmT] [^1155SZET].

> I should confirm safety and stewardship concerns: unnecessary early CT contributes to radiation exposure, an important issue particularly in younger patients, and observational pediatric data show substantial overuse of CT without clear indication, underscoring the need for guideline-concordant, selective imaging strategies [^111ufVxZ] [^1134tXdT] [^1157XcBk].

> In synthesis, yes — abdominal CT can detect pancreatitis and is excellent for delineating severity and complications, but I need to emphasize timing and indication: avoid routine early CT in mild, clinically straightforward cases; use ultrasound first for biliary etiology; obtain CT selectively if the diagnosis is uncertain, if the patient fails to improve by 48–72 hours, or when severe disease and complications are suspected, with optimal CT timing at 72–96 hours for severe presentations to accurately define necrosis and guide management [^1157XcBk] [^111f2vmT] [^1138wSCP] [^112DRa2E].

Yes, pancreatitis is **detectable on abdominal CT** [^111wfzKF] — especially with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) [^112DRa2E], which can show pancreatic enlargement, peripancreatic fat stranding, fluid collections, and necrosis [^112DRa2E]. However, **early CT (< 48–72 h) may miss necrosis** [^1128STCb] and is not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient deteriorates [^1157XcBk] [^112juomJ]. CT is most useful after 72–96 hours to assess severity and complications [^1138wSCP], and is preferred when the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected [^1128STCb].

---

## CT findings in acute pancreatitis

CT provides **characteristic findings** that help confirm acute pancreatitis [^116Y8dGT]:

- **Pancreatic enlargement**: Diffuse or focal swelling of the pancreas [^116dVuXp].

- **Peripancreatic fat stranding**: Inflammation of the surrounding fat tissue [^112DRa2E].

- **Fluid collections**: Presence of peripancreatic fluid collections or pseudocysts [^116dVuXp].

- **Pancreatic necrosis**: Non-enhancing areas within the pancreas indicating necrosis [^111DvWc5].

- **Extrapancreatic inflammation**: Inflammation extending beyond the pancreas, which can be quantified using the EPIC score [^1152et87].

---

## Timing of CT imaging

The timing of CT is critical for diagnosing and assessing pancreatitis severity [^111DvWc5]. Early CT (** < 48–72 hours**) may not detect pancreatic necrosis or complications because these findings typically evolve over several days [^1128STCb] [^112juomJ]; therefore, routine early CT is not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient is deteriorating clinically [^1157XcBk]. Optimal timing (**72–96 hours**) after symptom onset [^112DRa2E] provides the most accurate assessment of necrosis and complications, with sensitivity approaching 100% for detecting necrosis [^1138wSCP].

---

## Clinical guidelines for CT imaging in pancreatitis

Several **clinical guidelines** provide clear recommendations on the use of CT in pancreatitis:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2024 | - Avoid routine early CT imaging <br/> - Reserve CT for unclear diagnosis or clinical deterioration [^1157XcBk] |
| World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) 2019 | - Obtain CT when diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected <br/> - Optimal timing is 72–96 hours after symptom onset [^1128STCb] [^1138wSCP] |
| Canadian Journal of Surgery (BPIGS) 2016 | Obtain CT when the differential diagnosis includes pancreatitis or when local complications are suspected [^116X1AVn] |

---

## Limitations and pitfalls of CT imaging

While CT is highly effective in diagnosing pancreatitis, certain pitfalls remain. Early CT can miss pancreatic necrosis or complications, resulting in false-negative studies [^1128STCb] [^113C9tHW]. CT involves **radiation exposure**, which is a particular concern in younger patients or when multiple scans are needed [^113jvDyY]. Iodinated contrast carries risks for patients with renal impairment or contrast allergies [^115Mo5in].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

In certain clinical scenarios, **alternative imaging modalities** may be preferred:

- **Ultrasound**: Recommended as the initial imaging modality to evaluate biliary etiology, particularly in suspected gallstone pancreatitis [^1127rDRD] [^113UkjmJ].

- **MRI**: Preferred in patients with contrast allergies, renal impairment, or when detailed evaluation of the pancreatic duct is required [^1155SZET] [^115Mo5in].

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: Useful in detecting microlithiasis or small gallstones not visible on CT or standard ultrasound [^1155SZET] [^111f2vmT].

---

## Role of CT in chronic pancreatitis

CT also plays a significant role in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis, characterized by pancreatic atrophy, calcifications, and irregularities or strictures of the pancreatic duct. CT or MRI is recommended as **first-line imaging** for chronic pancreatitis [^1133Bmqa] [^1166XDQ4].

---

## Clinical scenarios where CT is particularly useful

CT is **particularly useful** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Severe acute pancreatitis**: To assess the extent of pancreatic necrosis and guide management [^1138wSCP] [^112DRa2E].

- **Suspected complications**: Such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or vascular complications [^116Y8dGT].

- **Unclear diagnosis**: When the clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis is uncertain [^1128STCb] [^1166F3zp].

---

## Conclusion

Pancreatitis can be **detected on abdominal CT**, especially with contrast-enhanced CT. CT is most accurate when performed 72–96 hours after symptom onset [^1138wSCP] and is particularly useful for assessing severity and complications. Early CT is not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient is deteriorating clinically [^1157XcBk]. Alternative imaging modalities, such as ultrasound and MRI, may be preferred in specific clinical scenarios [^1127rDRD].

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from a collaboration of a panel of experts. It contains 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements, such as severity grading, imaging, use of prophylactic antibiotics, and most aspects of the management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, the evidence is quite weak and requires further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

Early CT scans will not show necrotic or ischemic areas and will not modify the clinical management during the first week of the illness. However, when the diagnosis is uncertain, CT should be considered, especially to rule out secondary perforation peritonitis or mesenteric ischemia. It can also show active hemorrhage and thrombosis associated with pancreatitis.

CECT has been shown to yield an early overall detection rate of 90%, with nearly 100% sensitivity after four days for pancreatic necrosis. Balthazar et al. established a CT severity index that grades pancreatitis based on the degree of inflammation, the presence of fluid collections, and the extent of necrosis. A higher score is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

- **CT severity index (Modified from: Balthazar EJ, Robinson DL, Megibow AJ, Ranson JH. Acute pancreatitis: value of CT in establishing prognosis. Radiology. 1990; 174:331–6)**: CT severity index = grade score (0–4) + necrosis score (0–6).

CECT is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis, staging, and detection of complications of acute pancreatitis. It plays major roles in evaluating patients with known or suspected acute pancreatitis, including:

- Diagnosis
- Staging of severity
- Detection of complications, particularly the identification and quantification of (peri)pancreatic necrosis.

However, frequent repeat CT scans increase the total radiation dose and have limited effects on subsequent decision-making. MRI is preferable to CECT in patients with an allergy to iodinated contrast or in patients with renal impairment or insufficiency.

### Diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in chronic pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166XDQ4]. European Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Data was extracted systematically from the included studies by using a structured study record form. The following study design and patient characteristics were extracted: name of the first author, country of origin, year of publication, name of journal, study design, total number of patients included, number of included patients with CP, median or mean age, the proportion of male patients, and the patient inclusion criteria.

Data regarding the imaging characteristics was extracted, including the type of imaging modality, scoring criteria, technical features for each modality, and reported observer experience. Also, data on the reference standard was extracted, such as clinical follow-up, surgery, and histology.

The methodological quality of the included articles was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. The QUADAS-2 tool evaluates the risk of bias in four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow and timing, and the clinical applicability in the first three domains. Signaling questions were used to assist in assessing the risk of bias and applicability. Possible answers were 'yes', 'no', or 'unclear', with 'yes' indicating no risk of bias. In addition, the GRADE scoring system for diagnostic tests was used, which assesses the quality of evidence for each imaging modality. Although the criteria are applicable to diagnostic test accuracy, the methods are less well established compared to interventional studies. Two reviewers independently assessed the QUADAS-2.

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^111ufVxZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis in children is increasing; however, the causes, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic methods, vary across different centers. This study aims to investigate the common causes and routine diagnostic and therapeutic methods of acute pancreatitis in children within a pediatric gastrointestinal referral center and assess their accordance with existing guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 60 children diagnosed with acute pancreatitis were studied.

- **Results**: The most common causes of acute pancreatitis included systemic and metabolic diseases and medications. A CT scan was performed for 36% of patients, although 31% of these cases had no clear indication for it. Only half of the patients received fluid 1.5 times their maintenance in the first 24 hours. Antibiotic therapy was given to 48% of patients; however, medical indications for antibiotic treatment were found in only 34% of cases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative incidence of acute pancreatitis increased.

- **Conclusions**: In children with systemic and metabolic diseases, especially those using anticonvulsant drugs, it is important to consider the incidence of acute pancreatitis. Clinical education should emphasize the risks of radiation due to unnecessary CT scans and the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. More research is needed to study the association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^116cenKo]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

For a diagnostic study to have an impact in clinical practice, the results should be obtained in a representative population and setting. This multicentre study closely mimicked daily practice; a large number of residents and radiological observers, with varying levels of experience, participated. The multicentre setting included university and teaching hospitals. We believe that our results reflect the performance of imaging strategies in daily practice and are relevant to physicians managing patients with acute abdominal pain.

Use of imaging has been widely investigated for the two most common causes of acute abdominal pain — acute appendicitis and diverticulitis. In patients with suspected diverticulitis, imaging is helpful in detecting complications of diverticulitis to assist in therapeutic decisions. For suspected acute appendicitis, extensive use of CT has been shown to reduce rates of negative appendicectomy and lower overall hospital costs by preventing unnecessary admissions and surgical explorations. Although imaging in general showed a positive effect on patients' outcomes in acute appendicitis, the ideal diagnostic strategy for acute appendicitis remains a matter of debate, as imaging might not be necessary for certain presentations.

In unselected patients with acute abdominal pain, studies have shown that the use of diagnostic imaging positively affects the clinical diagnosis and influences decisions on management. Diagnostic laparoscopy has also been shown to be an accurate investigation in patients with acute abdominal pain.

### Integrating CT-based radiomics and clinical features to better predict the prognosis of acute pancreatitis [^116sVzxs]. Insights into Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by a local and systemic acute inflammatory response and histological acinic cell destruction of the pancreas. It is a very frequent acute gastrointestinal disease. Most cases of AP are mild with a self-limiting course; however, approximately 20% of patients develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, sometimes accompanied by necrosis of the pancreatic or peripancreatic tissue or organ failure, resulting in mortality rates ranging from 13% to 40%. The mortality rate of AP is closely associated with its severity. Mild cases typically have a good prognosis and result in discharge within one week, whereas severe cases often involve multiple complications and organ failure, leading to high mortality. Therefore, early evaluation of the prognosis in patients with AP and the improvement of prognosis in those at risk of developing severe AP is crucial.

Laboratory markers are used to indirectly infer the severity and prognosis of AP but are susceptible to interference from concomitant diseases. Computed tomography (CT) has been the most common modality for directly visualizing morphological changes in the pancreas and assessing the condition of patients with AP. Although CT is not performed as a routine diagnostic workup for AP, it is used in unclear cases and/or to detect complications. However, CT might not always identify necrosis in its initial stage or detect small necrotic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on the other hand, can sensitively and non-invasively evaluate the pancreatic duct and biliary tree.

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^116ZM9Bw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

There are roughly 300,000 hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis annually in the United States. Many of the affected patients at our institution undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unnecessarily early during their admissions. We hypothesize that cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of admission in patients meeting the criteria for acute, mild pancreatitis is over-utilized and does not change management.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis from our tertiary care institution from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were a lipase more than three times the upper limit of normal and clinical suspicion of pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, chronic pancreatitis, severe pancreatitis, and when ultrasound findings were the reason for imaging.

- **Results**: Of the 166 patients who met the criteria for analysis, 105 (63.3%) underwent cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of presentation (CT: 104, MRI: 1). Of the examined CTs, 27 (26.0%) showed no abnormality and 55 (52.9%) revealed uncomplicated pancreatitis. The remaining 22 (21.2%) demonstrated at least one of the following: local complications, biliary ductal dilatation, or other findings. On thorough chart review, only two patients received a beneficial change in management as a result of the early imaging.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis supports guidelines that early cross-sectional abdominal imaging may not be beneficial for management changes in cases of suspected acute mild pancreatitis.

### Autoimmune pancreatitis: An update on diagnosis and management [^1145Ne81]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autoimmune pancreatitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is an IgG4 systemic disease characterized by obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain, and acute pancreatitis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of AIP is unknown; however, an autoimmune cause, specifically its association with HLA haplotype, is postulated.

- **Disease course**: The Th1 type of immune response is predominantly involved in the development of AIP, which presents as type 1 and type 2 subtypes with symptoms of obstructive jaundice, acute pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Manifestations of other organ involvement include biliary disease, symptoms of Sjögren's disease (due to salivary gland involvement), lung nodules, interstitial nephritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of mortality increases with an odds ratio of 2.07 (p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.07–3.55) in type 1 AIP.

### Acute pancreatitis: Current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^1155SZET]. Pancreas (2023). Low credibility.

Currently, there are no validated models to predict acute pancreatitis (AP) severity early on, and therapeutic options are limited to supportive care. However, several diagnostic tools exist that attempt to classify patients into subgroups to determine whether admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is probable.

- **Diagnostic tools**: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the preferred imaging technique for determining the extent of pancreatic inflammation and identifying complications such as (peri)pancreatic necrosis stemming from AP. However, the risk associated with repeated radiation exposure limits contrast-enhanced computed tomography as a monitoring tool for AP patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred when minimal radioactive exposure or better evaluation of the pancreatic duct is required. Although imaging evidence of pancreatitis is only one of the three criteria for the diagnosis of AP, these modalities are also helpful in identifying potential complications. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is also used to identify gallstones as a potential AP etiology. Endoscopic ultrasound can be performed to screen for microlithiasis or choledocholithiasis when clinical suspicion is high, but the right upper quadrant ultrasound is negative. Disease severity is determined using either the Revised Atlanta Classification or the Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity. Each of these classification systems was published in the same year, with similar categories for patients based on organ failure. Both classification systems have been compared.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^115m3FZ4]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing in incidence across the world and in all age groups. Major changes in management have occurred in the last decade. Avoiding total parenteral nutrition, prophylactic antibiotics, overly aggressive fluid resuscitation, initiating early feeding, avoiding endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant cholangitis, same-admission cholecystectomy, and minimally invasive approaches to infected necrosis should now be the standard of care. There is increasing recognition of the risk of recurrence of AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis, along with the unexpectedly high risk of diabetes and exocrine insufficiency after AP, which is the subject of large ongoing studies. In this review, we provide an update on important changes in management for this increasingly common disease.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: Management of acute pancreatitis [^116acdrS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), defined as acute inflammation of the pancreas, is one of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract leading to hospital admission in the United States. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that AP is heterogeneous, progressing differently among patients and is often unpredictable. While most patients experience symptoms lasting a few days, almost one-fifth of patients will go on to experience complications, including pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure, at times requiring prolonged hospitalization, intensive care, and radiologic, surgical, and/or endoscopic intervention. Early management is essential to identify and treat patients with AP to prevent complications. Patients with biliary pancreatitis typically will require surgery to prevent recurrent disease and may need early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography if the disease is complicated by cholangitis. Nutrition plays an important role in treating patients with AP. The safety of early refeeding and its importance in preventing complications from AP are addressed. This guideline provides an evidence-based practical approach to the management of patients with AP.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute pancreatitis, specifically with respect to the open abdomen, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend performing early fascial and/or abdominal definitive closure for the management of the open abdomen if all the following criteria are met:

- **Requirements for ongoing resuscitation**: Any requirements have ceased.
- **Source control**: The source control has been definitively reached.
- **Intestinal viability**: No concerns regarding intestinal viability persist.
- **Surgical re-exploration**: No further surgical re-exploration is needed.
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: No concerns for abdominal compartment syndrome exist.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^116RRvWR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal X-rays are neither sensitive nor specific for acute pathology in older adults in the ED. In contrast to ultrasound and CT scan use patterns, over the 2007–2019 time period, X-ray administration decreased for all age groups. Despite this decline, use remains high, particularly in the older adult population where 13% of abdominal pain visits received an X-ray as the sole diagnostic imaging modality in 2019. While NHAMCS does not indicate the anatomical target of X-ray imaging, in this population who presented with abdominal pain, the majority of X-rays are likely abdominal plain films.

Abdominal X-ray is an appropriate imaging modality for confirming gastric tube placement or identifying kidney stones; however, we did not find evidence that these uses contributed meaningfully to the utilization of this imaging technique. We also did not find evidence that emergency general surgery (EGS) diagnoses where X-ray without CT is an appropriate means of diagnosis (e.g. gastrostomy tube confirmation) accounted for relatively high rates of plain film use. This suggests that dissemination of knowledge about this potentially ineffective and relatively high radiation dose abdominal imaging modality may reduce overuse and improve outcomes.

Female patients comprise 55% of overall ED visits nationally, but 67% of abdominal pain visits. This difference was primarily driven by visits from reproductive age women, for whom there is additional diagnostic complexity due to chronic, painful conditions such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, due to pregnancy, and due to acute conditions that can present with pain such as ovarian issues.

### Severe acute pancreatitis: Advances and insights in assessment of severity and management [^1155hkvj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with acute pancreatitis are at risk of developing various complications from ongoing pancreatic inflammation. Often, there is no correlation between the degree of structural damage to the pancreas and the clinical manifestation of the disease. The effectiveness of any treatment is related to the ability to predict severity accurately, but there is no ideal predictive system or biochemical marker. Severity assessment is indispensable for selecting the proper initial treatment in the management of acute pancreatitis. The use of multiparametric criteria and the evaluation of the severity index permit the selection of high-risk patients. Furthermore, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning and contrast-enhanced MRI play important roles in severity assessment. The adoption of multiparametric criteria proposed together with morphological evaluation allows for a discreetly reliable prognosis on the evolution of the disease a few days from onset.

### Radiomic features of the pancreas on CT imaging accurately differentiate functional abdominal pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis, and chronic pancreatitis [^112AoAnX]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with recurrent abdominal pain and pancreatic enzyme elevations may be clinically diagnosed with recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP), even with normal imaging or no imaging at all. Since neither abdominal pain nor enzyme elevations are specific for acute pancreatitis (AP), and patients with RAP often have a normal-appearing pancreas on CT after resolution of an AP episode, RAP diagnosis can be challenging. This study aims to determine if quantitative radiomic features of the pancreas on CT can differentiate patients with functional abdominal pain, RAP, and chronic pancreatitis (CP).

Contrast-enhanced CT abdominal images of adult patients evaluated in a pancreatitis clinic from 2010 to 2018 with the diagnosis of RAP, functional abdominal pain, or CP were retrospectively reviewed. The pancreas was outlined by drawing a region of interest (ROI) on images. Fifty-four radiomic features were extracted from each ROI and were compared between the patient groups. A one-vs-one Isomap and Support Vector Machine (IsoSVM) classifier was trained and tested to classify patients into one of the three diagnostic groups based on their radiomic features.

Among the study's 56 patients, 20 (35.7%) had RAP, 19 (33.9%) had functional abdominal pain, and 17 (30.4%) had CP. On univariate analysis, 11 radiomic features (10 GLCM features and one NGTDM feature) were significantly different between the patient groups. The IsoSVM classifier for the prediction of patient diagnosis had an overall accuracy of 82.1%.

Certain radiomic features on CT imaging can distinguish between these conditions.

### A study of radiological scoring system evaluating extrapancreatic inflammation with conventional radiological and clinical scores in predicting outcomes in acute pancreatitis [^113KnawB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastroenterological emergency with varying severity. Predicting the severity and outcome in AP can guide appropriate triage of patients and direct specialist care for those likely to have severe AP. A number of parameters have been assessed for predicting severity in AP. These include single parameters such as the presence of pleural effusion, obesity, age, serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hematocrit, levels of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. Multivariate scores like Ranson's score, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Bedside Index of Severity in AP (BISAP), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score have also been considered. BISAP is a 5-parameter score that includes blood urea nitrogen, impaired mental status, presence of SIRS, age, and pleural effusion.

The role of computed tomographic (CT) examination in predicting severe AP has been evaluated, with many scores such as the Balthazar grade, CT severity index (CTSI), modified CTSI (MCTSI), extrapancreatic inflammation on CT (EPIC) score, and renal rim sign being assessed. However, comparative data on clinical scoring systems and radiological scores is limited. Furthermore, data comparing CT scores with BISAP is scarce, and it is unclear if CT is necessary for prognostication in AP when an assessment with BISAP has been made on admission.

The prognostic significance of scoring systems like the EPIC score and renal rim grade, which evaluate extrapancreatic inflammation, is also not clear. Moreover, these scoring systems…

### Extrapancreatic inflammation on abdominal computed tomography as an early predictor of disease severity in acute pancreatitis: Evaluation of a new scoring system [^1152et87]. Pancreas (2007). Low credibility.

To introduce a new scoring system based on signs of systemic inflammation on computed tomography (CT) [extrapancreatic inflammation on CT (EPIC) score] and evaluate this score as an early prognostic tool, forty patients with acute pancreatitis who received an abdominal CT within 24 hours after admission were included in the study. The Balthazar score, the CT severity index, and the EPIC score (based on the presence of pleural effusion, ascites, and retroperitoneal fluid collections) were calculated for all patients. The end points were the occurrence of severe acute pancreatitis (local complication or presence of organ failure for more than 48 hours) and in-hospital mortality. This score was evaluated by calculating receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve.

The mean age of the patients was 50 (± 17.7) years, and the Ranson score was 3.3. Fourteen (35%) patients developed severe disease; in-hospital mortality was 15% (6/40). The mean EPIC score was 3.6 (± 2.0). The area under the ROC curve for predicting severe disease and mortality was 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.99) and 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.99) respectively. An EPIC score of 4 or more had a 100% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity for predicting severe pancreatitis. The EPIC score was superior to the Balthazar score and CT severity index in predicting the outcome.

In patients with acute pancreatitis, extrapancreatic inflammation assessed by abdominal CT scan and quantified with the EPIC score allows for the accurate estimation of disease severity.

### The role of emergency department computed tomography in early acute pancreatitis [^113C9tHW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is often ordered for patients in whom the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) has already been established via elevated lipase levels and typical abdominal pain. We investigated whether early CT imaging performed in the ED altered the diagnosis or management.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting to a large academic ED between the years 2013–2015 with AP who received CT imaging. Relevant history, laboratory, imaging data, and hospital course were abstracted from the medical record and analyzed by three independent reviewers, with 100% agreement among reviewers on 30 randomly selected cases. The primary outcome was whether the CT led to a change in diagnosis or management above and beyond the ultrasound. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between predictor variables and outcomes.

- **Results**: The electronic health record query yielded 458 patients. Of those, 174 met the American College of Gastroenterology criteria for AP and were included in the study. Among these, 145 patients (83%) had abdominal CT during their hospital course, 125 (86%) of which were performed in the ED. Of these 145 patients, 57 (39%) had imaging evidence of AP. A total of 107 patients had abdominal ultrasound (US) during their hospital course. Of 84 patients who had both CT and US, 31 (37%) were diagnosed with gallstones by US versus 19 (23%) by CT. Biliary dilation/obstruction was diagnosed by US in 5 (6%) patients versus 4 (5%) by CT. CT led to the correct diagnosis or change in management in 21 (14%).

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^1134oknu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

There are roughly 300,000 hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis annually in the United States. Many of the affected patients at our institution undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unnecessarily early during their admissions. We hypothesize that cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of admission in patients meeting the criteria for acute mild pancreatitis is over-utilized and does not change management.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis from our tertiary care institution from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were a lipase more than three times the upper limit of normal and clinical suspicion of pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were an etiology of pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, chronic pancreatitis, severe pancreatitis, and ultrasound findings being the reason for imaging.

- **Results**: Of the 166 patients who met the criteria for analysis, 105 (63.3%) underwent cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of presentation (CT: 104, MRI: 1). Of the examined CTs, 27 (26.0%) showed no abnormality and 55 (52.9%) revealed uncomplicated pancreatitis. The remaining 22 (21.2%) demonstrated at least one of the following: local complications, biliary ductal dilatation, or other findings. On thorough chart review, only two patients received a beneficial change in management as a result of the early imaging.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis supports guidelines that early cross-sectional abdominal imaging is generally unnecessary in cases of suspected acute mild pancreatitis.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111svvmD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Unlike CT scans, hepatobiliary ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation. It represents a potentially effective diagnostic modality for upper abdominal pain or other symptoms suggesting a hepatobiliary origin. In contrast to either modality, abdominal X-rays are poorly sensitive and poorly specific for clinically significant disease and are potentially misleading.

Prior literature has demonstrated that the utilization of imaging modalities increased as they have become more available. The rate of abdominal CT scans for all indications increased 17.5-fold from 1990 to 2009. Additionally, abdominal pain grew to become the leading chief complaint among those who underwent a CT scan in United States EDs from 1995 to 2007. The probability of obtaining a specific diagnosis via CT scan increases with age, yet for older adults with abdominal pain, nearly one in six ED visits has been shown to receive an X-ray without ultrasound or CT, a potentially ineffective test in older adults, and this occurs more often for older women. Little evidence is available from the past decade to understand whether the rapid initial growth of these modalities used to assess abdominal pain has continued, whether changes in utilization are differential across age groups, and whether increased imaging rates have resulted in greater rates of clinically significant diagnoses.

We hypothesized at the time of writing that a continuous increase in CT and ultrasound imaging modalities and a decrease in X-ray use occurred from 2007 to 2019. To test these hypotheses, we used nationally representative ED data to describe trends.

### Pancreatic CT perfusion: Quantitative meta-analysis of disease discrimination, protocol development, and effect of CT parameters [^113dnS3m]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Search strategy**: We explored the PubMed library, searching the database for published studies using the key terms 'pancreas' or 'pancreatic', 'dynamic' or 'perfusion', and 'computed tomography' or 'CT'. All CT perfusion research studies published and indexed before July 3, 2020, were collected. A total of 491 research articles published from 1982 to 2020 were obtained from the search. In the first step, these research articles were scanned manually based on their titles and abstracts for inclusion or exclusion. In the second step, all suitable studies were read and assessed independently by two authors (N.V. and S.S.). Disagreements regarding study inclusion or exclusion were resolved by consensus-based discussions in two cases.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: We included studies that (1) reported original data, (2) included original human data, (3) included at least five or more datasets, (4) included measurements of the pancreas or pancreatic pathologies, and (5) reported quantitative perfusion parameters from perfusion CT. All study designs, both prospective and retrospective, were included. Studies that had a cohort overlapping with previously published studies were not considered original data and were excluded. Articles reporting different perfusion measurements for the same patient collective were counted as one study since patient data were acquired only once. Reviews, animal studies, or case reports (less than five patients) were excluded. To distinguish perfusion CT from conventional contrast-enhanced CT studies, only studies that reported quantitative perfusion parameters were included.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery. Journal Canadien de Chirurgie (2016). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.

### Evaluation of unusual causes of pancreatitis: Role of cross-sectional imaging [^116FyHWf]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

There are widely diverse causes of pancreatitis. Gallstones and alcohol have been recognized as the most common causes of pancreatitis, accounting for 90% of cases. However, acute and chronic pancreatitis may also result from a variety of uncommon causes. The determination of the etiology is important for patient management and prevention of recurrence. Sludge is the most common cause of idiopathic or acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasonography is considered the most accurate diagnostic test for this abnormality. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have only a limited role in the diagnosis of sludge. However, papillitis observed on contrast-enhanced CT and MR may provide clues to the detection of pancreatitis secondary to sludge, a small stone, or a recently passed stone. Radiological studies, clinical presentation, and laboratory data can be helpful in determining the etiology of unusual causes of pancreatitis, such as anatomic anomalies, autoimmune pancreatitis, groove pancreatitis, and traumatic pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis: The role of imaging and interventional radiology [^113RfjuX]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis can manifest as a benign condition with minimal abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia. However, it can also have a fulminant course, which may be life-threatening, typically due to the development of infected pancreatic necrosis and multisystem organ failure. Fortunately, 70–80% of patients with acute pancreatitis experience a benign, self-limiting course (figs. 1, 2, 4). The initial 24–48 hours following diagnosis usually determine the subsequent course. For many of the 20–30% of patients who eventually experience a fulminant course, this becomes apparent within this period.

Regarding long-term outcomes, most cases recover without lasting sequelae, with only a minority progressing to chronic pancreatitis. During the initial management of acute pancreatitis, evaluating metabolic disturbances and systemic organ dysfunction is critical. Over the past two decades, the advent and refinement of cross-sectional imaging modalities have led to a significant role for diagnostic imaging in assessing acute pancreatitis. These imaging modalities have also enabled the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventional techniques performed by radiologists.

In this article, we review the diagnostic features of acute pancreatitis, clinical staging systems, potential complications, and the role of imaging. Discussion will also cover interventional radiology techniques in the management of acute pancreatitis and potential complications associated with these treatments.

### Acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic impact of immediate CT scanning [^113uX89N]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common diagnostic problem. This study aimed to evaluate the routine use of contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning early in the diagnostic process.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on 2,222 patients with acute abdominal pain who underwent contrast-enhanced CT scanning within 24 hours after admission. The diagnoses obtained were compared with the final diagnoses after one month.

- **Results**: After CT scanning, the following diagnoses were suggested as the primary cause of abdominal pain: nonspecific abdominal pain in 984 patients (44.3%), appendicitis in 354 patients (15.9%), bowel obstruction in 190 patients (8.6%), diverticulitis in 182 patients (8.2%), gastrointestinal perforation in 52 patients (2.3%), gallstone disease in 64 patients (2.9%), pancreatitis in 72 patients (3.2%), inflammatory bowel disease in 13 patients (0.6%), intra-abdominal malignancy in 34 patients (1.5%), vascular disease (including one patient completely cured of paradoxical embolization in the superior mesenteric artery) in 33 patients (1.5%), urological causes in 131 patients (5.9%), gynecological issues in 54 patients (2.4%), and miscellaneous causes in 31 patients (1.4%). In 28 cases, a conclusive CT examination could not be carried out. The suggested diagnoses were correct in 2,151 cases (96.8%), while an incorrect diagnosis was reported in 16 cases (0.7%), leading to 7 unnecessary laparotomies. False negative reports were obtained in 27 cases (1.2%). Following CT examination, 500 patients could be discharged immediately.

- **Conclusions**: Contrast-enhanced CT scanning results in superior diagnostic precision in patients with acute abdominal pain. This study supports the strategy to include this examination early in routine diagnosis.

### Approach to patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis: A comprehensive review [^1176W8zV]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) represents a significant health care burden in the United States. Diagnosing it early and accurately is important for the efficient management of these patients. However, the early diagnosis of CP, when structural and functional pancreatic changes are subtle, remains difficult. Complicating this is the large cohort of patients with nonspecific abdominal pain who are often suspected of having early CP and who utilize significant health care resources in attempts at diagnosis and management. We present a review of the diagnostic tests available for making an early diagnosis of CP. We further report our approach to patients suspected of having CP based on the available literature.

### Does early ED CT scanning of afebrile patients with first episodes of acute pancreatitis ever change management [^112juomJ]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Rising utilization of computed tomography (CT) imaging early in the course of acute pancreatitis (AP) has been recently reported. However, radiographic demonstration of the degree of necrosis or the presence of complications is not fully apparent within the first days of an acute attack. The objective of this study was to examine if CT scanning early in the course of the disease (< 48 h of symptoms) in afebrile patients with an emergency department (ED) diagnosis of a first episode of AP revealed any unanticipated pathology that altered clinical management.

A retrospective chart review of all adult patients with a first episode of AP without fever admitted to the medical ward through the ED of our community hospital from January 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012, was performed. In cases in which CT scans were performed, the record was reviewed to determine if any unexpected findings were uncovered or if patient care was altered by the CT report. Two hundred forty-eight patients were admitted with an ED diagnosis of AP; 26.2% (n = 65) met inclusion criteria; 70.8% (n = 46) received a CT scan within 48 h of symptom onset. No patient that underwent CT scanning had an unexpected finding (95% CI, 0.923–1.0).

Our results demonstrate that afebrile patients with first episodes of AP do not benefit from early abdominal CT imaging. These results support the ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommendation that CT is not indicated in the first 48 h after symptom onset in unequivocal cases of AP.

### Imaging of blunt pancreatic trauma [^115KucWH]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Blunt pancreatic trauma is an exceedingly rare but life-threatening injury with significant mortality. Computed tomography (CT) is commonly employed as the initial imaging modality in blunt trauma patients and provides a timely diagnosis of pancreatic trauma. The CT findings of pancreatic trauma can be broadly categorized as direct signs, such as a pancreatic laceration, which tend to be specific but lack sensitivity, and indirect signs, such as peripancreatic fluid, which tend to be sensitive but lack specificity. In patients with equivocal CT findings or ongoing clinical suspicion of pancreatic trauma, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be employed for further evaluation. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is of crucial importance, and though injury of the duct may be strongly suggested upon initial CT, MRCP provides clear delineation of the duct and any potential injuries. This article aims to review and illustrate the CT and magnetic resonance imaging findings of blunt pancreatic trauma and delineate the integration of these modalities into the appropriate imaging triage of severely injured blunt trauma patients.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the ED, all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by either the attending radiologist or the radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To ensure a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was evaluated only after finalizing the ultrasound part of the case record form.

CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for the comparative study to ensure that all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist, unlike ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours. To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers recorded the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed, categorized as less than 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, or 1,000–5,000.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation and management of acute pancreatitis: A review of current practices and future directions [^115Mo5in]. Clinical Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a condition marked by inflammation of the pancreas and surrounding tissues. While the majority of cases are mild, severe cases significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Retroperitoneal morphologic changes can be detected using various imaging modalities, and their accurate evaluation is crucial for effective management.

Acute pancreatitis is commonly diagnosed using computed tomography (CT). However, there are clinical scenarios where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be superior. Specifically, MRI is beneficial when patients cannot receive iodinated CT contrast or when investigating the underlying cause of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, MRI can evaluate ductal disconnection and guide interventions for necrotic collections. The unique features of MRI, such as superior contrast resolution and the ability to offer greater functional information through techniques like diffusion-weighted imaging, are particularly useful.

This review aims to discuss the MRI assessment of individuals with acute pancreatitis and introduces recent advances in MRI for the evaluation of acute pancreatitis.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^117NqHXs]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Computed tomography was performed using different types of CT scanners in the participating centers, ranging from 4- to 16-slice or more CTs. All patients received intravenous contrast medium, with no oral or rectal contrast agents used. In 16 patients (1.6%), an unenhanced CT was performed due to known renal failure (n = 14) or a previous reaction to contrast agents (n = 2).

The CT was evaluated in the same standardized way as the ultrasound examinations. General image findings and specific radiological features assessed for CT included image quality, fat infiltration, free fluid, abscess, free intraperitoneal air, and fistulas, which were recorded on a digital case record form. Image assessment per organ included the gallbladder, bile duct, liver, pancreas, appendix, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, vascular system, kidneys, and, if appropriate, female genitalia. If no abnormalities were recorded, further specification was not required. However, if abnormalities were observed, further specification was warranted, and a CT diagnosis was recorded. Comparable to ultrasound, no specific set of criteria was provided per diagnosis to assist observers in assigning their diagnosis.

After six months, a final diagnosis was assigned by an independent expert panel consisting of two experienced gastrointestinal surgeons and an experienced abdominal radiologist.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^116vydwn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) in this patient is straightforward, as he presents with characteristic abdominal pain and a markedly elevated lipase level. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not necessary for this patient, as it will not assist in diagnosis nor be useful in predicting severity, especially considering that most patients (80%) will improve. CT scans should be reserved for patients with atypical symptoms and/or mild elevations of amylase/lipase levels, which could be nonspecific.

The etiology of AP in this patient remains unclear. Identifying the cause is important for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol consumption are the most common causes of AP. Although ultrasound (US) is indicated as an initial evaluation of AP, a negative examination does not rule out a biliary etiology. A stone in the gallbladder may have passed to the common bile duct and been missed by the US, whether it has or has not moved to the duodenum. Despite a potentially negative initial US, given the prevalence of biliary pancreatitis, the exam should be repeated on an outpatient basis if no other etiology is found.

Alcohol consumption is a common cause of AP, requiring a relatively large amount (50 grams) over multiple years to induce pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? It is not likely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride level is lower than 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be necessary. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor.

### Diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in chronic pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146cYp3]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a disabling inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by severe or continuous abdominal pain and considerable impact on quality of life. Patients with CP usually develop endocrine and exocrine insufficiency during the course of the disease as a result of the progressive loss of pancreatic parenchyma.

There is a lack of international consensus regarding the initial diagnosis of CP, particularly in its early stages. The diagnosis is often made by a combination of clinical symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, malabsorption, diabetes mellitus), pancreatic function tests (e.g. fecal elastase-1), and morphological abnormalities seen on imaging (e.g. calcifications, ductal lesions, pseudocysts). Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with CP. The most frequently used imaging modalities for CP are endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (US).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the initial diagnostic assessment of CP.

### Can early endoscopic ultrasound predict pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^117HCbVF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a complex acute inflammatory disorder of the pancreas and surrounding tissues that is usually mild in the majority of patients. However, the clinical course of this disease is highly variable, and in up to 20% of patients, the attack may be severe, leading to various local and systemic complications, prolonged hospital stays, and significant morbidity and mortality. The factors determining the severity of AP have not been completely understood, making it challenging to predict the clinical course of patients with AP.

Pancreatic necrosis (PN) develops in up to 15% of patients with AP. Patients with PN have markedly increased morbidity and mortality compared to those with non-necrotizing interstitial pancreatitis. Most patients who develop organ failure and life-threatening complications of AP have necrotizing pancreatitis. Early and accurate detection of PN can mitigate increased morbidity and mortality in this subgroup of patients, allowing for the timely institution of appropriate preventative measures such as fluid resuscitation and intensive care monitoring. PN is currently detected by the loss of vascular enhancement on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. However, the signs of PN on cross-sectional imaging evolve over several days, and its full extent may not be completely apparent on a contrast-enhanced CT for up to 3 days after disease onset. Therefore, an early CT may not detect PN accurately.

### Imaging and percutaneous management of acute complicated pancreatitis [^115afvbs]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis varies from a mild, self-limited disease to one with significant morbidity and mortality in its most severe forms. While clinical criteria abound, imaging has become indispensable to diagnose the extent of the disease and its complications, as well as to guide and monitor therapy. Percutaneous interventional techniques offer options that can be life-saving, surgery-sparing, or important adjuncts to operation. Close cooperation and communication between the surgeon, gastroenterologist, and interventional radiologist enhance the likelihood of successful patient care.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^113jvDyY]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), approximately 10% have complaints of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. Formerly, these patients were thought to have an acute abdomen, and surgery was indicated. Nowadays, patients with acute abdominal pain, even if accompanied by abdominal tenderness and rigidity, will not all undergo surgery, while others without abdominal rigidity may be operated on.

Diagnostic imaging is widely used in the work-up of patients with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are both frequently used in addition to clinical and laboratory evaluations. The American College of Radiology suggests an abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast medium for patients with acute abdominal pain. Others are in favor of ultrasound as the primary imaging technique, mainly because ultrasound is easily accessible and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation exposure at CT is associated with the risk of radiation-induced cancer. This is a drawback of CT, especially as CT is increasingly used in the diagnostic work-up of young patients. This may prompt the evaluation of alternative imaging strategies, such as ultrasound and MRI. However, diagnoses should not be missed or delayed, and thus the most accurate imaging technique should be used.

A previous evaluation of diagnostic strategies for unselected patients with acute abdominal pain favored a conditional CT strategy for the detection of urgent conditions, with ultrasound first as an initial step.

### CT of blunt pancreatic trauma: a pictorial essay [^11166fDc]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Blunt trauma to the pancreas is uncommon, and clinical features are often non-specific and unreliable, leading to possible delays in diagnosis and, therefore, increased morbidity. CT has been established as the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing abdominal solid-organ injury in blunt trauma patients. The introduction of multidetector-row CT allows for high-resolution scans and multiplanar reformations that improve diagnosis. Detection of pancreatic injuries on CT requires knowledge of the subtle changes produced by pancreatic injury. The CT appearance of pancreatic injury ranges from a normal initial appearance of the pancreas to active pancreatic bleeding. Knowledge of CT signs of pancreatic trauma and a high index of suspicion are required in diagnosing pancreatic injury.

### Acute pancreatitis: Value of CT in establishing prognosis [^116dVuXp]. Radiology (1990). High credibility.

The CT Severity Index (CTSI) for acute pancreatitis is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis in patients. It is based on computed tomography (CT) findings and is used to predict the clinical outcome of the disease. The CTSI is particularly useful in stratifying patients into different risk categories, which can guide management and treatment decisions. It takes into account factors such as the presence and extent of pancreatic inflammation, pancreatic necrosis, and extrapancreatic complications. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that the CTSI is most useful in the setting of acute pancreatitis and may not be as relevant in chronic pancreatitis or other pancreatic diseases.

The CT severity index for acute pancreatitis is a tool used to assess the condition's severity by examining two key inputs: the findings on a CT scan and the extent of pancreatic necrosis. These factors are each assigned specific scores that contribute to an overall severity score.

- **CT findings are categorized and scored as follows**:
	- Normal pancreas: 0 points
	- Focal or diffuse pancreatic enlargement: 1 point
	- Pancreatic inflammation and/or peripancreatic fat: 2 points
	- Single peripancreatic fluid collection: 3 points
	- Two or more fluid collections and/or presence of retroperitoneal air: 4 points

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^111f2vmT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

On admission, ultrasound (US) should be performed to determine the etiology of acute pancreatitis, such as biliary causes (1C). When doubt exists, computed tomography (CT) provides good evidence of the presence or absence of pancreatitis (1C). All patients with severe acute pancreatitis need to be assessed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The optimal timing for the first CE-CT assessment is 72–96 hours after the onset of symptoms (1C). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound should be considered to screen for occult common bile duct stones in patients with an unknown etiology (1C).

On admission, the etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) should be determined to project the need for definitive treatment, such as gallstone disease, and to avoid recurrence from factors like alcohol intake or hypertriglyceridemia. The treatment and follow-up depend on the etiology of AP. A transabdominal ultrasound should be performed on admission to facilitate procedures such as cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis when appropriate. Almost all AP guidelines worldwide, based on revisions and meta-analyses, recommend performing ultrasound on admission or within the first 48 hours.

In the majority of patients with AP, CT is not required. The extension of the (peri)pancreatic necrosis may be detected with a contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) after 72 hours from the onset of AP. Concerns have been raised over post-contrast acute kidney injury (AKI). A recent meta-analysis with 28 observational studies and over 100,000 participants found no evidence to support the association of acute kidney injury with the use of contrast in these situations.

### Duodeno-pancreatic and extrahepatic biliary tree trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1136bcKD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pancreatic trauma, the AAST/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering a repeated CT within 12–24 hours from the initial injury in hemodynamically stable patients. This applies particularly to those with a high clinical suspicion of duodeno-pancreatic injury or pancreatic ductal injury with negative or non-specific CT findings on admission imaging, as well as patients with elevated amylase and lipase levels or persistent abdominal pain.

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^112vR1JD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The size of the patient cohort is a strength of this study. Our inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded a population that has not been explicitly evaluated in prior literature on this topic. Weaknesses of this study include its retrospective nature and the fact that follow-up was not examined for these patients. It is also difficult to know for certain if these patients actually did have a prior episode of pancreatitis not reported to the treating physician. Associated medical comorbidities and their effects were not recorded, though our mortality rate was similar to that in other populations. It is important to note that our population was largely African-American, and that our study took place in a teaching center.

- **What is already known**: Acute pancreatitis is a significant contributor to healthcare utilization. Currently accepted guidelines recommend cross-sectional imaging only in certain situations for patients with acute pancreatitis.

- **What the new findings are**: For patients with mild acute pancreatitis, many decisions to obtain cross-sectional imaging do not follow guidelines. Cross-sectional imaging performed against the recommendations of guidelines rarely contributes useful information. Renewed emphasis on guideline-based care for those with mild acute pancreatitis may reduce costs and the harmful effects of excess imaging.

This single-center trial demonstrates that early and repeated cross-sectional imaging is frequently performed in patients who present with acute, mild pancreatitis, but very rarely does this strategy lead to information that would n

### Clinical course for pancreatic necrosis and pancreatic pseudocysts due to severe acute or chronic pancreatitis [^114NQTaX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis is a potentially serious inflammatory disease that can lead to multiple organ failure. It is divided into acute and chronic forms. Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be classified into three distinct categories: mild, moderate, and severe forms. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a pathologic fibro-inflammatory syndrome of the pancreas that develops persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. Common features of established and advanced CP include pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, and dysplasia. AP is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders requiring acute hospitalization worldwide, with a reported increasing annual incidence of 13–45 cases per 100,000 persons, whereas CP ranges from 5 to 12 cases per 100,000 persons. Local complications are peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (sometimes infected), and formation of pseudocysts and walled-off necrosis (WON).

AP is diagnosed when at least two of the following three criteria are met: (i) upper abdominal pain (typically radiating belt-like to both sides, excluding pain from other conditions); (ii) an increased level of serum lipase exceeding threefold the upper limit of normal; (iii) typical findings in sectional image studies, such as transabdominal sonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggestive of AP. Definitive CP can be diagnosed by imaging criteria (CT, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound).

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: Do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^1134tXdT]? BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis in children is increasing, but causes and diagnostic and therapeutic methods vary in different centers. The aim of this study was to investigate the common causes and routine diagnostic and therapeutic methods of acute pancreatitis in children in a pediatric gastrointestinal referral center and their accordance with existing guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 60 children with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were studied.

- **Results**: The most common causes of acute pancreatitis were systemic and metabolic diseases and medications. A CT scan was performed for 36% of patients; however, 31% of those patients had no clear indication for the scan. Only half of the patients received fluid at 1.5 times their maintenance levels in the first 24 hours. Antibiotic therapy was administered to 48% of patients, but medical indications for such treatment were found in only 34% of cases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative incidence of acute pancreatitis increased.

- **Conclusions**: In children with systemic and metabolic diseases and those using anticonvulsant drugs, it is important to consider the incidence of this disease. In clinical education, the risks of radiation from unnecessary CT scans and the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics need to be emphasized. More research should be conducted to study the association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis.

### The role of diagnostic radiology in pancreatitis [^116BfRJR]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a frequent inflammatory and necrotic process of the pancreas and peripancreatic field. Detecting the presence of infected or sterile necrotic components and hemorrhage of the pancreatic parenchyma is important for therapeutic approaches. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by irreversible exocrine dysfunction, progressive loss of pancreatic tissue, and morphological changes of the pancreatic canal. Imaging modalities play a primary role in the management of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. CT and MR imaging confirm the diagnosis and detect the severity of the disease. In chronic pancreatitis, MRCP after Secretin administration, spiral CT, and endoscopic US seem to replace diagnostic ERCP. However, differentiation of pseudotumor of chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma is difficult with either imaging modality.

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^117PXGjG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is responsible for approximately 330,000 emergency department visits and 240,000 hospital admissions in the United States annually, and its incidence continues to rise worldwide. Though the overwhelming majority (80%) of patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis have mild, self-limited disease, this condition accounts for $2.5 billion of annual U.S. healthcare expenditure.

National guidelines strongly recommend diagnosing acute pancreatitis based on the presence of two of the following three criteria: abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic findings on abdominal imaging. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear, those who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission, or those needing evaluation for complications. Since approximately 40% of acute pancreatitis cases are related to gallstone disease, transabdominal ultrasound is recommended for all patients with the condition. Alcohol consumption (30%) is the next most prevalent cause of pancreatitis, while all other etiologies — such as hypertriglyceridemia, drug-related, and autoimmune disease — account for 5% of cases or less.

Some of the reasons for recommending against the routine use of early cross-sectional imaging are its lack of meaningful contribution to immediate care or prognosis and its inaccuracy in detecting certain conditions.

### Imaging of acute pancreatitis and its complications [^116Y8dGT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute pancreatitis may present with mild or severe disease, with the latter comprising a minority of cases but accounting for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the mainstay of imaging for patients with acute pancreatitis and is widely used in both community and academic settings. A variety of retroperitoneal morphologic changes are readily depicted, and the correct assessment of these abnormalities is imperative for management.

The purpose of this review is to describe the imaging evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis using the 1992 Atlanta Symposium classification and definitions to describe local complications depicted on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Correlation with the proposed revision of Atlanta Symposium definitions set forth by the Acute Pancreatitis Working Group will be discussed.
