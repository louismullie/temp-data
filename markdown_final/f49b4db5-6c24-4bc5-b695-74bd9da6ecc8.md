## Question

is there a contraindication for thrombocytopenia and eliquis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thrombocytopenia is a contraindication to apixaban (Eliquis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled contraindications for apixaban. Then, I should verify how thrombocytopenia is handled in major clinical trials and guidelines. Next, I will stratify by platelet count ranges and clinical scenarios, including HIT, cancer-associated thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused approach and confirm any exceptions or caveats that could change management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA label lists only two absolute contraindications: active pathological bleeding and severe hypersensitivity to apixaban; thrombocytopenia itself is not listed as a contraindication, which means there is no regulatory prohibition against using apixaban solely on the basis of low platelets [^115tX6YM].

> Wait, let me verify how trials operationalized platelet thresholds. In AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT, patients with platelet counts less than 100,000/mm³ were excluded, which signals caution rather than a labeled contraindication; this exclusion was a trial design choice to mitigate bleeding risk, not a formal labeling rule, so it cannot be equated with a contraindication in practice [^115GtXFU] [^1113z9jn].

> I need to check guideline positions next. The American Society of Hematology HIT guideline explicitly allows DOACs, including apixaban, as non-heparin anticoagulant options in acute HIT, and it recommends applying the same contraindications used for VTE treatment when choosing a DOAC in HIT, which again does not make thrombocytopenia a standalone contraindication; rather, it emphasizes individualized bleeding risk assessment and agent selection [^117KQXA5] [^114LYDyU] [^111Gj2X3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how different platelet levels are handled clinically. For severe thrombocytopenia, many expert sources treat platelet counts below roughly 25,000–50,000/µL as a relative or practical contraindication to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation due to bleeding risk, with LMWH preferred and dose modifications considered if anticoagulation is still indicated; this is especially emphasized in cancer-associated thrombosis and in consensus statements for thromboprophylaxis, where thresholds around 50,000/µL often guide decisions to use full-dose, reduced-dose, or hold therapy [^1179RFXw] [^114zdX58] [^115S8MKR].

> Let me consider the HIT scenario specifically, because thrombocytopenia is intrinsic to the disease. In acute HIT, guidelines recommend stopping heparin and starting a non-heparin anticoagulant, and apixaban is an accepted oral option; typical dosing is 5 mg twice daily for isolated HIT and 10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily when HIT is complicated by thrombosis, with treatment continued until platelet recovery, which operationalizes safe use despite thrombocytopenia when clinically indicated [^113twkQs] [^116qbEBy] [^111Gj2X3].

> I should double-check cancer-associated thrombocytopenia guidance. Contemporary oncology and thrombosis guidelines advise that therapeutic anticoagulation is generally avoided when platelets are below about 25,000/µL, considered case-by-case between 25,000 and 50,000/µL often with LMWH dose reduction, and feasible above 50,000/µL if bleeding risk is acceptable; DOACs can be used in selected patients, but data in severe thrombocytopenia are limited, so LMWH remains preferred in many such settings [^1179RFXw] [^111up6iu] [^114zdX58].

> But wait, what if the indication is atrial fibrillation rather than VTE or HIT. Observational AF cohorts show that thrombocytopenia is common and associated with higher bleeding risk, yet many patients still derive net clinical benefit from anticoagulation; decisions should weigh stroke risk against bleeding risk, and while severe thrombocytopenia often leads to deferral or use of reduced-intensity strategies, this is not a label-defined absolute contraindication to apixaban [^1118E8sd] [^111udYaL].

> I will now examine practical management by platelet tier to ensure internal consistency. Above 100,000/µL, standard apixaban dosing is generally acceptable if otherwise indicated; between 50,000 and 100,000/µL, many clinicians proceed with standard dosing but with heightened vigilance; between 25,000 and 50,000/µL, consider dose reduction or alternative agents like prophylactic-dose LMWH depending on thrombotic urgency and bleeding risk; below 25,000/µL, therapeutic anticoagulation is usually avoided unless the thrombotic risk is extreme and bleeding can be mitigated, sometimes with platelet transfusion support in select high-risk scenarios [^1179RFXw] [^111up6iu] [^115ZzpfD].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought the FDA might list thrombocytopenia as a precaution, but that is not correct; the label's bleeding-related precautions and warnings center on active bleeding, drug interactions, and procedural management, and thrombocytopenia is not singled out as a labeled precaution, reinforcing that decisions are clinical rather than regulatory [^1138Kjw6] [^116kDDro].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure alignment with evidence and guidelines. Thrombocytopenia is not an absolute contraindication to apixaban; use is feasible and sometimes indicated across a range of platelet counts, but the severity of thrombocytopenia should guide dose selection, agent choice, and monitoring intensity, with shared decision-making to balance thrombotic benefit against bleeding risk and with consideration of alternatives such as LMWH when platelets are very low or bleeding risk is high [^115tX6YM] [^117KQXA5] [^1179RFXw] [^111up6iu].

Thrombocytopenia is not an absolute contraindication to apixaban (Eliquis) [^1118E8sd], but it significantly increases bleeding risk and requires careful risk–benefit assessment [^1118E8sd]. Apixaban is **generally avoided when platelets are < 50,000/µL** and is contraindicated with active bleeding [^115tX6YM] or severe hypersensitivity to apixaban. In patients with thrombocytopenia, consider dose reduction, closer monitoring, or alternative anticoagulants (e.g. LMWH) [^1179RFXw] based on platelet count, bleeding risk, and clinical context [^111up6iu]. For HIT, apixaban is a non-heparin option [^116qbEBy] once platelets recover [^114LYDyU].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Clinical trials**: Major apixaban trials (AMPLIFY, AMPLIFY-EXT) excluded patients with platelet counts < 100,000/µL, so safety in thrombocytopenia is limited [^115GtXFU] [^1113z9jn].

- **ASH guidelines**: For HIT, apixaban is a reasonable non-heparin option once platelets recover, with dosing until platelet count normalization [^111Gj2X3] [^113twkQs].

- **Cancer-associated thrombocytopenia**: Guidelines suggest individualized decisions for platelets < 50,000/µL, with LMWH preferred when counts are low or falling [^1179RFXw] [^116w4JVs].

---

## Platelet count thresholds and recommendations

| **Platelet count** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| > 100,000/µL | Standard apixaban dosing is acceptable |
| 50,000–100,000/µL | Use with caution; consider dose reduction and close monitoring |
| < 50,000/µL | Generally avoid; consider alternatives (e.g. LMWH) or platelet transfusion if anticoagulation is essential [^1179RFXw] [^1113FQHG] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and management strategies

- **HIT**: Apixaban is a non-heparin option after platelet recovery; dosing continues until normalization [^114LYDyU] [^113twkQs].

- **Cancer-associated thrombocytopenia**: Use LMWH or VKA if platelets are < 50,000/µL; consider apixaban only if counts are stable and bleeding risk is acceptable [^1179RFXw] [^114zdX58].

- **Liver disease**: Use caution in moderate hepatic impairment; avoid in severe impairment due to bleeding risk [^1155dUxX].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Thrombocytopenia increases bleeding risk; monitor closely and adjust therapy as needed [^1118E8sd].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Routine lab monitoring is not required, but clinical vigilance for bleeding is essential [^114LYDyU].

- **Reversal agents**: Andexanet alfa is available for life-threatening bleeding [^1178YTJJ].

---

## Alternative anticoagulant options

- **LMWH**: Preferred in cancer-associated thrombocytopenia or when platelets are < 50,000/µL [^1179RFXw] [^114zdX58].

- **VKA**: Consider when DOACs are contraindicated or not tolerated.

- **Fondaparinux**: Option in HIT or when heparinoids are contraindicated [^117Fe4ru].

---

Thrombocytopenia is not an absolute contraindication to apixaban, but it increases bleeding risk and warrants cautious use, dose adjustment, and close monitoring [^115ZzpfD]. Use **alternative anticoagulants** when platelets are < 50,000/µL or bleeding risk is high [^1179RFXw].

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The study AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) was published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE? In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the population was: 1642 patients (705 female, 937 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with VTE. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or requiring an ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or aspirin at a dose > 165 mg/day; hemoglobin level of < 9 mg/dL; platelet count < 100,000/mm²; serum creatinine level > 2.5 mg/dL. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 813 apixaban (5 mg BID for 12 months) n = 829 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 months). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.34). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause (4.2% vs. 11.6%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.53) No significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.6% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.33) Significant decrease in recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD-related death (2.3% vs. 10%; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.38). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and adverse events. significant differences in VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD-related death, or major bleeding (2.5% vs. 10.4%). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with VTE, apixaban was superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE.

Subacute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) A — direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy: In patients with subacute HIT A, the ASH guideline panel suggests treatment with a DOAC (eg, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) rather than a VKA (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). Remarks indicate that several considerations may inform the choice of agent, including drug and patient factors, and that DOACs are preferred in clinically stable patients at average risk of bleeding. Evidence cited includes a systematic review of case series of 11 patients with HIT who received DOACs after platelet count recovery, among whom there were no thrombotic events; among 11 patients with probable HIT who were transitioned to DOACs, 1 patient had a major hemorrhage secondary to known varices. Additional considerations note that DOACs are more expensive than VKAs and may be more acceptable to patients because they do not require routine laboratory monitoring and dietary restrictions.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Thrombosis in multiple myeloma: risk stratification, antithrombotic prophylaxis, and management of acute events. A consensus-based position paper from anexpert panel [^115S8MKR]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Box 2. Recommendations regarding primary antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma.

All patients with multiple myeloma who are candidates for active anti-myeloma treatment should be considered for thromboprophylaxis.
The type, intensity and duration of thromboprophylaxis should be tailored according to the individual's baseline thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk profiles.
Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 20×10⁹/L), active bleeding, congenital bleeding disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, severe deficiency of coagulation factors), and acquired coagulopathy that cannot be corrected (e.g. severe liver disease) are absolute contraindications to thromboprophylaxis.
Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50×10⁹/L), a history of bleeding, and acquired coagulopathy with a chance of correction are relative contraindications to thromboprophylaxis.
To ensure appropriate, safe and efective thromboprophylaxis and to avoid the risks of bleeding and potential thrombotic complications, it is recommended that the drug-drug interactions of antithrombotic agents and antimyeloma drugs are considered.
Patients' compliance and patients' preferences should be considered in the choice of thromboprophylaxis, and patients should be adequately informed about their thrombotic risk.
Patients at low risk of thrombosis, i.e. those aged less than 75 years, with a normal body mass index, without fractures, a central venous catheter, or co-morbidities and not planned to receive therapy with immunomodulatory drugs, should not be given thromboprophylaxis or can be given thromboprophylaxis with low-dose aspirin. The criterion for the choice is the individual hemorrhagic risk.
All other patients should receive thromboprophylaxis, with low molecular weight heparin as the first choice.
Patients without other risk factors for thrombosis except for a planned therapy containing an immunomodulatory drug and with a contraindication, strong aversion or documented poor compliance to low molecular weight heparin therapy, could be given aspirin as thromboprophylaxis.
Preliminary data on the efcacy and safety of apixaban and rivaroxaban as primary thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs are promising. However, there is no strong evidence in favor of direct oral anticoagulants instead of a low molecular weight heparin.
Of-label prescription of apixaban as primary antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with contraindications to low molecular weight heparin (e.g. for allergy) should be considered.
The duration of thromboprophylaxis should be modulated according to the length of anti-myeloma treatment and evolving risk factors. Prophylaxis should continue as long as a thrombotic risk is present (e.g. active disease or assumption of drugs with a thrombotic risk).
Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma should receive thromboprophylaxis during the treatment according to the indications recommended for newly diagnosed patients.
For patients under lenalidomide maintenance, thromboprophylaxis is indicated even if thromboembolic events are less frequent than during newly diagnosed disease. In these patients, prophylactic aspirin 100 mg/day is recommended.
In patients with renal insufciency, the most appropriate prophylaxis should be chosen according to the degree of renal function. For patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min, low molecular weight heparin with dose adjustments is the preferred prophylaxis. Dose adjustments of low molecular weight heparin according to creatinine clearance value are recommended (Table 5).
During antithrombotic prophylaxis, the platelet count should be monitored, particularly in patients receiving antimyeloma therapeutic combinations that are at high risk of causing thrombocytopenia.
Thromboprophylaxis should be stopped if the platelet count decreases to less than 20–30×10⁹/L. Dose reductions should be applied when the platelet count is 30–50×10⁹/L. Full-dose thromboprophylaxis can be used when the platelet count is over 50×10⁹/L.
Primary thromboprophylaxis should be stopped in the case of clinically relevant or major bleeding. In this circumstance, the cause of bleeding should be evaluated and eventually corrected before restarting thromboprophylaxis.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117TNjZ9]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Anticoagulation use in patients with liver disease — recommendations are: 2a B-NR: For patients with AF who are at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism and mild or moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B), oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is reasonable in the absence of clinically significant liver disease–induced coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia; 2a B-NR: For patients with AF who are at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism and mild or moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B) and who are deemed to be candidates for anticoagulation, it is reasonable to prescribe DOACs (Child-Pugh class A: any DOAC; Child-Pugh class B: apixaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban) over warfarin; 3: Harm C-LD: For patients with AF and moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class B) at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism, rivaroxaban is contraindicated due to the potentially increased risk of bleeding.

### Using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in cancer and other high-risk populations [^115wL7is]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The major practical advantage of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, over vitamin K antagonists is their fixed dosing without the need for laboratory monitoring. With the recent, rapid introduction of the DOACs for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians are now faced with various questions regarding the efficacy and safety of these compounds overall and in specific high-risk populations. The collective evidence from 6 large clinical trials involving 27,000 patients has demonstrated that DOACs are as effective as vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in preventing recurrent VTE while being associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding. These findings are consistent in subgroups of patients with pulmonary embolism, the elderly, and those patients with a high body weight or moderate renal insufficiency, making these agents suitable for a broad spectrum of patients with VTE. DOACs are also an attractive treatment option in patients with VTE and concomitant cancer, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but the currently available clinical data is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of DOACs in these settings. Several studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in these high-risk populations are underway.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^115XydC1]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — benefits and harms: Discontinuation of heparin and treatment with a non-heparin anticoagulant probably results in fewer new or progressive thrombotic events (12% to 25%) than discontinuation of heparin alone or discontinuation of heparin and treatment with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (∼50%), and few thrombotic events were reported with DOACs (rivaroxaban, 1 of 46; apixaban, 0 of 12; dabigatran, 1 of 11), although the number of reported patients treated with these agents remains relatively small. Treatment with a non-heparin anticoagulant likely increases major bleeding (8% to 36% risk of major bleeds), limb amputations occurred in 13.7% of patients treated with argatroban and in 4.2% of patients treated with danaparoid, and there were fewer bleeds with DOACs (rivaroxaban, 0 of 46; apixaban, 0 of 12; dabigatran, 0 of 11). A systematic review addressed rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran in acute HIT, and the guideline notes that the benefits and harms of the effects of DOACs compare favorably with those associated with parenteral non-heparin anticoagulants.

Management of bleeding risk

From the start of anticoagulant treatment, patients with acute PE are at increased bleeding risk. Therefore, management of bleeding risk is relevant throughout the course of treatment, beginning with ruling out absolute contraindications to anticoagulant treatment at diagnosis, identifying the optimal anticoagulant strategy, and avoiding unnecessary interventions. Alternative treatment strategies in PE patients who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation include (repeated) platelet transfusions to deal with 'critical' thrombocytopenia aiming to keep the platelet count above 30–50 × 10⁹/L, or the use of a retrievable vena cava filter in selected cases. Appropriate action should be taken to ensure drug adherence and optimal dosing, while avoiding relevant drug-drug interactions. Risk factors for bleeding need to be screened for and — when modifiable — reversed before patients are discharged. The most relevant potentially modifiable risk factors are: renal insufficiency, liver disease, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, hypertension, and use of antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. After the first 3–6 months, estimation of the risk of bleeding over the long term becomes relevant for patients at high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), for whom indefinite treatment is considered. This bleeding risk can be estimated by either implicit judgement, weighing individual risk factors, or by risk prediction schemes. The currently available evidence supports the application of the American College of Chest Physicians bleeding risk tool or VTE-BLEED to identify patients at lowest risk of bleeding complications, in whom long-term anticoagulant treatment is likely safe. There is however no evidence supporting the avoidance of long-term anticoagulation in patients with a high estimated bleeding risk based on either of these risk stratification tools. Instead, such knowledge should be discussed with the patient and incorporated into a shared decision-making process regarding continuation or discontinuation of anticoagulation. Moreover, we propose a reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for patients at higher risk of bleeding, in whom it is decided to continue treatment. Of note, according to the ESC PE guideline, a reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended anticoagulation after the first 6 months should generally be considered.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants as emerging treatment options for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^115M6xvG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for the use of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Data Source

A PubMed search (1950-February 2015) was collected using the terms heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and target-specific anticoagulants, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and direct-acting oral anticoagulants, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and new oral anticoagulants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles were reviewed for inclusion. The references of included articles were reviewed for additional data.

Data Synthesis

HIT is an immune-mediated, prothrombotic adverse reaction that requires not only discontinuation of heparin but also initiation of an alternative nonheparin anticoagulant to counter the effects of the autoimmune cascade. Pharmacotherapeutic management with argatroban is unpredictable and problematic. The DOACs display predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and exhibit no interaction with platelet factor 4. Currently, the DOACs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for venous thromboembolism, yet have limited evidence in both in vitro and clinical HIT studies.

Conclusions

Though dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have been used in case reports, currently data are not yet sufficient to recommend clinical use of these agents in the management of HIT. Future trial results may further substantiate management of HIT with use of the DOACs.

2.1 Recommended Dose in Adult Patients

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.
In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dose in Pediatric Patients

Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE in Pediatric Patients

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is based on the patient's weight, see Table 1. Adjust the dose according to weight-tier as treatment progresses. Initiate ELIQUIS treatment for pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age following at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation therapy. Individualize duration of overall therapy after careful assessment of the treatment benefit and the risk for bleeding.

Table 1: Dose Recommendation in Pediatric Patients from Birth to less than 18 Years of Age for the Treatment of VTE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE

ELIQUIS is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2.6 kg because ELIQUIS was not studied in these patients.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose of ELIQUIS is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

### Systematic literature review of DOACs as treatment for confirmed or suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [^117E31eH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze available literature on the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the treatment of confirmed or suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase databases were searched through December 16, 2024, to identify studies assessing DOAC use in the treatment of acute confirmed or suspected HIT.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Included studies analyzed use of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban in patients with confirmed or suspected HIT.

Data Synthesis

Ten studies including 275 patients met the inclusion criteria. Eight were retrospective cohort studies and 2 were prospective. No randomized control trials were identified. A 4Ts score was reported for 259 patients; an antibody immunoassay was reported for 149 patients; and a serotonin release assay was reported for 109 patients. Eight, 6, and 2 studies reported use of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, respectively. Thrombosis rates ranged from 0% to 8.3%, 0% to 13.7%, and 0% to 2.5% for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran respectively. Major bleeding was reported in 1 patient receiving rivaroxaban.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

The 2018 American Society of Hematology HIT guidelines conditionally recommend DOAC use due to very low certainty of effects. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an attractive treatment option for acute HIT due to ease of administration and reduced need for monitoring. Analysis of the recently published relevant data can support and guide appropriate use of DOACs in these patients.

Conclusions

This systematic review strengthens previously published evidence that DOACs are likely a safe and effective treatment for confirmed or suspected HIT. Study design, small study size, and varying diagnostic criteria reduce data certainty.

The study ARCADIA-MRI was published by Maarten G Lansberg and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with a recent cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy? In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the population was: 174 patients (83 female, 91 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a recent cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication on MRI; clear indication for therapeutic-dose anticoagulant therapy; need for antiplatelet therapy; history of spontaneous ICH; CKD; clinically significant bleeding diathesis; unresolved anemia or thrombocytopenia; clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within the past year; active hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency with Child-Pugh B or C. In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the interventions were: n = 79 apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg) n = 95 aspirin (at a dose of 81 mg). In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in non-lacunar covert infarcts (5% vs. 18%; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.83). In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in non-lacunar covert infarct or non-lacunar symptomatic stroke (9% vs. 26%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.79) No significant difference in non-lacunar symptomatic stroke (4% vs. 8%; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.77) No significant difference in lacunar or non-lacunar covert infarcts (15% vs. 26%; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.07). In the ARCADIA-MRI study, the conclusion was: in patients with a recent cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy, apixaban was superior to aspirin with respect to a non-lacunar covert infarcts.

### Direct oral anticoagulants for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^111JSjv8]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

To present the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence and highlight the areas of uncertainty regarding direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CAT).

Recent Findings

In the last years, four RCTs have shown that rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban are at least as effective as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of both incidental and symptomatic CAT. On the other hand, these drugs increase the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cancer at this site. Another two RCTs have demonstrated that apixaban and rivaroxaban also prevent CAT in subjects at intermediate-to-high risk commencing chemotherapy, albeit at the price of higher likelihood of bleeding. By contrast, data are limited about the use DOAC in individuals with intracranial tumors or concomitant thrombocytopenia. It is also possible that some anticancer agents heighten the effects of DOAC via pharmacokinetic interactions, up to making their effectiveness-safety profile unfavorable.

Summary

Leveraging the results of the aforementioned RCTS, current guidelines recommend DOAC as the anticoagulants of choice for CAT treatment and, in selected cases, prevention. However, the benefit of DOAC is less defined in specific patient subgroups, in which the choice of DOAC over LMWH should be carefully pondered.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). The recommended dose in atrial fibrillation is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**

- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.
- Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it's converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
- The indication for use includes four options: Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), or Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis.

- **Computation**

- For **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**

- The dosage is tailored based on three criteria:

- Age of 80 years or older.
- Weight of 60 kg or less.
- Creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less.
- If a patient meets two or more of these criteria, the dosage is reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily. A note explains the reason for dosage reduction.
- If fewer than two criteria are met, the standard dosage is 5 mg twice daily.

- For **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** and **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**

- An initial higher dose of 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days is recommended, followed by 5 mg twice daily. This regimen is aimed at acute treatment. A note provides context on the dosing strategy.

- For **Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis**

- The suggested dose is 2.5 mg twice daily, with a note indicating its purpose in preventing thrombosis after surgery.

- **Output**

- The calculator returns the determined apixaban dosage accompanied by relevant notes if applicable. These notes provide critical context for clinical decision-making, clarifying the reasoning behind dosage adjustments based on patient characteristics and treatment indications.

The structured assessment assures the apixaban dosage is well-suited to the patient's needs, adhering to clinical guidelines and ensuring safety and efficacy aligning with their health condition.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^116kDDro]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

use of indwelling epidural catheters
concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy. (2.5, 5.1, 14.1)

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA: Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. (5.3)

ELIQUIS also showed significantly fewer major bleeds than warfarin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Time to First Stroke or Systemic Embolism in ARISTOTLE (Intent-to-Treat Population)

All-cause death was assessed using a sequential testing strategy that allowed testing for superiority if effects on earlier endpoints (stroke plus systemic embolus and major bleeding) were demonstrated. ELIQUIS treatment resulted in a significantly lower rate of all-cause death (p = 0.046) than did treatment with warfarin, primarily because of a reduction in cardiovascular death, particularly stroke deaths. Non-vascular death rates were similar in the treatment arms.

In ARISTOTLE, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint were generally consistent across most major subgroups including weight, CHADS2score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to predict risk of stroke in patients with AF, with higher scores predicting greater risk), prior warfarin use, level of renal impairment, geographic region, and aspirin use at randomization (Figure 5).

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^112TtCuJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For patients receiving ELIQUIS 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, the dose of ELIQUIS should be decreased by 50% when coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For patients receiving ELIQUIS at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concomitant administration of combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients.

Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Concomitant use with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] which increases the risk for bleeding.

Clarithromycin

Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary with concomitant administration with ELIQUIS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Concomitant use with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] which increases the risk for stroke and other thromboembolic events.

Table 3.
Non-heparin alternative anticoagulants that may be used to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients.

Direct thrombin inhibitors - Argatroban is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor that binds to the thrombin active site in a reversible manner. It is capable of inhibiting both free and clot-associated thrombin. Clinical trials reported that treatment with argatroban reduces death, amputation and thrombosis compared to historical controls. Bivalirudin is another synthetic peptide composed of two short hirudin peptide fragments. It is widely used for non-HIT patients with coronary disease because some studies showed that it reduced bleeding complications in the setting of invasive cardiology.

Direct oral anticoagulants - Rivaroxaban, apixaban and endoxaban directly block Xa, while dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor. There is increasing evidence to suggest the safety and efficacy of several direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in HIT. In one small multicenter prospective study good safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban, without new thrombotic events, were observed. In another case series, the use of rivaroxaban, apixaban or dabigatran showed no recurrent arterial, venous thrombosis or bleeding complications. Although these observations seem encouraging, robust clinical studies investigating the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with acute HIT are limited, and this precludes any evidence-based recommendations. Importantly, the observed low trough levels of the drugs may not offer adequate protection for some HIT patients.

Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment

The use of high doses of IVIG was shown to inhibit HIT antibody-mediated platelet activation. Evidence emerging from case reports indicates that patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia who are refractory to standard treatment may benefit from IVIG therapy. However, more data are needed to clarify the indications and the appropriate IVIG dosing.

### Influence of thrombocytopenia on bleeding and vascular events in atrial fibrillation [^1118E8sd]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated overall prevalence of 4% to 5% among patients 65 years of age or older. Anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolic events, including ischemic strokes, in patients with AF but increases the risk of bleeding. The use of anticoagulation therapy for patients with AF requires the identification of patients with a net clinical benefit. Thrombocytopenia, a common comorbidity affecting 6% to 24% of patients with AF, may increase the risk of bleeding with anticoagulation, possibly altering the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation therapy. Concurrent thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhage associated with anticoagulation for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), but whether it substantively alters the risk of bleeding in patients with AF is uncertain.

Despite the frequency of coexisting AF and thrombocytopenia, data to guide clinicians on management in this population are limited. Moderate and severe thrombocytopenia were exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical trials examining the effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF. Older studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of warfarin for patients with AF included few patients with thrombocytopenia. Risk calculators developed to predict the risk of major bleeding, such as the HAS-BLED score, often fail to incorporate thrombocytopenia. The HEMORR 2 HAGES risk score does incorporate platelet count but is based on a pooled analysis of patients with thrombocytopenia, reduced platelet function, and antiplatelet agents, such that the contribution of thrombocytopenia as a standalone risk factor is undefined.

The paucity of data describing the safety of oral anticoagulants for patients with AF and thrombocytopenia represents a major challenge in clinical practice. Clinical guidelines do not include specific guidance for anticoagulation in patients with coexisting AF and thrombocytopenia, other than suggesting that anticoagulation may be contraindicated in severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 × 10³/μL). Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize rates of bleeding in patients with AF and moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia (ie, platelet count < 100 × 10³/μL) in a matched cohort of patients with AF and normal platelet counts (platelet count > 150 × 10³/μL).

### How we manage patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia [^112JxFyZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains a rare, but significant, condition related to mortality and morbidity. The incidence has decreased with reduced use of unfractionated heparin, with the exception of cardiac surgery. Due to the high risk of thrombosis, a switch to a non-heparin anticoagulant is required, until platelet counts normalize. Within the acute setting, argatroban, fondaparinux and direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACS) are therapeutic options. In patients with HIT-associated thrombosis or who require long-term anticoagulation, warfarin remains the preference, but DOACs are attractive alternatives.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Currently licenced direct oral anticoagulants selectively target thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (eg, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed to be given in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than do vitamin K antagonists, and in randomised controlled trials involving around 250000 patients, they were at least as effective for prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications because of their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. In this Therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarise the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for the development of oral anticoagulants.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^1148YTpY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamic Drug Interaction Studies

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with aspirin, clopidogrel, aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, enoxaparin, and naproxen were conducted. No pharmacodynamic interactions were observed with aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A 50% to 60% increase in anti-FXa activity was observed when ELIQUIS was coadministered with enoxaparin or naproxen.

Specific Populations

Renal impairment: Anti-FXa activity adjusted for exposure to apixaban was similar across renal function categories.

Hepatic impairment: Changes in anti-FXa activity were similar in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. However, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there is no clear understanding of the impact of this degree of hepatic function impairment on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and bleeding. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not studied.

Pediatric patients: In pediatric patients treated with apixaban, the correlation between anti-FXa activity and plasma concentration is linear with a slope close to 1.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Apixaban has no effect on the QTc interval in humans at doses up to 50 mg.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Apixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in exposure for oral doses up to 10 mg.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50% for doses up to 10 mg of ELIQUIS. Food does not affect the bioavailability of apixaban. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of apixaban appear 3 to 4 hours after oral administration of ELIQUIS. At doses ≥ 25 mg, apixaban displays dissolution-limited absorption with decreased bioavailability. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of water, exposure was similar to that after oral administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets mixed with 30 g of applesauce, the Cmaxand AUC were 20% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following administration of a crushed 5 mg ELIQUIS tablet that was suspended in 60 mL D5W and delivered through a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to that seen in other clinical trials involving healthy volunteers receiving a single oral 5 mg tablet dose.

The dose modification strategy is derived from expert consensus and uses different approaches, including empirical reductions with relatively weaker data. A recent systematic review by Samuelson et al. also addressed this issue and did not identify any evidence for the superiority of one approach over another.

The risk of recurrence decreases after the initial 30-day period. Therefore, in this subacute or chronic period, anticoagulation could be reduced to lower the risk of bleeding and avoid unnecessary transfusions. In particular, decreased dosing (50% or prophylactic doses of LMWH) is suggested for platelet counts between 25 and 50 × 10⁹/l, whereas temporary discontinuation should be considered for platelet counts of < 25 × 10⁹/l. In certain patients at low risk of recurrent thrombosis, withholding anticoagulation for the entire period of thrombocytopenia (platelet count of < 50 × 10⁹/l) may be effective and safe.

LMWH is currently the preferred anticoagulant among patients with thrombocytopenia. Data on the use of DOACs in CAT patients with severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 × 10⁹/l) are lacking, even though some evidence is emerging. So far, based on current data, inferior vena cava filter insertion should be considered only in patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation. According to guidelines, patients who experienced VTE and low platelet count (< 50 × 10⁹/l) should be treated with full anticoagulation and possibly with platelet transfusion during the first 30 days after diagnosis of VTE. Prophylactic anticoagulant dose may be effective and safe during the chronic phase of VTE for platelet counts between 25 × 10⁹/l and 50 × 10⁹/l.

Cancer‐Associated Thromboembolism

Patients with cancer are at increased risk for venous and arterial thromboembolism and bleeding events. 48 Anticoagulation within the cancer population is complicated by comorbidities that can affect drug disposition (ie, renal insufficiency, high rates of nausea and vomiting), thrombotic risk (ie, concurrent AF), or bleeding risk (ie, thrombocytopenia); drug‐drug interactions between anticoagulants and oncology medications; malnourished/underweight states; and patient preferences (ie, burdensome laboratory testing, patient discomfort with injections, and medication cost). 48 As such, the growing need for optimal anticoagulation strategies is of mounting importance. Historically, LMWHs have been the cornerstone of cancer‐associated VTE on the basis of 2 trials providing reduced thrombotic risk compared with warfarin. 49, 50 Evidence comparing the use of DOACs to LMWH have emerged to provide an oral dosing option that may be more cost effective and does not require frequent laboratory monitoring. The Hokusai VTE Cancer (Edoxaban for the Treatment of Cancer‐Associated Venous Thromboembolism) trial compared edoxaban 60 mg daily with dalteparin 200 IU/kg subcutaneously daily×1 month, then 150 IU/kg daily thereafter. 51 Edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin with respect to the primary end point of recurrent VTE or major bleeding, displaying a nonsignificant reduction in recurrent VTE (23% relative risk reduction, P = 0.09), but increasing major bleeding (1.77‐fold increase; P = 0.04). The Select‐D (Anticoagulation Therapy in Selected Cancer Patients at Risk of Recurrence of Venous Thromboembolism) pilot trial compared rivaroxaban at standard VTE dosing (15 mg twice daily×21 days, then 20 mg daily thereafter) versus dalteparin (same dosing regimen used in the Hokusai VTE Cancer trial) and revealed reduced recurrent VTE (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19–0.99) but a 1.83‐fold (95% CI, 0.68–4.96) increased risk of major bleeding after 6 months of treatment with rivaroxaban. 52 The ADAM VTE (Apixaban, Dalteparin, in Active Cancer Associated Venous Thromboembolism) trial was the first trial for apixaban to support active treatment of cancer‐associated VTE. 53 Apixaban dosed at 10 mg twice daily×7 days, then 5 mg twice daily thereafter, was compared with dalteparin (dosed as above) over 6 months. Apixaban was associated with a noninferiority with regard to the primary end point of major bleeding (0% versus 2.1%; P = 0.9956) and a robust 74% relative risk reduction in recurrent VTE (P = 0.0182). Similar results were recently published in the Caravaggio (Apixaban for the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism Associated With Cancer) trial, demonstrating noninferiority with respect to recurrent VTE (P < 0.001) and comparable major bleeding (P = 0.60). 54 Thus, the current landscape for treatment of VTE in the cancer population seems to support apixaban over the current standard of care with LMWH and other DOACs, establishing the ideal balance of thrombosis prevention while not inducing excess bleeding. However, several other trials investigating DOAC to LMWH for treatment of cancer‐associated VTE are slated to be completed within the next 1 to 2 years. Subgroup analyses from phase III VTE and AF trials and retrospective observational cohorts have also demonstrated consistent efficacy and safety outcomes in the cancer population. 48 In response, major guidelines now endorse the use of DOAC in cancer‐associated VTE treatment. 55, 56 Trials investigating the use of DOACs for the prevention of VTE in patients with cancer have also been conducted and support the use of these agents in patients with cancer undergoing ambulatory chemotherapy with intermediate‐high VTE risk and low bleeding risk. 48, 57, 58 As current practice heavily favors LMWH and VKAs, these novel and compelling trials supporting the use of DOACs will likely serve to ignite a paradigm shift in practice standards among this growing population of complex patients.

In patients with critical illness, increased bleeding risk, or increased potential need for urgent procedures, argatroban or bivalirudin may be preferred and such patients may require close monitoring; in moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Class B or C), it is advisable to avoid argatroban or use a reduced dose. Fondaparinux and the DOACs are reasonable options in clinically stable patients at average risk of bleeding, while in HIT complicated by life- or limb-threatening thromboembolism a parenteral non-heparin anticoagulant may be preferred. For rivaroxaban dosing, for acute HIT, 15 mg twice per day for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once per day is preferred; for acute isolated HIT, 15 mg twice per day until platelet count recovery (usually a platelet count of ≥ 150 × 10⁹/L) followed by 20 mg once per day is preferred if there is an indication for ongoing anticoagulation.

Thrombocytopenia

Anticoagulation is contraindicated when platelets are < 25 × 10⁹/L. When platelets are between 25 and 50 × 10⁹/L, LMWH should be used since data with DOAC in this context are scarce. In fact, the platelet count threshold in RCTs of DOAC for CAT ranged from 50 × 10⁹/L (Hokusai VTE Cancer and ADAM VTE) to 75 × 10⁹/L (CARAVAGGIO) to 100 × 10⁹/L (SELECT-D).

LMWH is also preferred over DOAC when platelets are > 50,000 × 10⁹/L, but with possibility of a further decrease in the subsequent days. Similarly, prophylactic-dose LMWH, and not DOAC, may be considered to prevent CAT in individuals with thrombocytopenia, with close monitoring of the platelet count.

In presence of acute VTE or high thrombotic risk, or when there is a history of recurrent or progressive thrombosis, transfusions may be performed to raise the platelet count above 50 × 10⁹/L and, therefore, make full-dose anticoagulation feasible. Conversely, if the thrombotic risk is low, LMWH can be given at a dosage reduced by 25–50%, and the dose can be adjusted to 50% of the normal in case of subacute or chronic VTE. Modified-dose anticoagulation has been shown to be safe in patients with active malignancy, acute VTE and a platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L.

Management of Direct Oral Anticoagulants During Invasive Procedures

For the prophylaxis of cardioembolism in atrial fibrillation, it is recommended to interrupt DOAC in the hours or days before an invasive procedure and then restart them after a variable amount of time, depending on intervention-related and intrinsic bleeding risk and renal function. This guidance is based on the predictable pharmacokinetics of DOAC, as well as on data showing that bleeding is more likely if heparin is temporary substituted for DOAC or VKA (so called heparin bridging). It is yet to be proved that this strategy is also valid for DOAC therapy of CAT, even though it is reasonable that this is indeed the case.

### Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia elucidate the syndrome [^1145P51z]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can have a dramatic presentation and often an unfortunate outcome. Each episode has the real potential to result in clinical catastrophe. From the > 100 such patients that we see yearly, patients have been selected to illustrate aspects of HIT such as history, epidemiology, clinical features, and improving treatment strategies. Delayed recognition continues to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It is not adequate to just stop heparin therapy even with isolated HIT, therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins is contraindicated, and care must be used not to initiate warfarin therapy early or unopposed. A moderate suspicion for HIT should trigger the institution of therapy with an alternative anticoagulant even before laboratory confirmation. The potential beneficial impact of therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors makes it more important to maintain awareness of and vigilance for this syndrome.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 Protocol, study identification; and screening

A study protocol was submitted to the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD 42020219027). A sensitive search strategy was developed to identify all studies which assessed the effectiveness and safety outcomes of anticoagulants used for the treatment of acute HIT. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE through the Ovid platform from inception until November 10, 2020. The following search terms were used: (heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia.tw OR heparin induced thrombocytopenia.tw) AND (Hirudins[MeSH OR hirudins.tw OR rivaroxaban[MeSH] OR rivaroxaban.tw OR Dabigatran[MeSH] OR Dabigatran.tw OR Danaparoid.tw OR lepirudin.tw OR argatroban.tw OR Fondaparinux.tw OR Bivalirudin.tw OR Desirudin.tw OR Apixaban.tw OR Edoxaban.tw). The search was limited to studies in humans; no restrictions were applied concerning language or type of publication. Additionally, references of articles were manually checked for potentially eligible studies. Records were screened in duplicate by two investigators (J.K. M.N.) and duplicates were removed. The manuscript was prepared following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA) guideline. 11

2.2 Study eligibility

The eligibility of studies was assessed in full‐text by two investigators (J.K. M.N.) and disputes were resolved by discussion. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) treatment of acute HIT with one of the specified non‐heparin anticoagulants mentioned below, and (2) reporting of at least one of the following outcomes: (a) platelet recovery, (b) new or progressive TE, (c) major bleeding, or (d) death. Exclusion criteria were: (1) review articles without new data, (2) insufficient clinical data, (3) double publications, (4) case reports, and (5) investigational therapies other than the pre‐specified anticoagulants. We did not apply exclusion criteria regarding study design, type of publication, publication date, or language.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^115y95Bf]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function, which makes anticoagulation particularly challenging. Furthermore, patients with ESKD initiating anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are typically hospitalized to receive parenteral heparin when starting warfarin, putting them at risk for hospital‐associated complications, including heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia. A safe, effective therapy for this high‐risk population is needed.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have provided options for the management of VTE but have not been extensively evaluated in individuals with ESKD for this indication. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran have been associated with a higher risk of bleeding than warfarin in patients with ESKD who are anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (AF) in observational studies. A small randomized study of reduced dose rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) versus warfarin noted similar rates of major bleeding, stroke, and systemic embolism in this population although it was underpowered to demonstrate noninferiority for these clinically important outcomes. Apixaban may be safer than warfarin, with recent evidence supporting lower bleeding rates in patients with ESKD treated for AF.RENAL‐AF, an open randomized controlled trial (RCT) of apixaban versus warfarin for atrial fibrillation in patients on hemodialysis was halted prematurely due to slow accrual. Therefore, high‐quality RCT data evaluating DOACs for patients with ESKD and AF are lacking. Similarly, the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE have not been extensively studied. There is reason to speculate that bleeding risk and risk of recurrent thrombosis could be different in patients with AF compared to VTE treated with apixaban. Patients with VTE are generally treated with higher doses of apixaban (10 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 5 mg twice daily); in AF, there is no role for doses greater than 5 mg twice daily at treatment initiation, and some patients can be treated with 2.5 mg twice daily, depending on patient factors. In contrast, in VTE, the use of less than 5 mg twice daily — regardless of patient characteristics — is off‐label. We sought to characterize recent trends in the use of apixaban to treat VTE in ESKD and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of apixaban compared to warfarin. We hypothesized a lower bleeding risk and similar effectiveness of apixaban when compared to warfarin.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. 1 DOACs are categorized into 2 main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (ie, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (ie, dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the following years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; ie, warfarin), or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. 2, 3, 4, 5 Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. 6 As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 7

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome and challenging to integrate into everyday clinical use. The purpose of this review is to be a practical reference or algorithm for the busy clinician to navigate key aspects of effective DOAC prescribing, with an emphasis on addressing key situations where clinical uncertainty exists. This review will provide recommendations to address special clinical situations to include indications, use in specific comorbidities, monitoring parameters, transitioning to or off of therapy, drug interactions, and cost.

2.3 Definition of drugs, outcomes, and other variables of interest

The following categories of treatment schemes were defined: argatroban, danaparoid, fondaparinux, DOACs, bivalirudin, and other hirudins. The DOACs included apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. Other hirudins included lepirudin, desirudin, and hirudin. In cases where patients were treated with more than one non‐heparin anticoagulant, only the drug administered for the longest duration was considered for analysis.

Acute HIT was defined as newly diagnosed HIT prior to platelet recovery. Platelet recovery and new or progressive TE were defined as effectiveness outcomes, and major bleeding and death of any cause were defined as safety outcomes. Platelet recovery was defined as an increase in platelet count of ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L or doubling of the nadir platelet count, or a 30% increase from the nadir if the nadir was above 100 × 10⁹/L. 12 TE was defined as a new objectively verified arterial or venous TE or progression of already present TE. Major bleeding was defined according to the classification of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH). 13 If bleeding events were reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the US National Cancer Institute, bleeding grade 3 and 4 were defined as major bleeding. 14 All events that were observed within the observation time defined by the primary study were counted.

### Prescribing trends of oral anticoagulants in US patients with cirrhosis and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^111MMtF7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, we found that over 50% of patients with cirrhosis and NVAF who were eligible for anticoagulation (ie, CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores ≥ 2 [men] or ≥ 3 [women]) did not receive an OAC. Such low rates of OAC use were consistently observed in patients at the highest risk of stroke (ie, CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score ≥ 5), including in those without clear contraindications to therapy, such as patients with compensated cirrhosis and those without coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, or prior bleeding events. These findings are supported by data from the general population, which similarly describe modest rates of overall OAC use among adults with NVAF and elevated risk of stroke. Other studies have suggested marked discordance between clinical recommendations for OAC use and actual patterns of real‐world use, such that 20% to 55% of patients with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score ≥ 2 do not receive anticoagulation, whereas in contrast, 40% to 53% of patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of 0 are treated with OAC therapy, including in studies with rigorously defined NVAF and comorbidities and valid assessments of CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores. Such figures raise understandable concern because patients with AF who fail to receive guideline‐congruent OAC therapy suffer from high rates of preventable stroke.

Our findings show a progressive increase over time in the uptake of DOACs in patients with cirrhosis and NVAF, together with a concurrent decline in warfarin use, patterns that have also been described in the general population with NVAF. By the end of our study period (2019), DOACs accounted for 77.6% of all OAC prescription claims in MarketScan, and the most commonly prescribed DOAC was apixaban. Yet, there remains a lack of robust data regarding the use, safety, and effectiveness of DOACs, including apixaban, in patients with cirrhosis and NVAF. Thus, as the worldwide prevalence of cirrhosis continues to grow, and as DOACs continue to be integrated into clinical practice, it is imperative that future research studies identify the optimal DOAC strategy for this high‐risk and vulnerable population, particularly for patients with advanced, decompensated cirrhosis.

Reversal of apixaban and rivaroxaban with andexanet alfa — evidence and cautions. Coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo, or andexanet alfa is approved for the reversal of apixaban and rivaroxaban and may additionally reverse low molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin due to binding heparin–antithrombin III complex; it is not FDA-approved for edoxaban, although successful cases have been reported. In a multicenter prospective trial, andexanet alfa administration showed a 92% reduction of factor Xa inhibition by both apixaban and rivaroxaban, and a single-center retrospective study demonstrated excellent or good 24h hemostatic control in 78.9% of patients who received andexanet alfa peri-procedurally. There are no absolute contraindications to andexanet alfa, but its use should be avoided prior to heparinization as it may interfere with heparin's anticoagulant effects; it has been safely used in the geriatric population (65+ years of age) and has not been evaluated in pregnant or breastfeeding patients. Patients should resume apixaban or rivaroxaban 24 hours after moderate or intermediate to high-risk procedures, as long as medically stable and cleared.

Results

The cohort was composed of 5236 patients with AF; 4 patients had missing data, and 17 patients taking low‐molecular‐weight heparin were excluded. Thus, the analysis was performed in 5215 patients. Of these patients, 3877 (74.3%) were taking VKAs, and 1338 (25.7%) NOACs: 469 taking dabigatran, 478 taking apixaban, 379 taking rivaroxaban, and 12 taking edoxaban.

Characteristics of patients are reported in Table 1. The mean age was 75.0 ± 9.6 years, and 2368 (45.4%) were women. Overall, thrombocytopenia was present in 592 patients (11.4%) (Table 1). Of these patients, 10.4% had mild and 0.96% had moderate‐severe thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia were older; they were more likely to have persistent/permanent AF, active cancer, and liver cirrhosis; and more of them were treated with calcium channel blockers, nitrate, diuretics, and xanthine oxidase inhibitors. A trend for higher use of lipid‐lowering drugs and proton pump inhibitors and diabetes mellitus was also found (Table 1). Among antiarrhythmic drugs, 147 were treated with propafenone, 258 were treated with flecainide, 674 were treated with amiodarone, and 229 were treated with other drugs (dronedarone/unknown).

Direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) qualitative assessment when assays suitable for quantitation are not available — interpretive use of routine coagulation tests: For dabigatran, use thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); Normal TT excludes clinically relevant levels, but Prolonged TT does not discriminate between clinically significant and insignificant levels, and Normal aPTT usually excludes clinically relevant levels if a sensitive reagent is used; for detecting on-therapy or above on-therapy levels, Prolonged aPTT suggests presence of such levels, while Normal aPTT may not exclude them, particularly with relatively insensitive reagents. For apixaban, Normal PT and aPTT do not exclude clinically relevant levels, whereas UFH or LMWH anti-FXa below the lower limit of quantitation probably excludes clinically relevant levels; on-therapy levels are suggested by Prolonged PT, although Normal PT may not exclude them, particularly with relatively insensitive PT reagents. For betrixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, UFH or LMWH anti-FXa below the lower limit of quantitation probably excludes clinically relevant levels and Prolonged PT suggests on-therapy or above on-therapy levels, while Normal PT may not exclude them; the table notes that consideration of anticoagulant reversal is recommended for serious bleeding with a DOAC level > 50 ng/mL and for invasive procedures with high bleeding risk at > 30 ng/mL.

### Thrombocytopenia and mortality risk in patients with atrial fibrillation: an analysis from the START registry [^1113FQHG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The most common causes of thrombocytopenia in adults include acute and chronic infectious diseases, liver cirrhosis, cancer, and use of drugs like heparin, chemotherapies, antibiotics, and antidiabetic medications. 1 In addition, platelet count may be reduced in patients with myelofibrosis or hematologic diseases.

Thrombocytopenia is usually defined as a platelet count < 150×10⁹/L, and in the general population, it is associated with an increased risk of mortality. 2 Furthermore, the presence of a low platelet count was associated with worse short‐ and long‐term outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome or cancer. 3, 4

The management of patients with thrombocytopenia requiring oral anticoagulation, such as those with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation (AF), is particularly challenging for the potential risk of bleeding. 3, 5 Indeed, anticoagulation is generally contraindicated if platelet count is < 50×10⁹/L, 6 and patients with platelet count < 100×10⁹/L were excluded from recent clinical trials with non–vitamin K antagonist (VKA) oral anticoagulants (NOACs). 7, 8, 9, 10 Prevalence and determinants of thrombocytopenia in AF patients are still unclear. In 2 recent studies, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia was highly variable, as it ranged from 6% to 24%. 4, 5 Furthermore, follow‐up data about the relationship between thrombocytopenia and mortality in patients with AF were not reported.

On the basis of this, the aim of the present study was to assess prevalence and determinants of thrombocytopenia and its relationship with mortality in a large population of the multicenter cohort START (Survey on Anticoagulated Patients Register) registry.

Special considerations for use of DOACs in the treatment of cancer-associated VTE

Practical considerations

Although DOAC treatment is associated with lower rates of VTE recurrence and comparable rates of major bleeding relative to LMWH in patients with cancer, particularly nongastrointestinal cancer, practical considerations may limit DOAC use. Unlike parenteral LMWH, oral anticoagulants including DOACs are subject to interference from chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; therefore, LMWH may be preferable in patients with frequent vomiting. The DOACs require careful dosing in patients with renal impairment, and drug labeling provides little support for use of DOACs to treat VTE in patients with severe renal impairment. Similar concerns apply to LMWH use in patients with severe renal impairment, and unfractionated heparin or VKAs are preferred in this population. Caution is also required in patients with thrombocytopenia; current clinical guideline recommendations and practice guidance suggestions include standard-dose LMWH treatment in patients with platelet counts > 50 000/µl and no evidence of bleeding, and case-by-case decisions based on individual risk/benefit considerations for patients with platelet counts < 50 000/µl. The 2018 ISTH guidance suggests withholding anticoagulation in patients with platelet counts < 25 000/µl who are at lower risk for recurrent VTE and considering platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts above 40 000–50 000/µl in patients with thrombocytopenia and high risk for VTE recurrence.

### Prescribing trends of oral anticoagulants in US patients with cirrhosis and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^111xNMND]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large, population‐based US cohort of commercially insured patients with cirrhosis and NVAF, we found more than half of the eligible patients were not anticoagulated. From 2012 to 2019, DOAC use has increased substantially, whereas warfarin use dropped precipitously. Apixaban has become the most frequently prescribed OAC, accounting for over 53% of all OAC prescriptions by the end of the study period. The trends of increasing DOAC use over time were consistent across all age groups and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc risk categories, and they also were evident in high‐risk patients with underlying thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and decompensated cirrhosis. Notably, the most pronounced increases in DOAC use over time were found in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, whereas relatively smaller increases were found in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Warfarin has historically been the most commonly prescribed OAC in patients with cirrhosis and NVAF, largely owing to the limited evidence in patients with chronic liver disease and the lack of cirrhosis‐specific guidelines for AF management. Concern also remains regarding DOAC use in patients with progressive or decompensated cirrhosis, given the risks of aberrant hepatic drug metabolism and adverse bleeding events, coupled with the lack of cirrhosis‐specific safety and efficacy data from published DOAC randomized controlled trials, which actively excluded patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, among the few observational studies focused on chronic liver disease, none directly compared individual DOACs in a head‐to‐head manner; thus, it is unclear whether one DOAC should be preferred over another. Given these uncertainties, it is often recommended that patients with NVAF and advanced cirrhosis avoid DOAC therapy. Nevertheless, we observed a progressive change over time in prescribing preferences for patients with cirrhosis and NVAF that increasingly favors DOACs, particularly apixaban, over warfarin, including in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and high‐risk features such as thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. These changing practice patterns could reflect variability in patient, provider, or formulary preferences; however, they did not appear to be explained by differences in patient age, or in the proportions of patients with underlying coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, or prior major bleeding events, in our analyses stratified by these factors.

### Anticoagulation in thrombocytopenic patients-time to rethink? [^115MUNvp]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the difficult clinical situations in the anticoagulation era is how to give these medications to patients with significantly reduced platelet counts. The concern is the heightened bleeding risk, and the current practice is to apply a certain platelet count threshold below which the use of anticoagulant is deemed unsafe. However, this is not an evidence-based approach especially because the thresholds arose from studies in patients with acute leukemia. In this forum article, we discuss the bleeding risk estimation in thrombocytopenic patients when the decreased counts may not be related to marrow underproduction and aim to identify possible markers which can help in this risk estimation beyond platelet counts. We exhort future studies to include a combination of these markers, which may then guide us to administer safe anticoagulation in patients with severe thrombocytopenia.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: safe vascular access 2025 [^116rGkhQ]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The Working Party noted the recommendations and thresholds for transfusion provided in the British Society of Haematology guidelines. However, the Working Party reached a different consensus, that lower platelet counts are acceptable before transfusion should be necessary (Tables 5 and 6). Local policies should be developed for the management of complex patients as appropriate. Patients who are known to increment poorly after platelet transfusion will need discussion with haematology specialists. Patients with thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura or heparin‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopaenia should not be given platelets without discussion with haematology specialists.

Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, do not normally need to be stopped before the insertion and removal of CVADs. Prophylactic doses of anticoagulants do not normally need to be stopped before the insertion and removal of CVADs.

Treatment doses of anticoagulants can usually be continued during the insertion of PICCs and uncomplicated temporary central venous catheters, and during the removal of PICCs and temporary central venous catheters up to 8.5 Fr. Treatment doses of anticoagulants should normally be stopped before the following: insertion of temporary lines for complex patients with anatomical difficulties and multiple punctures; removal of temporary central venous catheters above 8.5 Fr; and insertion and removal of tunnelled CVADs and portacaths. The exact timing of cessation will depend on renal function, bleeding risk and local policy. Recommendations include stopping low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin and dalteparin) for 24 h; stopping apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban for 24–48 h; and stopping dabigatran for 24–72 h.

### Rivaroxaban for treatment of suspected or confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia study [^111UQTMk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Essentials Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a thrombogenic condition that is difficult to treat. We evaluated rivaroxaban as a treatment option in patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. One patient had recurrent thrombosis and 9/10 patients with thrombocytopenia had platelet recovery. Rivaroxaban may be an effective and safe treatment option for HIT.

Summary

Background Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anti-Xa inhibitor that has the potential to greatly simplify treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in this patient population, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, prospective cohort study of patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. Patients/Methods Twenty-two consecutive adults with suspected or confirmed HIT received rivaroxaban 15 mg bid until a local HIT assay result was available. Participants with a positive local assay result continued rivaroxaban 15 mg bid until platelet recovery (or until day 21 if they had acute thrombosis at study entry), then stepped down to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily until day 30. Results and Conclusions The primary outcome measure, incidence of new symptomatic, objectively-confirmed venous and arterial thromboembolism at 30 days, occurred in one HIT-positive participant (4.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0–23.5%) and one HIT-positive participant required limb amputation despite platelet recovery. Platelet recovery was achieved in nine out of 10 HIT-positive patients with thrombocytopenia. Rivaroxaban appears to be effective for treating patients with confirmed HIT, although the small number of patients enrolled limits precision.
