## Question

Erythrocyte extravasation, consistent with solar/traumatic purpura

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about erythrocyte extravasation consistent with solar or traumatic purpura, including definitions, mechanisms, histopathology, clinical contexts, differential diagnosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what erythrocyte extravasation means histologically and how it differs from true vasculitis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of solar versus traumatic purpura. Next, I will review the histopathologic hallmarks and ancillary stains that help date hemorrhage. After that, I should consider the clinical contexts where this finding is expected versus when it signals disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and outline management principles, making sure I double-check where erythrocyte extravasation is a primary feature versus a secondary bystander.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate it. Erythrocyte extravasation refers to red blood cells leaking out of vessels into the surrounding tissue, which is a histopathologic observation rather than a diagnosis, and it is distinct from vasculitis, which requires vessel wall damage with leukocytoclasis or fibrin deposition. Importantly, extravasated erythrocytes can accompany vasculitis, but their presence alone does not establish vasculitis, so I need to be careful not to overcall it [^cdab6be9] [^f757678e].

> Now, I should review the two clinical entities implied by the query. Solar purpura, also called actinic purpura, is a benign, chronic photodamage-related phenomenon in older adults with dermal atrophy and fragile vessels that bleed with minor trauma, typically on the dorsal hands and forearms. Traumatic purpura reflects direct mechanical injury to vessels with bleeding into the skin, often ecchymotic and localized to the site of impact. Both are common, nonpalpable, nonblanching purpuras where erythrocyte extravasation is expected on histology rather than a marker of vasculitis or systemic disease [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the histopathology. In solar purpura, I expect dermal atrophy, solar elastosis, and extravasated erythrocytes in the papillary dermis with hemosiderin-laden macrophages in older lesions. In traumatic purpura, I anticipate extravasated erythrocytes with dermal hemorrhage and variable edema, often with little to no inflammatory infiltrate unless there is a secondary process. These patterns contrast with vasculitis, where I should see vessel wall destruction, leukocytoclasis, and fibrin deposition alongside extravasated erythrocytes [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2] [^cdab6be9].

> Wait, let me verify how to date hemorrhage histologically. Fresh extravasation shows intact erythrocytes, whereas older hemorrhage shows erythrocyte ghosts and hemosiderin deposition. Prussian blue staining confirms iron and helps distinguish recent from remote bleeding, which is useful when correlating with clinical timing and prior trauma or photodamage. I should confirm that glycophorin immunohistochemistry can identify erythrocyte ghosts when RBCs have lysed, which can be helpful in subtle cases [^bba692de].

> Next, I should review clinical contexts where erythrocyte extravasation is expected versus when it should prompt a broader workup. Expected settings include solar purpura in photoaged skin, straightforward traumatic ecchymoses, and certain benign entities like pigmented purpuric dermatoses, where a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and hemosiderin is classic. Conversely, if erythrocyte extravasation accompanies leukocytoclasis, fibrin, or systemic symptoms, I need to consider vasculitis, drug reactions, infections, or hematologic disorders and escalate evaluation accordingly [^f2a2b906] [^763f4a04] [^cdab6be9].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis so I don't miss important mimics. Entities that can show extravasated erythrocytes without vasculitis include urticaria, viral exanthems, drug eruptions, and pigmented purpuric dermatoses. Entities that show extravasation with vasculitis include leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and vasculitis secondary to drugs or infections. I should double-check for clues like palpable purpura, systemic symptoms, medication history, and serologies to separate benign extravasation from vasculitic disease [^a88bc2ed] [^866afe6c] [^f757678e].

> Let me think about management principles, and I should confirm they align with the underlying cause. For solar purpura, counseling on sun protection, minimizing mechanical trauma, and reassurance are key. For traumatic purpura, supportive care, analgesia, and observation suffice unless there is concern for deeper injury or coagulopathy. If vasculitis or another systemic process is suspected, I need to ensure appropriate labs, imaging, and specialty referral, and treat the underlying disease rather than the extravasation itself, which is a marker rather than the driver of pathology [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2] [^cdab6be9].

> But wait, what if the purpura is nonblanching and palpable with systemic features? I should confirm whether there is vessel wall damage and fibrin on histology, because that would shift me toward vasculitis and away from simple solar or traumatic purpura. In that scenario, I need to check for infections, drugs, autoimmune disease, and hematologic abnormalities, and manage per vasculitis protocols rather than attributing findings to benign extravasation [^cdab6be9] [^f757678e].

> In summary, erythrocyte extravasation is a histopathologic finding that, in the right clinical context of solar or traumatic purpura, supports a benign mechanical or photodamage-related process rather than vasculitis. I should confirm the absence of vasculitic features, correlate with clinical history and special stains for hemosiderin, and avoid overcalling systemic disease when the pattern is consistent with expected benign extravasation [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2] [^bba692de].

Erythrocyte extravasation in solar or traumatic purpura reflects **mechanical vessel injury** from dermal atrophy and fragility (solar) or direct trauma, causing red blood cells to leak into the dermis without true vasculitis [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2]. Histology shows **extravasated erythrocytes** with minimal inflammation and no vessel wall necrosis or fibrin, distinguishing it from vasculitis [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2]. Clinically, lesions are nonpalpable, nonblanching macules or patches on sun-exposed or traumatized sites, often resolving with hemosiderin deposition and hyperpigmentation [^f2a2b906] [^763f4a04]. Management is supportive: avoid trauma, protect from sun, and reassure; biopsy is reserved for atypical or persistent cases to exclude vasculitis or other purpuric disorders [^a2ebd7a2].

---

## Pathophysiology

Solar purpura results from **chronic photodamage** causing dermal atrophy, loss of collagen and elastic fibers, and marked fragility of superficial blood vessels, so minor trauma or even normal movement leads to red cell extravasation [^f2a2b906]. Traumatic purpura results from **direct mechanical injury** to dermal vessels from blunt force, friction, or pressure, disrupting vessel walls and allowing red cells to escape into the dermis [^a2ebd7a2]. Both mechanisms produce **extravasation without vasculitis**, i.e. without vessel wall inflammation, necrosis, or fibrin deposition [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2].

---

## Histopathological features

Key histopathological findings include:

- **Extravasated erythrocytes**: present in the papillary and upper reticular dermis, often perivascular but not within vessel walls [^f2a2b906] [^763f4a04].

- **Minimal inflammation**: sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate without neutrophils, eosinophils, or leukocytoclasis [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2].

- **Absence of vasculitis**: no vessel wall necrosis, fibrin deposition, or endothelial swelling [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2].

- **Hemosiderin deposition**: golden-brown pigment in macrophages (siderophages) in older lesions, reflecting erythrocyte breakdown and iron storage [^f2a2b906] [^763f4a04].

- **Solar elastosis**: in solar purpura, basophilic degeneration of dermal collagen and elastic fibers is common [^f2a2b906].

## Clinical presentation

| **Feature** | **Solar purpura** | **Traumatic purpura** |
|-|-|-|
| Age | Elderly, typically > 60 years | Any age |
| Location | Sun-exposed areas: dorsal hands, forearms, neck, face | Sites of trauma: arms, legs, trunk, face |
| Morphology | Nonpalpable, nonblanching violaceous macules or patches, often irregular or linear | Nonpalpable, nonblanching ecchymoses, often round or oval, may be linear if friction-related |
| Course | Chronic, recurrent, fades to brown hyperpigmentation | Acute, resolves with yellow-green discoloration and clearing in 1–2 weeks |
| Symptoms | Usually asymptomatic or mildly tender | Pain, tenderness, or itch at trauma site |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Entities to consider and exclude include:

- **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**: palpable purpura with neutrophils, nuclear dust, and fibrin in vessel walls [^cdab6be9] [^cc5cb2c2].

- **Urticarial vasculitis**: urticarial plaques lasting > 24 hours with erythrocyte extravasation and variable vasculitis [^f757678e] [^ca3921e7].

- **Pigmented purpuric dermatoses**: chronic, bilateral lower extremity petechiae with lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate and hemosiderin [^763f4a04] [^bd306ca5].

- **Coagulopathies**: platelet disorders, anticoagulant use, or von Willebrand disease causing easy bruising [^215f6e6c] [^fdb42801].

- **Drug-induced purpura**: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, or aspirin-related bruising [^215f6e6c].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical history**: onset, trauma, sun exposure, medications, bleeding history, family history [^215f6e6c].

- **Physical examination**: distribution, morphology, palpability, blanching, associated features [^f2a2b906].

- **Laboratory tests**: usually not needed; consider CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, platelet function if bleeding history or atypical features [^215f6e6c].

- **Skin biopsy**: reserve for atypical, persistent, or diagnostic uncertainty to exclude vasculitis or other purpuric diseases [^a2ebd7a2].

---

## Management

Management is **supportive and preventive**:

- **Avoid trauma**: protective clothing, padding, gentle skin care [^f2a2b906].

- **Sun protection**: regular sunscreen, protective clothing, minimizing sun exposure [^f2a2b906].

- **Patient education**: explain benign nature, expected course, and warning signs for concern [^f2a2b906].

- **Topical agents**: mild corticosteroids or vitamin K creams may reduce inflammation or bruising in some cases (limited evidence) [^notfound].

- **Treat underlying factors**: address medications or coagulopathies if present [^215f6e6c].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; both solar and traumatic purpura are benign, chronic conditions with cosmetic impact but no systemic risk. Lesions resolve slowly with hyperpigmentation, and recurrences are common without ongoing protection [^f2a2b906] [^763f4a04].

---

Erythrocyte extravasation in solar or traumatic purpura reflects **mechanical vessel injury** without vasculitis, producing nonpalpable purpura that heals with hemosiderin deposition. Recognition relies on clinical context and, when needed, histology to exclude vasculitis; management centers on trauma avoidance, sun protection, and reassurance [^f2a2b906] [^a2ebd7a2].

### Intraplaque haemorrhages as the trigger of plaque vulnerability [^bba692de]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Histopathological description

Histopathological studies are limited by the difficulties of precisely dating fibrin-rich intraplaque haemorrhages by histological examination due to the detersion of haemorrhagic products by phagocytes and progressive oxidative and proteolytic transformation. Virmani and Robertsreported that the frequency of intraplaque, erythrocyte extravasation, and the presence of iron and fibrin were proportional to the number of atherothrombotic plaques present. Moreover, intraplaque iron and fibrin were mainly present in association with extravasated erythrocytes, suggesting that all the blood components of haemorrhages are present within the plaque, including plasma and cellular components. Recently, intraplaque haemorrhages have been observed macroscopically by the presence of red liquid in plaques (Figure 1, upper panel), identified microscopically by the presence of more or less intact erythrocytes (Figure 3) in the core of the plaque, or indirectly characterized by the presence of free haemoglobin, and iron staining with Prussian blue, observed as haemosiderin present in phagocytic cells (Figure 2, right panel). In the absence of intact erythrocytes, the presence of a large amount of iron provides evidence of older haemorrhages. Erythrocyte 'ghosts' can also be identified by the presence of glycophorin, an abundant antigenic protein of the erythrocyte membrane, detectable by immunohistochemistry(Figure 3 D). A recent autopsy study observed a higher density of neovessels in non-stenotic, human coronary plaques, which correlated with the presence of iron and glycophorin.

### Myospherulosis [^2078889e]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Myospherulosis is a rare tumor caused by interaction of extravasated erythrocytes and exogenous or endogenous lipids. Fifty-nine articles presented 181 patients with myospherulosis since first description in 1969. Myospherulosis seems to occur in any age and in any part of the body; however, most frequent sites are paranasal sinus and subcutaneous tissue. In most cases, exogenous lipids from postoperative packing are damaging the erythrocytes, but also spontaneous cases are described. Diagnosis is made by histology but can be already suggested by radiographic imaging. Differential diagnoses include infections by fungi or algae due to histopathologic similarity. Besides that, radiographic imaging and morphology can wrongly be interpreted as carcinomas, metastases, osteofibrosis, or echinococcosis. Myospherulosis is a benign process, with symptoms deriving from the space occupying character and surgical excision can bring cure. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment and provide a systematic review of the literature on myospherulosis.

### A systematic review of histopathologic surveys on mucocutaneous biopsies in patients developed COVID-19 vaccine-related dermatologic manifestations [^895b338f]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Coronavirus 2 is an infectious agent primarily identified as the cause of a pandemic viral pneumonia. With the mass vaccination against this virus, one of the health issues is the safety of currently available vaccines considering their adverse reactions. This systematic review was conducted to assess and summarize all reported data on histopathologic findings associated with mucocutaneous reactions that developed after COVID-19 vaccination for a better pathophysiology interpretation and clinical management of these reactions. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases as well as Google Scholar engine for relevant English articles published till July 1, 2022. This review includes 131 studies with a total number of 287 cases. Eruptions that underwent a biopsy were mostly described as erythematous maculopapular, papulosquamous, vasculitis-like, lichenoid, or urticarial lesions. Histopathology revealed spongiosis, interstitial, and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration, erythrocyte extravasation, parakeratosis, endothelial inflammation, and the like. Findings were highly consistent with morbilliform erythema, psoriasiform dermatosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and lichenoid or urticarial drug reactions. The majority of these reactions had a mild nature and were primarily observed in patients with underlying health conditions. Microscopic evaluation was also consistent with transient inflammatory changes, and features like neutrophilic infiltrates, subcorneal pustules, and vasculopathy were less frequently reported than what seen in COVID infection. Therefore, dermatologic reactions developing after vaccination in the general population should not hinder a complete vaccination.

### Blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown and pericyte reductions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1d0d68c1]. Acta Neuropathologica (2013). Low credibility.

In the present study, we utilized high resolution histopathologic analyses to determine whether BSCB disruption in humans with ALS results in extravasation of erythrocytes in motor neuron dense regions of the spinal cord, and whether BSCB disruption in human ALS is associated with a reduction in the pericyte population. We show not only that capillary leakage of erythrocytes and plasma proteins is present in ALS, but also that vascular rupture coincides with reductions in capillary pericyte populations in human ALS spinal cord tissue specimens. These findings raise a number of questions regarding the significance and/or contributory role of vascular dysfunction in ALS pathogenesis.

### Blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown and pericyte reductions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^84dbb1bd]. Acta Neuropathologica (2013). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin is toxic to motor neurons and neural cells expressing different SOD1 mutants in vitro through iron-dependent oxidative injury. In mouse models of ALS and in pericyte-deficient mice with disrupted PDGFRβ signaling in pericytes, BSCB disruption with erythrocyte extravasation and/or motor neuron accumulation of extravasated plasma-proteins such as thrombin and fibrin precedes motor neuron injury. Whether small foci of extravasated erythrocytes can contribute to motor neuron injury in the spinal cord of ALS patients, and whether extravasated proteins (e.g. fibrin, thrombin) localize on the surface or inside motor neurons in human ALS, as found in cortical and/or motor neurons in pericyte-deficient mice or transgenic apolipoprotein E4-expressing mice, require future experimental investigation.

Perivascular hemosiderin deposits account for perivascular hypointensities of T2✱-weighted MRI analysis utilized clinically for the detection of intracerebral microhemorrhage. The small size of spinal cord hemosiderin deposits as described in the present study may pose a significant barrier to the sensitivity and specificity of conventional T2✱-weighted MRI imaging pulse sequences in human subjects. Therefore, MRI studies in ALS patients should be interpreted with caution. For example, one brain MRI study failed to detect microhemorrhages that were < 100 μm in diameter in a small number of ALS patients, possibly due to limited resolution of imaging. Future studies are needed combining MRI and histopathologic analyses to better optimize pulse sequences for the detection of perivascular hemosiderin deposits in ALS patients, especially in the spinal cord, which has yet to be investigated. Whether ALS patients develop BBB disruption with erythrocyte extravasation, hemosiderin deposition, and/or pericyte reductions in motor cortex and affected brainstem motor nuclei remains to be seen.

WHAT IS THE DIAGNOSIS?

Diagnosis: Thrombogenic vasculopathy

Histopathology revealed superficial epidermal necrosis and intradermal capillary microthrombi (arrowheads) with extravasated erythrocytes at 4.4× magnification (Figure 2, H&E stain). A pauci‐perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was appreciated without vasculitis or papillary dermal edema. One week following onset of her skin findings, the patient developed persistent tachypnea, and subsequent CT angiography of the chest revealed a right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism which was treated with enoxaparin.

Severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction

There are COVID‐19‐positive cases severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions including DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) described, which is a severe cutaneous drug reaction with nonspecific histologic findings (Figure 9A, B). The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters including frequently occurring hepatic abnormalities, eosinophilia and exanthema with facial swelling, and lymphadenopathy. The culprit drug should be stopped immediately upon identification.

### Lichen aureus: an unusual histopathological presentation: a case report and a review of literature [^29841a71]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2014). Low credibility.

Lichen aureus (LA) presents an inflammatory infiltrate with a lichenoid pattern, which mainly localizes to the superficial dermis, and it is admixed with extravasated erythrocytes. We present the case of a 12-year-old male who had a 1.3-cm golden-brown-color patch on the right upper back for 2 weeks. Histopathologic examination revealed a lichenoid, superficial, and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with perineural and periappendageal involvement, extravasated erythrocytes, papillary dermal edema, and hemosiderophages. The perineural and periappendageal infiltrate is unusual for LA and suggestive of lichen striatus (LS). In addition, the presence of perineural inflammation is not a common feature for either LA or LS. However, given the clinical findings, taken together, these features were interpreted as being most consistent with LA. To the best of our knowledge, no previous case of LA has been reported with histological features of perineural inflammation and LS.

### Urticarial vasculitis and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome [^cdab6be9]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis is a clinicopathologic entity in which episodes of urticaria are accompanied by histopathologic features of cutaneous vasculitis. The histopathologic definition of vasculitis varies from report to report. In this article, vasculitis is defined as histopathologic features of blood vessel damage: There should be evidence of leukocytoclasis and vessel wall destruction, which may or may not be accompanied by fibrinoid deposits. Red blood cell extravasation and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate also may be present. The extent to which each of these elements must be present has been debated.

### Radiation-induced skin injuries to patients: what the interventional radiologist needs to know [^4a98f9c3]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of Radiation-Induced Skin Reactions and Injuries

On histologic examination, morphological findings depend on the phase of radiation injury. The immediate and delayed erythema is accompanied by widening of the rete ridges, edematous swelling of the dermis, dilatation of the dermal vessels, swelling of the endothelia and fibrous thickening of the vessel walls, first precipitating erythema and then teleangiectases. Intravascular thromboses and erythrocyte extravasation have also been described. Atrophy of the epidermis and adnexal structures (hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands), and/or degeneration of basal keratinocytes are found at later stages and correlate with hair loss. In addition, dermal collagen fibers appear coarse and increased in number. Hyperpigmentary changes correlate with an increase in dermal melanophages.

On the molecular level, depending on the absorbed energy, ionizing radiation can break chemical bonds and cause ionization of molecules such as DNA, membrane lipids, proteins and even water. Because ionizing irradiation affects the cell cycle, DNA damage occurs primarily in the proliferating epidermal keratinocytes of the basal cell layer, resulting in various types of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis). This process is accompanied by the secretion of the second messengers including inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandins). In the dermis, these inflammatory mediators cause changes in vessel endothelia, fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. The final result of exposure to ionizing radiation is skin inflammation. In severe cases of radiation exposure, toxins and/or unrestricted inflammation can result in overt destruction of the epidermis. Following restoration of epidermal integrity, long-term effects of skin irradiation comprise increased risk of skin cancers, hyperkeratoses, cutaneous atrophy, hair loss (epilation), telangiectasia, hemangiomas and fibrosis.

### Skin erythrodiapedesis during chronic venous disorders [^2648ca38]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Extravasation of erythrocytes (erythrodiapedesis [ED]) is currently included among causes of skin damage in legs with chronic venous disorders (CVD) and ascribed to venular hypertension. ED is followed by erythrocyte disruption, degradation of hemoglobin, and storing of ferric iron into hemosiderin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of ED in the skin of legs with different clinical stages of CVD.

Methods

One hundred eighteen skin biopsies from legs with CVD underwent histologic evaluation for ED and hemosiderin deposition (HD).

Results

ED was found in only 21/118 specimens. In particular, it was found in ulcer samples, in tissues surrounding varicophlebitis and, finally, in acute eczematous skin. ED was found in only 15/30 samples showing HD.

Conclusion

Our findings confirm the occurrence of ED during CVD. However, it was found only in concomitance of severe dermal inflammation. Hemosiderin deposition in the absence of actual ED could be explained with previous healed episodes of skin inflammation. However, ED is not likely the only cause of skin iron overload, which could also occur by a molecular mechanism. Further studies are needed to define the mechanism of iron deposition in the skin of legs afflicted with CVD.

### Purpuric eruption in a child [^adb9c631]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)
B. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)
C. Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD)
D. Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS)
E. Exanthematous drug eruption

Answers:
A. HSP – Incorrect. HSP is a type of small-vessel vasculitis seen mostly in children, commonly after an upper respiratory tract infection. It presents with palpable purpura and is often associated with extracutaneous manifestations such as arthralgias, abdominal pain, and nephritis. Pathology in HSP shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels.
B. RMSF – Incorrect. The patient had no relevant travel history to endemic regions. Additionally, RMSF is commonly preceded by systemic symptoms such as fever, severe headache, and myalgias. Pathology in RMSF shows early perivascular edema, erythrocyte extravasation, thrombosis, and vasculitis in later lesions.
C. HFMD – Incorrect. HFMD presents with oval-shaped vesicles on the hands and feet and oral lesions which were not present in this patient.
D. PPGSS – Correct. The clinical presentation of erythematous and purpuric patches on the hands and feet were consistent with this condition. Serum testing showed Coxsackie B6 as the culprit, a previously reported cause of PPGSS. Pathology showed a superficial perivascular mixed infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and dermal hemorrhage. Because histopathologic findings in PPGSS are nonspecific and common to viral exanthems, biopsy is not needed as part of the evaluation. In this case, it was performed to exclude vasculitis.
E. Exanthematous drug eruption – Incorrect. This condition presents with confluent macules and papules and not exclusively on hands and feet. The patient's parents did not recall any recent medications.

### The histopathology of urticaria revisited-clinical pathological study [^a88bc2ed]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The classic histopathological findings of urticaria include dermal edema and a sparse perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. However, this pattern is inconsistently described.

Objective

To describe the histological and immunofluorescence characteristics of urticaria and to identify distinctive patterns.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed in which the medical files and biopsy specimens of 58 patients with acute and chronic classical urticaria were reviewed. Pathological parameters were quantified.

Results

We recognized 2 distinctive patterns of urticaria: lymphocyte and neutrophil predominant; the former was characterized by a perivascular location, whereas the latter was associated with an interstitial location and a denser infiltrate. Mast cells were relatively sparse, better demonstrated with special stains. Tryptase stain demonstrated more mast cells than Giemsa stain. Extravasated erythrocytes were present in 50% of the cases, but vasculitis was not observed.

Conclusions

Histological findings in classical urticaria show a spectrum of findings from a sparse superficial perivascular to a deep perivascular and interstitial infiltrate. Distinctive groups based on the dominant cell type can be identified, accounting for the similarity to neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis. Lesions may have a purpuric appearance, but leukocytoclastic vasculitis is never present.

### Microvascular pathology and morphometrics of sporadic and hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain [^206119ad]. Brain Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral microbleeds and hemosiderin

Cerebral microbleeds are an imaging construct to represent ferromagnetic hemosiderin iron derived from extravasation of erythrocytes. Cerebral microbleeds detected by T2‐W* or echo gradient MRI are also associated with histopathological evidence of lipohyalinosis and CAA 31. They are likely a surrogate marker of SVD evident on MRI along with lacunes and WM changes 111. The prevalence of radiological microbleeds in SVD ranges from 35% to 85%. Both radiological cerebral microbleeds and foci of hemosiderin containing single crystalloids, or larger perivascular aggregates, are found in the brains of older subjects including those diagnosed with VaD and CADASIL 72, but the radiological and pathological relationship between these findings has not been entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests that cerebral microbleeds detected by MRI are a surrogate marker for ischemic SVD rather than exclusively hemorrhagic diathesis 55. Greater putamen hemosiderin was significantly associated with indices of small vessel ischemia, including microinfarcts, arteriolosclerosis, perivascular spacing and lacunes in any brain region, but not large vessel disease or whole brain measures of neurodegenerative pathology. It appears that brain iron homeostasis and small vessel ischemic change are responsible for these rather than minor episodes of cerebrovascular extravasation.

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^a2ebd7a2]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is an appropriate intervention in the management of this condition?
A. Avoidance of skin biopsy
B. Psychiatric evaluation
C. Autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test
D. Referral for malignancy workup
E. Oral corticosteroids

Answers:
A. Avoidance of skin biopsy – Incorrect. Skin biopsy of ecchymosis will show extravascular erythrocytes and edema in the epidermis or dermis. Histopathologic examination can be useful to help exclude vasculitis.
B. Psychiatric evaluation – Correct. PP can present in patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder. A detailed evaluation should be considered, as this may lead to a psychoemotional diagnosis that may otherwise go untreated. Because there is no confirmatory test, the diagnosis of PP is largely one of exclusion. Medication review and laboratory studies would be appropriate to rule out disorders that could predispose patients to ecchymosis.
C. Autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test – Incorrect. An autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test is positive if an ecchymosis develops at the site of injected autologous erythrocytes. Historically, this test was used for diagnosis of PP; however, its utility is now controversial because of lack of standardization and data on its validity.
D. Referral for malignancy workup – Incorrect. An association between PP and an underlying malignancy has not been reported. Hematologic malignancy may present with ecchymosis; however, prodromal of symptoms and lack of trauma in the area prior to the development of ecchymosis may not be present.
E. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. There is no standardized treatment of PP. Glucocorticoids, hormonal contraceptives, and antibiotics are ineffective. Investigators have reported improvement in skin conditions with treatment of the underlying psychiatric disease, if one is present.

### Febrile ulceronecrotic mucha-habermann disease in a 22-month-old boy: a case presentation and literature review [^d618b780]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We report a 22-month-old boy with febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease who presented with rapid progression of necrotic skin lesions and fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology, which revealed interface dermatitis, intraepidermal vesiculation, and erythrocyte extravasation. Immunohistochemistry revealed perivascular T-cell infiltration. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antivirals achieved resolution. This case highlights diagnostic challenges and emphasizes the importance of integrating histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and prompt multimodal therapy.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulceration as a presenting feature of pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^a410a8f9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 16-year-old, previously healthy male presented to his primary care physician with acne-like lesions on his face, chest, upper back and arms. He was treated with topical antibiotic and retinoids in addition to oral antibiotics for 2 months; however, the lesions progressed and developed into ulcerations (Fig. 1 a). Skin biopsies were performed and initially interpreted as perifollicular inflammation with giant cell reaction and abscess formation consistent with acne. Treatment with oral prednisone, 80 mg daily for suspected PG was initiated with some improvement. A few weeks later, he developed systemic symptoms of cough and sinusitis. Chest CT scan showed central upper lobe nodular consolidating opacity with peripheral ground glass in a peri-bronchial vascular distribution and mild stenosis of some sub-segmental airways. The rheumatology team was consulted and the diagnosis of GPA was made according to EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for childhood GPA based on sinus, pulmonary, and renal (focally crescentic, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis) involvement in addition to elevated inflammatory markers and a positive PR3. Upon further review, the initial skin biopsy was interpreted as palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and erythrocyte extravasation (Fig. 2). He was treated with plasmapheresis, followed by 2 doses of IV cyclophosphamide and a course of rituximab (two doses of 1000 mg given 2 weeks apart). He was given intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days) initially, and then oral prednisone (60 mg/day (0.67 mg/kg/day) tapered off over 6 months). This treatment course, which was chosen based on the extensive pulmonary findings, renal involvement and worsening PG-like ulcerations resulted in significant improvement of the skin ulcerations (Fig. 1 b) and his systemic disease. He continues in remission on rituximab maintenance therapy every 6 months.

### Magnetic resonance imaging-defined areas of microvascular obstruction after acute myocardial infarction represent microvascular destruction and haemorrhage [^a8a8c0d9]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Lack of gadolinium-contrast wash-in on first-pass perfusion imaging, early gadolinium-enhanced imaging, or late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging after revascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is commonly referred to as microvascular obstruction (MVO). Additionally, T2-weighted imaging allows for the visualization of infarct-related oedema and intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH) within the infarction. However, the exact histopathological correlate of the contrast-devoid core and its relation to IMH is unknown.

Methods and Results

In eight Yorkshire swine, the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 75 min by a balloon catheter. After 7 days, CMR with cine imaging, T2-weighted turbospinecho, and LGE was performed. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance images were compared with histological findings after phosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin and anti-CD31/haematoxylin staining. These findings were compared with CMR findings in 27 consecutive PCI-treated STEMI patients, using the same scanning protocol. In the porcine model, the infarct core contained extensive necrosis and erythrocyte extravasation, without intact vasculature and hence, no MVO. The surrounding-gadolinium-enhanced-area contained granulation tissue, leucocyte infiltration, and necrosis with morphological intact microvessels containing microthrombi, without erythrocyte extravasation. Areas with IMH (median size 1.92 [0.36–5.25] cm³) and MVO (median size 2.19 [0.40–4.58] cm³) showed close anatomic correlation [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.85, r = 0.85, P = 0.03]. Of the 27 STEMI patients, 15 had IMH (median size 6.60 [2.49–9.79] cm³) and 16 had MVO (median size 4.31 [1.05–7.57] cm³). Again, IMH and MVO showed close anatomic correlation (ICC 0.87, r = 0.93, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The contrast-devoid core of revascularized STEMI contains extensive erythrocyte extravasation with microvascular damage. Attenuating the reperfusion-induced haemorrhage may be a novel target in future adjunctive STEMI treatment.

### Herpes incognito most commonly is herpes zoster and its histopathologic pattern is distinctive! [^d8d5bfea]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2006). Low credibility.

Infections of the skin by herpesviruses do not always present themselves in typical fashion. Conventional microscopy is used routinely to confirm infection by herpesviruses, but sometimes typical signs such as multinucleated epithelial cells or "ghosts" of them are not encountered in a specimen (so-called herpes incognito). We studied 35 patients in whom infection with herpesviruses was differentially diagnosed clinically but in whom a biopsy specimen had been taken for confirmation. Only those patients in whom histopathologic findings had been interpreted as being "not diagnostic" of herpesvirus infection by 2 independent dermatopathologists were included. Clinical and histopathologic findings were correlated with results from polymerase chain reaction studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Polymerase chain reaction revealed herpesvirus-specific DNA in 12 of 35 specimens, 10 being varicella zoster virus (VZV) positive, 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 positive, and 1 HSV-1 positive. Ten of these 12 cases presented themselves in very similar fashion (8 VZV, 1 HSV-1, 1 HSV-2). All lesions were macular or papular and typified mostly by dense perivascular and sparse interstitial superficial and deep infiltrates of lymphocytes, sometimes assuming a patchy lichenoid pattern. Infiltrates were prominent in and around adnexal structures, often peppering follicles, sebaceous glands, and eccrine glands. Lymphocytes were also found in the lower part of the epidermis accompanied by a combination of spongiosis and vacuolar alteration. The papillary dermis was often edematous; extravasated erythrocytes in variable numbers were a common finding. Lymphocytes sometimes had large and polygonal nuclei. Neutrophils and nuclear dust were present occasionally; eosinophils were rare. We conclude that herpes incognito most commonly is herpes zoster and its histopathologic pattern is distinctive.

### SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, skin and immunology-what do we know so far? [^866afe6c]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Virus‐induced maculopapular exanthema

Although skin biopsies are rarely taken from viral skin lesions, because the features observed are mostly not very specific, biopsies might be an option to differentiate viral exanthema from drug‐induced exanthema in COVID‐19 patients; in these cases, it is essential to do the differential diagnosis and rule out the pharmacological cause.

To distinguish infectious exanthema from exanthema induced by drug hypersensitivity reactions, histologic features and immunologic changes in the skin might help to diagnostically differentiate both entities.

Immunologic features of maculopapular virus exanthema known so far are summarized in Figure 5A. Typical histologic features of infectious exanthema induced by viremia or dissemination of infectious agents through the blood are shown in Table 2 and Figure 6A.

### Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus for clinicians-virology, pathogenesis, and pathology [^18100a10]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathology

To date, few autopsy or necropsy reports of CCHF patients have been published. Histopathologic reports on 2 skin biopsies noted diffuse extravasation of erythrocytes into the epithelial interstitium, associated with hemorrhages in the skin (Appendix reference 51). Anecdotally, a liver biopsy obtained during a nosocomial outbreak in South Africa in 1984 showed interhepatocyte infiltration of erythrocytes with diffuse extravasation (Appendix reference 51). Using electron microscopy, evidence of pericapillary edema and autolysis of hepatocytes, as well as intracytoplasmatic virions in epithelial cells of hepatic sinusoids and portal vessels, were observed (Appendix reference 51). Evidence of hepatic lesions ranged from disseminated necrosis to multiple necrotic foci. Of note, the foci of viral antigen demonstrated by immunofluorescence was disproportionate to the severity of necrosis, suggesting injury mechanisms other than direct viral cytopathic effect. Thrombus formation in central and portal veins was found in patients with more severe liver involvement (Appendix reference 52). More recent reviews of liver pathology using immunohistochemistry demonstrated infection of Kupffer cells, hepatic endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, with mononuclear portal inflammation, and necrosis characterized by hemorrhage. A marked splenic lymphoid apoptosis and lymphocyte depletion with dilated sinusoids were also described.

Petechial hemorrhage of serosa, liver and spleen capsule, and intestinal hyperemia are visible by macroscopic exam. Necropsy from an autochthonous case in Spain, in addition to hepatocyte necrosis, demonstrated cytoplasmic macrovesiculation and microvesiculation, complete epithelial denudation of the colon, occasional microthrombi, and bone marrow hemorrhages (Appendix reference 53). A study from Turkey of 5 confirmed and 14 suspected CCHF cases demonstrated hemophagocytosis with unclear clinical significance in the bone marrow of 7 patients (Appendix reference 54).

### Cerebral malaria in children: using the retina to study the brain [^7a3e0278]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Endothelial dysfunction may also result from P. falciparum -associated reductions in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and bioavailability (reviewed in), and increased oxidative stress (Narsaria et al. 2012), which can reduce erythrocyte deformability and impair neurovascular coupling as well as control of vascular tone (reviewed in).

These points illustrate how tissue damage associated with sequestration may be caused through synergistic mechanisms, including (and probably not limited to) inflammation and coagulation, in addition to congestion of blood flow secondary to reductions in lumen diameter. Local coagulopathy and loss of endothelial barrier function are consistent with haemorrhage and brain swelling seen in the paediatric brain, and with quantifiable manifestations of malarial retinopathy.

Haemorrhage

Histopathology reveals subtypes of cerebral malaria within fatal retinopathy-positive paediatric cerebral malaria. In Malawi 75% of cases coming to autopsy have sequestration with associated perivascular haemorrhages and intravascular microthrombi, wheras 25% have sequestration but no haemorrhages or other perivascular pathology visible on routine haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections.

Petechial haemorrhages on the cut surface of fresh brain correspond to microscopic ring haemorrhages. Ring haemorrhages occur frequently in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, and extend to the grey–white border. They are rare in cortical and subcortical grey matter, but occur throughout the cerebellum and brainstem. Diffuse axonal injury follows the same distribution.

In general, ring haemorrhages in paediatric cerebral malaria consist of extravasated uninfected erythrocytes; each haemorrhage is centred on a distended capillary containing infected erythrocytes and commonly a microthrombus.

Brain swelling and vessel leakage

Studies of paediatric cerebral malaria where retinopathy status was either unknown or a combination of retinopathy-positive and retinopathy-negative cases, have found raised opening pressure at lumbar puncture, clinical signs consistent with brain herniation (12/12 fatal cases, 17/49 survivors), papilloedema, and enlarged optic nerve sheath diameter.

Raised brain weight and extravasation of fibrinogen from microvessels occurs in histpathologically confirmed paediatric cerebral malaria, although these do not distinguish cerebral malaria from fatal coma of other cause. Leakage is most often associated with vascular pathology such as haemorrhage, but fibrinogen is also seen in cerebral grey matter where haemorrhages are absent. Focal loss of blood–brain barrier cell junction proteins (ZO1, occludin, vinculin) occurs adjacent to sequestration. The distribution of fibrinogen, IgG and C5b-9 in these cases did not indicate widespread leakage into brain tissue.

### Gloves and socks syndrome: early and late histopathologic features [^2accdd1c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Gloves and socks syndrome (GSS) is a recently described exanthem, most commonly caused by parvovirus B19.

Objective

Our purpose was to describe both early and late histopathologic features of GSS.

Methods

We performed histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens from a case of GSS and reviewed all the English-language literature reports of GSS to compare the reported histologic descriptions.

Results

A total of 46 cases of GSS have been reported in the English-language literature. In 18 of those, the pathologic features were described. The histologic features of the current case evolved from a nonspecific superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate to a vacuolar interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes, erythrocyte extravasation, and a superficial perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate.

Conclusion

Early lesions of GSS show nonspecific features common to viral exanthems. The late features, of a fully evolved exanthem, demonstrate a vacuolar interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes, a superficial perivascular and interstitial infiltrate, and dermal hemorrhage. These late pathologic features, together with the clinical appearance of GSS, may help distinguish it from other entities.

### A linear purpuric rash in an elderly man [^8a0d5d09]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Linear lichenoid pigmented purpura – Correct. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis (PPD) describes a group of chronic skin disorders characterized by distinct red-to-golden brown macules, patches, and papules with petechiae. PPD is generally divided into 55 major variants, with linear pigmented purpura – also known as unilateral linear capillaritis – being a rarer form. It often presents unilaterally on an extremity, sometimes in a blaschkoid distribution such as in our patient. On histology, lymphocytic inflammation with extravasated erythrocytes in the upper dermis is seen. Our patient's histology was consistent with a lichenoid pattern, helping further classify the diagnosis as the even more rare linear lichenoid pigmented purpura.
B. Lichen striatus – Incorrect. Lichen striatus primarily occurs in children, and skin biopsy shows peri-eccrine lymphocytic inflammation.
C. Linear lichen planus – Incorrect. Linear lichen planus presents with significant pruritus, deep purple-colored lesions, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. In addition, histology shows a lichenoid band of inflammation in the papillary dermis with epidermal hyperplasia and hypergranulosis but without extravasated erythrocytes.
D. Linear Darier disease – Incorrect. Segmental Darier disease is typically composed of keratotic, sometimes crusted, papules that are pink to red-brown rather than purpuric. Histopathologic findings include acantholysis and dyskeratosis.
E. Linear psoriasis – Incorrect. Linear psoriasis typically presents as intensely pruritic, erythematous, and scaly papules and plaques along Blaschko's lines. Biopsy would not show a lichenoid infiltrate.

### Prolonged urticaria with purpura: the spectrum of clinical and histopathologic features in a prospective series of 22 patients exhibiting the clinical features of urticarial vasculitis [^f757678e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Biopsy specimens of lesions with clinical features of urticarial vasculitis often show a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils and red blood cell extravasation. Only occasionally is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis encountered, confirming a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical presentation and histologic features of patients who meet the clinical criteria for urticarial vasculitis.

Methods

Patients were recruited who had persistent urticarial lesions individually lasting longer than 24 hours, associated with at least 2 of 3 of the following: pain or tenderness; purpura or dusky changes; and resolution with hyperpigmentation. Patients were interviewed based on a standard questionnaire with regard to their symptoms. Blood tests and chest radiographs were performed to exclude systemic involvement and hypocomplementemia. Skin biopsy specimens were sent for histology and direct immunofluorescence.

Results

Of 22 patients recruited, 19 (86.4%) showed a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate on histology. Three cases (13.6%) had a neutrophil-predominant infiltrate associated with a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Twenty (90.9%) had a superficial perivascular infiltrate, and two (9.1%) had a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate. In all, 21 biopsy specimens (95.5%) showed inflammatory cells within dermal blood vessel walls, obscuring the vessel outline in some. Endothelial cell swelling was seen in 20 biopsy specimens (90.9%), erythrocyte extravasation in 17 (77.3%), nuclear dust in 5 (22.7%), and fibrin extravasation in 2 (9.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed the following features to be independently associated with neutrophil predominance: fulfillment of all 3 minor criteria for urticarial vasculitis-like lesions (P = 0.007); presence of fibrin on histology (P < .001); presence of nuclear dust on histology (P = 0.001); hypocomplementemia (P = 0.001); and anemia (P = 0.015). There was a trend toward lesions not clearing as readily in the neutrophil-predominant group (P = 0.071), even with two-modality treatment (P = 0.089).

Limitations

Serum immunoelectrophoresis was not done to exclude Schnitzler's syndrome. Electronmicroscopy and cytokine profiling were not performed.

Conclusion

Biopsy specimens of lesions with clinical features of urticarial vasculitis reveal that only a minority of patients has leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The majority has a lymphocyte-predominant histology, associated with varying numbers of eosinophils. We favor a lymphocytic vasculitis as a causative explanation in the lymphocyte-predominant group.

### Whip-like rash in hospitalized patient [^4d132882]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: As seen in this patient's biopsy, what histological findings are consistent with the diagnosis?
A. Spongiotic dermatitis
B. Dermal microthrombi with endothelial damage and red blood cell extravasation
C. Subtle spongiosis and interface dermatitis combined with a dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils
D. Intraepidermal clefting, erosion, and hemorrhage
E. Necrotizing inflammation of medium sized and small arteries with leukocytoclasis

Answers:
A. Spongiotic dermatitis – Incorrect. Spongiotic dermatitis would be expected for contact dermatitis, eczematous dermatitis, and id reaction rather than thermal injury.
B. Dermal microthrombi with endothelial damage and red blood cell extravasation – Incorrect. These histologic findings would be expected for purpura fulminans rather than thermal injury.
C. Subtle spongiosis and interface dermatitis combined with a dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils – Incorrect. These findings are consistent with flagellate erythema due to bleomycin therapy or shitake mushroom intake. Cases of flagellate erythema related to connective tissue disease will often show features of the underlying autoimmune condition, such as dermatomyositis. Cases secondary to bleomycin or shiitake mushrooms predominantly show features compatible with exanthematous and morbilliform drug reactions.
D. Intraepidermal clefting (red arrows in Fig 2), erosions (blue arrows in Fig 2), and hemorrhage (green arrows in Fig 2) – Correct. These findings are consistent with thermal injury and are demonstrated in Fig 2.
E. Necrotizing inflammation of medium sized and small arteries with leukocytoclasis – Incorrect. These histologic findings would be more consistent with vasculitis.

### Epilepsy under my skin? [^50f4f77a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for observation after an unwitnessed syncope. Physical examination revealed skin purpura and bilateral tongue haematoma. Laboratory studies were unremarkable. Radiological imaging showed no abnormalities of the vasculature, signs of thrombosis or brain anomalies. Biopsy of a purpuric lesion revealed extravasation of erythrocytes. After excluding several causes of both syncope and purpura, the typical location of these thoracocervicofacial purpura, the tongue haematoma and an elevated prolactin level (which came back later) led to the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. The patient was referred to the neurology department for follow-up. Within 3 weeks, the purpura were completely resolved, and the patient remained free of seizures during follow-up. In case of an unwitnessed syncope, an epileptic seizure should be carefully considered and thoracocervicofacial purpura can be the pivotal manifestation leading to this diagnosis.

### Linear lichenoid pigmented purpura: an unusual histopathologic pattern [^9e1feaa7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Within the literature, 5 distinct variants of PPD have been described, including progressive pigmentary dermatosis (Schamberg disease), lichen aureus, purpura of Majocchi, eczematoid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis, and pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatitis of Gougerot and Blum. Some rarer forms, including linear and granulomatous pigmented purpura, have been less frequently reported and recognized. PPD most commonly presents bilaterally in the lower extremities. Although some association with venous stasis has been postulated, hemosiderin deposition because of erythrocyte extravasation occurs in the papillary dermis from small cutaneous vessels rather than deeper blood vessels. The development of PPD has not been significantly associated with any underlying diseases or hematologic abnormalities; however, some medications, including acetaminophen, aspirin, glipizide, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, hydralazine, among others have been identified as triggers.

### Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis: a histopathologic study of 31 cases with review of literature [^93c68789]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis defined by diagnostic criteria that include the lack of evidence for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Because of the clinicopathological similarities on the one hand and the strict exclusion on the other hand, we were interested in a systematic evaluation of the relationship between these two diseases. We investigated the clinical and histopathological characteristics of 31 patients with Sweet syndrome, comparing our cases with 32 cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (including seven cases of urticarial vasculitis) and tried to place them in the background of published cases. There is a close relationship between Sweet syndrome and leukocytoclastic vasculitis in terms of clinical appearance, histopathological pattern, triggers, disease course, and response to treatment. The majority of the cases (23/31; 74%) showed histologic evidence of vasculitis, including nuclear dust, extravasation of erythrocytes, fibrin in and around vessel walls, and degeneration of collagen. Although one original criterion for Sweet syndrome is the absence of vasculitis, we propose that vasculitic changes should not exclude the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. In contrast, Sweet syndrome can demonstrate vasculitis and may, similarly to urticarial vasculitis, be regarded a variant of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Clinicopathologic characteristics with acute onset of juicy papules, plaques mostly on the face, shoulder, and trunk, and prominent edema probably reflect modifications of the pathogenetic process based on location and disease acuity.

### Balanitis of zoon: a clinicopathologic study of 45 cases [^d88a2c0c]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2002). Low credibility.

Balanitis of Zoon is a relatively common diagnosis in elderly men, although its nature is controversial and descriptions of its histopathologic features in current textbooks of dermatopathology vary considerably. We studied 45 cases of balanitis of Zoon clinically and histopathologically. The earliest histopathologic changes in cases diagnosed clinically as balanitis of Zoon were slight thickening of the epidermis, parakeratosis, and a patchy lichenoid infiltrate of lymphocytes and some plasma cells. More advanced cases showed atrophy of the epidermis, superficial erosions, a scattering of neutrophils in the upper reaches of the epidermis, scant spongiosis, extravasation of erythrocytes, and a much denser infiltrate with many plasma cells. Additional findings at even later stages were subepidermal clefts, sometimes with loss of the entire epidermis, marked fibrosis of the superficial dermis, and many siderophages. That sequence of histopathologic changes is compatible with the thesis that balanitis of Zoon results from irritation or mild trauma affecting barely keratinized skin in a moist environment. As a reaction to nonspecific stimuli, balanitis of Zoon may be found superimposed on lesions of other diseases and may modify the histopathologic presentation of those diseases to the extent that they are no longer recognizable. In the current study, several cases diagnosed originally as balanitis of Zoon turned out to be examples of allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus, and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It is important, therefore, to recognize balanitis of Zoon as a nonspecific pattern that may occur either as an isolated finding or may complicate other diseases affecting the glans penis or prepuce of uncircumcised men.

### SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant causes mild pathology in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters [^a92a9ef5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

VOC Omicron infection of hamsters displays a lower pathogenicity for the lower respiratory tract than previous VOCs

All SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters showed inflammatory lesions in the lung, but the distribution and severity varied among the groups. Histopathological lesions were characterized by multifocal to coalescing broncho-interstitial pneumonia. Alveoli were often obscured by septal and luminal infiltrates of macrophages and neutrophils/heterophils, admixed with extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin. Conductive airways showed occasional cell death and mucosal infiltration with neutrophils/heterophils and macrophages. Conductive airway epithelia frequently also showed piling up of cells and increased number of mitoses, interpreted as hyperplasia. In addition to alveoli and conductive airways, histopathological lesions were also observed in the vascular compartment. These were characterized by histiocytic and neutrophilic/heterophilic vasculitis with vascular wall degeneration, endothelialitis and luminal endothelial cell proliferation, interpreted as endothelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In addition, perivascular lympho-histiocytic cuffs, perivascular edema, and perivascular hemorrhages were also frequent.

### Clinical characteristics, CT signs, and pathological findings of pyrrolizidine alkaloids-induced sinusoidal obstructive syndrome: a retrospective study [^1a816af8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Histology

Most of PAs-induced HSOS patients did not receive percutaneous liver biopsy due to ascites, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders. In addition, the expense and the unavailability of facility confined the application of transjugular biopsy in our hospitals. Thus, only 12 patients received biopsy procedure in our study, and PAs-induced SOS exhibited different pathological features. The patients received liver biopsy within 1–3 months after the initial presentation. The results of liver functional tests at the time of the liver biopsy were shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Pathological features of the PAs-induced HSOS patients varied from early changes to subacute changes. In acute phase of PAs-induced HSOS (6 cases), liver biopsy showed massive sinusoidal dilatation and sinusoidal congestion predominantly in zone 3 accompanied by the extravasation of erythrocytes into space of Disse. In addition, we found hepatocellular necrosis, the accumulation of macrophages (Fig. 3 a). In subacute stage (6 cases), important features of histopathology were the complete loss of pericentral hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilatation, the deposition of hemosiderin derived from destructive erythrocytes (Fig. 3 b). The extravasation of erythrocytes and excessive deposition of collagen were not observed (Fig. 3 b). The infiltration of inflammatory cells was not obvious in acute and subacute stage.

### Mechanisms of edema formation after intracerebral hemorrhage: effects of extravasated red blood cells on blood flow and blood-brain barrier integrity [^d812eadf]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Red blood cell (RBC) lysis contributes to brain edema formation after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and RBC hemolysate (oxyhemoglobin) has been implicated to be a spasminogen in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Whether cerebral ischemia contributes to brain edema formation after ICH remains unclear, however. The aims of this study were to test whether extravasation of RBCs induces cerebral ischemia and/or blood-brain barrier disruption in a rat ICH model characterized by perihematomal brain edema.

Methods

In this study, 87 pentobarbital-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were used. In each animal, saline, packed RBCs, or lysed RBCs were injected into the right caudate nucleus. Sham injections served as controls. Regional cerebral blood flow, brain water and ion contents, blood-brain barrier integrity, and plasma volume were measured.

Results

Intraparenchymal infusion of lysed RBCs caused severe brain edema by the first day but did not induce ischemic cerebral blood flows. In contrast, blood-brain barrier permeability increased during the first day after infusion of lysed RBCs (a 3-fold increase) and 3 days after infusion of packed RBCs (a 4-fold increase).

Conclusions

These results suggest that ischemia is not present at 24 or 72 hours after hematoma induction by injection of intact or lysed RBCs. RBC constituents that appear after delayed lysis, however, increase blood-brain barrier permeability, which contributes to edema formation.

### Pigmented purpuric dermatosis of the hand: clinicopathologic analysis of six cases with review of the literature [^763f4a04]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pigmented purpuric dermatosis (PPD) is a group of skin disorders characterized by red, brown, or golden macules and patches with cayenne pepper-like spots. Classic histopathologic features include a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with associated erythrocyte extravasation and hemosiderin deposition. Although PPD most commonly affects the lower extremities, upper extremity involvement has been infrequently reported. Cases involving the hands are particularly rare. We present 6 new cases of PPD involving the hand and review 17 previously reported cases in the literature. All cases in our series were unilateral and localized to the dorsum of the hand. PPD was considered clinically in only 2 of these cases. Histopathologic examination revealed hallmark features of PPD, namely a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and extravasated erythrocytes. Previous reports of PPD involving the hand described concurrent involvement of other anatomic sites in most cases; only 4 cases (24%) were confined to the hands. Histopathologic descriptions of these reported cases were compatible with PPD. In sum, our series describes a unique and rare clinical presentation of PPD confined to the unilateral dorsal hand. Because of the unusual presentation, biopsy is often required for accurate diagnosis.

### A clinical, histopathological, and molecular study of two cases of VEXAS syndrome without a definitive myeloid neoplasm [^3fd1439b]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Case description

The first patient was a 63-year-old man presenting with recurrent fever, skin rash, and polyarthritis. Laboratory studies showed anemia, thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor (Table 1). A skin biopsy specimen showed neutrophilic infiltration of papillary dermis consistent with Sweet syndrome (data not shown). Treatment with high-dose oral prednisone led to complete resolution of skin rash, arthritis, and other systemic symptoms. However, subsequent attempts to taper prednisone were unsuccessful, with prompt recurrence of symptoms despite treatment with several biologic agents (adalimumab, etanercept, abatacept, tocilizumab, anakinra, tofacitinib, and IV immunoglobin).

Table 1.
Summary of clinical presentation and pertinent laboratory experiments

The second patient was a 67-year-old man presenting with fever, body aches, and progressive dyspnea with minimal exertion. Laboratory findings were similar to patient 1 (Table 1). Chest computed tomography demonstrated diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and small pleural effusions. Systemic symptoms improved with oral prednisone and, similar to patient 1, taper of prednisone resulted in recurrence of symptoms. He subsequently developed palpable purpura and symptomatic extensive left leg great saphenous vein thrombus. A skin biopsy specimen showed superficial perivascular and mild inflammatory infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes, suggestive of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (data not shown). The patient continued to be treated with oral prednisone, 10 mg twice daily, and was receiving continuous oxygen supplementation at last follow-up.

### Histopathologic features of cutaneous acute graft-versus-host disease in T-Cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplant recipients [^f3f38c10]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2015). Low credibility.

T-cell-depleted (TCD) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation demonstrates similar efficacy and reduced incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in appropriately selected patients versus T-cell-replete transplantation. The histopathology of cutaneous acute GVHD (aGVHD) after TCD peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCTs) is not described. We identified 13 cases of patients after TCD PBSCT, with definitive aGVHD, and 20 cases of non-aGVHD skin rash in patients after TCD PBSCT, during multidisciplinary review by a dermatopathologist, dermatologist, and transplant physician, incorporating clinical presentation, therapeutic response, and histopathology data. Histopathologic features of aGVHD and non-aGVHD skin rash in TCD PBSCT patients were compared to each other, and also to features recently reported for non-TCD transplant recipients. aGVHD and non-aGVHD skin rash in TCD PBSCT patients' biopsies had similar rates of epidermal acanthosis, dermal melanophages, neutrophils, plasma cells, eosinophils, and extravasated erythrocytes. While satellitosis, exocytosis and adnexal involvement slightly favored aGVHD, more notable differential findings favoring aGVHD were diffuse (vs. focal/absent) basal vacuolization (77% aGVHD vs. 25% non-aGVHD rash), involvement of the entire epidermis (vs. partial thickness) by necrotic keratinocytes (42% aGVHD vs. 0% non-aGVHD rash), and nondense (rather than exuberant) inflammatory infiltrates (77% vs. 20%). After filtering features seen in all TCD samples (epidermal acanthosis, dermal melanophages, neutrophils, plasma cells, eosinophils, and extravasated erythrocytes), the most distinct features belonging to aGVHD-positive TCD samples were diffuse basal vacuolization, slight rather than dense inflammatory infiltrates, and necrotic keratinocytes involving the entire epidermis. Awareness of these features may help when evaluating a skin rash occurring after a TCD transplant.

### Granulomatous pigmented purpura: an unusual histological variant [^debc4db7]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) tend to vary clinically, yet share a similar histology. Granulomas are only rarely seen, with 4 prior reported cases, designated granulomatous pigmented purpura. Historically, granulomatous pigmented purpura has been seen in Asians. In this article, we report the case of a 42-year-old, white female with granulomatous pigmented purpura, the fifth such reported case in the literature. Histopathological examination revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with eosinophils, extravasated erythrocytes, melanophages, and vascular proliferation. These findings were consistently reported on subsequent biopsy 6 months later. This case illustrates a rare histological finding in PPDs. Medications associated with PPD are reviewed and the patient's use of mesalamine and balsalazide for ulcerative colitis are deemed potential triggers, given their relative similarity to aspirin, a known trigger of PPD. Although other granulomatous processes must be excluded in such patients, one must consider the possibility of granulomatous pigmented purpura in the appropriate setting.

### Atypical case of telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as purpura [^86c6d30f]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cutaneous breast carcinoma metastasis can be of different clinicopathologic types. The most common manifestation is nodules, which are often found on the chest wall. Carcinoma telangiectaticum is rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature.,

Clinically, carcinoma telangiectaticum is characterized by yellowish to reddish or violaceous lymphangioma circumscriptum–like papulovesicles ipsilateral to the side affected by breast carcinoma. Our patient presented with a large purpuric patch mimicking traumatic purpura on the abdomen without pain or itch, which is a relatively rare manifestation of cutaneous breast cancer metastasis even in carcinoma telangiectaticum.

Histologically, tumor nests are found in dilated small blood vessels, mainly in the subepidermal zone in carcinoma telangiectaticum. Blood vessels in the lower dermis may occasionally be involved. Tumor nests usually lie free in the vascular lumina, although focal connection to the vessel walls or breaching into the surrounding dermis may occur. Our case is mostly consistent with these histologic characteristics. Interestingly, our specimen showed not only metastatic breast cancer cells but also most erythrocytes aggregating and occluding the dermal blood vessels and forming multiple intravascular thrombi. Extravasation of erythrocytes into the dermis was not detected. We speculated that the atypical clinical manifestation of large purpuric patch mimicking traumatic purpura in our case was possibly caused by aggregation of erythrocytes in the dermis forming multiple intravascular thrombi. This clinicopathologic presentation was similar to that seen with hemangioma simplex or capillary-venous malformation.

### Meningeal lymphatics clear erythrocytes that arise from subarachnoid hemorrhage [^f3ea791a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The enhancement of lymphatic draining function, lymphangiogenesis, and lymphangiectasia are commonly observed in peripheral acute inflammation, including arthritis, bacterial keratitis, and colitis –, with the enhanced lymphatic flow and lymphangiogenesis reducing the local inflammation and edema. The overexpression of VEGF-C by viral infection or local injection has been shown to ameliorate, while the blockade of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway exacerbates, inflammation –. Increasing meningeal lymphatic drainage was observed at day 7 of SAH in this study; however, lymphatic expansion and growth were not pronounced. These results are in consistent with previous reports that the morphology of meningeal lymphatics did not change in EAE-associated neuroinflammation. Meningeal lymphatics may have a limited growth capability when exposed to neuroinflammation. Further research is needed to determine whether modulating lymphangiogenesis by overexpression of VEGF-C or other means affects SAH induced-neuroinflammation.

In summary, we show that extravasated erythrocytes in the SAS are drained into CLNs through meningeal lymphatics during SAH. This study adds insight into the extravasated erythrocyte clearance pathway that occurs during the very early stages of SAH and provides a possible therapeutic avenue for its treatment, as well as possibly other types of intracranial hemorrhage.

### Pathologic approach to pulmonary hemorrhage [^ab9d1ea2]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The pathologist's approach to pulmonary hemorrhage is outlined. Most cases fall into those examples of pulmonary hemorrhage caused by localized sites of bleeding, and those examples that fall within the spectrum of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The histologic evaluation of pulmonary hemorrhage is outlined including assessment of fresh hemorrhage in alveolar spaces (including exclusion of traumatic hemorrhage related to the procedure) and the presence of hemosiderin and its various causes. The most common causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and clues to their clinically pathologic diagnosis are discussed.

### Scaly erythematous papules and plaques in a teenager [^7fd8ef68]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old healthy Hispanic boy presented to the dermatology clinic with a 10-month history of a pruritic rash on his trunk and extremities. He was previously treated with fluocinolone 0.01% oil, triamcinolone 0.1% cream, and hydroxyzine 10 mg with no relief. The patient denied pain or a similar rash in the past. He had no relevant family or social history. Physical examination demonstrated non-blanching, scaly erythematous papules and plaques on his legs, right arm, and trunk (Figs 1 and 2). A punch biopsy from lower portion of his right leg was performed (Fig 3).

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, history, and histologic findings, what is your diagnosis?
A. Nummular eczema
B. Lichen planus
C. Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED)
D. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis
E. Contact dermatitis

Answers:
A. Nummular eczema–Incorrect. Although clinically consistent with nummular eczema, biopsy revealed considerable perivascular dermal infiltrates and extravasated red blood cells, which are absent in eczema.
B. Lichen planus–Incorrect. While lichen planus can present with pruritic violaceous papules and plaques on the extremities, the histologic findings of the disease were absent in this patient's biopsy.
C. EED–Incorrect. EED is a necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis characterized by erythematous plaques on the dorsal aspects of the hands or extensor surfaces. Histology would demonstrate a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis of the dermal vessel wall.
D. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis–Correct. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis often presents as an eczematous, non-blanching, red-brown purpuric or petechial eruption in the lower extremities. Epidermal spongiosis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and extravasation of red blood cells are seen histologically. Therefore, the clinical and histologic picture of our patient best reflect eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis.
E. Contact dermatitis–Incorrect. Contact dermatitis could be a plausible diagnosis for our patient, as it presents with a well-demarcated erythematous papule or plaque confined to the site of contact with an allergen or irritant. However, the histologic features of contact dermatitis were absent in this patient.

### A chronic nonresponsive facial eruption [^f2a2b906]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 67-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a waxing and waning facial eruption, which had been present for several years. Of note, the patient denied any prior use of topical steroids. The patient took omeprazole daily for years but denied any correlation with her cutaneous eruption. Physical examination revealed erythematous atrophic plaques and thin plaques with scale on the bilateral cheeks within a diffuse background of telangiectasia (Fig 1). Dermoscopic evaluation did not reveal follicular plugging. Prior laboratory evaluation by her primary care physician demonstrated absence of antinuclear antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and low levels of C3 and C4. A punch biopsy revealed cell-poor interface dermatitis with scattered apoptotic keratinocytes, along with superficial perivascular and perifollicular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Fig 2).

Question 1: Which of the following is the best diagnosis?

A. Actinic purpura
B. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)
C. Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea
D. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)
E. Topical corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy

Answers:

A. Actinic purpura – Incorrect. Actinic purpura presents with violaceous macules and patches on photoaged skin. Lesions are commonly found on the face, neck, and arms, specifically on the extensor surfaces of the forearms and the dorsal aspects of the hands. The histopathologic features of actinic purpura include extravasation of red blood cells within the dermis and solar elastosis.

B. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) – Incorrect. ACD typically presents with erythema and pruritus. Acute ACD can present with vesiculation or bullae, while chronic ACD can present with lichenification. The affected areas are localized to the area of allergen contact. The histopathologic features of acute ACD include edema and intraepidermal vesiculation without epidermal hyperplasia. Subacute-to-chronic ACD presents with epidermal hyperplasia. Eosinophils are present in all stages of ACD, and eosinophilic spongiosis is a variable feature.

### Histopathology of the exanthema in DRESS is not specific but may indicate severity of systemic involvement [^ff457866]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Exanthema in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has no specific clinical diagnostic hallmark and there are few histopathologic studies. The aim of this study was to describe dermal-epidermal histopathologic features in DRESS and correlate them with the culprit drug, viral reactivation, or systemic organ involvement.

Methods

Skin biopsies were independently evaluated by 2 dermatopathologists who characterized the main histological patterns and scored dermal and epidermal changes, which were further correlated with clinical and laboratorial data.

Results

In 15 DRESS patients (9 male/6 female patients, mean age 53.3 years), the main observation was lymphocyte exocytosis (1.87 ± 1.25), spongiosis (0.93 ± 0.94), scattered keratinocyte necrosis (1.70 ± 1.44), basal cell vacuolization (2.13 ± 1.42), lymphocyte infiltration around dermal vessels (2.93 ± 0.92) or at the dermal-epidermal junction (2.07 ± 1.12), often with eosinophils and extravasated erythrocytes, swollen endothelial cells, and intravascular neutrophils but no vasculitis. Histopathologic patterns were classified mainly as spongiotic (5), erythema multiforme-like (3), or lichenoid (2). There was a significant positive correlation between the intensity of lymphocyte infiltration and the severity of hepatic cytolysis (r = 0.51; P < 0.05) and eosinophilia (r = 0.51; P < 0.05). No correlation was observed between the intensity and type of dermal inflammation and the degree of epidermal damage or the culprit drug. Human herpes virus type 6-positive patients had a pseudolymphomatous reaction or a perifollicular localization of the infiltrate.

Conclusions

Histopathology in DRESS is variable with no specific diagnostic aspect, but there is a possible correlation between the intensity of the lymphocyte infiltrate and DRESS severity, namely, liver cytolysis.

### Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography assessment of pityriasis rosea [^fbf06ab5]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Histologic diagnosis

The punch biopsy showed a subacute spongiotic process (Fig 4). Epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and mild spongiosis were present. There were foci of parakeratosis with mild infiltration of mononuclear cells and extravasation of erythrocytes within the papillary dermis. These features of spongiotic dermatitis are consistent with pityriasis rosea (PR) based on the clinical presentation.

### Bathtub suction-induced purpura [^ccfb2f90]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

We report two cases of bathtub suction-induced purpura. Two girls, ages 9 and 14 years, developed recurring purpura "spontaneously" in the same lower back location and in the same U-shaped distribution. The patients had similar histopathologic findings, with extravasated erythrocytes and a sparse superficial inflammatory infiltrate. After extensive evaluation, one patient eventually admitted to self-inducing her lesions by creating suction against a bathtub. The second patient denied self-inflicting her lesions; however, her purpura improved when she stopped taking baths.

### A case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in a patient on dupilumab [^ab5a2d38]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Past medical history was significant for Graves' disease, fibromyalgia, migraines, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). Past serologies were weakly positive for anti-ku and positive for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) of 1:160. The patient was not on any treatments for her lupus, which was in remission. She also has a history of atopic dermatitis, supported by biopsies that showed spongiotic dermatitis in the past. Prior treatment for her AD included topical steroids, topical tacrolimus, methotrexate, as well as dupilumab, which she had been on for at least a year, before self-discontinuing given improvement of her AD.

The patient presented to our clinic a year later with worsening AD supported on repeat biopsy. Given her history of improvement on dupilumab, the patient was restarted on dupilumab and then 10 days later developed new-onset palpable purpura involving the bilateral lower extremities (Fig 1). A punch biopsy of the left anterior leg was performed, and histopathology showed abundant extravasation of erythrocytes in surrounding vessels within the dermis with karyorrhexis consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Fig 2). An extensive work-up was performed that revealed a repeat ANA of 1:80, mildly elevated complements, negative rheumatoid factor, negative anti-streptolysin O titer, negative hepatitis panel, negative urinalysis, and a complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that were within normal limits. Her serum electrophoresis was negative. The patient was initially offered prednisone; however, after meeting with her neurologist about her migraines, she was switched to a course of methylprednisolone with taper. Her dupilumab was discontinued. At her 2 week follow up, her palpable purpura had completely resolved.

Clinical presentation. Palpable nonblanching purpura of the lower extremities.

Fig 2
Histopathological examination of the left lower extremity demonstrates abundant extravasation of erythrocytes in surrounding vessels within the dermis, extensive infiltration of vessel walls by mixed inflammation, including lymphocytes, histiocytes, neutrophils, and multiple eosinophils, and nuclear dust consistent with karyorrhexis (A and B). Minimal fibrinoid change was seen within occasional inflamed superficial dermal vessel walls. All features were consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; 10×, and 20× respectively).

### The SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for renal scintigraphy in adults [^42cbb07b]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Medium credibility.

Renal scintigraphy — injection extravasation and total renal function calculation: Extravasation at the injection site may give rise to difficulties in data processing and may lead to incorrect interpretation because the shape of ROI curves may be affected, and assessment of total renal function relies on kidney count rate related to injected counts; if activity is extravasated or delayed at the site, the measurement is inaccurate. Some authors therefore recommend scanning the injection site after the study, and if the count rate at the injection site exceeds 1–2% of injected counts, calculation of total renal function should be omitted.

### Isotretinoin-induced majocchi purpura… [^bd306ca5]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

We believe isotretinoin was the most likely causative agent in this case because the lesions began after initiation of isotretinoin treatment and resolved shortly after its termination, and the pathologic findings were consistent with other described cases of drug-induced PPD. The lesions have continued to fade, and no new lesions have developed in a 3-month follow-up period. Drug-induced PPD is distinct from idiopathic PPD, and it is important to consider isotretinoin as a potential inciting agent. Each entity presents with a unique clinical presentation of nonblanching, nonpalpable purpuric lesions that are often bilaterally symmetrical and present on the lower extremities. 1 In addition to idiopathic cases attributed to various factors including exercise, gravitational dependence, venous hypertension, capillary fragility, and focal infections, medications and chemical exposures have been established in the literature as etiologic factors in PPD.

1–4 We report a case of purpura annularis telangiectodes of Majocchi induced by isotretinoin and review the current literature on substance-induced PPD. Laboratory results were normal, including complete blood cell count and results of a basic metabolic panel. A biopsy sample was taken from a representative lesion and showed a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes, and Perls stain revealed hemosiderin deposits within the papillary dermis. A, There is a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes. B, Perls stain reveals hemosiderin deposits within the papillary dermis. These histologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pigmented purpuric dermatosis.

Treatment of PATM includes topical corticosteroids and compression hose in mild cases, with the addition of oral ascorbic acid or pentoxifylline in moderate cases, as well as possible use of colchicine and griseofulvin. 5 In severe cases, psoralen–UV-A or narrowband UV-B phototherapy, cyclosporine, or methotrexate may be effective. 5 In drug-induced cases, however, removal of the offending substance is often enough to clear the PPD.

### Granulomatous pigmented purpuric dermatosis [^cc3bbc94]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The granulomatous variant of the pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) is a rare and infrequently described condition, with a total of 16 cases published to date. We report a case of granulomatous PPD in a 59-year-old white woman who demonstrated involvement of the arms, legs, chest and back with concurrent hyperlipidaemia. Histopathological examination revealed a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate obscuring the dermoepidermal junction, and loose granuloma formation in the superficial dermis, with extravasated erythrocytes. Other conditions within the differential diagnosis such as atypical infection, papular sarcoidosis and generalized granuloma annulare were excluded on clinical and histological grounds. Our patient represents the ninth patient reported to have granulomatous PPD with coexisting hyperlipidaemia, and the fifth patient with granulomatous PPD and a lichenoid infiltrate.

### Novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier bound with albumin shows neuroprotection with possible antioxidant effects [^6d0a0a98]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose- A hemoglobin-albumin cluster, 1 core of hemoglobin covalently bound with 3 shell albumins, designated as HemoAct was developed as a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. We aim to investigate neuroprotection by HemoAct in transient cerebral ischemia and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Methods- Male rats were subjected to 2-hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and were then administered HemoAct transarterially at the onset of reperfusion. Neurological and pathological findings were examined after 24 hours of reperfusion to identify neuroprotection by HemoAct. Intermittent measurements of cortical blood flow and oxygen content were performed, and a histopathologic analysis was conducted on rats during the early phase of reperfusion to assess the therapeutic mechanism of HemoAct. In addition, the antioxidant effects of HemoAct were examined in hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated rat brain microvascular endothelial cells. Results- Neurological deterioration, infarct and edema development, and the activation of MMP-9 (matrix metalloprotease-9) and lipid peroxidation after 24 hours of reperfusion were significantly ameliorated by the HemoAct treatment. Reductions in blood flow and tissue partial oxygen pressure in the cortical penumbra after 6 hours of reperfusion were significantly ameliorated by the HemoAct treatment. The histopathologic analysis of the cortical penumbra revealed that HemoAct in HemoAct-treated rats showed superior microvascular perfusion with the mitigation of microvascular narrowing changes than autologous erythrocytes in nontreated rats. Although HemoAct extravasated into the ischemic core with serum protein, it did not induce an increase in serum extravasation or reactive oxygen species production in the ischemic core. In vitro experiments with rat brain microvascular endothelial cells revealed that HemoAct significantly suppressed cellular reactive oxygen species production in hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cells, similar to albumin. Conclusions- HemoAct exerted robust neuroprotection in transient cerebral ischemia. Superior microvascular perfusion with an oxygen delivery capability and possible antioxidant effects appear to be the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms.

### Dermatologic perivascular hemophagocytosis: a report of two cases [^d1bb186c]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic syndrome includes fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver function tests, with some patients developing lymphadenopathy and cutaneous eruptions. Herein we report two cases of dermal perivascular hemophagocytosis identified in skin biopsies of two patients with no additional symptoms attributable to hemophagocytic syndrome. Biopsies showed capillary ectasia with dermal perivascular infiltrates. The overlying epidermis and adjacent subcutaneous fat was unremarkable. The infiltrate consisted of perivascular neutrophils and benign histiocytes with predominately phagocytized erythrocytes and occasional engulfed karyorrhectic debris. Perivascular nuclear dust (leukocytoclasia) and extravasated erythrocytes were present, but other factors typically found in leukocytoclastic vasculitis were absent, namely fibrin deposition and endothelial hypertrophy and/or necrosis. This appears to be hemophagocytosis, possibly associated with late lesions of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Both hemophagocytosis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis are associated with activated immunity with increased cytokines and/or immune complexes. It is important to consider this uncommon finding in the evaluation of indeterminate cutaneous eruptions.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Response to berry et al's "Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis following single-dose janssen ad26.COV2.S vaccination" [^cc5cb2c2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Biopsy from the patient's thigh revealed fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls with fibrin thrombi, extravasated erythrocytes, and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate with leukocytoclasia (Fig 2). Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a biopsied specimen from a new lesion on the abdomen was negative for specific immune deposits. SARS-CoV-2 in situ hybridization was negative. The diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis was rendered. Initiation of high-dose corticosteroids led to the rapid improvement of the patient's cutaneous symptoms and clinical appearance of the rash. The patient's vasculitis resolved and remained quiescent after the completion of his oral steroid course. His lower extremity function has returned to baseline, and there is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation at sites of previously involved leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which are gradually improving in clinical appearance.

Fig 2
Histopathological findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Vessels are surrounded by neutrophils, karyorrhectic debris, and extravasated erythrocytes and contain fibrin thrombi (A, arrow). Vessels display endothelial swelling and mural infiltration by neutrophils (hematoxylin-eosin; original magnification: ×200).

The temporal association between the patient's vaccination and subsequent development of vasculitis in the absence of other possible inciting etiologies suggests that the vaccine may have been the trigger; however, we cannot ascribe causation. While there have been cases of systemic illness in the setting of cutaneous vasculitis, our patient was not acutely ill and responded rapidly to appropriate treatment.

### Histopathological changes seen in mycosis fungoides patients after phototherapy [^f9039cd6]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Early stage (IA, IB, IIA) mycosis fungoides (MF) has long been treated with various agents including oral psoralen plus UVA (PUVA), broadband and narrowband. The histopathological changes seen after phototherapy have not been clearly described. Twenty-three skin biopsy specimens of MF patients treated with phototherapy both UVA and UVB were evaluated before and 3 months after phototherapy. The clinical and histomorphological response were evaluated. Various types of epidermotropism: such as single cells, haloed cells, linearly arranged single cells, pagetoid spread, and Pautrier microabscesses were noted. Stratum corneum was classified as normal, hyperkeratotic, and parakeratotic. The epidermal thickness was noted as normal, atrophic, and hypertrophic. Spongiotic microvesiculation, presence of dilated dermal vessels, was investigated. Papillary dermis fibrosis, the presence of plasma cells, eosinophils, and extravasated erythrocytes were also examined. Epidermal hyperplasia, dermal fibrosis, loss of parakeratotic pattern, and inflammatory infiltrate were frequently observed after therapy. After phototherapy, the atypical cells rarely formed "Pautrier microabscess" or made a "linear pattern" at the base of epidermis. The cells other than lymphocytes (plasma cells, eosinophils, and erythrocytes) should also be considered regarding the phototherapy effect. A pathology report of a MF patient who has undergone successful phototherapy would describe changes resulting from phototherapy-such as fibrosis or "lack of dermal inflammation" and the absence of active epidermal cellular changes such as "Pautrier microabscess" or "linearly arranged cells".

### Cause of death based on systematic post-mortem studies in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 tissue PCR during the COVID-19 pandemic [^d4a5ab09]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

After initial evaluation at the local pathology laboratory, all histological specimens from patients who had PCR‐confirmed COVID‐19 disease along with the autopsy report and available medical documentation were forwarded to the central pathology laboratory (MR and VK) for independent review of histological specimens, validation of consistency of observed findings with COVID‐19 and assessment of its possible causative association with death.

The presence of DAD was considered significant if typical histological alterations [were present in the alveolar–capillary unit, such as intra‐alveolar oedema, with multiple macrophages in the alveolar lumen and hyaline membranes lining the alveolar septa. DAD was considered minimal if no macroscopic abnormalities were observed at autopsy and alveolar patency was preserved. Typical examples of pulmonary parenchyma exhibiting signs of significant and minimal DAD are presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Minimal (left panel) and significant (right panel) diffuse alveolar damage. Note the viral transformation of desquamated alveolocytes, the early signs of microangiopathy with detectable interalveolar capillary occluded by erythrocyte clots and preserved alveolar patency on the left panel. On the right panel, alveolar space is filled with exudate, and capillaries are massively occluded with microthrombi. Numbers in the figure indicate alveolar space (1), microthrombi in alveolar capillaries (2) and desquamated alveolocytes (3). Haematoxylin–eosin staining, magnification ×200.

As a rule, death was categorized as COVID‐19‐related (COVID‐19 death) if patients demonstrated significant DAD. The presence and the characteristics of other comorbidities as potential death causes were considered in order to then categorize COVID‐19 as the primary or the contributing cause of death. In all other cases with positive SARS‐CoV‐2 tissue PCR but with no or minimal DAD, COVID‐19 was considered a concomitant condition not causally associated with death (non‐COVID‐19 death).

The final decision with regard to case classification was made by expert commission members (ER, VV, GS, VK and MR) based on the original local laboratory pathology report and the central pathology laboratory evaluation. In the clinical autopsy cohort, the review also included clinical documentation from the patient's latest hospital admission. In case of disagreement or uncertainty, the decision was reached by a consensus‐based discussion.

### Paraneoplastic cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis as a presentation of recurrent metastatic breast cancer [^9efbd217]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

A 53-year-old South African woman presented to our dermatology department with a 2-week history of painful skin lesions on the arms, legs, and trunk. She denied using any medications in the recent past. There was no recent history of fever or symptoms of multiorgan involvement such as arthritis, abdominal pain, melena, hematuria, hemoptysis, or headaches. Stage IIB infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast with left axillary lymph node metastases was diagnosed 11 months previously. She was not placed on a selective estrogen receptor modulator because immunohistochemistry showed negative staining for the estrogen and progesterone receptors. She underwent a modified radical mastectomy followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. She received 3 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and 3 cycles of paclitaxel. She had also received radiotherapy.

The physical examination found palpable purpura with associated necrosis, bullae, and well-delineated ulcers on both the upper and lower limbs as well as the trunk (Fig 1). The general and systemic examination were normal. There was no lymphadenopathy or features suggestive of infection.

Fig 1
The upper arm displays palpable purpura with associated necrosis, well-delineated ulcers, and bullae.

Histology of the skin punch biopsy showed full-thickness epidermal necrosis and ulceration with superficial blister formation (Fig 2). In the dermis, there was severe perivascular neutrophilic inflammation, nuclear debris, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls, and erythrocyte extravasation (Fig 3). Periodic acid–Schiff and Grocott (silver stain) were negative for fungal yeasts and hyphae. Brown and Brenn was negative for bacterial organisms. Martius Scarlet Blue was negative for fibrin thrombi. Immunofluorescence studies (IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3) were negative in the basement membrane and perivascular regions. The features were consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Case of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma manifesting marked purpura [^43394cdd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 62-year-old woman with marked purpura, first appearing on both legs, then spreading over the whole body, including the face. At presentation, the patient was thought to have Henoch-Schonlein purpura. However, a skin biopsy from a purpuric lesion revealed prominent infiltrations of atypical lymphocytes into the papillary dermis and marked extravasation of erythrocytes through the epidermis and upper dermis. Antibody to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was present in the serum and samples from skin lesions revealed HTLV-1 proviral DNA integration, as well as a clonal T-cell receptor Cbeta1 gene rearrangement. We therefore diagnosed this case as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), and the purpuric lesions as ATL-specific. Soon after the initiation of chemotherapy, these purpuric lesions began to resolve with pigmentation.

### An unusual complication of axillary lymph-node clearance [^4a27f77e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of two elderly patients who developed an unusual striking eruption of the right chest wall, 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, after right axillary lymph-node dissection. The procedures were performed following diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma with regional nodal metastases. Both procedures were complicated by the formation of a seroma, subsequently drained by needle aspiration. On histological examination of the first case, extravasated red cells were found around dilated vessels, which were confirmed by immunohistochemistry to be lymphatic vessels. The eruptions resolved spontaneously within 4–8 weeks. The cause of the eruption remains unclear, but possible reasons are bleeding into the seroma or the occurrence of a temporary lymphovascular anastomosis. To our knowledge, these are the first such cases reported in the literature.

Alveolar–capillary barrier dysfunction domain in experimental ALI — panel responses highlighted that assessment of pulmonary edema accumulation measured by lung wet weight to dry lung weight or body weight ratio was considered "most relevant" by > 30% of panelists, while Evan's blue–albumin approaches require caution because Evan's blue is only 0.98 kD and acts as a small molecule and caution should be taken to ensure that free Evan's blue is not present; endothelial-specific permeability via the filtration coefficient can be assessed but is technically challenging and not available in all laboratories; although extravascular lung water can be measured with thermodilution techniques, these methods have limited clinical applicability and are not as accurate as gravimetric methods; measures that less than 30% considered "most relevant" included markers of alveolar epithelial injury, surfactant function, and evidence of large defects in the alveolar–capillary barrier (e.g., red blood cells in the airspace and transfer of very large-molecular-weight proteins), and the majority (52%) stated that epithelial injury alone should not be used to fulfill this domain because there can be epithelial injury without significant breakdown of the alveolar–capillary barrier and thus epithelial injury alone is insufficient as a measure of alveolar–capillary barrier dysfunction.

### Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen [^f5a89f48]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) is a recently recognized nonneoplastic vascular lesion of the spleen with fewer than 30 cases described. Microscopically, SANT consists of multiple well-circumscribed vascular/angiomatoid nodules showing plump endothelial cell and extravasated erythrocytes. The nodules are surrounded by a variable lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, spindle cells, and collagenous stroma. The vascular nodules display a complex mixture of endothelial phenotypes resembling splenic sinusoids (CD34-/CD31+/CD8+), capillaries (CD34+/ CD31+/CD8-), and small veins (CD34-/CD31+/CD8-). Focal expression of CD68 can also be seen. The differential diagnosis of SANT includes splenic hamartoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, littoral cell angioma, and hemangioendothelioma. It has been postulated that SANT represents a peculiar hamartomatous transformation of splenic red pulp in response to an exaggerated nonneoplastic stromal proliferation. SANT has a benign clinical course with splenectomy being curative.

Topical triamcinolone 0.1% ointment twice daily, compression stockings, and frequent leg elevation were initiated. At the 6-week follow up, the patient's examination findings had changed dramatically. The plaques had become reddish-brown with both peau d'orange and cobblestone surface changes (Fig 3, A and B), representing a mixed clinical variant of PTM.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with koebner phenomenon associated with Ehlers Danlos syndrome [^3e40ed4b]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Physical examination found palpable purpura in a linear configuration on the lower legs (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Biopsy of one of the lesions found a mostly superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate with conspicuous nuclear debris, extravasated erythrocytes, and intravascular fibrin deposition (Fig 4). Periodic acid–Schiff and Gram stains were negative for bacterial and fungal organisms. Direct immunofluorescence showed focal granular C3 deposition within papillary dermal vessels. No IgA deposition was visualized. A diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis was rendered.

### Glial swelling with eosinophilia in human post-mortem brains: a change indicative of plasma extravasation [^22e63d11]. Acta Neuropathologica (2000). Low credibility.

Swollen, intensely eosinophilic glial cells are often observed in the vicinity of hemorrhagic lesions in post-mortem human brains. We sought to determine the nature of this change. Thirty adult human brains removed at autopsy and three surgical specimens were obtained 6h to 60 days following a hemorrhagic event. They were subjected to a battery of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. The swollen cells, which were observed in the majority of autopsy specimens in which hemorrhage had occurred within the previous 9 days, stained intensely red with Masson stain and were immunoreactive for IgG, IgM, IgA, and fibrinogen. Some were also immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, particularly in subpial and subependymal areas, if the lesions were more than 3 days old. In white matter some of the cells were immunoreactive for CNPase. There was no labeling with markers for macrophage/microglial cells. The absence of DNA fragment detection by TUNEL suggests that the cells were not dying. Mild glial cytoplasmic eosinophilia without swelling was observed in surgical specimens. No eosinophilic swollen glia were seen in perfusion-fixed rat brains with experimental intracerebral hemorrhage, although they were seen in rat brains that were not promptly fixed. We conclude that human macroglia, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, ingest plasma proteins that have been released into brain parenchyma. This likely represents a homeostatic mechanism that maintains the composition of the extracellular environment. If the tissue is not promptly fixed the cells become more swollen and eosinophilic.

### Hydroxychloroquine-associated pigmentation after extravasation injury [^5eca9c3c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although reported in 7% of patients with SLE, the pathogenesis of HCQ-associated pigmentation remains elusive. In addition, it is difficult to predict and prevent HCQ-associated pigmentation as there is no clear association with cumulative dose or duration of use. Regarding the clinical features of HCQ-associated pigmentation, Jallouli et alreported the largest study, comparing 24 SLE patients with HCQ-associated pigmentation to 517 SLE controls treated with HCQ. According to the study, hyperpigmentation was localized on the trauma-prone anterior side of the leg in all patients and in 21% of patients with arm involvement. Also, the majority of patients (96%) had at least 1 condition leading to a predisposition for easy bruising, such as treatment with oral anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents. Based on the aforementioned results, Jallouli et alsuggested that HCQ-associated pigmentation may occur secondary to ecchymosis or bruising. Our case supports this hypothesis and clearly shows that inappropriate intravenous cannulation, or trauma in a broad sense, can trigger pigmentation in patients taking HCQ. Previous histologic findings of HCQ-induced pigmentation suggest the importance of both melanin and iron deposition. In the case of melanin deposition, basal layer hyperpigmentation in the epidermis and the presence of melanophages in the superficial dermis have been commonly observed. In contrast, the predominant roles of iron and the presence of siderophages in the dermis have also been documented in some cases in which the median concentrations of iron were 10 times higher in the pigmented lesions than in normal skin along with statistical significance. The presence of hemosiderin, not melanin, in our case further strengthens the pivotal role of trauma and subsequent extravasation in HCQ-induced pigmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating iatrogenic injury as a direct cause of HCQ-associated hyperpigmentation. It is also notable that the patient had no predisposing conditions to easy bruising at the time of extravasation injury. Therefore, special care should be taken in patients taking HCQ to prevent trauma, especially iatrogenic injury, including extravasation injury. However, it is unclear how siderophages can persist in the dermis and whether HCQ affects their clearance. It has been shown that HCQ can affect the function of macrophage lysosomes through pH alteration; however, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism underlying HCQ-induced pigmentation.

### Extravasation injuries [^cdce3752]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Extravasation injuries occur under a wide variety of circumstances in the inpatient setting. Prevention remains the ideal treatment for these iatrogenic injuries. When extravasation injuries do occur, they must be diagnosed and treated promptly to minimize the amount of soft tissue injury. Initial management is similar among vesicant extravasates. Although evidence is limited to guide management for specific extravasates, it is paramount to be aware of the described treatments and principles.

### The neuropathology of fatal cerebral malaria in Malawian children [^f75b265a]. The American Journal of Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Cellular Immune Responses

A consistent finding in all malaria cases was the absence of an extravascular localized immune response to the vascular, myelin, and axonal pathology. Dürck's granulomas, which consist of collections of reactive microglia, astrocytes, and lymphocytes, were not present in any of the 37 cases of CM. Dürck's granulomas are a feature of adult CM and probably represent a later immune response to focal parenchymal necrosis. A variable number of CD45/CD68-positive monocytes containing hemozoin were present in the lumen of microvessels in the gray and white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, subcortex, brainstem, cerebellum, and leptomeninges of CM2 patients. Microvessels were often distended by the accumulated monocytes, which appeared to occupy most of the lumen of capillaries and venules but did not migrate out of the vessels into brain tissue (Figure 8, A, C, and D). Often, a capillary lumen was completely filled with a (presumably adherent) monocyte (Figure 8, A, C, and D). Monocytes with phagocytosed malarial pigment were usually present, along with extravasated RBCs, in the center of RHs (Figure 8 B). Neither CD4 + nor CD8 + T lymphocytes were found in areas of RH, myelin, or axonal damage in CM1 or CM2 cases; and only occasional CD8 + T cells were observed within the vascular lumen and, infrequently, in the subendothelial region of a few blood vessels in one CM1 and three CM2 cases. Scattered perivascular chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates were present in the brain parenchyma in some of the infectious CM3 cases. Occasional microglial cells expressing class II MHC molecules were seen in a few CM2 cases. Among the HIV-positive children, we did not observe pathological changes of HIV encephalitis or opportunistic infections.

### A case of urticarial vasculitis associated with atezolizumab [^ca3921e7]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 70-year-old female with metastatic small cell lung cancer presented with a 1-month history of mildly tender, pruritic raised welts. Two to 3 new lesions appeared daily, never in the same location. The lesions lasted 2 to 3 days before regressing. The patient reported a prodromal sensation of itch preceding the development of each lesion. She denied associated systemic symptoms such as joint pain. The initial lesion emerged 19 days after commencing cancer therapy with atezolizumab (cycle 1) and persisted through cycle 2, with infusions administered every 3 weeks. Pantoprazole was the only concomitant medication, initiated 4 months before rash onset. Treatment with oral antihistamines and clobetasol 0.05% ointment was attempted but provided minimal relief.

On physical examination, faintly erythematous, edematous plaques were observed on the bilateral arms, legs, face, scalp, and buttocks (Fig 1). Histopathologic examination revealed a superficial-to-mid perivascular and interstitial infiltrate consisting of neutrophils and eosinophils, accompanied by leukocytoclasia and extravasated erythrocytes, and fibrin deposition in the vessel walls (Fig 2). The clinical history of tender, edematous plaques lasting several days, in conjunction with the observed histopathologic findings, confirmed a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. Serum complement levels (including C3, C4, and C1q), complete blood count, and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibodies were negative. Eight days before dermatology consult, a 40 mg prednisone taper was initiated for the rash and atezolizumab was held due to the rash. The rash resolved the day after the consult. There was no residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Atezolizumab was never resumed due to suspected ICI-induced pneumonitis which developed 7 weeks after rash onset. A computed tomography scan 3 months after atezolizumab initiation demonstrated partial tumor response.

### Docetaxel extravasation: pathologic correlation and treatment with intralesional steroids [^232e9409]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 72-year-old-African American man with biopsy-proven prostate cancer with metastases to the bone was started on androgen depravation therapy with degarelix and referred to the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health to start a protocol with docetaxel, androgen depravation therapy, and prostvac, a vaccine-based therapy. The patient received the vaccine via subcutaneous injection 24 hours before standard intravenous infusion of docetaxel (143 mg [75 mg/m 2] over 60 minutes, in a total volume of 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride).

Twelve hours after initial infusion of docetaxel, a painful indurated plaque over the left proximal bicep developed at site of infusion. Subsequently, the plaque spread distally down the patient's arm over the next several days. The event was reported to the National Cancer Institute's quality control/assurance system. The patient did not receive any imaging or contrast dye. When the extravasation site did not improve, he sought care with dermatology at the referring institution, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

The initial evaluation 3 weeks after the event found an indurated, dusky-to-violaceous plaque on the left medial upper arm. This lesion was tender and fibrotic with a chalky-white, scaling peripheral rim (Fig 1). A punch biopsy found hyperkeratosis with a basket weave pattern, intracorneal dyskeratotic cells, hypergranulosis, focal spongiosis with lymphocytic exocytosis, and slightly pale and swollen basilar nuclei (Fig 2, A). Much of the mid dermis was occupied by a zone of brightly eosinophilic, homogenized collagen fibers and red blood cell debris (Fig 2, B). Within this zone, adnexal structures and blood vessels largely disappeared, giving the area a markedly hypocellular appearance. Intact eccrine glands and blood vessels leading up into this zone could be seen disintegrating within the zone. Immunohistochemical stains for sweat ducts and blood vessels (CEA and CD31) confirmed loss of these structures within the homogenized zone of tissue damage.

### Inflammatory retiform purpura and wrist drop [^dc5ed88a]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Based on the clinical and laboratory data, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV)
B. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
C. Rheumatoid vasculitis (RV)
D. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis
E. Paraneoplastic vasculitis

Answers:
A. Bullous LCV – Incorrect. While hemorrhagic bullae can also be observed in LCV, inflammatory retiform purpura are observed in medium vessel vasculitis rather than LCV. In addition, bullous LCV would not show medium vessel vasculitis on pathology.
B. PAN – Incorrect. PAN is excluded by the absence of nodules on examination and the presence of severe arthritis. PAN also demonstrates a focal medium vessel vasculitis on pathology.
C. RV – Correct. RV is a rare form of small- and medium-vessel vasculitis, occurring in 1% to 5% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).RV most often occurs in the setting of longstanding untreated seropositive RA due to the RF-mediated activation of complement and destruction of vessel walls. The skin is involved in 80% of patients, with common manifestations including purpura, ulcers, digital necrosis, and livedo reticularis. Histopathology frequently demonstrates thrombotic vasculitis affecting both small and medium vessels, a helpful but nonspecific feature.
D. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis – Incorrect. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can present with a positive RF, small and medium vessel vasculitis, and mixed serum cryoglobulins. However, anticyclic citrullinated peptide is highly specific for RV, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis demonstrates vasculitis in combination with occlusion due to solid pink aggregates of cryoprotein rather than fibrin.
E. Paraneoplastic vasculitis – Incorrect. Retiform purpura and sensory changes can also be present in paraneoplastic vasculitis, but this is less likely based on the serologic evaluation and absence of constitutional symptoms.

### Neuropathologic findings in a young woman 4 years following declaration of brain death: case analysis and literature review [^990c4e9d]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Brain tissue viability as inferred by autopsy

The histologic findings of faintly stained outlines of neurons and other cells raises the obvious question: Were these "viable" before our young woman's "somatic" death? To address this question, we need to understand what is meant by the terms "viable", "necrotic", and "autolyzed" (the latter also relating to the concepts of postmortem tissue changes variably referred to as "mummification", "maceration", and "saponification"), as well as "decomposition" (or "putrefaction") as used among pathology specialists in several relevant contexts (Table 4; Figs. 11–13). "Viability" and "necrosis" as used in neuropathology derive from widely established appearances, both macroscopic and microscopic, of surgically resected tissues having short, known intervals between removal and processing (fixation). As such, these features are the "closest" an observer can be to what is happening in the tissues of the patient. All of medicine relies on this time-honored means of diagnosis by pathologists for treatment and understanding of human disease. Thus, "viability" is denoted by the typical nuclear basophilia and cytoplasmic eosinophilia (e.g. as visible in Fig. 7A), corresponding by convention to integrity of cellular structures. "Necrosis" is characterized by nuclear pallor and eventual fragmentation, and in perfused conditions, is accompanied by microvascular reaction (endothelial and pericyte prominence and proliferation), inflammatory infiltrates and phagocytosis; over time, gliosis, cavitation, and sometimes focal "mummification" result, and can be present for many years after the inciting event, including in old infarcts and contusions (personal observation [RDF and JFC]). If there is no perfusion whatsoever (i.e. in areas of the brain in "brain death" in which a clinically administered bolus of radioisotope is not detected), there can be no microvascular reaction, inflammation, or phagocytosis of devitalized cells (Table 1; Fig. 11). This appearance was interpreted by Grunnet and Paulson as a process of "in vivo autolysis", resulting from the "inadequacy of blood supply… through rapidly developing and severe cerebral edema". In such regions, faint preservation of cell and nuclear outlines, including vessels containing red cell contours, is the norm. In many ways, this appearance is analogous to that seen in the retained ("macerated") stillbirth, the brain of which is often the last to disintegrate even at maternal body temperature for prolonged periods, remaining evaluable histologically (Table 4) (personal observation [RDF]). Consequently, in stillbirth the term "necrotic" is not used for this appearance, acknowledging that the fetus was "viable" before the intrauterine demise (whatever its underlying reason). In this setting, the term "mummification" may be applied, particularly referring to a prolonged period of retention in utero; here, anatomic relationships may be relatively well preserved and even amenable to radiographic delineation of cortical ribbon from deeper tissues. "Mummification" is also used in the forensic setting to describe preservation by desiccation, in bodies in dry environments (Table 4; Fig. 12). Histologically, the rehydrated tissue may have pale staining characteristics, but relative preservation of cellular architecture.

### Standardizing lymphangiography and lymphatic interventions: a preclinical in vivo approach with detailed procedural steps [^cdafcd69]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

After lipiodol-based INL, local hemorrhage can be observed around a sharply defined defect region (indicating the needle tract) in the cortex, probably due to the damage of trabecular blood vessels (Fig. 13). The erythrocytes are distributed diffusely in the adjacent parenchyma. Near the needle tract, a few dissociative parenchymal cells indicate local necrosis. In addition, the application of lipiodol brings characteristic changes within the lymph node. Due to histological preprocessing (incl. fixation, dehydration, and paraffin embedding), fat-like substances such as lipiodol were washed out, leaving optically empty spaces. Such empty spaces are found extensively in the parenchyma with a single endo-epithelial layer, predominantly in the expanded extrafollicular region, indicating deposits of lipiodol in dilated sinuses and blood vessels. Microscopically, they look like a sponge filled with water. However. 6 days later, the lipiodol in the sinuses flowed away or was gradually absorbed with the restoration of the dilated sinuses; parenchymal injury and inflammation were not observed (Fig. 13).

Similar to lipiodol-based INL, 6 days after INE, the sinuses within the lymph node were dilated and filled with lipiodol-glue mixtures within the subcapsular and extrafollicular region, obstructing efferent lymphatic vessels and sinuses; noticeably, ectopic embolization of trabecular blood vessels could also be observed (Fig. 13). Besides, mild parenchymal injury consisting of focal nuclear pyknosis and partial loss of intercellular borders could be found around the embolized lymphatic vessels and sinuses (Fig. 13).

### Update on the features and measurements of experimental acute lung injury in animals: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^fae9b479]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2022). High credibility.

Methods — Delphi process for ALI measurement prioritization across domains: similar to the 2011 workshop, a Delphi method was used, with a list of 50 participants finalized; in Round 1, "the 50 participants were asked to complete an electronic survey" addressing the four domains. In Round 2, participants rated each measurement "using a scale of 0–5 (0 = minimal importance, 5 = maximal importance)", with items grouped by domain-specific categories (histology: alveolar spaces, alveolar epithelium, vasculature, alveolar septae, interstitium; barrier alteration: endothelial injury or dysfunction, epithelial injury or dysfunction, lung edema, transfer of plasma or lung constituents; inflammatory response: soluble mediator profiles, inflammatory cellular composition and characteristics, consequences of inflammation; physiologic dysfunction: gas exchange, lung mechanics, vital signs, other aspects). In Round 3, participants chose "the top 4–5 features" per domain; features "selected as 'most relevant' by 30% or more of the respondents were considered 'relevant'", and "a 30% cutoff resulted in at least five measurements named as 'most relevant' in each of the four domains".

### Bleeding and bruising: a diagnostic work-up… [^215f6e6c]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

The PFA-100 simulates the formation of the platelet plug in vivo by passing the patient's blood through an aperture coated with collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. In patients with von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders, the amount of time required for the platelets to aggregate from both collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate is prolonged. A prolonged time to clot to just collagen/epinephrine usually indicates a drug effect, such as from aspirin. The reported sensitivity of the PFA-100 for diagnosing von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders is 88 to 90 percent with a specificity of 86 to 94 percent. Referral If the laboratory work-up does not diagnose a bleeding disorder, but there is still high suspicion based on personal and family history, the patient should be referred to a hematologist.

If von Willebrand's disease, a factor VIII inhibitor, or factor deficiencies are discovered, referral is based on the diagnosis and severity, as well as the comfort level of the physician. If the history, physical examination, or the routine laboratory studies are abnormal in the preoperative assessment, surgery should be delayed until a cause can be determined with a work-up or by referral. RESOLUTION OF CASE STUDIES Case One. Laboratory testing included a normal blood count and platelet count. A PFA-100 test was abnormal to collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. Further testing was diagnostic for von Willebrand's disease. Case Two. A complete blood count, PT, PTT, and PFA-100 were normal. The patient was reassured that with a low bleeding score, a negative family history, and an unremarkable physical examination, she most likely has purpura simplex. She was told to follow up if her symptoms got worse or if she had any new symptoms.

Case Three. Laboratory evaluation included a hemoglobin count of 7 g per dL, a platelet count of 400 × 10³ per μL, a PT of 12 seconds, and a PTT of 100 seconds. A mixing study did not return the PTT to normal. Measurement of factor VIII showed a level of 1 percent, and an assay for the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor showed a high-titer inhibitor.

### Myxoglobulosis in oral extravasation mucocele: an entity? [^d34206b1]. Histopathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Myxoglobulosis is a recognized variant of mucocele of the vermiform appendix. Myxoglobulosis has recently been reported in extravasation mucocele of the oral cavity. This morphological study was carried out to identify the prevalence and possible pathogenesis of this unusual feature.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of archival material diagnosed as oral cavity mucocele was undertaken. This covered a period of 32 months and consisted of 76 cases. In accordance with the proposed traumatic origin of extravasation mucocele, histological changes were classified on the basis of mucin extravasation and cyst formation. Globular structures, as described in the reports of myxoglobulosis, were looked for, as were changes that could be ascribed to their formation.

Conclusions

Globular structures were noted in 22 (31%) of 71 cases of extravasation mucocele. They were present within cysts (11 samples) and in extraluminal connective tissue in the rest. They appeared to originate from alterations in connective tissue collagen following mucin extravasation. Their structure is different from that described in appendicial mucocele. When observed, they are best regarded as part of the normal sequence in the formation of oral cavity extravasation mucocele, without attaching special importance to them.

### Gadopiclenol (Elucirem) [^2ee1add5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Acute Kidney Injury

In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.

5.6 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions

Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.

5.7 Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI

As with any GBCA, ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.

### Is there a shared pathophysiology for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome? [^d04b4efc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by microvascular thrombosis coupled with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and red blood cell fragmentation. Familiar to nephrologists and hematologists alike, classically associated with thrombotic microangiopathy are the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the histories and presentations of which are closely intertwined. Not surprising, these two disorders are considered by many to be manifestations of the same disease process, whereas others consider HUS and TTP to be distinct clinical and pathologic entities. Herein are reviewed HUS and TTP along with recent progress shedding new light on possible shared pathophysiologic mechanisms for these two intriguing disorders.

### Segmental pigmented purpura [^ad228466]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A segmental distribution of pigmented purpura (PP) is rare. Our patient presented at 5 years of age with red-brown petechial macules and telangiectases on her chest, the inner and dorsal aspects of the right upper extremity, and the dorsal aspect of the hand, which had developed slowly over the previous 7 months. The lesions were intermittently pruritic. A biopsy from the right arm revealed discrete hydropic degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, dilation of the blood vessels, numerous extravasated erythrocytes and lymphocytes, and lymphocytes in the lower part of the epidermis. The skin disease resolved almost completely within 18 months. The general physical examination revealed an open foramen ovale, slight hypogammaglobulinemia (G and A), and enhanced fragility of the blood vessels.

### Biochemical and morphological changes in endothelial cells in response to hypoxic interstitial edema [^ef667395]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

The data base for the analysis came, for each animal group, from about 150 counting fields randomly chosen on the micrographs.

For morphometric analysis, primary data (point, line intersection and vesicle counts) were summed over all the micrographs derived from each section and the parameters were computed as the ratio of sums. The parameters were then averaged over the various section samples. Data were expressed as means ± SE. The significance of the differences among groups was determined using one-way ANOVA and t -test.

An estimate of the extravascular water accumulation was obtained for the ratio between the weight of the fresh tissue samples and after drying in the oven at 70°C for at least 24 h (W/D ratio).

### Purpuric lesions in the large bowel [^acfde99d]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Answer

Histological description of skin biopsies is consistent with leucocytoclastic vasculitis, which is diagnostic of IgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura) in the right clinical context. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 revised criteriafor IgA vasculitis requires the mandatory presence of purpura and one of the following four: abdominal pain, supporting histopathology, arthralgia/arthritis and renal involvement. IgA vasculitis is the most common type of vasculitis and usually affects children; however, it is more severe in adults.

Gastrointestinal manifestations are seen in 50%–75% of patients, including diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting and rectal bleeding. Biopsy helps confirm the diagnosis, but negative biopsy does not exclude the disease.EULAR guidelines 2019on IgA vasculitis recommend considering corticosteroids in severe gastrointestinal symptoms; however, the evidence is limited to case series. Recommended doses are 1–2 mg/kg/day for oral prednisolone and 10–30 mg/kg for pulsed IV methylprednisolone, depending on severity. Our patient received intravenous hydrocortisone before the diagnosis was clear and completed reducing prednisolone course with excellent clinical recovery. Differentiating IgA vasculitis from other causes of acute bloody diarrhoea such as inflammatory bowel disease has long-term implications. We highlight the clinical features of the disease with gastrointestinal involvement and advocate endoscopic examination in hospitalised patients.

### Hydroxychloroquine-associated pigmentation after extravasation injury [^ef6c0c0d]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 14-year-old girl with history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with hyperpigmentation on the inner aspect of the left forearm. The pigmented skin lesion persisted for 1 year after minor extravasation injury during an intravenous cannulation procedure on the left forearm. Initial ecchymosis due to the extravasation injury changed to bluish-gray pigmentation in a few weeks. She denied previous history of any other trauma. She had previously been treated with oral steroids and cyclosporine for the management of SLE, but this changed to HCQ and mycophenolate mofetil 21 and 16 months prior, respectively. She had no prior history of hyperpigmentation at sites of trauma or hematoma prior to taking HCQ.

Physical examination demonstrated a palm-sized, bluish-gray patch on the inner aspect of the left forearm (Fig 1, A). At the time of extravasation injury, routine laboratory tests, including platelet count and coagulation panel, were all within the respective normal limits. Histological analysis revealed increased basal pigmentation in the epidermis and yellow-brown granular pigment deposition within macrophages in the mid-to-deep dermis (Fig 1, B and C). Additional staining to clarify the pigment in the dermis revealed positive staining for hemosiderin and negative staining for melanin, suggesting perivascular siderophage infiltration (Fig 1, D and E). The clinical and pathological findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine-associated pigmentation.

### Purpura with cold urticaria in a patient with hepatitis C virus infection-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia type III: successful treatment with interferon-beta [^e7bbd3dd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a 54-year-old man with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-associated cryoglobulinemia type III. The patient had suffered from cold-induced urticaria that left purpuric eruptions up to 1 cm in diameter, intermittent migratory joint pain for seven years and mild liver dysfunction for nine years. Hemophilia A was diagnosed when the patient was 26 years old, and he was then given infusions of factor VIII for a short time. In both skin biopsy samples from urticarial and purpuric eruptions, mild inflammatory infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes with nuclear dust, extravasation of erythrocytes and deposition of IgM and C3 in the superficial blood vessels were observed. After antiviral treatment with interferon-beta, the clinical symptoms and the cryoglobulin and HCV-RNA in the serum disappeared. There has been no recurrence in the subsequent nine years.
