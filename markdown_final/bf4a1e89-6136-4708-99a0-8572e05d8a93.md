## Question

Effects of omega fatty acids on decreasing any specific infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether omega-3 fatty acids decrease the risk of specific infections and, if so, which infections and under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility and mechanisms by which omega-3s could influence infection risk. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for primary prevention in the general population. Next, I will examine secondary prevention and treatment effects in hospitalized or critically ill patients, including sepsis and ARDS. After that, I should review pediatric and perinatal data. I will also consider respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19, and finally synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with attention to dosing, formulation, and guideline context.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale. Omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (EPA and DHA) are anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving: they reduce arachidonic acid–derived proinflammatory eicosanoids and generate specialized pro-resolving mediators (resolvins, protectins, maresins) that can accelerate resolution of inflammation and potentially improve host defense dynamics, which could theoretically reduce infection susceptibility or severity in some contexts [^115MnSyz] [^114c3ZBh].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality primary prevention signal. A large prospective cohort using UK Biobank found that higher baseline omega-3 index (eO3I) was associated with a graded, inverse risk of future sepsis hospitalization over 13 years: HRs of 0.88, 0.80, and 0.75 across quartiles 2–4 versus quartile 1, with a significant trend per SD increase in eO3I, suggesting that higher circulating omega-3 levels may reduce incident sepsis risk in the community [^113ob5Hx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality benefits in established sepsis. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized trials in septic patients show no significant reduction in mortality with omega-3 nutrition, although some report shorter mechanical ventilation duration; infectious complications were not consistently reduced either, so treatment effects in active sepsis remain unproven despite plausible biology [^113ThATf] [^113syd8m] [^111mBHMP].

> I need to check the ICU parenteral nutrition data carefully. Several meta-analyses indicate that omega-3–enriched parenteral nutrition reduces nosocomial infections and sepsis and shortens hospital and ICU length of stay in hospitalized adults, with pooled estimates around a 38–40% reduction in infection and about a 56% reduction in sepsis; however, these are largely non-ICU or mixed ICU cohorts and do not show a consistent mortality benefit, so the clinical applicability is strongest for infection prevention in parenterally fed inpatients rather than mortality modification [^1142KjZF] [^117S3vyB] [^116vASvi].

> Let me consider respiratory viral infections, especially COVID-19. Observational data suggest higher plasma DHA is associated with lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization, and a large app-based study suggested modest reductions in testing positive with omega-3 supplement use, but a rigorous randomized trial of cod liver oil (providing low-dose vitamin D plus EPA/DHA) did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious COVID-19, or other acute respiratory infections, underscoring that confounding and formulation issues complicate inference; thus, no definitive primary prevention effect is established for COVID-19 or URIs from omega-3s alone [^113Q8Gsh] [^115DvgTa] [^111YyTmc] [^113StkQu].

> I should double-check pediatric and perinatal data. Prenatal fish oil supplementation starting at 24 weeks reduced offspring gastroenteritis days and episodes in the first 3 years of life in one RCT, suggesting a specific reduction in gastrointestinal infection burden; however, infant formula enrichment with DHA/ARA/EPA showed no consistent infection benefits except for a signal of fewer lower respiratory tract infections with higher EPA content, and lactation-era maternal/infant fish oil did not reduce overall child morbidity in a low-resource setting, so effects may be context- and dose-dependent and are not uniformly observed [^112xwsne] [^111DAyuv] [^115z6ovr].

> But wait, what about other specific infections or vulnerable populations. In cystic fibrosis, small RCTs show very low-quality evidence with no clear reduction in pulmonary exacerbations or antibiotic use, so routine omega-3 supplementation for infection prevention is not supported there; in HIV, omega-3s may lower CRP but do not demonstrate consistent clinical infection outcome benefits, reinforcing that anti-inflammatory effects do not automatically translate into fewer infections [^116enJ3s] [^114wFvtH].

> I will now examine dosing and formulation nuances because they likely matter. In ICU parenteral nutrition meta-analyses, benefits accrue with fish oil–enriched lipid emulsions typically providing about 0.1–0.2 g/kg/day of fish oil, whereas oral dosing in community studies is far more variable and often lower; moreover, rapid infusion of IV lipid emulsions carries risks in neonates (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, respiratory distress), so product selection and infusion practices must be controlled to avoid iatrogenic harm even if omega-3s are used [^1142KjZF] [^115FGD6F] [^113VYZya].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions before concluding. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against omega-3 fatty acids as immune supplements in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock, reflecting the lack of consistent mortality benefit and potential for harm in some formulations; pediatric critical care guidance similarly does not endorse immunonutrition with omega-3s given limited and inconsistent benefit signals, so routine use for infection prevention in these settings is not advised [^1116pVWH] [^111Zj5AA].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis. The most consistent and specific signal is a reduction in incident sepsis associated with higher premorbid omega-3 status in community cohorts, with additional, formulation-specific evidence that omega-3–enriched parenteral nutrition lowers nosocomial infections and sepsis in hospitalized adults receiving PN; however, there is no proven benefit for preventing common viral URIs or COVID-19 in the general population, and no established benefit for treating active sepsis or reducing sepsis mortality, so clinical application should be cautious and context-specific [^113ob5Hx] [^1142KjZF] [^116vASvi] [^111YyTmc].

> In practical terms, I should confirm that for primary prevention, maintaining an adequate omega-3 status through diet or supplements may modestly reduce long-term sepsis risk, though causality remains unproven; for secondary prevention in the hospital, if parenteral nutrition is required, choosing a fish oil–containing lipid emulsion at 0.1–0.2 g/kg/day is reasonable to lower infection risk, while avoiding use as an immune supplement in active sepsis per guidelines; for respiratory viral prevention, current evidence does not support omega-3s as a standalone strategy, and pediatric routine supplementation for infection prevention is not supported outside of research contexts [^113ob5Hx] [^1142KjZF] [^115FGD6F] [^1116pVWH] [^111Zj5AA].

---

Omega-3 fatty acids have **modest, context-specific benefits** for infection risk, with the most consistent evidence for **reduced nosocomial infections** in critically ill adults receiving parenteral omega-3 [^1142KjZF] [^117S3vyB] and **lower sepsis incidence** in populations with higher omega-3 status [^113ob5Hx]. Evidence for **COVID-19** is mixed: observational data suggest lower risk with higher omega-3 levels [^113Q8Gsh] [^115DvgTa], but a large RCT of cod liver oil found no reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity [^notfound]. There is no consistent benefit for **community-acquired respiratory infections**, and guidelines do not recommend omega-3s for infection prevention in critically ill patients [^1116pVWH]. Overall, omega-3s may reduce infection risk in specific settings but are not a general infection-prevention strategy.

---

## Mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids in infection

Omega-3 fatty acids exert **anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects** that may influence infection susceptibility and outcomes:

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Omega-3s reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) and promote resolution of inflammation via specialized pro-resolving mediators (resolvins, protectins, maresins) [^115MnSyz] [^115DvgTa].

- **Immune modulation**: Omega-3s enhance macrophage phagocytosis and neutrophil function, potentially improving pathogen clearance [^117HdtWC].

- **Barrier function**: Omega-3s may strengthen mucosal barriers, reducing pathogen invasion [^116FBrqv].

---

## Clinical evidence for omega-3 fatty acids in infection

### Respiratory infections

- **COVID-19**: Observational studies suggest higher omega-3 status is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity, but a large RCT of cod liver oil found no significant reduction in infection or severity [^113Q8Gsh] [^115DvgTa].

- **Community-acquired respiratory infections**: Evidence is inconsistent, with no clear benefit from omega-3 supplementation in reducing incidence or severity [^notfound].

---

### Gastrointestinal infections

Gastrointestinal infections show **limited evidence**: maternal omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy reduced gastroenteritis in offspring, but broader pediatric data are inconsistent [^112xwsne] [^111DAyuv].

---

### Nosocomial infections in critically ill patients

Nosocomial infections in critically ill patients show the **strongest evidence**: omega-3–enriched parenteral nutrition significantly reduces nosocomial infections and sepsis in ICU patients, likely via anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [^1142KjZF] [^116vASvi] [^112kMTBL].

---

### Sepsis

Higher omega-3 status is associated with **lower long-term sepsis risk**, but RCTs have not shown consistent mortality benefits in established sepsis [^113ob5Hx] [^113ThATf].

---

## Specific infections with evidence of omega-3 benefit

| **Infection type** | **Evidence summary** | **Strength of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Nosocomial infections in ICU | Significant reduction with omega-3 PN | Strong |
| Sepsis | Lower incidence with higher omega-3 status | Moderate |
| COVID-19 | Observational benefit; RCT null | Mixed |
| Gastroenteritis in children | Maternal omega-3 reduces offspring risk | Moderate |
| Community respiratory infections | No consistent benefit | Weak |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend routine omega-3 supplementation for infection prevention; the **Surviving Sepsis Campaign advises against omega-3s as immune supplements in critically ill patients** [^1116pVWH], and **parenteral nutrition guidelines** suggest omega-3–enriched lipids may be considered in ICU patients to reduce infections, but evidence is evolving [^113uXz92].

---

## Safety considerations

Omega-3s are generally safe, but **high doses (> 3 g/day) can increase bleeding risk** and cause gastrointestinal upset [^notfound]; **parenteral omega-3 lipids** require monitoring for hypersensitivity and infection risk [^113VYZya].

---

## Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acids have **modest, context-specific benefits** for infection risk, with the strongest evidence for **reduced nosocomial infections** in critically ill adults receiving parenteral omega-3 and **lower sepsis incidence** in populations with higher omega-3 status. Evidence for COVID-19 and community respiratory infections is mixed or limited, and omega-3s are not a general infection-prevention strategy.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113ThATf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis reported that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition may reduce mortality in septic patients. As new randomized controlled trials began to accumulate, we conducted an update.

Methods

A PubMed database was searched through Feb 2016, and randomized controlled trials comparing omega-3 fatty acids with control were selected by two reviewers independently.

Results

Eleven trials randomly assigning 808 patients were included in the present study. Using a fixed effects model, we found no significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids on overall mortality (risk ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67 to 1.05, P = 0.12), or infectious complications (risk ratio 0.95; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.25, P = 0.70). However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was markedly reduced by omega-3 fatty acids (weighted mean differences (WMD) = −3.82; 95% CI: −4.61 to −3.04; P < 0.00001). A significant heterogeneity was found when the duration of hospital (I² = 93%; WMD = −2.82; 95% CI: −9.88 to 4.23, P = 0.43), or intensive care stay (I² = 87%; WMD = −2.70; 95% CI: −6.40 to 1.00, P = 0.15) were investigated.

Conclusions

Omega-3 fatty acids confer no mortality benefit but are associated with a reduction in mechanical ventilation duration in septic patients. However, low sample size and heterogeneity of the cohorts included in this analysis limits the generalizability of our findings.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids can influence antigen-presenting cell, T-cell and B-cell function, although their effects on these cell types in humans is not consistently reported. However, they are clearly demonstrated to be anti-inflammatoryand to be converted to specialised proresolving mediators such as resolvins, protectins and maresins. Whether this is a mechanism by which they reduce risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 is not clear. Nevertheless, here we provide evidence to support a protective effect in omega-3 fatty acid supplements users with a 12% reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the overall UK cohort, 21% in the US cohort and 16% in the SE cohort. Although, in the UK, stratified analysis shows this effect is largely driven by females, and only significant in one male stratum.

Probiotics

Probiotics modify the host's gut microbiota and may generate antiviral metabolites, and they interact with the host's gut-associated immune system. This can result in improved immunity, including enhanced responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine. Mechanistic studies support a gut-lung axis, whereby immune effects of microbiota at the gut level can be transferred to the lung, most likely through movement of immune cells. This could explain why some probiotic organisms reduce riskand severityof respiratory tract infections. Here, we provide evidence to suggest that people taking probiotics supplements are modestly protected with a 14% reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the overall UK cohort, 18% in the US cohort and 37% in the SE cohort. However, effects of probiotics are strain and species specific and we have no information of which probiotics or their quality were being used by participants in this study. Moreover, when we adjusted for other covariates including diet, the effect of probiotics was weaker suggesting that probiotic use may be confounded by a healthy diet.

### Association of omega-3 status with long-term risk of hospitalization for sepsis [^113ob5Hx]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection. Despite decades of clinical trials, there are no specific treatments; care of the nearly 50 million annual cases worldwide is limited to antimicrobials and supportive measures. A primary prevention strategy may therefore be of value. We hypothesized that higher premorbid omega-3 fatty acid levels would be associated with a reduced incidence of sepsis.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting

Retrospective data from the United Kingdom (U.K. Biobank).

Patients

Two hundred seventy-three thousand three hundred twenty-five participants from the U.K. Biobank.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Our exposure was baseline estimated omega-3 index (eO3I), modeled both categorically in quartiles, and continuously with restricted cubic splines. Our outcome measure was hospital admission with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition code consistent with sepsis. The median (interquartile range) baseline eO3I was 6.0% (4.8–7.3%). Over a mean follow-up period of 13 years, 9241 participants experienced hospitalization with sepsis. In our adjusted model, compared with the lowest eO3I quartile, participants had lower risks of sepsis incidence in the second quartile (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86–0.91; p < 0.001), third quartile (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.78–0.83; p < 0.001), and fourth quartile (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.77; p < 0.001). When analyzed as a continuous variable, increasing eO3I was associated with a decreasing risk of sepsis (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this population-based cohort study, baseline eO3I was inversely associated with subsequent sepsis incidence. Given that omega-3 levels can be increased with dietary supplementation, primary prevention should be explored to mitigate the burden of sepsis.

Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on infectious complications or the duration of mechanical ventilation

Infectious complications were reported in five studies (Additional file 2: Table S2), we combined these trials in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that omega-3 fatty acids did not affect infectious complications (risk ratio 0.95; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.25, P = 0.70; Fig. 4).

Forest plots show the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on infectious complications in septic patients

The duration of mechanical ventilation was reported in seven studies, but the data from five of them could be combined in the meta-analysis (Additional file 2: Table S2). Our meta-analysis showed that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD = −3.82; 95% CI: −4.61 to −3.04; P < 0.00001; Fig. 5). However, a heterogeneity was found across the trials (I² = 40%; Fig. 5). Sensitivity analyses suggested that no benefit on the duration of mechanical ventilation was observed among the remaining studies after excluded one study (I² = 0%; Additional file 3: Figure 5S). Thus, this result should be interpreted with caution.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: clinical role for alternative intravenous fat emulsions [^111mrF7A]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids classification and inflammatory pathways — introduction/background: Fatty acids (FAs) are categorized by chain length as 2–4 carbons for short-chain FA, 6–12 carbons for medium-chain FA, and ≥ 14 carbons for long-chain FA; saturated FAs have no double bonds, monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) have 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) have 2 or more double bonds. Unsaturated FAs include 3 principal families — ω-3, ω-6, and ω-9 — with the first double bond at the third, sixth, or ninth carbon, respectively; the ω-6 and ω-3 FAs are metabolized through 2 different pathways but use the same enzymes with a preference of ω-3 > ω-6 > ω-9. Clinically, ω-3 FAs are relatively less proinflammatory than ω-6 FAs and some ω-3 FAs may actually have anti-inflammatory effects; more of one FA than another in the diet can drive production toward proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory metabolites, and some evidence suggests certain long-chain FAs may impair immune function via effects on phagocytosis and chemotaxis, increasing infection risk.

### Modulation of host defence against bacterial and viral infections by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^116jutG5]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) are used widely in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, their effect in infectious disease requires a particular attention.

Methods

The present article discusses their anti-inflammatory and immune properties involved in the host defence and presents a systematic review of the effects of their oral administration on the prevention and outcome of experimental and clinical infections.

Results

At a dose corresponding to an human dose of 500 mg/day, n-3 LC-PUFAs intake is beneficial against experimental infections caused by extracellular pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus by reducing inflammation, and reduces the incidence of pneumococcal infections in the elderly, but at 2–4-fold higher doses as occurs in some human intervention and/or during long-term it becomes detrimental in intestinal infections with Citrobacter rodentium or Helicobacter hepaticus by exacerbating anti-inflammatory response. They are also harmful against infections caused by intracellular pathogens as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Influenza virus and Herpes simplex virus by affecting the immune cell response.

Conclusion

The effects of n-3-LC-PUFAs on infections depend on the pathogen and the n-3 LC-PUFA dose and timing. Caution should be recommended for high-dose and long-term supplementation in humans.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111mBHMP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary outcome of our meta-analysis suggested that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition has no benefit on reduction of mortality in septic patient. The secondary outcomes suggested that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition did not increase the infectious complications. Nevertheless, omega-3 fatty acids nutrition failed to show a beneficial effect on the length of hospital stay, or intensive care stay. However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was markedly reduced by omega-3 fatty acids.

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of parenteral omega-3 fatty acids for sepsis found a beneficial effect on mortality (risk ratio 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.99, P = 0.04; 12 trials, 721 patients). Our study is not consistent with this work. The difference of enrolled trials may attribute to the inconsistent result between our study and the previous meta-analysis. In the present meta-analysis, we also investigated that whether the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis was different when it was administrated via parenteral or enteral pathway, and whether the dose and composition of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition could influence its effect.

### Parenteral omega-3 fatty acids: pouring oil on troubled waters? [^112ndDEu]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of parenteral fish oil in 23 studies in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients reported a reduced infection rate (significant in ICU patients) and shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stays (both non-ICU and ICU patients). Parenteral fish oil reduced inflammation and improved oxygenation index and liver function. The findings of the meta-analysis are discussed in this report.

### Effect of daily vitamin D supplementation on risk of upper respiratory infection in older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^116mTuDF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Among individuals with vitamin D deficiency, daily vitamin D supplementation appears to lower risk of acute respiratory infection. However, recent trials, in different populations and using different regimens, have yielded null results. We investigated the effect of daily vitamin D supplementation (vs placebo) on risk of upper respiratory infection (URI) in older adults.

Methods

The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of supplemental vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acids in generally healthy men (age ≥ 50 years) and women (age ≥ 55 years). This prespecified analysis focuses on vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) versus placebo in the 15 804 (61%) participants with baseline serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome was self-report of a recent URI at 1-year follow-up.

Results

Participants had a mean age of 68 years and 51% were women; 76% were non-Hispanic White, 16% Black, and 8% other race/ethnicity. The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 31 (standard deviation, 10) ng/mL, with < 12ng/mL in 2.4%. The overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on recent URI was nonsignificant (odds ratio [OR], 0.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .86–1.06]). In the prespecified subgroup of primary interest (< 12ng/mL and denied taking concurrent vitamin D), which had only 255 participants, vitamin D supplementation was nonsignificant (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, .28–1.30]). Statistical power to assess effect modification in other subgroups was limited.

Conclusions

In older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, supplemental vitamin D did not lower URI risk overall. Whether effects differ in subgroups requires further study. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT01169259.

### Role of arginine and omega-3 fatty acids in wound healing and infection [^113P2JjE]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Significance: Only a few decades ago, the primary focus of nutritional supplementation was to prevent deficiencies of essential nutrients. It is now recognized that, at higher than essential levels, selected nutrients can have a pharmacologic effect to prevent or treat disease. Recent Advances: Two of the most important pharmaconutrients, arginine, and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, have been shown to have profound effects on wound healing and infections. Critical Issues: Both arginine and fish oils have independent benefits, but the combination appears to be much more effective. This combination has been shown to affect outcomes involving wound healing and infections, as reviewed here, and can also affect incidence and outcomes in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, organ transplant rejection, and other inflammatory conditions. These possibilities have not yet progressed to widespread clinical application. Future Directions: The optimal combinations of immunonutrients, timing of administration, and the doses needed for best results need to be determined in preclinical and clinical studies. Also, the mechanisms involved in the administration of pharmaconutrients need to be established.

### Prevention of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections with cod liver oil supplementation, a low dose vitamin D supplement: quadruple blinded, randomised placebo controlled trial [^111YyTmc]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D has received much attention during the covid-19 pandemic for its potential role in preventing and treating covid-19. Preclinical studies have reported a role for vitamin D metabolites in the immune responses to respiratory viruses, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25(OH)D 3) have been associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory infections. A recent meta-analysis, examining 46 randomised controlled trials, concluded that vitamin D supplementation (400–1000 IU/day or 10–25 µg/day) decreased the risk of acute respiratory infections compared with placebo.

Serious covid-19 has been associated with increased inflammation with uncontrolled activation of immune cells and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. Long chained omega 3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, have been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. Ensuring adequate levels of these fatty acids and vitamin D has been proposed as a cost effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious covid-19.

Cod liver oil is a low dose vitamin D supplement with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. A long tradition exists in Norway of taking cod liver oil during the winter to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, we initiated the Cod Liver Oil for Covid-19 Prevention Study (CLOC), where participants were randomised to receive cod liver oil or placebo (corn oil) during the winter of 2020–21, and we examined whether cod liver oil could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, or other acute respiratory infections.

### Prevention of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections with cod liver oil supplementation, a low dose vitamin D supplement: quadruple blinded, randomised placebo controlled trial [^113StkQu]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Few studies have examined omega 3 fatty acids and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, and other acute respiratory infections. The NutriNet-Santé cohort found no association between dietary intake of omega 3 fatty acids and susceptibility to covid-19. Conversely, others have seen an association between omega 3 supplementation and reduced risk of covid-19and upper respiratory tract infections. Also, an inverse association between the omega 3 index in blood and death from covid-19 has been reported. The effect of vitamins A and E, also present in cod liver oil, on SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, and other acute respiratory infections is not known. Vitamin D has been suggested to reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in those with mild to moderate asthma, whereas a Norwegian study found an increase in the incidence of adult onset asthma with the use of cod liver oil. Vitamin A levels in the cod liver oil used in that study were more than three times the daily amount provided by the cod liver oil in our study, however. We believe it is unlikely that vitamin A or E would have masked any effect of vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids on covid-19 disease or other acute respiratory infections.

Only low grade side effects were reported in our trial. More side effects were reported by participants in the placebo group than in the cod liver oil group, including low levels of vitamin D.

### Influence of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids enriched lipid emulsions on nosocomial infections and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients: ICU lipids study [^112kMTBL]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (contained in fish oil) have been shown to beneficially influence infection rate and clinical outcomes in surgical patients probably due to their immunomodulatory action. In contrast, study results of fish oil administration in critically ill patients are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on the prevalence of nosocomial infections and clinical outcomes in medical and surgical critically ill patients.

Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized, comparative, double-blind study.

Setting

Seventeen Spanish ICUs during 4 years.

Subjects

A total of 159 medical and surgical intensive care patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score more than or equal to 13, expected to require total parenteral nutrition for at least 5 days.

Interventions

Patients received total parenteral nutrition prepared either with a lipid emulsion containing 10% fish oil or a fish oil-free lipid emulsion. The prevalence of nosocomial infections was detected during 28 days of ICU stay. Patients were followed 6 months after discharge from the ICU for length of hospital stay, hospital mortality, and 6-month mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

The number of patients with nosocomial infections was significantly reduced in the fish oil-receiving group (21.0% vs 37.2%, p = 0.035) and the predicted time free of infection was prolonged (21 ± 2 vs 16 ± 2 d, p = 0.03). No significant differences were detected for ICU, hospital, and 6-month mortality.

Conclusions

The results show that administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces the risk of nosocomial infections and increases the predicted time free of infections in critically ill medical and surgical patients. The administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was safe and well tolerated.

### Evolving concepts in how viruses impact asthma: a work group report of the microbes in allergy committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^113xeDS1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Prenatal omega-3 fatty acids — dose, timing, and outcome have been reported. In a recent clinical trial, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation at 2.4 g/day to pregnant women, beginning at 24 week of gestation, resulted in a 30% reduction in relative risk of persistent wheeze or asthma at age 3 years, although the report notes the need to ensure no safety issues before use for asthma prevention.

### Omega-3 fatty acid-containing parenteral nutrition in ICU patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis [^1142KjZF]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes

Overall, this meta-analysis showed a positive impact of omega-3 FA-containing PN on clinical outcomes for ICU patients. The relative risk for infection was reduced significantly by 38% with ω-3 FA-containing PN versus standard PN in ICU patients across 8 studies with 795 patients (relative risk [RR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45, 0.86; p = 0.004) (Fig. 1 a). Similarly, critically ill ICU patients had a 35% RR reduction for infection with ω-3 FA-containing PN (5 studies with 659 patients; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46, 0.94; p = 0.02) (Fig. 1 b). There was a not significant trend towards a decreasing incidence of sepsis with ω-3 FA-containing PN (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.26, 1.19; p = 0.13) in 3 studies with 336 ICU patients (Fig. 2). Sepsis was not evaluated for the subgroup of critically ill patients, as the minimum observation requirement was not met. ω-3 FA-containing PN was associated with a non-significant 10% relative risk reduction in 30-day mortality in all ICU patients and the subgroup of critically ill ICU patients across 12 studies with 925 patients (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69, 1.16; p = 0.41) and 10 studies with 835 patients (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69, 1.16; p = 0.41), respectively (Fig. 3 a, b). HLOS was reported in 11 studies with 872 ICU patients and 8 studies with 742 critically ill ICU patients: both patient groups exhibited significant reductions in mean HLOS with ω-3 FA-containing PN of − 3.05 days (95% CI − 5.03, − 1.07; p = 0.003) and − 3.98 days (95% CI − 6.90, − 1.06; p = 0.008), respectively (Fig. 4 a, b). ICU LOS was also significantly reduced with ω-3 FA-containing PN versus standard PN in all ICU patients and critically ill ICU patients: 11 studies (890 patients) reported ICU LOS in the general ICU patient population, with a mean reduction of − 1.89 days (95% CI − 3.33, − 0.45; p = 0.01) (Fig. 5 a) and 9 studies with 826 patients reported a mean ICU LOS reduction of − 2.14 days (95% CI − 3.89, − 0.40; p = 0.02) in critically ill ICU patients (Fig. 5 b). Length of mechanical ventilation was reported in 6 studies (528 patients): Compared with standard PN, ω-3 FA-containing PN was associated with a non-significant reduction of − 0.02 days in length of mechanical ventilation (95% CI − 0.10, 0.05; p = 0.60) (Fig. 6). The relevance of statistically significant outcomes was verified with TSAs: all significant clinical outcomes showed adequate statistical power, meaning the results can be considered conclusive (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Hence, the beneficial effects of a lower infection rate, shorter HLOS as well as ICU LOS are indeed a consequence of the application of an ω-3 FA-containing PN solution.

### Role of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators in pulmonary inflammation diseases: mechanisms and development [^114c3ZBh]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Inflammation response and resolution are complex processes which involve a huge number of immune cells and regulatory factors. The dysregulation of inflammation resolution is the primary pathophysiology of disease development. Therefore, the direct or indirect clearance of pathogens via all types of immune cells limits any overlap between inflammatory phases and prevents chronic inflammation development. SPMs family, their pathways, and receptors could provide a basis for new approaches for treating inflammation-associated diseases, especially in respiratory diseases.

Pneumonia and TB are caused by various microbial factors and produce a complex immune response. Many factors can cause pneumonia. Over the past few decades, coronaviruses have repeatedly posed a public health concern. The coronavirus infection-induced alveolar, lung tissue, and extra-pulmonary damage are major caused by the "inflammatory storms" and immune responses. They also cause higher mortality rates than those elicited by pneumonia due to infection with influenza viruses. Continuing research on coronaviruses has shown that they can elicit an early, rapid immune response. The inflammatory storm might cause lung tissue damage, impair function, and reduce vital capacity. In addition to the pathogenicity of the virus, the body's inflammatory response also has a vital role in cases of coronavirus infection-induced lung injury. Recent studies show that Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA, could reduce the risk of ARDS and the need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Moreover, a traditional Chinese medicine research has shown that the inhibition of the arachidonic-acid metabolic pathway potentially inhibits the release of inflammatory factors and alleviates the "cytokine storm" in the early infectious phase. These researches suggest that SPMs might be a novel target for the rapidly inflammation reaction in the future.

### Protective nutrients [^116FBrqv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Recognition that specific nutrients can be beneficial when consumed in amounts above the accepted daily requirements has provided a major impetus for the critical examination of dietary approaches with single or multiple nutrient supplements chosen to modulate the inflammatory response, enhance immune function, or improve the blood-gut barrier. Patients suffering the effects of hypercatabolism caused by surgery, cancer, or extensive burns are prime candidates for immunonutrition, as the intervention has come to be known, as are immunosuppressed patients with the human immunodeficiency virus or other overwhelming infections. This review focuses on key nutrients used in clinical trials for which a body of information on the mode of action and metabolic pathways is available. The topics covered include the amino acids, glutamine and arginine; omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acid; vitamin A; and zinc. Lastly, we address the area of pre- and probiotics and how "friendly" microorganisms are being incorporated into therapeutic regimens aimed at sustaining health. The use of immunonutrition requires judicious consideration of the potential undesirable effects of certain additives in clinical settings where enhanced immune responsiveness can translate into tissue damage and altered mucosal defenses.

### The role of ω-3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral nutrition in critical illness in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SX5D4]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the supplementation of parenteral nutrition with ω-3 fatty acids confers treatment benefits to critically ill adult patients.

Data Source

We performed computerized searches for relevant articles from 1996 to June 2011 on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane register of controlled trials and abstracts of scientific meetings from 2005 to 2011.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials of ω-3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral nutrition in critically ill adult patients admitted to the intensive therapy unit, given in addition to their routine care, compared with parenteral nutrition without ω-3 fatty acid supplementation.

Data Synthesis

Five fully published trials and three trials published in abstract form with 391 participants have been included. Overall trial quality was poor. Mortality data were pooled from eight studies with 391 participants. No differences were found with a risk ratio for death of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.57, 1.20; p = 0.32). Data for infectious complications were available from five studies with 337 participants. No differences were found, with a risk ratio for infection of 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.43, 1.41; p = 0.41). Data for intensive therapy unit and hospital length of stay were available from six and three studies with 305 and 117 participants, respectively. With respect to intensive therapy unit length of stay, no differences were observed with a mean difference of 0.57 days in favor of the ω-3 fatty acid group (95% confidence interval -5.05, 3.90; p = 0.80). A significant reduction in hospital length of stay of 9.49 days (95% confidence interval -16.51, -2.47; p = 0.008) was observed for those receiving ω-3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral nutrition, but results were strongly influenced by one small study.

Conclusions

On the basis of this systematic review, it can be concluded that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation of parenteral nutrition does not improve mortality, infectious complications, and intensive therapy unit length of stay in comparison with standard parenteral nutrition. Although ω-3 fatty acids appear to reduce hospital length of stay, the poor methodology of the included studies and the absence of other outcome improvements mean they cannot be presently recommended.

### Supplementation with fish oil in pregnancy reduces gastroenteritis in early childhood [^112xwsne]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We hypothesized that insufficient intake of fish oil-derived omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) during pregnancy is a contributing factor to gastroenteritis in early childhood. We examined the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on gastroenteritis symptoms in the offspring's first 3 years of life.

Methods

This was a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial whereby 736 mothers were administered n-3 LCPUFA or control from pregnancy week 24 until 1 week after birth. We measured the number of days with gastroenteritis, number of episodes with gastroenteritis, and the risk of having a gastroenteritis episode in the first 3 years of life.

Results

A median reduction of 2.5 days with gastroenteritis (P = 0.018) was shown, corresponding to a 14% reduction in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with controls in the first 3 years of life (P = 0.037). A reduction in the number of gastroenteritis episodes (P = 0.027) and a reduced risk of having an episode (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% confidence interval, .66-.97]; p = 0.023) were also shown.

Conclusions

Fish oil supplementation from the 24th week of pregnancy led to a reduction in the number of days and episodes with gastroenteritis symptoms in the first 3 years of life. The findings suggest n-3 LCPUFA supplementation as a preventive measure against gastrointestinal infections in early childhood.

### Nutrition of the COVID-19 patient in the intensive care unit (ICU): a practical guidance [^115FGD6F]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of EN enriched with omega-3 fatty acids should be preferred in case of ARDS. Fish oil-enriched intravenous fat emulsions should be prescribed if PN is required

A systematic review and meta-analysis on fish oil (FO) enteral supplementation suggests an advantage for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) acid supplementation in ARDS patients in terms of length of ventilation and length of ICU stay, but not mortality. However, these conclusions were based on low-quality studies. A Cochrane analysis found that enteral EPA and DHA may improve oxygenation and length of ventilation and length of stay, but these findings were mainly based on low-quality evidence studies. Negative outcome associated with administration of enteral FO has been only observed when administered in a bolus and with a low protein regimen. The immunoregulator effects of EPA and DHA may have a beneficial impact in the severe cytokine storm observed in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Therefore, we suggest that EN enriched with 3.5 g/day EPA and DHA can be administered in this disease, not in a bolus. Higher amounts up to 9 g/day have been administered safely.

FO-based intravenous lipid emulsions have been extensively analyzed in a meta-analysis including 49 prospective randomized controlled studies with intervention groups receiving omega-3 fatty acids compared to standard intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs), as a part of PN covering > 70% of the energy provision. Mortality was not decreased significantly, but a significant decrease was observed in relative risk of infection (40% lower) with omega-3 fatty acid-enriched ILEs, in ICU and in hospital lengths of stay. Risk of sepsis was also reduced by 56%. This latest analysis increases our knowledge on FO-enriched lipid emulsions. If PN including ILEs is required in this population suffering from COVID-19 ARDS, FO-enriched lipid emulsions should be prescribed. The provision of omega-3 fatty acids increases the EPA and DHA plasma levels. The recommended FO doses are 0.1–0.2 g/kg/day.

### Association between blood N-3 fatty acid levels and the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 in the UK biobank [^113Q8Gsh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of nutritional status and the risk of contracting and/or experiencing adverse outcomes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are unclear. Preliminary studies suggest that higher n-3 PUFA intakes are protective.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare the risk of 3 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes (testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, hospitalization, and death) as a function of the baseline plasma DHA levels.

Methods

The DHA levels (% of total fatty acids [FAs]) were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. The 3 outcomes and relevant covariates were available for 110,584 subjects (hospitalization and death) and for 26,595 ever-tested subjects (positive for SARS-CoV-2) in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. Outcome data between 1 January, 2020, and 23 March, 2021, were included. The Omega-3 Index (O3I) (RBC EPA + DHA%) values across DHA% quintiles were estimated. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed, and linear (per 1 SD) relations with the risk of each outcome were computed as HRs.

Results

In the fully adjusted models, comparing the fifth to the first DHA% quintiles, the HRs (95% confidence intervals) for testing positive, being hospitalized, and dying with COVID-19 were 0.79 (0.71, 0.89, P < 0.001), 0.74 (0.58, 0.94, P < 0.05), and 1.04 (0.69–1.57, not significant), respectively. On a per 1-SD increase in DHA% basis, the HRs for testing positive, hospitalization, and death, were 0.92 (0.89, 0.96, P < 0.001), 0.89 (0.83, 0.97, P < 0.01), and 0.95 (0.83, 1.09), respectively. The estimated O3I values across DHA quintiles ranged from 3.5% (quintile 1) to 8% (quintile 5).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that nutritional strategies to increase the circulating n-3 PUFA levels, such as increased consumption of oily fish and/or use of n-3 FA supplements, may reduce the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

Clinical Outcomes

For the primary outcome, infection rate, 24 studies (2154 patients) were included that reported any nosocomial infections: 7 studies for ICU patients and 17 for non‐ICU patients. Compared with standard lipid emulsions, ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN resulted in a significant 40% reduction of infection rates (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49‐0.72; P < 0.00001) (Figure 2). No subgroup analysis was performed, as heterogeneity was low (I²: 0%).

### Effects of prolonged breastfeeding and colostrum fatty acids on allergic manifestations and infections in infancy [^116Ro1d2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In developed countries World Health Organization recommendation of 6 months' exclusive breastfeeding is under debate.

Objective

We assessed the impact of predominant breastfeeding (PBF) duration and colostrum long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) profile on the risk of allergic manifestations (wheezing and atopic eczema) and infections [low respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and gastroenteritis] in infancy.

Methods

Information on child feeding practices was obtained from 580 infants of a pregnancy cohort. Presence of infant's health outcomes was documented through questionnaires at 6 and 14 months of age. The LC-PUFAs were measured in colostrum. Adjusted odds ratios (adjOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models.

Results

In comparison with never breastfeeding, PBF for 4–6 months was associated with lower risk of wheezing (adjOR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32, 0.89), LRTIs (adjOR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31, 0.83) and atopic eczema (adjOR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32, 1.04) between months 7 and 14 of life. Results of a risk period-specific analysis (restricted to infants at risk for outcome onset after 6 months of age), showed no indication for reverse causation (results were not very different compared with an overall analysis). Predominantly breastfeeding for 4–6 months was associated with lower risk of gastroenteritis during the first 6 months of life (adjOR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18, 0.64). Among breastfed infants higher doses of arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid, and total n-3 in were associated with a decreased risk of gastroenteritis, but no association was found for allergic manifestations or LRTI.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

Promotion of PBF for 4–6 months could reduce the burden of allergic manifestations and infections in infancy. Beneficial effects of breastfeeding on gastroenteritis were explained in part by exposure to higher doses of n-3 and AA received from colostrum. No significant effects from fatty acid dose were found on risk of allergic manifestations or LRTIs.

### The role of lipid emulsions containing omega-3 fatty acids for medical and surgical critical care patients [^115aGfYQ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence for benefits of PN containing omega-3 PUFAs in critically ill patients

Numerous clinical studies have evaluated mixed-oil ILEs (with or without fish oil) in different critically ill patient populations, with meta-analyses providing supplementary information. Results of most systemic reviews/meta-analyses indicate that ILEs containing fish oil have beneficial effects on the inflammatory response and clinical outcomes, with a notable exception. One meta-analysis screened 1054 studies, including 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1733 patients, finding that PN formulations containing less omega-6 PUFAs (any mixed-oil ILE) were associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay (LOS), and a trend towards reduction in 28-day mortality, ICU LOS, and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. Among the different mixed-oil ILEs, PN containing fish oil reduced the duration of ICU care and the rate nosocomial infection, and a trend towards shorter hospital LOS was observed. These results aligned with a previous large meta-analysis, including 24 RCTs and1421 patients, that reported fewer infections, fewer cases of sepsis, and shorter durations of both hospital and ICU LOS. A subsequent network-meta-analysis by the same group compared PN with and without fish oil (any mixed-oil ILE without fish oil), confirming these findings. Notz et al. also reported benefits for fish oil on mortality rates compared with placebo when fish oil was used as a stand-alone ILE — though the use of pure fish-oil ILEs for adults is experimental and should not (yet) be applied outside a formal clinical study setting.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for cystic fibrosis [^116enJ3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies suggest that a diet rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects for chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review.

Objectives

To determine whether there is evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality and to identify any adverse events associated with supplementation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of last search: 01 April 2020. We also searched online study registries and contacted authors. Date of last search: 12 February 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplements with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

The searches identified 23 studies; five studies with 106 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies and interventions differed. Two studies compared omega-3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks; one study compared omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids to control capsules (customised fatty acid blends) for three months; one study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids to one without for six months; and one study compared omega-3 fatty acids to a placebo for 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias for randomisation, but the risk was unclear in the remaining two studies; all studies had an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Three of the studies adequately blinded participants; the risk of bias for selective reporting was high in one study and unclear for four studies. Two studies reported the number of respiratory exacerbations. At three months, one study (43 participants) reported no change in antibiotic usage. At 12 months the second study (15 participants) reported a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and cumulative antibiotic days in the supplement group compared to the previous year (no data for the control group); very low-quality evidence means we are unsure whether supplementation has any effect on this outcome. With regards to adverse events, one six-week study (12 participants) reported no difference in diarrhoea between omega-3 or placebo capsules; the very low-quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on this outcome. Additionally, one study reported an increase in steatorrhoea requiring participants to increase their daily dose of pancreatic enzymes, but three studies had already increased pancreatic enzyme dose at study begin so as to reduce the incidence of steatorrhoea. One study (43 participants) reported stomach pains at three months (treatment or control group not specified). One six-week study (19 participants) reported three asthma exacerbations leading to exclusion of participants since corticosteroid treatment could affect affect essential fatty acid metabolism. Four studies reported lung function. One six-week study (19 participants) reported an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (L) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), but the very low-quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on lung function. The remaining studies did not report any difference in lung function at three months (unit of measurement not specified) or at six months and one year (FEV 1% predicted and FVC % predicted). No deaths were reported in any of the five studies. Four studies reported clinical variables. One study reported an increase in Schwachman score and weight alongside a reduction in sputum volume with supplementation compared to placebo at three months (data not analysable). However, three studies reported no differences in either weight at six weeks, in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SD) score at six months (very low-quality evidence) or BMI Z score at 12 months. Three studies reported biochemical markers of fatty acid status. One study showed an increase from baseline in both EPA and DHA content of serum phospholipids in the omega-3 group compared to placebo at three months and also a significant decrease in n-6/n-3 ratio in the supplement group compared to placebo; since the quality of the evidence is very low we are not certain that these changes are due to supplementation. One six-month cross-over study showed a higher EPA content of the neutrophil membrane in the supplement group compared to the placebo group, but, no difference in DHA membrane concentration. Furthermore, the leukotriene B 4 to leukotriene B 5 ratio was lower at six months in the omega-3 group compared to placebo. A one-year study reported a greater increase in the essential fatty acid profile and a decrease in AA levels in the treatment arm compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that regular omega-3 supplements may provide some limited benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects: however, the quality of the evidence across all outcomes was very low. The current evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. A large, long-term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes when providing omega-3 supplementation or olive oil placebo capsules. More research is required to determine the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111kUK7z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life threatening systemic inflammatory syndrome that is triggered by infection, and it is a major cause of death in critical ill patients such as severe burn. Even with dramatic advances in pharmacology as well as the technology of intensive care and life supporting, the mortality estimates in septic patients is as high as over 25%. It is suggested that when complicated with organ failure or shock, the mortality in septic patients could be further elevated to 33.2%. Thus, strategies that could play a benefit on survival in septic patients are appreciated.

Omega-3 fatty acids are reported to have a protective role in cardiovascular diseases. And it is also recognized that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating features. Recently, a number of studies have focused on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on septic patients. However, inconsistent findings were reported between trials. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2014 found mortality in septic patients could be reduced by parenteral nutrition of omega-3 fatty acids. However, as the low quality of enrolled trials, the authors concluded that the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the mortality of sepsis was uncertain. Meanwhile, as new randomized controlled trials began to accumulate, we conducted an update and in the present meta-analysis, our goal was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition on mortality, the duration of hospital, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, infectious complications, and the duration of mechanical ventilation in septic patients.

### Fish oil (omegaven) [^113VYZya]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants

In the postmarket setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported.

Strictly adhere to the recommended total daily dosage; the hourly infusion rate should not exceed 1.5 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion.

Carefully monitor the infant's ability to eliminate the infused lipids from the circulation (e.g., measure serum triglycerides and/or plasma free fatty acid levels). If signs of poor clearance of lipids from the circulation occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6) and Overdosage (10)].

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Omegaven contains fish oil and egg phospholipids, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis has been reported following Omegaven administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Omegaven is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish or egg protein or to any of the active or inactive ingredients in Omegaven [see Contraindications (4)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of Omegaven immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures.

5.3 Infections

Lipid emulsions, such as Omegaven, can support microbial growth and are an independent risk factor for the development of bloodstream infections. The risk of infection is increased in patients with malnutrition-associated immunosuppression, long-term use and poor maintenance of intravenous catheters, or immunosuppressive effects of other conditions or concomitant drugs.

To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic technique in catheter placement and maintenance, as well as in the preparation and administration of Omegaven.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of early infections including fever and chills, laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia), and frequently inspect the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge.

### Randomized clinical trial of omega-3 fatty acid-supplemented enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in patients undergoing oesophagogastric cancer surgery [^115U4vn7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Radical surgery offers patients with oesophagogastric cancer the best prospect of cure, but perioperative risks are high. Morbidity rates of up to 43 and 60 per cent following oesophageal and gastric cancer surgery respectively have been reported in the UK. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs) has been shown to be beneficial in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

An immunoenhancing diet (IED) can modulate both the hyperinflammatory and compensatory phases associated with surgery. O-3FAs, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important constituents of immunonutrition owing to their effects on eicosanoid balance. O-3FAs have anti-inflammatory properties, leading to the production of eicosanoids that are less inflammatory than those produced by omega-6 fatty acids (O-6FAs).

The expression of HLA-DR is crucial in the specific immune response to infection. Reduced HLA-DR expression correlates directly with infectious complications and continued sepsis. HLA-DR expression is reduced on the T lymphocytes of patients who develop postoperative infections.

Existing results of immunonutrition in patients with gastrointestinal cancer are inconsistent. Some have reported reduced infective complications and shortened hospital stays–, whereas others have found no advantages–. These studies are confounded by heterogeneous groups of patients with cancer, numerous centres recruiting small numbers of patients and failure to analyse on an intention-to-treat basis–.

The primary aim of the present prospective randomized trial was to study the effect of perioperative enteral immunonutrition with O-3FAs on clinical outcome in a homogeneous group of patients with oesophagogastric cancer. A secondary aim was to examine the immunological effects of O-3FAs on these patients.

### N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, inflammation, and inflammatory diseases [^115MnSyz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammation is part of the normal host response to infection and injury. However, excessive or inappropriate inflammation contributes to a range of acute and chronic human diseases and is characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and other oxidized derivatives), other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species), and adhesion molecules. At sufficiently high intakes, long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as found in oily fish and fish oils, decrease the production of inflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species and the expression of adhesion molecules. Long-chain n-3 PUFAs act both directly (e.g., by replacing arachidonic acid as an eicosanoid substrate and inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism) and indirectly (e.g., by altering the expression of inflammatory genes through effects on transcription factor activation). Long-chain n-3 PUFAs also give rise to a family of antiinflammatory mediators termed resolvins. Thus, n-3 PUFAs are potentially potent antiinflammatory agents. As such, they may be of therapeutic use in a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory settings. Evidence of their clinical efficacy is reasonably strong in some settings (e.g., in rheumatoid arthritis) but is weak in others (e.g., in inflammatory bowel diseases and asthma). More, better designed, and larger trials are required to assess the therapeutic potential of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in inflammatory diseases. The precursor n-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid does not appear to exert antiinflammatory effects at achievable intakes.

### Ω-3 supplementation in HIV-1-infected individuals with unsuppressed viral load: cause for caution? [^113VAW5T]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Dietary n-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, mainly eicosapentaenoic (C20: 5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (C22: 6n-3, DHA) are useful to decrease hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-1-infected patients. These fatty acids are readily incorporated in cell membranes, changing the properties of the phospholipid bilayer. Whether this triggers HIV-1 replication and infectivity remains unexplored, as data are limited to clinical trials conducted in patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART), thus precluding the evaluation of any potential effect on viral load. To address this issue, we set up an ex-vivo experiment to test HIV-1 infectivity and replication after inducing a range of ω-3 content in CD4 + T cell membranes resembling to those obtained after dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish and most fish oil capsules contain both EPA and DHA species at different doses, with DHA usually being the most abundant. The issue of whether all ω-3 species are equal regarding their effects remains elusive. To avoid this caveat, we used DHA as supplemental fatty acid because it is the most abundant ω-3 in cell membranes.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during childhood in preventing allergic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kMD1x]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early omega-3 fatty acids exposure can influence early immune development and potentially prevent allergic disease.

Objectives

To review the effects of omega-3 fatty acids during childhood on allergic disease outcomes.

Methods

We conducted searches of the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and international trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN Registry) to September 30, 2018. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies regarding the effect of omega-3 fatty acids during childhood on allergic disease outcomes. A total of 8 publications from 2 prospective cohort studies and 6 reports representing 5 unique RCTs were included.

Results

The results of meta-analysis showed that omega-3 fatty acids during childhood did not appear to significantly alter the risk of any atopy (≤ 3years old: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.04, p = 0.08; > 3years old: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16, p = 0.77), wheeze (≤ 3years old: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.26, p = 0.375; > 3years old: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.00, p = 0.929) and eczema (≤ 3years old: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08, p = 0.20; > 3years old: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35, p = 0.60).

Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support omega-3 fatty acids during childhood could reduce the risk of allergic disease.

### Omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to prevent preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Mfh86]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 in reducing the incidence of preterm birth.

Data Sources

Searches were performed in MEDLINE, OVID, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with the use of a combination of keywords related to "fish oil", "pregnancy", and "omega-3".

Methods Of Study Selection

We included all randomized controlled trials of asymptomatic women with singleton gestations who were randomized to prophylactic treatment with either omega-3 supplementation or control (either placebo or no treatment). Exclusion criteria included trials in women with multiple gestations, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia at randomization, prior preterm birth, and trials with polyunsaturated fatty acids as control.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Nine randomized trials including 3,854 eligible women were identified. Women who received omega-3 had a similar rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation compared with women in the control group (7.7% compared with 9.1%, respectively; relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.11). There were no significant differences in birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or perinatal death in the omega-3 compared with control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the subgroup analyses, except for the rate of perinatal death, which was lower (0.3% compared with 1.2%; relative risk 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.80) in the women who received omega-3 before 21 weeks of gestation and in trials with low risk of bias (0.3% compared with 1.0%; relative risk 0.28, 95% CI 0.09–0.89) compared with women in the control group. However, in no randomized controlled trial was perinatal death the primary outcome.

Conclusion

Omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the incidence of preterm birth or improve neonatal outcome.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^115pe8Za]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

There is considerable confidence in the effect estimates of the current study as assessed using GRADE and trial sequential analysis. This is necessary for the result to be relevant to clinical practice. 76 The quality of evidence for clinical outcomes and all laboratory parameters (except TNF‐α) were rated as high or moderate. Moreover, there was no evidence of meta‐bias (reporting bias) from funnel plots. Although we have a high level of confidence in the meta‐analysis estimates, especially infection and sepsis reduction estimates, ideally it would be useful to confirm these evaluations by performing further large‐scale RCTs. In particular, large, properly designed trials are required to prove or reject any effect on mortality rates. Finally, we adhered to best practices, such as prospective registration of methods and following the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta‐analyses.

In summary, this meta‐analysis confirms and extends previous results in greater numbers of patients and clinical trials, providing greater precision. It provides clear evidence that omega‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN provides significant clinical and nonclinical benefits over standard non‐ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN in adult hospitalized patients.

### European Respiratory Society research seminar on preventing pediatric asthma [^114eS8e1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.8 Fish Oil

Dietary changes in westernized countries have resulted in an increase in the intake of n −6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and a decrease in the intake of n −3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially the long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n −3 LCPUFA) — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — found in oils from cold‐water fish. There is considerable evidence from observational human studies and animal studies that low levels of n −3 LCPUFA during pregnancy might increase the risk of atopic disorders in the offspring, including asthma, allergy and atopic dermatitis, but the evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of fish oil supplementation has been inconsistent. An RCT of fish oil supplementation during pregnancy in 736 Danish women found that supplementation in the last trimester of pregnancy reduced the risk of asthma in the offspring by 30% by age 5 years. This effect was most pronounced in mothers with low EPA and DHA blood levels before the intervention, and in mothers who carried fatty acid desaturases (FADS) gene risk variants associated with lower levels of EPA and DHA. Evidence of a protective effect was also found for RTIs and gastroenteritis, while there was no effect on allergy or atopic dermatitis. Surprisingly, supplementation with fish oil was associated with an increased body mass index (BMI) during childhood. These results need to be replicated in future large‐scale trials to provide sufficient evidence base for recommendations on fish oil supplementation during pregnancy. Future studies should address the unexpected protective effects against infections, and potential modifying factors, such as maternal EPA and DHA blood levels, genotype, lifestyle, dietary factors, and ethnicity. Also, potential adverse effects should be investigated including metabolic consequences of a potential increase in childhood BMI. If the beneficial effects on early asthma and infections are confirmed, fish oil supplementation during pregnancy could be one of the first preventive measures for these common childhood disorders, with large health benefits in offspring of high‐risk mothers. From a research perspective, this could also provide insight into the still poorly understood mechanisms of infection susceptibility in childhood.

### Immunonutrition as an adjuvant therapy for burns [^113kfMvj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

With burn injuries involving a large total body surface area (TBSA), the body can enter a state of breakdown, resulting in a condition similar to that seen with severe lack of proper nutrition. In addition, destruction of the effective skin barrier leads to loss of normal body temperature regulation and increased risk of infection and fluid loss. Nutritional support is common in the management of severe burn injury, and the approach of altering immune system activity with specific nutrients is termed immunonutrition. Three potential targets have been identified for immunonutrition: mucosal barrier function, cellular defence and local or systemic inflammation. The nutrients most often used for immunonutrition are glutamine, arginine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids and nucleotides.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a diet with added immunonutrients (glutamine, arginine, BCAAs, n-3 fatty acids (fish oil), combined immunonutrients or precursors to known immunonutrients) versus an isonitrogenous diet (a diet wherein the overall protein content is held constant, but individual constituents may be changed) on clinical outcomes in patients with severe burn injury.

Search Methods

The search was run on 12 August 2012. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), ISI WOS SCI-EXPANDED & CPCI-S and four other databases. We handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, screened reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies. We updated this search in October 2014, but the results of this updated search have not yet been incorporated.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of immunonutrients to a standard nutritional regimen versus an isonitrogenated diet or another immunonutrient agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors were responsible for handsearching, reviewing electronic search results and identifying potentially eligible studies. Three review authors retrieved and reviewed independently full reports of these studies for inclusion. They resolved differences by discussion. Two review authors independently extracted and entered data from the included studies. A third review author checked these data. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with the third and fourth review authors. Outcome measures of interest were mortality, hospital length of stay, rate of burn wound infection and rate of non-wound infection (bacteraemia, pneumonia and urinary tract infection).

Main Results

We identified 16 trials involving 678 people that met the inclusion criteria. A total of 16 trials contributed data to the analysis. Of note, most studies failed to report on randomisation methods and intention-to-treat principles; therefore study results should be interpreted with caution. Glutamine was the most common immunonutrient and was given in seven of the 16 included studies. Use of glutamine compared with an isonitrogenous control led to a reduction in length of hospital stay (mean stay -5.65 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.09 to -3.22) and reduced mortality (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). However, because of the small sample size, it is likely that these results reflect a false-positive effect. No study findings suggest that glutamine has an effect on burn wound infection or on non-wound infection. All other agents investigated showed no evidence of an effect on mortality, length of stay or burn wound infection or non-wound infection rates.

Authors' Conclusions

Although we found evidence of an effect of glutamine on mortality reduction, this finding should be taken with care. The number of study participants analysed in this systematic review was not sufficient to permit conclusions that recommend or refute the use of glutamine. Glutamine may be effective in reducing mortality, but larger studies are needed to determine the overall effects of glutamine and other immunonutrition agents.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — immune-modulating formulas: Based on expert consensus, we suggest the use of either arginine-containing immune-modulating formulations or EPA/DHA supplement with standard enteral formula in patients with TBI. Evidence is limited; only 1 small trial in adults (40 patients) compared immune-modulating formulations (containing arginine, glutamine, prebiotic fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids) with standard enteral formulations in TBI patients and demonstrated decreased infections.

### Prenatal primary prevention of mental illness by micronutrient supplements in pregnancy [^115ygzb5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Genes, infection, malnutrition, and other factors affecting fetal brain development are a major component of risk for a child's emotional development and later mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. Prenatal interventions to ameliorate that risk have yet to be established for clinical use. A systematic review of prenatal nutrients and childhood emotional development and later mental illness was performed. Randomized trials of folic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements assess effects of doses beyond those adequate to remedy deficiencies to promote normal fetal development despite genetic and environmental risks. Folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example. Vitamins A and D are currently recommended at maximum levels, but women's incomplete compliance permits observational studies of their effects. Folic acid and phosphatidylcholine supplements have shown evidence for improving childhood emotional development associated with later mental illnesses. Vitamins A and D decreased the risk for schizophrenia and autism in retrospective observations. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk for schizophrenia and increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but in later pregnancy it decreased childhood wheezing and premature birth. Studies are complicated by the length of time between birth and the emergence of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, compared with anomalies like facial clefts identified at birth. As part of comprehensive maternal and fetal care, prenatal nutrient interventions should be further considered as uniquely effective first steps in decreasing risk for future psychiatric and other illnesses in newborn children.

### Left ventricular assist devices: a primer for the general cardiologist [^111w6oxn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple pharmacologic therapies have been examined for their benefits as both primary and secondary prevention agents of GIB. Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to significantly decrease the rates of gastrointestinal bleeds, number of blood product transfusions, days in the hospital, and gastrointestinal procedures in patients with LVAD which is thought to be mediated through its anti‐inflammatory properties. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been extensively studied as a secondary prevention agent, and has been shown to decrease the frequency of GIBsecondary to increased splanchnic vasoconstriction, enhancement of platelet aggregation, and inhibition of gastrointestinal angiogenesis. Patients on digoxin were also found to have fewer GIB from angiodysplasias attributed to suppression of neoangiogenesis.

In patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeds who have failed other measures, strategies such as holding or decreasing antiplatelet therapy dosing or pursuing lower INR goals are often entertained as possible options. However, these strategies should be considered with caution based on device type. While decreasing antiplatelet dosing may decrease GIB, it has also been shown to increase the rate of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in patients with HeartWare devices. Evaluation of the cessation of antiplatelet therapy in the HM3 device is currently underway, and small studies have reported no difference in stroke rates in these devices at lower INR goals (1.5–1.9).

Infection

Although LVADs are internal, the driveline exits the abdominal wall, and this external portion is a large source of infection. Major infection is the most common adverse event among patients with LVAD in the STS INTERMACS Database. Forty percent of patients supported by an axial flow device, 43% with a CF‐Hybrid levitation device, and 33% with a CF‐Full magnetic levitation device experience a major infection during the first year of follow‐up after LVAD implantation. The incidence of infection is highest in the early postimplant period, but the risk of infection persists during the entire duration of device support. Infections in patients supported by an LVAD may be characterized as VAD‐specific, VAD‐related, or non‐VAD infections. Most VAD‐specific infections are localized to the driveline, but these infections may also affect the LVAD pump, cannula, or pocket. VAD‐related infections include endocarditis, bloodstream infections, and mediastinitis from sternal wound or pocket infection. Common non‐VAD infections include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cholecystitis, and clostridium difficile infection.

### Omega-6 sparing effects of parenteral lipid emulsions-an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^115EFoZC]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Critical illness is often characterized by an imbalanced immune response, which can lead to excessive cytokine release and accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress ultimately result in tissue damage, multi organ failure and high mortality rates. Parenteral lipid emulsions provide fatty acids (FAs) as a source of calories and cellular building blocks and have been under investigation because of their immunomodulating features. Traditionally, parenteral lipid emulsions are derived from plant — and especially soybean oil (SO) to provide the patient with essential long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, SO's ratio of omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs to omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs (7:1) is being regarded critically. In vivo, linoleic acid (omega-6) is converted to arachidonic acid and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. On the other hand, α-linolenic acid (omega-3) is the metabolic precursor of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which both have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties like inhibitory effects on various innate and adaptive immune cells and the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Unfortunately, the pathway of α-linolenic acid conversion to DHA and EPA appears to be highly ineffective in most humans and an abundance of omega-6 FAs will furthermore suppress the balancing effects of omega-3 FA conversion, as both FAs (omega-3 and omega-6) compete for the same enzymes. Therefore, omega-6 FA reducing strategies have been introduced to clinical nutrition. A reduction in omega-6 FAs can be achieved with the addition of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), olive oil (OO) or fish oil (FO) to SO-based lipid emulsions. FO supplements, as a major source of DHA and EPA, can simultaneously provide adequate levels of omega-3 FAs, which is regarded as an attractive immunomodulatory treatment option with potential clinical benefits. Hitherto, meta-analyses solely focused on the FO aspect, resulting in limited evidence regarding the overall picture of omega-6 FA reduction. After aggregating 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2015, Manzanares et al. found that lipid emulsions with a FO component may reduce infectious complications, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and hospital length of stay (LOS) in critically ill patients. In the most recent meta-analysis by Pradelli et al. FO containing parenteral nutrition (PN) again reduced the rate of infections and hospital as well as ICU LOS. Current nutrition guidelines state that DHA and EPA (FO dose of 0.1–0.2 g/kg/d) can be provided in patients receiving PN. Ambiguous results regarding other omega-6 sparing strategies are delineated, however without a clear recommendation. In recent years, several new RCTs on omega-6 sparing effects in general and on FO-containing lipid emulsions in particular have been published. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to give a broad and comprehensive update on the emerging topic.

### Short-chain fatty acids as a potential treatment for infections: a closer look at the lungs [^111tPyK9]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main metabolites produced by the gut microbiota via the fermentation of complex carbohydrates and fibers. Evidence suggests that SCFAs play a role in the control of infections through direct action both on microorganisms and on host signaling. This review summarizes the main microbicidal effects of SCFAs and discusses studies highlighting the effect of SCFAs in the virulence and viability of microorganisms. We also describe the diverse and complex modes of action of the SCFAs on the immune system in the face of infections with a specific focus on bacterial and viral respiratory infections. A growing body of evidence suggests that SCFAs protect against lung infections. Finally, we present potential strategies that may be leveraged to exploit the biological properties of SCFAs for increasing effectiveness and optimizing patient benefits.

Sepsis was reported in 9 studies (1141 patients), of which 2 were ICU studies and 7 non‐ICU studies. Compared with standard lipid emulsions, ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN resulted in a significant 56% reduction in the risk of sepsis (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28‐0.70; P = 0.0004) (Figure 6). No meta‐analyses were performed on hospital readmissions, ICU‐free days, or ventilation‐free days, as only 1 or no studies reported each of these outcomes.

Trial sequential analysis for all significant clinical outcomes (infection rate, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and sepsis) showed adequate power (Figures S1–S4), and thus these estimates can be considered conclusive.

Nonclinical Outcomes

Significant benefits were found in 10 of the 24 laboratory parameters analyzed (Table S2). These were significant benefits in marker liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, and GGT), higher levels of the antioxidant α‐tocopherol, as well as lower levels for markers of inflammation such as TNF‐α. A significant benefit was observed in fatty‐acid profiles, with increases in levels of the ω‐3 fatty acids, DHA, and EPA. A positive influence was also observed on LT levels, with a significant increase in LTB5 levels as well as on the LTB5:LTB4 ratio. PTT also increased significantly.

### Emerging pathways of action of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [^114tk5Jq]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammation contributes centrally to the genesis of plaque rupture and ischemic events. Contemporary data support that the risk associated with arterial inflammation persists independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The data from Reilly et alsuggest that EPA could help address this component of residual cardiovascular risk. Analyses from REDUCE-IT show consistent clinical benefits of EPA across baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (and triglycerides, as noted in the previous text). Anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the adaptive immune modulation beyond those assessed by the biomarkers of innate immunity previously reported in REDUCE-IT, such as the effects on T cells reported by Reilly et al, could contribute to these benefits.

The valuable data from Reilly et aladd to other important experimental data that have shown cell membrane stabilizing properties, other anti-inflammatory effects, antioxidant benefits, and antithrombotic properties of EPA, beyond its ability to lower levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. These laboratory data complement several randomized imaging trials that also show effects of EPA on slowing or even reversing coronary plaque progression, including the first demonstration of an effect of any drug on improving noninvasively determined fractional flow reserve on CT angiography.

The present analysis should prompt further research on EPA. This molecule, highly conserved through evolution, appears to play a fundamental role in cardiovascular biology. In REDUCE-IT, no apparent excess in infections emerged; thus, unlike some other targeted anti-inflammatory agents, there does not appear to be an infectious disease risk associated with EPA. This observation opens the door to the study of EPA in other disease states where the effects described by Reilly et alon T cells may also provide clinical benefit.

Carefully performed basic science experiments such as the current ones by Reilly et alshould help convince physicians that data from REDUCE-IT and several other consistent clinical and imaging trials have a firm biological basis. Hopefully, this deeper understanding of the emerging pathways of action of EPA (Figure 1) will translate into appropriate patients being identified and treated with icosapent ethyl in daily practice.

### Dietary omega-3 fatty acids increase survival and decrease bacterial load in mice subjected to Staphylococcus aureus-induced sepsis [^1114UHnC]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus is increasing in incidence. With the alarming use of antibiotics, S. aureus is prone to become methicillin resistant. Antibiotics are the only widely used pharmacological treatment for sepsis. Interestingly, mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have better survival of S. aureus-induced sepsis than mice fed HFD rich in saturated fatty acids (HFD-S). To investigate what component of polyunsaturated fatty acids, i.e., omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, exerts beneficial effects on the survival of S. aureus-induced sepsis, mice were fed HFD rich in omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to inoculation with S. aureus Further, mice fed HFD-S were treated with omega-3 fatty acid metabolites known as resolvins. Mice fed HFD rich in omega-3 fatty acids had increased survival and decreased bacterial loads compared to those for mice fed HFD-S after S. aureus-induced sepsis. Furthermore, the bacterial load was decreased in resolvin-treated mice fed HFD-S after S. aureus-induced sepsis compared with that in mice treated with vehicle. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids increase the survival of S. aureus-induced sepsis by reversing the deleterious effect of HFD-S on mouse survival.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^116tQWVe]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Critically ill patients show a stereotype metabolic response to injury that affects carbohydrate metabolism, causing hyperglycemia, which is boosted by the actions of counterregulatory hormones. This metabolic response makes the critically ill patient especially susceptible to infection and increases morbidity and mortality. The control of blood glucose levels and adequate nutritional support contribute to metabolic improvement and help reduce the risk of infection.

Glycemic variability (GV) has been independently associated with mortality and a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection in critically ill patients. Accordingly, it has been proposed that this variability could be improved by modifying the composition of the standard enteral nutrition formula given to the patient. In an effort to avoid the detrimental consequences of hypoglycemia, many ICUs have elevated their targeted lower limits for glucose levels. However, to date no consensus has been reached on the optimal target glucose range.

Hyperglycemia in the ICU patient can be treated with exogenous insulin and by the enteral administration of diabetes-specific formulas. Although the use of standard enteral nutrition (EN) products is widely accepted, the benefits of disease-specific or modified standard enteral formulas for hospitalized patients with diabetes remain controversial. When used as short- to medium-term treatment, a standard high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet may compromise glycemic control. By modifying carbohydrate composition and adding monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and fiber, studies have shown improved glycemic control compared with a standard diet. However, few studies have examined the benefits of diabetes-specific formulas in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia.

We hypothesized that in the hyperglycemic, critically ill patient, the use of a diabetes-specific nutrition formula might serve to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infection. The aim of our study was to compare, in mechanically ventilated ICU patients with hyperglycemia, the use of three EN formulas: a standard EN formula, a widely used diabetes-specific formula and a new-generation diabetes-specific formula. This last formula contains high protein levels, MUFA, slowly absorbed carbohydrates, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and is enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and fiber.

### Enrichment of infant formula with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of infection and allergy in the nationwide ELFE birth cohort [^111DAyuv]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The new European regulations require the enrichment of formulas with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) because of the positive effects of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) on neurodevelopment and visual acuity. In this observational study, we aimed to evaluate whether the consumption of LCPUFA-enriched formula was associated with the risk of infection and allergy in early childhood.

Methods

Analyses involved data from 8389 formula-fed infants from the ELFE birth cohort. Formula enrichment was identified from the list of ingredients of the formula consumed at 2 months. Infections (gastrointestinal, lower respiratory tract [LRTI], upper respiratory tract) and allergies (wheezing, itchy rash, asthma medication, food allergy) from age 2 months to 5.5 years were reported by parents during follow-up surveys. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess associations between the consumption of LCPUFA-enriched formula and the risk of infection and allergy.

Results

Among formula-fed infants at 2 months, 36% consumed formula enriched with DHA and arachidonic acid (ARA), and 11% consumed formula additionally enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Enriched formula consumption was not associated with infection or allergy, except for an association between consumption of DHA/ARA/EPA-enriched formula and lower use of asthma medications. Furthermore, as compared with non-DHA/ARA/EPA-enriched formula, consumption of formula with high EPA content (≥ 3.2 mg/100 kcal) was related to lower risk of LRTI and lower use of asthma medications.

Conclusion

This study suggests that consumption of DHA/ARA/EPA-enriched formula (especially those with high EPA content) is associated with a lower risk of LRTI and lower use of asthma medications.

### Omega-3 fatty acids improve the diagnosis-related clinical outcome [^111tR5t2]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Supplementation of clinical nutrition with omega-3 fatty acid in fish oil exerts immune-modulating and organ-protective effects, even after short-term application. The aim of this study was to evaluate dose-dependent effects of parenteral supplementation of a 10% fish oil emulsion (Omegaven, Fresenius-Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) on diagnosis- and organ failure-related outcome.

Design

Prospective, open label, multiple-center trial.

Patients and Methods

A total of 661 patients from 82 German hospitals receiving total parenteral nutrition for ≥ 3 days were enrolled in this study. The sample included 255 patients after major abdominal surgery, 276 with peritonitis and abdominal sepsis, 16 with nonabdominal sepsis, 59 after multiple trauma, 18 with severe head injury, and 37 with other diagnoses. The primary study end point was survival; secondary end points were length of hospital stay and use of antibiotics with respect to the primary diagnosis and the extent of organ failure. Multiple quasi-linear and logistic regression models were used for calculating diagnosis-related fish oil doses associated with best outcome.

Results

The patients enrolled in this survey were (mean ± sd) 62.8 ± 16.5 yrs old, with a body mass index of 25.1 ± 4.2 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score of 32.2 ± 13.6. Length of hospital stay was 29.1 ± 18.7 days (12.5 ± 14.8 days in the intensive care unit). Total parenteral nutrition, including fish oil (mean, 0.11 g.kg(-1).day(-1)), was administered for 8.7 ± 7.5 days and lowered hospital mortality as predicted by Simplified Acute Physiology Score II from 18.9% (95% confidence interval, 17.4–20.4%) to 12.0% (p < .001). The fish oil dose.kg.day did correlate with beneficial outcome (intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, mortality). Fish oil had the most favorable effects on survival, infection rates, and length of stay when administered in doses between 0.1 and 0.2 g.kg(-1).day(-1). Lower antibiotic demand by 26% was observed when doses of 0.15–0.2 g.kg(-1).day(-1) were infused as compared with doses of < 0.05 g.kg(-1).day(-1). After peritonitis and abdominal sepsis, multiple quasi-linear regression models revealed a fish oil dose for minimizing intensive care unit stay of 0.23 g.kg(-1).day(-1) and an inverse linear relationship between dosage and intensive care unit stay in major abdominal surgery.

Conclusion

Administration of omega-3 fatty acid may reduce mortality, antibiotic use, and length of hospital stay in different diseases. Effects and effect sizes related to fish oil doses are diagnosis dependent. In view of the lack of substantial study literature concerning diagnosis-related nutritional single-substrate intervention in the critically ill, the present data can be used in formulating hypotheses and may serve as reference doses for randomized, controlled studies, which may, for instance, confirm the value of omega-3 fatty acid in the adjunctive therapy of peritonitis and abdominal sepsis.

### Association between enteral essential fatty acids and plasma phospholipid essential fatty acids related immune response in critically ill adults with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study [^111afQQR]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronaviruses infect the epithelium, modifying host cell metabolism by catabolizing plasma and membrane phospholipid to produce lipid components essential to viral replication. The coronavirus spike protein has three binding pockets for linoleic acid (18:2n‐6, LA), stabilizing the locked S conformation. We recently reported that COVID‐19 infection results in early fundamental depletion of plasma essential n‐6 fatty acid levels suggesting competition between virus and host for essential fatty acid. In patients with high mortality depletion of plasma n‐6 fatty acids content results in n‐6 fatty acid levels that may be too low to stimulate host immunity. At hospital admission, COVID‐19 infected patients who survive exhibit higher proportions of 20:4n‐6 in plasma phospholipids concurrent with elevation in plasma TNF‐α and IFN‐ɣ level compared with healthy patients. In contrast, more than half of patients who die of this virus exhibit very low 18:2n‐6 and 20:4n‐6 content in plasma phospholipids on hospital admission and a low level of primary inflammatory signals indicating limited stimulation of host immunity. Thus, COVID‐19 infection results in early and varied aberrations of essential fatty acid metabolism. Several papers and reviews examining the role of n‐3 fatty acids suggest that n‐3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of infection and provide an antiviral therapy to reduce the 'broad' risk after infection. Definitive studies of signals and immunological events affected are lacking.

We hypothesized that enteral formulas containing 20:5n‐3 and 22:6n‐3 would increase the concentration of circulating plasma phospholipid n‐3 essential fatty acids and modify the immune response by decreasing proinflammatory signals. This hypothesis was assessed in a prospective cohort study by feeding 20:5n‐3 and 22:6n‐3 to patients admitted to the ICU with COVID‐19‐associated respiratory failure to determine benefit to restoring the balance of essential fatty acids and impact on markers of immune response. This knowledge could affect treatment and disease outcome during hospitalization in the ICU because 25–50% of these patients do not survive.

### Immunonutrition [^111kbNL3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To outline recent findings on the efficacy of immunonutrients in patients undergoing inflammatory stress due to surgery, infection and cancer.

Recent Findings

Enteral nutrition is more efficacious and poses lower risks than parenteral nutrition. It reduces infection rates and shortens ICU and hospital length of stay of critically ill patients. Beneficial effects of immunonutrition are most apparent in malnourished patients. Perioperative enteral nutrition is more effective than postoperative nutrition. In Crohn disease similar remission rates are achieved with enteral nutrition as with steroids. Glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants exert beneficial influences in diverse patient populations. L-arginine is an important immunonutrient having both beneficial and adverse effects. The former effect occurs in necrotizing enterocolitis; the latter influence is seen in septic patients. The gut plays a major role in whole body amino acid metabolism, particularly arginine homeostasis. Arginase and nitric oxide synthetase compete for arginine within immune cells and play a pivotal role in clinical outcome during infection. In cancer a range of antioxidants are able to ameliorate immunosuppression. Intravenous lipids may be deleterious due to the pro-inflammatory effects of omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and combined with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and olive oil may provide a more efficacious form of intravenous lipid.

Summary

Immunonutrition is effective in improving outcome in a wide range of patients when applied enterally, particularly in malnourished individuals. Parenteral immunonutrition carries a higher risk but can be efficacious in selected patient groups for whom enteral nutrition is problematic.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116Kr2C1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Subgroup analysis

Subgroup analysis was performed to investigate that whether the effect of omega-3 fatty acids enriched nutrition on sepsis was influenced by its dose and composition, or a different administration route (either parenteral or enteral pathway). Our meta-analysis indicated that neither parenteral (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.14, P = 0.26; Additional file 9: Figure 3S1; included 6 trials) nor enteral (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.16, P = 0.29; Additional file 10: Figure 3S2; included 4 studies) omega-3 fatty acids nutrition influenced mortality in septic patients.

During the 11 trials included in the present meta-analysis, six trials investigated Omegaven (a commercially available omega-3 fatty acids enriched parenteral nutrition), however, only five of them reported mortality (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.16, P = 0.30; Additional file 11: Figure 4S1); Oxepa (a commercially available omega-3 fatty acids enriched enteral nutrition) was studied in three trials (risk ratio 1.03; 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.62, P = 0.89; Additional file 12: Figure 4S2), one studies investigated self-made omega-3 fatty acids enriched enteral nutrition (risk ratio 0.63; 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.00; Fig. 2) as well as one trial investigated Lipolus (a commercially available omega-3 fatty acids enriched parenteral nutrition, risk ratio 0.77; 95% CI: 0.25 to 2.34; Fig. 2). Our meta-analysis suggested that none of the four type of omega-3 fatty acids enriched nutrition has a benefit on mortality.

### Systematic review of preoperative n-3 fatty acids in major gastrointestinal surgery [^114acdBP]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Major gastrointestinal surgery results in postoperative catabolism. The aim of preoperative nutritional intervention is to optimize nutritional stores before major surgery, to pre-empt and mitigate postoperative catabolism. Immunonutrition may add to this by specific immunomodulatory effects of nutrients, such as: arginine, glutamine, omega-3 (or n-3) fatty acids, and nucleotides. These may attenuate the postoperative inflammatory response. Analyses of therapeutic effects of immunonutrition are hampered by the inability to discern which nutrients (if any) provide benefit. The very long chain n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are readily incorporated into tissues leading to decreased production of proinflammatory mediators, by interference with arachidonic acid metabolism. Fish oil is a rich source of DHA and EPA and early clinical studies suggested that this may attenuate inflammation. In particular, EPA has been shown to modulate the proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB), and thereby reduce myocellular inflammation.

The inflammatory cascade is a key mediator in the myogenic response to muscle damage. Inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6) can inhibit muscle regeneration and trigger muscle wasting. The sequelae of acute inflammation are lower muscle strength and subsequent higher dependency for activities of daily living.

A decade ago, two meta-analyses reported on combinations of immunonutrients given preoperatively. These demonstrated reductions in postoperative infection and length of stay but heterogeneity of trial design, and subsequent change in perioperative care (such as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)), makes broader interpretation challenging. There has been no evaluation of the effect of pre-operative n-3 fatty acids, independent of other components of immunonutrition.

The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the effect of preoperative n-3 fatty acids on the inflammatory response and clinical outcomes after major gastrointestinal surgery, in the modern era.

### N-3 long-chain PUFAs reduce respiratory morbidity caused by iron supplementation in iron-deficient South African schoolchildren: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention [^114GZN4f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although iron supplementation in malaria-free areas mostly reduces infectious morbidity, it can sometimes increase morbidity from infections as a result of the dependence of pathogenic microorganisms on iron. Supplementation with n-3 (ω-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) improved morbidity in several human studies. However, information on the combined effect of iron and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on infectious morbidity is limited.

Objective

We determined whether n-3 LCPUFAs and iron supplementation, alone or in combination, affected absenteeism and illness in iron-deficient schoolchildren with low fish intake.

Design

A total of 321 South African children (aged 6–11 y) with iron deficiency (ID) were randomly divided into 4 groups to receive 1) iron plus placebo, 2) a mixture of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (DHA/EPA) plus placebo, 3) iron plus DHA/EPA, or 4) placebo plus placebo as oral supplements 4 times/wk for 8.5 mo. Morbidity was recorded, and iron-status indexes were measured. The total phospholipid fatty acid composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell membranes was analyzed in a subsample (n = 130).

Results

Iron supplementation increased the number of days with illness when all symptoms were considered (B: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.03) as well as illness that was specifically caused by respiratory symptoms (B: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.70), whereas DHA/EPA reduced the number of days with illness at school (B: -0.96; 95% CI: -1.33, -0.59). The increases caused by iron were reduced to the levels seen in the placebo plus placebo group when iron was provided in combination with DHA/EPA as indicated by significant iron × DHA/EPA interactions (both P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Iron supplementation increased morbidity (mostly respiratory) in iron-deficient South African schoolchildren with low DHA/EPA intake, but when iron was given in combination with DHA/EPA, this effect was prevented.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk: a systematic review [^113jQ7ug]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Omega-3 fatty acids are purported to reduce the risk of cancer. Studies have reported mixed results.

Objective

To synthesize published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk in prospective cohort studies.

Data Sources

Articles published from 1966 to October 2005 identified through MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CAB Health; unpublished literature sought through letters to experts in the neutraceutical industry.

Study Selection

A total of 38 articles with a description of effects of consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor incidence, prospective cohort study design, human study population; and description of effect of omega-3 among groups with different levels of exposure in the cohort were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed articles using structured abstraction forms; disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted detailed data about the incidence of cancer, the type of cancer, the number and characteristics of the patients, details on the exposure to omega-3 fatty acids, and the elapsed time between the intervention and outcome measurements. Data about the methodological quality of the study were also abstracted.

Data Synthesis

Across 20 cohorts from 7 countries for 11 different types of cancer and using up to 6 different ways to categorize omega-3 fatty acid consumption, 65 estimates of the association between omega-3 fatty acid consumption were reported. Among these, only 8 were statistically significant. The high degree of heterogeneity across these studies precluded pooling of data. For breast cancer 1 significant estimate was for increased risk (incidence risk ratio [IRR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.98) and 3 were for decreased risk (RR, 0.68–0.72); 7 other estimates did not show a significant association. For colorectal cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27–0.89) and 17 estimates without association. For lung cancer one of the significant associations was for increased cancer risk (IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2–7.3), the other was for decreased risk (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13–0.76), and 4 other estimates were not significant. For prostate cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22–0.83) and 1 of increased risk (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.34–2.93) for advanced prostate cancer; 15 other estimates did not show a significant association. The study that assessed skin cancer found an increased risk (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27). No significant associations between omega-3 fatty acid consumption and cancer incidence were found for aerodigestive cancer, bladder cancer, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or stomach cancer.

Conclusions

A large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between omega-3 fatty acids and cancer incidence. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids is unlikely to prevent cancer.

### Using nutrition to help recovery from infections [^117J1u4u]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Current data suggest that diet and gut microbiota are closed related with pathways of inflammation, lipid digestion and SCFA regulation; however, much remains unclear about the patterns of gut microbiota ageing and how to delay or revert them. The limitations inherent to observational and animal studies restrict our understanding into the causation of microbiome changes during disease or ageing, with more intervention studies required. Improved insights into our understanding of the microbial pathways through which dietary interventions can be used to minimize antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis will open new perspectives to support healthy ageing.

### A novel effect of eicosapentaenoic acid: improved diaphragm strength in endotoxemia [^116BWYyQ]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory muscle weakness is commonplace in critically ill patients, impairing the ability of those patients to breath, prolonging the need for ventilatory support, and increasing the likelihood of respiratory failure when that support is removed. Infections and endotoxemia reduce respiratory muscle strength, probably acting through several mechanisms. It is reported that the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) attenuates the loss in diaphragm specific force generation (that is, diaphragm strength) induced by bacterial endotoxin treatment in rats. EPA is found in fish oils. EPA reduces calpain activation, suggesting a specific effect on this proteolytic pathway. It will be important to identify whether this effect occurs in patients receiving EPA.

### Effects of n-3 long-chain PUFA supplementation to lactating mothers and their breastfed children on child growth and morbidity: a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial in rural Ethiopia [^115z6ovr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent infections and inflammation contribute to growth faltering in low-income countries. n-3 (ω-3) Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty-acids (LC-PUFAs) may improve immune maturation, resistance to infections, and growth in young children who are at risk.

Objective

We evaluated the independent and combined effects of fish oil (500 mg n-3 LC-PUFAs/d) supplementation to lactating mothers and their breastfed children, aged 6–24 mo, on child morbidity, systemic inflammation, and growth in southwest Ethiopia.

Design

A 4-arm double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted by enrolling 360 mother-infant pairs with infants 6–12 mo old. Study arms were both the lactating mother and child receiving fish oil intervention (MCI), only the lactating mother receiving fish oil intervention and child receiving placebo control (MI), only the child receiving intervention and mother receiving placebo control (CI), and both mother and child receiving a placebo supplement or control (C). The primary study outcome was linear growth using monthly changes in length-for-age z score. Anthropometric measurements were taken monthly, and hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and blood LC-PUFAs were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 mo of follow-up. Weekly morbidity surveillance was conducted throughout the study.

Results

Fish-oil supplementation significantly increased blood n-3 LC-PUFA concentration (P < 0.01) and decreased the arachidonic acid:(docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid) ratio (P < 0.001) in all intervention arms. No significant intervention effect was found on linear growth, morbidity, or systemic inflammation. Compared to the control group, a small positive effect on monthly changes in weight-for-length z scores was found in the CI arm (effect size: 0.022/mo; 95% CI: 0.005, 0.039/mo; P = 0.012) and the MCI arm (effect size: 0.018/mo; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.034/mo; P = 0.041).

Conclusions

n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation of lactating mothers and children did not affect child linear growth and morbidity in a low-income setting. n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation given directly to children modestly increased relative weight gain. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01817634.

Other infant clinical outcomes

No anaphylactic reactions were reported. The percentage of infants with any hospital admissions during the first year of life (67/368 (18%) in n-3 LCPUFA group versus 74/338 (22%) in the control group; unadjusted relative risk 0.82, 0.61 to 1.11, P = 0.20; adjusted relative risk 0.82, 0.61 to 1.11, P = 0.20) and the total number of hospital admissions per child (mean 0.25 in the n-3 LCPUFA group versus 0.35 in the control group; unadjusted ratio of means 0.72, 0.50 to 1.03, P = 0.08; adjusted ratio of means 0.73, 0.51 to 1.04, P = 0.08) did not differ between groups. Similarly, we found no differences between the groups for the number of infants visiting a doctor because they were unwell (336/368 (91%) in the n-3 LCPUFA group versus 310/338 (92%) in the control group; unadjusted relative risk 1.00, 0.95 to 1.04, P = 0.89; adjusted relative risk 1.0, 0.95 to 1.04, P = 0.85) or the number of visits to a doctor per child (mean 4.55 in the n-3 LCPUFA group versus 4.28 in the control group; unadjusted ratio of means 1.06, 0.93 to 1.22, P = 0.38; adjusted ratio of means 1.06, 0.93 to 1.22, P = 0.38). The percentage of infants with respiratory tract infections (65/368 (18%) in the n-3 LCPUFA group versus 66/338 (20%) in the control group; unadjusted relative risk 0.90, 0.66 to 1.23, P = 0.50; adjusted relative risk 0.91, 0.67 to 1.23, P = 0.53) did not differ between groups. We also found no difference between the groups for the number of infants exposed to antibiotic treatment during the first 12 months of life (214/368 (58%) in the n-3 LCPUFA group versus 190/338 (56%) in the control group; unadjusted relative risk 1.03, 0.91 to 1.18, P = 0.61; adjusted relative risk 1.04, 0.91 to 1.18, P = 0.55). Ear infections were the most common reason for antibiotic use in infancy (99/368 (27%) in the n-3 LCPUFA group versus 84/338 (25%) in the control group; unadjusted relative risk 1.08, 0.84 to 1.39, P = 0.53; adjusted relative risk 1.10, 0.86 to 1.41, P = 0.44).

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115uNzjw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Secondary organ dysfunction is a key factor that triggered death in septic patients. It has been found that omega-3 fatty acids nutrition may prevent new organ dysfunction in three randomized controlled trials with 278 cases of sepsis (two trials investigated mild or early sepsis, one study with severe sepsis or septic shock). Thus, it seems that the omega-3 fatty acids may play a benefit on sepsis through inhibit new organ dysfunction. SOFA scores, an indicator of secondary organ dysfunction, were reported in three trials. As it was unable to obtain explicit data on SOFA scores that could be combined in the meta-analysis, we did not analyze the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on SOFA scores. It seems that omega-3 fatty acids may have potential benefit on new organ dysfunction; we suggested that a further study focus on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis should investigate secondary organ dysfunction. Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving strategy for critical ill patients. However, its adverse effects such as ventilation-induced lung injury, and ventilator associated pneumonia are life threatening. Our meta-analysis included 5 trials (Fig. 5) suggested that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in septic patient. This result is not consistent with a previous meta-analysis which included two studies. Nevertheless, heterogeneity was found across the trials. Thus, the result should be interpreted with caution.

### Ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition in hospitalized patients: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116fvrvK]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility criteria for included studies are shown according to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study designs (PICOS). 12, 13

Participants

Publications included human studies of adult hospitalized patients (later assigned as being within an intensive care unit [ICU] or non‐ICU setting, as defined by the authors using the criteria that ICU studies should have a mean of at least 48 hours in an ICU) who were eligible to receive PN covering at least 70% of their total energy provision. This excluded nontarget populations (ie, pediatric or neonatal patients), or enteral nutrition studies.

Interventions and comparisons

Interventions and comparators included were ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched PN and standard (non‐ω‐3 fatty‐acid enriched) PN, respectively. This excluded "off‐label" interventions (specifically in which fish oil was used as the sole source of parenteral lipids), and studies in which enteral nutrition accounted for > 30% of the daily caloric provision.

Outcomes

Clinical outcomes were infection rate (primary outcome), mortality rate (co‐primary outcome), length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, sepsis rate, hospital readmissions, ICU‐free days until day 30 or day 60, and ventilation‐free days until day 30 (note: sepsis included events defined by publication authors as septic or systemic inflammatory response syndrome; see Table S1). Other outcomes were transfused blood units and oxygenation index, fatty‐acid composition of plasma phospholipids and lipid profile (α‐tocopherol, EPA, DHA, arachidonic acid, plasma triglycerides), markers of inflammation and antioxidant status (interleukin‐6, leukotriene [LT] B5, LTB4, LTB5:LTB4 ratio, C‐reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]‐α), and routine laboratory parameters (lactate; urea; serum creatinine; creatinine clearance; platelets; prothrombin time; partial thromboplastin time [PTT]; international normalized ratio; bleeding time; liver enzymes aspartate [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and γ‐glutamyl transferase [GGT]; and total bilirubin).

Study design

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English in peer‐review journals containing at least 1 predefined outcome were included.

### The protective effect of breastfeeding on infant inflammation: a mediation analysis of the plasma lipidome and metabolome [^116EfgB8]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids

Many metabolomic fatty acid biomarkers (ratios of SFA, MUFA, and DHA in total fatty acids, PUFA/MUFA ratio, and linoleic acid) showed evidence of mediation in both directions, i.e. these fatty acids mediated the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation, and inflammation mediated the effect of breastfeeding on these fatty acids, although generally to a lesser extent. For example, the proportion mediation of the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation at 6 months by linoleic acid (measured by the NMR metabolomic platform) is 0.43 (Additional file 1: Table S22) compared with 0.19 proportion mediation of the effect of breastfeeding on linoleic acid by inflammation (Additional file 1: Table S26). Total omega 3 fatty acids were positively associated with breastfeeding and inflammation at 6 months, while the ratio of DHA to total fatty acids was positively associated with breastfeeding and negatively associated with inflammation. However, neither omega-3 nor omega-6 fatty acids overall mediated the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7
Summary of the cross-sectional associations at 6 months of total fatty acids, and selected PUFA-carrying lipid classes, with inflammation (GlycA, x-axis) and breastfeeding status (y-axis). Points are coefficients from adjusted Linear regression models. Red squares highlight mediators of the effect of breastfeeding on inflammation. Bars are 95% confidence intervals

It is well established that fatty acids play critical roles in inflammatory regulation and immune function. Fatty acids such as linoleic acid are integral to anti-inflammatory pathways and immune modulation. Conversely, infection and inflammation may regulate fatty acid synthesis, mobilisation, or metabolism. This evidence for bidirectional mediation effects highlights the complex interplay between nutrition, lipid metabolism, and inflammation during early development, providing mechanistic insights into how breastfeeding may support optimal immune and metabolic health in infants.

### Deregulated balance of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids following infection by the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis [^114pTQG7]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and an emergent zoonotic pathogen. Excessive inflammation caused by S. suis is responsible for early high mortality in septic shock-like syndrome cases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may contribute to regulating inflammatory processes. This study shows that mouse infection by S. suis is accompanied by an increase of arachidonic acid, a proinflammatory omega-6 (ω-6) PUFA, and by a decrease of docosahexaenoic acid, an anti-inflammatory ω-3 PUFA. Macrophages infected with S. suis showed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation. Fenretinide, a synthetic vitamin A analog, reduced in vitro expression of inflammatory mediators. Pretreatment of mice with fenretinide significantly improved their survival by reducing systemic proinflammatory cytokines during the acute phase of an S. suis infection. These findings indicate a beneficial effect of fenretinide in diminishing the expression of inflammation and improving survival during an acute infection by a virulent S. suis strain.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acids and autoimmune disease: evidence from the umbrella review and mendelian randomization analysis [^111mcUjf]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune diseases are a group of disorders characterized by abnormal immune responses that mistakenly target and attack healthy cells, tissues, and organs, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. Omega-3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory activities and may decrease abnormal immune activity. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids in various autoimmune diseases is still unclear. This umbrella review and Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to summarize the highest available evidence on omega-3 fatty acids and autoimmune disease.

Methods

We conducted an umbrella review by searching electronic databases to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The selection criteria included systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, which evaluated omega-3 fatty acids as the exposure and autoimmune disease as the outcome variable. Two authors independently assessed the overlapping and quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR-2 tool. We also performed MR studies to investigate the potential causal effect of fatty acids on the risk of various autoimmune diseases, utilizing data from the meta-analysis of the UKB-TOPMed and FinnGen cohorts.

Result

The umbrella review identified 21 studies (8 systematic reviews and 13 meta-analyses) on 9 autoimmune diseases and 30 diseases in the MR study. AMSTAR 2 categorized the quality of evidence in six studies as critically low, six studies as low, eight studies as moderate, and one as high-quality evidence. The consistent result between the review and the MR study demonstrated the benefit of omega-3 fatty acids on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additionally, in our summary review, omega-3 fatty acids can improve disease activity and inflammation biomarkers; however, MR studies provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of omega-3 fatty acids on psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes (T1D), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Conclusion

The current study presented solid evidence highlighting the advantageous impact of omega-3 fatty acids on SLE and RA. This was achieved through the reduction of disease risk, the decrease of disease activity, and the mitigation of inflammatory biomarkers. To stratify another autoimmune illness, it is necessary to carry out rigorous evaluations to surpass the existing findings and enhance understanding in this domain.

### Guidelines for the provision and assessment of nutrition support therapy in the pediatric critically ill patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [^111Zj5AA]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Immunonutrition in critically ill children — evidence and recommendations indicate limited pediatric benefit and current nonrecommendation: Infants requiring parenteral nutrition (PN) were randomized to intravenous lipid emulsions including omega-3 fatty acids or a 100% soybean oil–based lipid, but relevant clinical outcomes were not evaluated; lipids containing omega-3 versus 100% omega-6 fatty acids were associated with lower plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and potential for reduced intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Trials of parenteral glutamine found that clinical outcomes did not differ from standard PN. In a comparative effectiveness trial of mechanically ventilated children receiving enteral nutrition (EN), enrollment ended at 293 with no differences in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, infections, or mortality, although in a small immunocompromised subgroup nosocomial infections were lower with the study intervention compared with whey protein (1.57 vs 6.09; p = 0.011). Across pediatric trials, none demonstrated superiority of immunonutrition versus standard nutrition in terms of clinical outcomes. Adult trials reported no infectious benefits and possibility of harm with a significantly higher 6-month mortality with an immunonutrition-containing formula, and adult guidelines state that immunonutrition not be used in critically ill septic or medical patients but may be considered in perioperative or traumatic injuries; due to potential adult harms and limited pediatric data, immunonutrition cannot be currently recommended in critically ill children, and future trials should examine its role in select populations.

### The effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on inflammatory factors in HIV-infected patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114wFvtH]. Cytokine (2020). Medium credibility.

High concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory markers are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and are associated with non-HIV related comorbidity and mortality. Data on the benefits of omega-3 fatty acid (omega-3 FA) supplementation for improving inflammation status in HIV-infected patients are controversial. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the beneficial effects of omega-3 FAs on controlling inflammation in HIV-infected patients. We conducted a comprehensive search of the major biomedical databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library, for all potentially relevant studies published without restriction from the beginning of time to June 2020. Overall, nine RCTs were included comprising a total of 427 participants. A random-effects model was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the effect was measured as standardized mean difference (SMD). Supplementation of omega-3 FAs showed a significant reduction of CRP (SMD: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.07, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in levels of TNF-α (SMD: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.85, P = 0.94, I² = 87%) and IL-6 (SMD: -0.13, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.32, P = 0.57, I² = 73%, Fig. 3). The results indicate that the supplementation of omega-3 FAs in HIV-infected patients significantly decreases serum CRP levels when compared to the control group, however has no significant effect on IL-6 and TNF-α levels.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112KeRXz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

We are also interested in that whether the difference between parenteral and enteral administration may influence the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on septic patients. In a previous meta-analysis included three trials that reported a protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids on ARDS, the administration strategy was enteral nutrition. Our subgroup meta-analysis suggested that the mortality in septic patients was not influenced by omega-3 fatty acids that administrated through either parenteral or enteral pathway. This result is consistent with a previous meta-analysis that focuses on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on critically ill patients. These results suggested that the administration strategy may not be the key factor that influenced the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis or other critically ill patients.

There are some limitations in our meta-analysis. One potential limitation of the present meta-analysis was the asymmetric funnel plot that suggested publication bias may exist. It is possibly that the present meta-analysis did not include all of the trials, as we restricted the literature language to English, and other database except the PubMed was not adopted. Meanwhile, the small sample size may also have been a limitation, which may have lowered the statistical power. Furthermore, a marked heterogeneity was detected when the length of ICU or hospital stay was analyzed.

In brief, although our meta-analysis suggested that omega-3 fatty acids failed to reduce overall mortality in septic patients, a tendency toward a reduction in mortality should not be neglected (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.05, P = 0.12). Thus, future large scale, multicentre investigation is still required to draw a conclusion.

### Nutrition, immunity and COVID-19 [^115T2R8B]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

The immune system protects the host from pathogenic organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites). To deal with this array of threats, the immune system has evolved to include a myriad of specialised cell types, communicating molecules and functional responses. The immune system is always active, carrying out surveillance, but its activity is enhanced if an individual becomes infected. This heightened activity is accompanied by an increased rate of metabolism, requiring energy sources, substrates for biosynthesis and regulatory molecules, which are all ultimately derived from the diet. A number of vitamins (A, B 6, B 12, folate, C, D and E) and trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, iron) have been demonstrated to have key roles in supporting the human immune system and reducing risk of infections. Other essential nutrients including other vitamins and trace elements, amino acids and fatty acids are also important. Each of the nutrients named above has roles in supporting antibacterial and antiviral defence, but zinc and selenium seem to be particularly important for the latter. It would seem prudent for individuals to consume sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to support their immune system to help them deal with pathogens should they become infected. The gut microbiota plays a role in educating and regulating the immune system. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of disease including many infectious diseases and has been described in COVID-19. Dietary approaches to achieve a healthy microbiota can also benefit the immune system. Severe infection of the respiratory epithelium can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by excessive and damaging host inflammation, termed a cytokine storm. This is seen in cases of severe COVID-19. There is evidence from ARDS in other settings that the cytokine storm can be controlled by n-3 fatty acids, possibly through their metabolism to specialised pro-resolving mediators.

### Do statins increase and mediterranean diet decrease the risk of breast cancer? [^114SEPZw]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of death from cancer and a scientific challenge for the medical community. One critical issue is how to implement an effective preventive strategy. Risk factors such as genetic predisposition cannot be modified whereas other factors (unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle) can be avoided. Other strategies - for instance, decreasing the length of time a woman's breast tissue is exposed to estrogens - may help prevent BC but have proved difficult to implement.

Increasing protective factors is critical, in particular among high-risk women. The effects of dietary factors have been examined. For instance, dietary fats have been extensively studied in the prevention of BC but only marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) may be protective. In a meta-analysis of 21 independent prospective cohort studies, a significant reduction of BC risk with marine n-3 was found. By contrast, omega-6 fatty acids (n-6) may increase BC risk. Although not all studies show a link between n-6 and increased BC risk, the most recent and well-conducted studies actually indicate a positive association between n-6 and BC risk. The pro-cancer effect of n-6 has also been suggested in randomized controlled trials in which n-6 intakes were modified. These trials were not specifically referring to BC but to cancers in general, in particular because the numbers of cancers were too small to analyze specific cancers. However, in the same way as smoking increases the risk of lung, bladder and BC, the data suggest that n-6 may increase the risk of several cancers. If n-6 increase cancer risk in general, it is reasonable to think that they may also increase BC risk as epidemiological studies did suggest.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1133JDTB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

The potential mechanism that could possibly explain why omega-3 fatty acids may not be beneficial in septic patients was as follows: Firstly, sepsis is a severe disease with a high mortality. A number of factors such as a history of severe diseases, or divergence of pathogen may influence the clinic outcome. Septic patients often complicated with organ dysfunction or shock which may further elevate mortality. The included trials in our meta-analysis suggested that a number of patients diagnosed as sepsis were complicated organ dysfunction or shock. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, an inflammation disease with mortality over 40%, is a common secondary organ dysfunction in septic patients. A previous meta-analysis focused on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reported that it has no effect on reduction of 28-day mortality. The failure on the improvement of complications by omega-3 fatty acids seems to have limited impact on septic patients' survival. Secondly, the rational of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition as an adjunctive therapy for sepsis is partly based on its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating features. However, the mild anti-inflammatory effect of omega-3 fatty acids might not lead to improve in outcome. It has been reported that even a delay of antibiotics treatment may cause a significant increased mortality in patients with sepsis.

A previous meta-analysis suggested that a high fat formula used in control group which may contribute to an increased mortality could be the reason that a reduced mortality was observed in study group. It is suggested that the high fat formula may have pro-inflammatory features, and resulting in a worsened clinical outcome. It seems that clinical outcomes could be influenced by the dose and composition of nutrition. As the dose and composition of omega-3 fatty acids nutrition agent were divergent in studies, we are interested in that whether the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sepsis may be affected by the difference of dose and composition. Therefore, we examined trials testing different type of omega-3 fatty acids agent separately. Our subgroup meta-analysis indicated that the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on mortality in septic patients was not influenced by its dose and composition.

### Rationale and design of the pragmatic randomized trial of icosapent ethyl for high cardiovascular risk adults (MITIgATE) [^111S1eo3]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The MITIGATE study aims to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness of pre-treatment with icosapent ethyl (IPE), compared with usual care, on laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory infection (URI)-related morbidity and mortality in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Background

IPE is a highly purified and stable omega-3 fatty acid prescription medication that is approved for cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk adults on statin therapy with elevated triglycerides. Preclinical data and clinical observations suggest that IPE may have pleiotropic effects including antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that may prevent or reduce the downstream sequelae and cardiopulmonary consequences of viral URIs.

Methods

MITIGATE is a virtual, electronic health record-based, open-label, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial enrolling ∼16,500 participants within Kaiser Permanente Northern California - a fully integrated and learning health care delivery system with 21 hospitals and > 255 ambulatory clinics serving ∼4.5 million members. Adults ≥ 50 years with established ASCVD and no prior history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be prospectively identified and pre-randomized in a 1:10 allocation ratio (∼ 1,500 IPE: ∼15,000 usual care) stratified by age and previous respiratory health status to the intervention (IPE 2 grams by mouth twice daily with meals) vs the control group (usual care) for a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. The co-primary endpoints are moderate-to-severe laboratory-confirmed viral URI and worst clinical status due to a viral URI at any point in time.

Conclusion

The MITIGATE study will inform clinical practice by providing evidence on the real-world clinical effectiveness of pretreatment with IPE to prevent and/or reduce the sequelae of laboratory-confirmed viral URIs in a high-risk cohort of patients with established ASCVD.

### Lipid mediators in immune dysfunction after severe inflammation [^1111oKCo]. Trends in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Inflammation unites CI

Systemic inflammation is nearly ubiquitous in CI, uniting the leading causes of intensive care (ICU) admission. Induced by infectious and noninfectious stimuli with approximately equal frequency, the host inflammatory reaction is driven by common mediators and shared signaling pathways. Critically ill patients are now understood to experience a highly coordinated, reproducible response at the transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic level, regardless of the inflammatory source.

Adverse clinical outcomes are associated with a quantitative dysregulation of the inflammatory profile in both magnitude and duration. Predominance and prolongation of anti-inflammatory processes mechanistically contribute to multiple defects in the innate and adaptive immune system, and consequent vulnerability to nosocomial [hospital-acquired infection (HAI)], and CI-induced immune dysfunction (CIIID). In total, ∼30% of CI patients will contract HAI; a rate six times greater than on standard wards. HAI in this setting is associated with a twofold greater inpatient mortality risk and a case mortality in excess of 50%. Causative pathogens are most commonly bacterial; however, fungal infections (particularly Candida spp.) are increasing in incidence. Viral infection, especially reactivation, poses an additional risk, and polymicrobial infection is common.

LMs, including eicosanoids and the more recently discovered 'specialized pro-resolution lipid mediators' (SPMs), are key signaling molecules in the resolution of inflammation, playing a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory profile and promoting return to homeostasis. Their dysregulation in any of several dimensions may have pathogenic consequences (Box 1), with failure of resolution leading to chronic inflammation and excess tissue damage being best recognized. The potential active contribution of LMs to an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive phenotype has, until recently, received little attention.

Box 1
LMs: background and pathogenic potential

AA (20:6, ω-6), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, ω-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, ω-3) are polyunsaturated fatty acids that form the substrates for the enzymatic generation of several groups of bioactive LMs. Eicosanoids – the generic term for a group of bioactive lipids containing 20 carbons derived from AA – are divided into several separate mediator families, the major groups being the PGs, LTs and LXs. More recently discovered ω-3-derived SPM families include Rvs, protectins, and maresins. LMs represent vital endogenous biochemical determinants of inflammatory kinetics and the principle mediators of resolution.

### N-3 fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid, and antioxidants in sepsis [^115ph4KR]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The usefulness of n-3 fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid and antioxidants in the critically ill is controversial. I propose that adverse outcome in the critically ill is due to excess production of proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), while generation of anti-inflammatory products of PUFAs may lead to a favorable outcome. Hence, I suggest that measurement of plasma levels of various cytokines, free radicals, and proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory products of PUFAs and correlating them to the clinical picture may pave the way to identify prognostic markers and develop newer therapeutic strategies to prevent and manage critical illness.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^116axqAR]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Let us consider the four placebo-controlled trials testing rosuvastatin. They were conducted in patients with post-infarct left ventricular dysfunction, chronic kidney failure and in primary prevention. Regarding the first two RCTs, CORONA and GISSI-HF already discussed above with the RCTs testing n-3, some experts argue that the failure of rosuvastatin to reduce the risk in these specific patients was not surprising because almost no CVD complications or deaths were expected to fall into the category that statins could prevent, for example, myocardial ischemia or infarction and stroke. Actually, as shown in Table 2 in the CORONA article, this view is totally wrong, as 588 and 554 ischemic coronary events were recorded in the two groups in CORONA. In addition, 283 and 272 cardiac deaths occurred in ischemic coronary events against only 191 and 193 deaths due to worsening heart failure, a type of death not expected to be prevented by the statin. In other words and in accordance with the cholesterol-statin theory, the risk of most of these ischemic events should have been reduced by the statin treatment. Thus, unexpectedly the statin failed in CORONA despite striking reduction of cholesterol levels as well as the inflammatory marker CRP!

In fact, the large numbers of ischemic complications in CORONA were not unexpected - neither the sponsors nor the investigators were naive enough to launch a very expensive trial without the hope that rosuvastatin will be effective - because 100% of the recruited patients were survivors of a previous myocardial infarction and thus expected to be at high risk of recurrence, the best situation in theory to prescribe a statin and demonstrate its effectiveness. The fact that they also had various degrees of post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction and some symptoms of chronic heart failure does not change the problem, as perfectly understood by the sponsor when launching the trial. As a matter of fact, when looking at the effects of rosuvastatin in function of the severity of the symptoms of chronic heart failure, there was again no difference between the groups: those with mild heart failure (NYHA class II) symptoms also had no reduction of the primary endpoint: 219 vs. 217 events in the placebo group.

### Association between enteral essential fatty acids and plasma phospholipid essential fatty acids related immune response in critically ill adults with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study [^116JFSNu]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The mortality rate for people having COVID‐19 disease is high (25%–50%) for those admitted to the adult intensive care unit (ICU). COVID‐19 creates dysregulated immune responses in the respiratory tract and severe inflammation and damage to endothelial cells in the heart, kidneys, liver and intestine. Patients with severe COVID‐19 disease exhibit decreased clearance of infected cells, increased inflammation markers related to tissue damageand elevated mucous production. Pulmonary aspergillosis co‐infection with severe COVID‐19 is frequently associated with increased mortality. Immune response to infection involves utilization of essential fatty acids, but the impact of intake of essential fatty acids for those suffering respiratory failure during COVID‐19 disease is not clear.

Host immunity to infection and subsequent inflammation is driven by utilization of essential fatty acids for eicosanoid signals from arachidonic acid (20:4n‐6, AA). Essential fatty acid deficiency reduces immunological responses of innate and acquired immunity. Infiltration of neutrophil and NK cells is the first response to infection. Severe disease is due to failure of nonspecific first‐line defense attributed to failure of expression of 5‐lipoxygenase pathways or phospholipase A 2 essential to oxylipin synthesis from phospholipid 20:4n‐6 and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n‐3, EPA) derived from phospholipids within seconds of immune stimuli. After phospholipase A 2 release of arachidonic acid, production of leukotriene (LT) A 4 by 5 lipoxygenaseoccurs in addition to activating a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in immune signals. Phospholipase A 2, phosphatidylserine specific phospholipase, and levels of prostaglandin E 2 and F 2α are also elevated after infection.N‐3 fatty acids, specifically 20:5n‐3 and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n‐3, DHA), attenuate immune responses and inflammation by enhancing synthesis of mediators arising from series 3 and 5 prostaglandins and leukotrienes, protectins, and resolvins or by indirectly altering intracellular signaling cascades and altering transcription of genes that downregulate inflammation. Thus, the n‐6 to n‐3 fatty acid balance in the metabolic cascade that follows release of 20:4n‐6, 20:5n‐3 or 22:6n‐3 from the sn ‐2 position of phospholipid provides a potential mechanism for fatty acid intervention in the postinfection immune response. Leukotriene B 4 strongly induces monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)‐1 production. Interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐2, IL‐17, granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), interferon (IFN)‐γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)‐1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)‐1α, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α also orchestrate symptom progression.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^115cU7yV]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Adults living with HIV — dyslipidemia management emphasizes lifestyle counseling and coordination with infectious disease specialists, and statin selection that accounts for antiretroviral therapy interactions. In persons under 40 years of age, primary prevention decisions should be individualized. Pitavastatin is preferred over other statins in persons with HIV infection who are found to be at low/moderate ASCVD risk on traditional risk calculators, and pitavastatin effectively decreases ASCVD events and avoids the risk of adverse interactions with ART since it is metabolized via glucuronidation. Rosuvastatin (≤ 10 mg/day) is a good alternative and atorvastatin (≤ 10–20 mg/day) may be used with certain antiretroviral drugs, while pravastatin should not be prescribed in individuals on darunavir. Simvastatin and lovastatin are contraindicated with protease inhibitors or cobicistat, and rosuvastatin at 20 mg per day is a high-intensity statin option with decreased risk of interactions with ART medications. Ezetimibe, BA, or PCSK9 inhibitors may be considered if LDL-C targets have not been achieved on statins alone or if statin therapy is not tolerated, and in individuals with HIV and HTG, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acids or a fibrate (not gemfibrozil) may be prescribed.

### Omega-3 decreases IL-6 levels in HIV and human herpesvirus-8 coinfected patients in Uganda [^111eo9DP]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Kaposi sarcoma is a HIV-associated malignancy caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) that occurs at highest incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Kaposi sarcoma patients often present with inflammatory symptoms associated with higher mortality.

Design

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Uganda to test whether omega-3 supplementation could reduce inflammation in HIV and HHV-8 coinfected adults. Patients with acute illness, AIDS, or advanced Kaposi sarcoma were ineligible, as were pregnant women. Participant IDs were pre-randomized, blocked by Kaposi sarcoma status, to either the omega-3 or placebo arm.

Methods

Omega-3 participants received a 3-g pill dose daily for 12 weeks (1.8-g eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.2-mg docosapentaenoic acid); placebo participants received 44.8mg of high oleic safflower oil that appeared indistinguishable from the active supplement. Intervention effects were evaluated as the baseline-adjusted mean difference after 12 weeks between omega-3 and placebo participants in concentrations of fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, and immune cells.

Results

The final study population included 56 Kaposi sarcoma patients and 11 Kaposi sarcoma-negative, HIV and HHV-8-positive participants randomized to receive either omega-3 (N = 33) or placebo (N = 34). Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 concentrations decreased in omega-3 participants (-0.78pg/ml) but increased in placebo participants (+3.2pg/ml; P = 0.04). We observed a trend toward decreased IL-6 after omega-3 supplementation specific to Kaposi sarcoma patients (P = 0.08). CD8 T-cell counts tended to increase in the omega-3 arm Kaposi sarcoma patients (+60 cells/μl), in contrast to decreases (-47 cells/μl) among placebo (P = 0.11).

Conclusion

Omega-3 supplementation decreased IL-6 concentrations among HIV and HHV-8 coinfected Ugandans, which may have clinical benefit for Kaposi sarcoma patients.

### Eicosapentaenoic acid preserves diaphragm force generation following endotoxin administration [^111nhYyD]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

These data indicate that endotoxin-induced reductions in diaphragm specific force generation can be partially prevented by administration of EPA, a nontoxic immunomodulator that can be safely given to patients. We speculate that it may be possible to reduce infection-induced skeletal muscle weakness in critically ill patients by administration of EPA.

### Clinical risk factors of adverse outcomes among women with COVID-19 in the pregnancy and postpartum period: a sequential, prospective meta-analysis [^115jRDbR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the onset of the novel COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified pregnant women as a group at higher risk of severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with nonpregnant people. Despite known risk, pregnant women have been widely excluded from pharmaceutical clinical trials, resulting in an underdocumentation of the physiology, case count, complications, and consequences of COVID-19 in pregnancy.

Initial evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is linked to increased likelihood of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. A systematic review of 42 studies (N = 438,548) found that pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly higher odds of preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission compared with those not infected. Although vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mother to fetus reportedly occurs in a low percentage of cases, neonates can be negatively affected by maternal infection in other ways. In 2 systematic reviews of 42 and 66 studies, neonates of mothers with confirmed COVID-19 had 3 times higher odds of neonatal ICU (NICU) admission than those born to uninfected mothers.

Among pregnant women, multiple risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified. The Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network in the United States (N = 7950) determined that pregnant women aged > 25 years with prepregnancy obesity, chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, and pregestational diabetes mellitus had a 32% to 85% increased risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 compared with pregnant women without these conditions. Pregnant women with ≥ 3 underlying health conditions had over twice the risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 illness compared with those with no comorbidities.

In the general population, nutritional status has been introduced as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of 7 studies (N = 9912) found that among people with COVID-19, those with anemia had 2.44 higher odds of severe illness compared with nonanemic people. A scientific review found that sufficient intake of micronutrients, proteins, dietary fiber, short-chain fatty acids, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may act as a protective factor against severe illness in COVID-19 patients. Further research is required for pregnant women, for whom nutritional guidance would be particularly useful.

### Plant-based diets, pescatarian diets and COVID-19 severity: a population-based case-control study in six countries [^116xKgP9]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2021). High credibility.

Along with plant-based diets, individuals who reported following pescatarian diets had lower odds of severe COVID-19. Pescatarian diets lie within the spectrum of plant-based diets and include fish or seafood while restricting the intake of meats. Fish intake is an important source of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, that is, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). High EPA and DHA intake, which results in high omega-3 fatty acids compared with omega-6 fatty acids and formation of omega-3 oxylipins, have anti-inflammatory effects, suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β, tumour necrosis factor α), reducing inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis and oxidative stress. A meta-analysis of 10 randomised controlled trials in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) found that individuals who received formulas high in omega-3 fatty acid had shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and shorter length of stay at intensive care units, suggesting favourable effects of omega-3 fatty acids on ARDS. In our study, the magnitude of the association for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 illness was lower when we included pescatarian diets in addition to those who reported following plant-based diets. Our results suggest that although there is evidence that fish intake may have favourable impacts on respiratory illness, future studies are needed to confirm whether pescatarian diets are associated with patient outcomes in the context of COVID-19.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid nutrition on mortality in septic patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JXcNE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Characteristics and the quality of studies

The included eleven trials were published from 2003 to 2015 and enrolled an aggregate of 808 patients, including 405 patients in the study group and 403 in the control group. We did not have access to primary data and therefore were reliant on the case definitions of sepsis used by the authors of the individual studies. The sizes of studies ranged from 25 to 198. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the 11 randomized controlled trials which were conducted in Europe, Brazil, or Asia. Most of the randomized controlled trials were single center, except two trials were multicentre studies. Additional file 1: Table S1 shows detailed information about the quality assessment of the included studies, including the Jadad score and the results of allocation concealment.

Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on mortality

Mortality was reported in ten studies, we combined these trials in the mortality analyses. A fixed effect model was used, as no heterogeneity was observed across the trials (I² = 0%; Fig. 2). Our meta-analysis showed that omega-3 fatty acids did not reduce mortality (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.05, P = 0.12; Fig. 2). However, a publication bias may exist in the meta-analysis that was focused on the mortality by the funnel plot analysis (Fig. 3).

Evidence for lipid strategy in early PN for adult critical illness — Infectious complications with soybean oil lipid versus no lipids across two trials show Total (95% CI) 100.0% 2.05 [1.13, 3.73] with Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; Chi² = 0.11, df = 1 (P = 0.69); I² = 0% and Test for overall effect: Z = 2.36 (P = 0.02). Trauma patients provided IVFE-free PN over the first 10 days of hospitalization had a significant reduction in infectious morbidity (pneumonia, P = 0.05; catheter-related sepsis, P = 0.04), decreased hospital and ICU LOS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02), and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.01), though the IVFE-free PN was hypocaloric (21 kcal/kg/d vs 28 kcal/kg/d). A similar study comparing a hypocaloric IVFE-free regimen (1000 total kcal/d and 70 g of protein/d) versus an SO-based IVFE standard admixture (25 kcal/kg/d and 1.5 g of protein/d) found no significant differences in infectious complications, hospital LOS, or mortality, and in patients who received PN for > 5 days in multi-international ICUs no statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes between IVFE-free PN and PN with SO-based IVFE was found. A systematic review of 12 RCTs involving 806 patients evaluating SO IVFE alone or combined with MCTs, OO, and FO found no significant difference in outcome benefits, whereas a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs involving 391 patients comparing omega-3 fish oil–based PN with SO-based or SO+MCT-based IVFE showed a significant reduction in hospital LOS by nearly 10 days (WMD = −9.49; 95% CI, −16.5 to −2.5; p = 0.008) without differences between groups for ICU LOS, infectious complications, and mortality; observational data reported a significantly shorter ICU LOS (HR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.01–3.34; p = 0.05).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Published studies have detected omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA, in human milk. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids for supplementation have resulted in higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in human milk. There are no data available on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LOVAZA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from LOVAZA or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

A limited number of subjects older than 65 years were enrolled in the clinical trials of LOVAZA. Safety and efficacy findings in subjects older than 60 years did not appear to differ from those of subjects younger than 60 years.

### Specialized pro-resolving mediators from omega-3 fatty acids improve amyloid-β phagocytosis and regulate inflammation in patients with minor cognitive impairment [^117HdtWC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

In this review we discuss the immunopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and recent advances in the prevention of minor cognitive impairment (MCI) by nutritional supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids. Defective phagocytosis of amyloid-β (Aβ) and abnormal inflammatory activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are the two key immune pathologies of MCI and AD patients. The phagocytosis of Aβ by PBMCs of MCI and AD patients is universally defective and the inflammatory gene transcription is heterogeneously deregulated in comparison to normal subjects. Recent studies have discovered a cornucopia of beneficial anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) resolvins, protectins, maresins, and their metabolic precursors. Resolvin D1 and other mediators switch macrophages from an inflammatory to a tissue protective/pro-resolving phenotype and increase phagocytosis of Aβ. In a recent study of AD and MCI patients, nutritional supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids individually increased resolvin D1, improved Aβ phagocytosis, and regulated inflammatory genes toward a physiological state, but only in MCI patients. Our studies are beginning to dissect positive factors (adherence to Mediterranean diet with omega-3 and exercise) and negative factors (high fat diet, infections, cancer, and surgeries) in each patient. The in vitro and in vivo effects of omega-3 fatty acids and SPMs suggest that defective phagocytosis and chronic inflammation are related to defective production and/or defective signaling by SPMs in immune cells.

### Altered plasma fatty acids associate with gut microbial composition in common variable immunodeficiency [^113sk8XE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) has a prevalence of 1:25 000 to 1:50 0000 in Caucasians and is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults. Approximately 10% of CVID patients have a monogenic cause, whereas the remaining patients have a more complex pattern of inheritance involving multiple genetic and environmental factors. CVID comprises a heterogeneous group of patients characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, particularly reduced immunoglobulin G (IgG), which results in recurrent infections with capsulated bacteria in the respiratory tract. In addition, a large proportion of the patients (70–80%) have non-infectious autoimmune and/or inflammatory complications, such as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, enteropathy, granulomas and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. The etiology of these inflammatory and autoimmune complications is largely unknown, but we have previously shown an association with altered gut microbial composition and blood lipids.

Fatty acids (FAs), both free and as part of complex lipids, play a number of key roles in metabolism and cellular functions. They constitute a major component of cell membranes, act as precursors of extracellular signaling molecules, and influence membrane-derived intracellular signaling pathways. These factors are important for human health and disease risk, and numerous studies support a role for FAs in various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. In general, the n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) seem to have anti-inflammatory properties, whereas the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA) appears to mediate inflammatory reactions, at least partly by acting as precursors for various bioactive lipid mediators with opposing biological effects (Fig. 1). Circulating FAs are also used as biomarkers of dietary FA intake in epidemiological studies, often in relation to inflammatory or cardiometabolic outcomes. However, accumulating evidence supports gut microbiota as a modifier of the dietary impact on the host metabolic state, including FA metabolism, linking gut microbiota to metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

### A consensus approach to the primary prevention of food allergy through nutrition: guidance from the American academy of allergy, asthma, and immunology; American college of allergy, asthma, and immunology; and the Canadian Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^117Mkwzr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). High credibility.

Primary prevention of food allergy — maternal diet and breast-feeding: Recommendation 7 states, "We do not recommend maternal exclusion of common allergens during pregnancy and lactation as a means to prevent food allergy", and adds, "We offer no recommendation to support any particular food or supplement in the maternal diet for the prevention of food allergy in the infant in either the prenatal period or while breast-feeding". It further notes, "While exclusive breast-feeding is universally recommended for all mothers, there is no specific association between exclusive breast-feeding and the primary prevention of any specific food allergy". The graded statement is, "Recommendation: weak; Strength of Recommendation: B/C; Evidence Category: Ia-IV Risk of Bias: high". Workgroup consensus is documented: "All 9 members agreed on this recommendation". The accompanying comment states "there is no conclusive nor consistent evidence that the specific exclusion of particular foods or inclusion/dietary enrichment of certain foods in the diets of pregnant mothers is associated with the development or prevention of food allergy in either at-risk or not at-risk children", and also that "there is no evidence that formula-fed infants or nonexclusively breast-fed infants are at a greater or lesser risk of developing food allergy compared with exclusively breast-fed infants". It adds that "Protective associations with omega-3 fatty acids (in the form of fish oil) and probiotic supplementation have not been associated with preventing food allergy, but have been associated with reduced the risk of egg and CM sensitization, respectively".

### Omega-3 fatty acids: investigations from cytokine regulation to pancreatic cancer gene suppression… [^113Esx2A]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Omega-3 fatty acids have been clinically and experimentally associated with the amelioration of chronic and acute inflammation; however, the mechanisms for these observations have not been well defined. During the past decade, laboratories of nutrition and inflammation have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activities of ω-3 fatty acids occur at least in part through the inhibition of macrophage-elaborated tumor necrosis factor production and through inactivation of the nuclear factor–κB signaling pathway subsequently altering proinflammatory cytokine transcription. In healthy humans and animal models of experimental infection, EPA has consistently reduced prostaglandin synthesis in response to inflammatory stimuli; however, a concomitant reduction in proinflammatory cytokine production, especially tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1, has been variably reported.

6–10 Variability in type and content of experimental EPA preparations may account for some of the inconsistent results observed. We demonstrated that 4-hour ω-3 pretreatment significantly reduced TNF production in LPS-stimulated cells, with a 46% reduction in TNF from baseline observed. These data support the contention that anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 FAs occur at least in part through the inhibition of MØ TNF production in response to endotoxin. In various animal models, supplemental EPA decreased the number and size of tumors. 1, 17 Fish oil–fed mice demonstrate reduced tumor growth, metastatic load, blood vascular area, mast cell number, and MØ infiltration in solid mammary tumors. 18 In addition, ω-3 FAs have been shown to slow primary tumor growth and decrease metastasis in animal and human models of mammary tumorogenesis. 18–23.

As a result, the NF-κB signal transduction cascade is inhibited, and this decreased NF-κB activity is translated into a concomitant decrease in TNF messenger RNA and protein expression by 47% and 46%, respectively. Moreover, the ω-6 FA–treated MØs exhibit effects similar to MØs exposed to media alone in all experiments, validating observations that the anti-inflammatory effects on MØs are exclusive to ω-3 FAs and not a result of a general lipid effect. In this model, ω-3 FA treatment shows a strong positive correlation with PARP cleavage. Although there does not seem to be a synergistic effect supported by the PARP cleavage product data, there is a mild proapoptotic effect noted with gemcitabine-only treatment.

### Marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids: fishing for clues for cancer prevention… [^114Z3otZ]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

1The most biologically potent omega-3 FA are EPA and DHA, which may be incorporated directly into cell membranes and are found in cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel. EPA and DHA are then metabolized to resolvins and protectins, which limit or reduce inflammation. Omega-3 FA intake from fish or supplements has been studied as a means to reduce risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia; reduce obesity-related insulin resistance and fatty liver disease; and attenuate the activity of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease — all conditions with an inflammatory component.

Biologic effects of omega-3 FA include decreased production of prostaglandin E2 metabolites, thromboxane A2, leukotriene B4, and decreased release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin B1 and platelet-derived growth factor. 3They increase adiponectin secretion and PTEN expression and reduce proliferation and signaling through the ERK as well as PI3 kinase pathways. 14–16Insulin resistance in obese animal models is reduced through attenuation of nuclear factor kappa beta signaling and upregulation of insulin sensitivity–related genes GLUT 4 and IRS-1. 17Given the myriad of biologic pathway modulation observed in predominately preclinical studies, one would expect to see prevention of tumors where inflammation plays a role in promotion or progression.

Early Clinical Studies with Biomarkers as the Primary Endpoint A randomized trial of omega-3 FA in individuals with hyperlipidemia showed reduction in the inflammatory marker high sensitivity c reactive protein, which has also been associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. 28However, studies in healthy individuals have not suggested modulation of traditional hormone or inflammatory markers including hsCRP. Conclusion The marine-derived omega-3 FA EPA and DHA are attractive as potential chemoprevention agents for several common cancers in which inflammation is thought to play a role in development. They are safe over a wide range of doses, inexpensive, available without prescription, and used to treat or prevent a variety of conditions. Challenges remain in defining optimal ratios of EPA to DHA, effective doses, and intermediate biomarkers to use for an indicator of response.
