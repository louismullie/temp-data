## Question

How to treat mast cell activation syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat mast cell activation syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the subtype. Then, I should verify acute management priorities, especially anaphylaxis. Next, I will consider foundational anti-mediator therapy and how to escalate it. After that, I need to check advanced options for refractory disease and clonal forms. I will then examine special populations and comorbidities, followed by trigger identification and avoidance. Finally, I should review monitoring, prognosis, and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with consensus criteria and high-quality guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and classification, because treatment hinges on getting this right. MCAS is defined by episodic symptoms in at least two organ systems, objective evidence of mast cell mediator release during attacks, and a clinical response to mast cell–directed therapy; I should double-check that all three criteria are met before labeling someone as MCAS and before committing to long-term mast cell–targeted treatment [^bb33b47c] [^db14536b]. I need to classify the subtype as primary/clonal (MMAS), secondary to an underlying process, or idiopathic, because clonal disease may require cytoreduction and has different prognostic implications, whereas idiopathic MCAS is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes of mast cell activation [^82f78f81] [^0bbec724].

> Wait, let me verify the biomarker strategy, since missteps here derail management. Serum tryptase should be measured at baseline and again within 30–120 minutes of an acute episode; a significant increase over baseline supports systemic mast cell activation, using the formula acute tryptase > 1.2×baseline + 2 ng/mL, and I should remember that a normal baseline does not exclude MCAS if the acute rise is substantial [^ac1868e9] [^0fa549a2]. If tryptase is normal or equivocal, I should consider urinary metabolites such as N-methylhistamine, prostaglandin D2 metabolite (11β-PGF2α), and leukotriene E4, ideally obtained during symptoms, because these can reveal non-tryptase pathways and guide therapy selection; I need to ensure I am not relying on unvalidated markers like plasma histamine or chromogranin A, which are not recommended for MCAS diagnosis [^b36f6d96] [^0fd7bf57].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic symptoms without excluding mimics. I should actively consider differential diagnoses that can masquerade as MCAS, including IgE-mediated allergy, hereditary alpha-tryptasemia, systemic mastocytosis, carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma, endocrine causes of flushing, and functional gastrointestinal disorders; this prevents mislabeling and ensures the right treatment is chosen [^7f065f78] [^6e9d3c4d]. I should confirm that the patient truly has recurrent, multisystem episodes rather than persistent single-organ complaints, because chronic urticaria, IBS, or fibromyalgia-like syndromes alone do not meet MCAS criteria and require different management pathways [^bb33b47c] [^1e5aafeb].

> Next, I should review acute management, because anaphylaxis can be the presenting manifestation and mandates immediate action. Every patient with suspected or confirmed MCAS should carry two epinephrine autoinjectors, be educated on prompt intramuscular use, and be instructed to lie supine with legs elevated during hypotensive episodes; I need to ensure they also have a written emergency action plan and consider medical alert identification [^c34de00a] [^b904ead5]. For bronchospasm, inhaled albuterol is appropriate adjunct therapy, and I should remind myself that delayed epinephrine worsens outcomes, so early administration is critical even if the trigger is unknown [^c34de00a].

> I will now examine foundational chronic therapy, starting with H1 antihistamines, because they are first-line for most patients. Nonsedating second-generation H1 blockers such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, or loratadine are preferred and often require dosing at 2–4 times standard doses to achieve symptom control; I should titrate to effect while monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects, especially in older adults [^05a63367] [^3bbac701]. Let me consider H2 antihistamines next for gastrointestinal symptoms and to augment H1 blockade; famotidine or nizatidine can reduce acid-related symptoms and may blunt histamine-mediated vascular effects when combined with H1 therapy, though I should confirm that we are not masking another GI diagnosis [^05a63367] [^3bbac701].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite optimized H1/H2 therapy? I should add a mast cell stabilizer such as cromolyn sodium, particularly for GI cramping, bloating, and diarrhea; I need to counsel that onset is slow and that divided dosing up to 200 mg four times daily may be needed, with at least a month-long trial before declaring failure [^851e9d8a] [^d0416b82]. For refractory cases, I should verify whether prostaglandin D2 or leukotriene pathways are implicated; if urinary PGD2 metabolites are elevated, cautious aspirin desensitization can reduce flushing and hypotension, whereas elevated leukotriene E4 supports adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist such as montelukast or a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor like zileuton, ideally in combination with H1 therapy [^851e9d8a] [^6ce341bb].

> I need to ensure I escalate thoughtfully for refractory disease. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, can reduce anaphylaxis frequency and improve skin and GI symptoms in selected patients, particularly those with clonal disease or IgE-mediated triggers; I should confirm that conventional therapy has failed and discuss expectations, as neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal symptoms may not respond as well [^3e8b1c43] [^749a5b94]. For clonal MCAS or advanced systemic mastocytosis with life-threatening mediator symptoms, cytoreductive therapy such as interferon-alpha or cladribine may be indicated, and KIT-directed therapy with midostaurin is FDA-approved for advanced SM and can reduce mast cell burden; I should coordinate with hematology and weigh infection risks and cytopenias carefully [^3e8b1c43] [^bc31bba4].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities, because they shift the treatment calculus. In hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with suspected MCAS, I should align with GI society guidance to use H1/H2 antagonists and mast cell stabilizers while avoiding overpromising disease-modifying effects, and I should screen for POTS and autonomic dysfunction that may coexist and require parallel management [^7a4190db] [^0a58d553]. In patients with frequent idiopathic anaphylaxis or hymenoptera venom allergy, I should confirm clonality and consider venom immunotherapy with omalizumab adjuncts to reduce anaphylaxis risk during buildup, and I should remember that hereditary alpha-tryptasemia can elevate baseline tryptase and confound interpretation, prompting genetic testing when appropriate [^b904ead5] [^905204b9].

> I should double-check trigger identification and avoidance, because reducing exposures can meaningfully decrease episode frequency. Common triggers include temperature extremes, friction or pressure, alcohol, certain medications such as NSAIDs or radiocontrast, emotional stress, and specific foods; individualized elimination trials and a structured symptom diary can help pinpoint culprits, and I need to caution that aspirin desensitization is not the same as liberal NSAID use, which can precipitate attacks in some patients [^b904ead5] [^7a4190db]. For perioperative or procedural settings, I should implement premedication with H1, H2, and corticosteroids and ensure epinephrine is immediately available, given the higher anaphylaxis risk in clonal mast cell disease [^c2bf72da] [^51aafb5a].

> Next, I should review monitoring and prognosis, and I need to be honest about evidence gaps. There are no robust longitudinal MCAS-specific prognostic studies, but many patients with idiopathic MCAS stabilize with therapy, while a subset with clonal disease may evolve to indolent systemic mastocytosis; I should monitor symptoms with validated tools where available and reassess the diagnosis periodically if the clinical course deviates from expectations [^2b613b5c] [^9f0c54f3]. I should confirm that patients have emergency plans, up-to-date epinephrine prescriptions, and clear return precautions, and I should coordinate care with allergy, hematology, gastroenterology, or cardiology as indicated by organ involvement [^9f0c54f3].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm, and I will sanity-check each step against consensus criteria. First, confirm MCAS with multisystem episodic symptoms, objective mediator elevation during attacks, and response to mast cell–directed therapy; if criteria are not met, revisit the differential and avoid premature labeling. Second, classify the subtype and evaluate for clonality with KIT D816V testing and, when indicated, bone marrow studies. Third, initiate H1 antihistamine at standard dose and titrate to 2–4× if needed, add H2 therapy for GI symptoms, and layer cromolyn for GI or neuropsychiatric complaints. Fourth, if refractory, target specific pathways with aspirin for PGD2-driven flushing or leukotriene antagonists for LTE4-driven symptoms, and consider omalizumab for recurrent anaphylaxis or IgE-mediated triggers. Fifth, for clonal or advanced disease with severe mediator symptoms, escalate to cytoreduction or midostaurin in collaboration with specialists. Throughout, identify and avoid triggers, provide anaphylaxis education, and monitor response with symptom tools and selective mediator testing during flares [^bb33b47c] [^82f78f81] [^6ce341bb].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research needs, so I do not overstate what is known. High-quality randomized trials are sparse for many MCAS therapies, including second-generation H1 antihistamines and omalizumab, and diagnostic criteria continue to be refined to prevent overdiagnosis; I need to communicate this transparently while emphasizing that current consensus guidance still provides a coherent, clinically actionable approach that balances safety, efficacy, and patient-centered outcomes [^260194a5] [^4349b797] [^e34ad408].

Treatment of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) centers on **trigger avoidance** and **stepwise anti-mediator therapy** [^b904ead5], with epinephrine for anaphylaxis [^c34de00a] and escalation to omalizumab [^3e8b1c43], midostaurin [^3e8b1c43], or cladribine for refractory or clonal disease [^78563045]. Start with H1/H2 antihistamines [^05a63367], cromolyn [^851e9d8a], and leukotriene antagonists [^851e9d8a]; add aspirin for PGD2-driven flushing if tolerated [^851e9d8a], and use corticosteroids only short term for severe flares [^d0416b82]. Individualize therapy to symptoms and mediator profiles [^2b613b5c], and coordinate care with allergy/immunology and hematology for clonal disease [^bc31bba4].

---

## General principles of management

- **Trigger identification and avoidance**: Identify and avoid triggers such as foods, medications, temperature extremes, stress, and mechanical irritation [^b904ead5] [^7a4190db].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on recognizing early symptoms, using epinephrine autoinjectors, and seeking prompt medical attention [^c34de00a].

- **Individualized treatment**: Tailor therapy to symptom severity, frequency, and mediator profiles [^2b613b5c].

---

### Second-line therapies

- **Aspirin**: For refractory flushing/hypotension from prostaglandin D2; use cautiously due to risk of exacerbation [^851e9d8a] [^6ce341bb].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses for severe flares; long-term use avoided due to adverse effects [^d0416b82].

- **Omalizumab**: For refractory symptoms, especially with IgE-mediated triggers or recurrent anaphylaxis [^3e8b1c43] [^749a5b94].

---

### Advanced therapies for clonal or refractory disease

- **Midostaurin**: For advanced systemic mastocytosis or clonal MCAS with KIT D816V [^3e8b1c43] [^bc31bba4].

- **Cladribine**: For refractory clonal disease with high mast cell burden [^78563045].

- **Interferon-alpha**: Alternative cytoreductive option in select cases [^3e8b1c43].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **dietary modifications** — such as a low-histamine or low-FODMAP diet — to reduce symptom burden, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms [^aaa50487]. Stress management with mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and stress-reduction techniques can decrease symptom frequency and severity. Physical therapy may improve functional status and quality of life.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular assessment** of symptom control, medication tolerability, and quality of life [^9f0c54f3]. Mediator testing (tryptase, histamine metabolites, prostaglandin D2, leukotriene E4) can guide therapy adjustments [^b36f6d96]. Patient education should be ongoing, with reinforcement of trigger avoidance and emergency action plans [^b904ead5].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pediatric patients**, in whom treatment is similar but dosing must be adjusted and growth monitored. In pregnancy, prioritize H1/H2 antihistamines and cromolyn; avoid aspirin, leukotriene antagonists, and biologics unless clearly indicated. For perioperative care, premedicate with H1/H2 blockers and corticosteroids, and ensure epinephrine availability [^c2bf72da].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies and research directions include **BTK inhibitors** under investigation for IgE-independent mast cell activation [^d51fffe5], and CRTH2 antagonists targeting prostaglandin D2 pathways. Personalized medicine approaches aim to tailor therapy based on genetic markers and mediator profiles [^b1467f6b].

---

Effective MCAS management requires a **stepwise, individualized approach** that combines trigger avoidance, anti-mediator therapy, and escalation for refractory or clonal disease, with multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes [^b904ead5].

Our current recommendations for diagnosing and treating primary mast cell (MC) activation syndrome make use of the latest studies and consensus guidelines for clinically recognizing systemic anaphylaxis in real time, regardless of whether allergen-triggered or other pathways are involved; our current understanding of the biomarkers secreted by activated MCs that best discriminate this disorder from other conditions; and the therapeutic drugs that might selectively affect those mediators or MCs themselves. Finding familial or somatic mutations of genes that cause MCs to be hyperactivatable would extend our diagnostic tools and potentially indicate new therapeutic interventions, targeting either the mutated gene product or the associated molecular pathway. In conclusion, we trust that the clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic criteria for primary MC activation syndromes described herein will provide clinicians with practical criteria of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to diagnose most cases without overdiagnosing the disorder in patients who likely have other conditions.

### Mast cell activation syndromes [^ee228c8f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation is common and possibly necessary for maintenance of survival. Disordered mast cell activation occurs when mast cells are pathologically overproduced or if their activation is out of proportion to the perceived threat to homeostasis. Mast cell activation syndrome refers to a group of disorders with diverse causes presenting with episodic multisystem symptoms as the result of mast cell mediator release. Despite introduction of diagnostic criteria and some advances in treatment in the last decade, many areas of mast cell activation syndrome are in need of research. This article reviews our current knowledge about the various types of mast cell activation disorders, their treatment, and areas of uncertainty in need of future investigation.

### Mast cell activation syndrome: current understanding and research needs [^4349b797]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a term applied to several clinical entities that have gained increased attention from patients and medical providers. Although several descriptive publications about MCAS exist, there are many gaps in knowledge, resulting in confusion about this clinical syndrome. Whether MCAS is a primary syndrome or exists as a constellation of symptoms in the context of known inflammatory, allergic, or clonal disorders associated with systemic mast cell activation is not well understood. More importantly, the underlying mechanisms and pathways that lead to mast cell activation in MCAS patients remain to be elucidated. Here we summarize the known literature, identify gaps in knowledge, and highlight research needs. Covered topics include contextualization of MCAS and MCAS-like endotypes and related diagnostic evaluations; mechanistic research; management of typical and refractory symptoms; and MCAS-specific education for patients and health care providers.

Knowledge and understanding of mast cell biology and mast cell disorders has increased in the past several years, with new classifications of diseases for both clonal and non-clonal forms. Along with these classifications has come differing treatment paradigms, including novel therapies now approved for various forms of clonal mast cell disorders. Unfortunately, there is some lack of guidance on how best to utilize these therapies. This yardstick aims to provide the clinician with a review of available therapies to treat mast cell activation syndrome and indolent systemic mastocytosis and an evidence-based expert opinion approach regarding how best to utilize these therapies.

Patients who present with typical features of mast cell activation with laboratory confirmation and without evidence of a clonal mast cell disorder or other medical condition should be initiated on medical treatment to block mast cells and their mediators. If a major response is achieved, a diagnosis of nonclonal mast cell activation syndrome (NC-MCAS) is likely and treatment should be optimized, including management of any associated conditions. In this review, the latest evidence with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of NC-MCAS is presented.

### Selecting the right criteria and proper classification to diagnose mast cell activation syndromes: a critical review [^e34ad408]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years, knowledge about mechanisms underlying mast cell activation (MCA) and accumulation in various pathologic conditions increased substantially. In addition, criteria and a classification of MCA syndromes (MCASs) have been set forth. MCAS is defined by typical clinical symptoms, a substantial increase in serum tryptase level during an attack over the patient's baseline tryptase, and a response of the symptoms to drugs targeting mast cells, mediator production, and/or mediator effects. Alternative diagnostic criteria of MCAS have also been suggested, but these alternative criteria often lack specificity and validation. In this report, we critically review the contemporary literature relating to MCAS and compare the specificity, sensitivity, and strength of MCAS-related parameters within proposals to diagnose and classify MCAS and its variants. Furthermore, we highlight the need to apply specific consensus criteria in the evaluation and classification of MCAS in individual patients. This is an urgent and important medical necessity because as an increasing number of patients are being given a misdiagnosis of MCAS based on nonspecific criteria, which contributes to confusion and frustration by patients and caregivers and sometimes may delay recognition and treatment of correct medical conditions that often turn out to be unrelated to MCA.

### A practical guide for treatment of pain in patients with systemic mast cell activation disease [^a2a4a19f]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic mast cell activation disease (MCAD, a subclass of mastocytosis), which has a prevalence of around 17% (at least in the German population), is characterized by accumulation of genetically altered dysfunctional mast cells with abnormal release of these cells' mediators. Since mast cells affect functions in potentially every organ system, often without causing abnormalities in routine laboratory or radiologic testing, this disease has to be considered routinely in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic multisystem polymorbidity of a generally inflammatory and allergic theme. Pain in its different manifestations is a common symptom in MCAD found in more than three-quarters of the MCAD patients. Because of the specific mast cell-related causes of pain in MCAD it should be treated specifically, if possible, deduced from their putative mast cell mediator-related causes. As yet, there is no official guideline for treatment of MCAD at all. The present review focuses on mast cell mediator-induced acute and chronic pain and the current state of analgesic drug therapy options in MCAD. Due to the high prevalence of MCAD, many physicians are often faced with the issue of pain management in MCAD patients. Hence, our practical guide should contribute to the improvement of patient care. Key words: Pain therapy, mast cell activation disease, mast cell activation syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, mast cell.

### How to evaluate the patient with a suspected mast cell disorder and how / when to manage symptoms [^1e3cabe3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell disorders include mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. Mastocytosis is a rare clonal disorder of the mast cell, driven by KIT D816V mutation in most cases. Mastocytosis is diagnosed and classified according to World Health Organization criteria. Mast cell activation syndromes encompass a diverse group of disorders and may have clonal or nonclonal etiologies. Hematologists may be consulted to assist in the diagnostic workup and/or management of mast cell disorders. A consult to the hematologist for mast cell disorders may provoke anxiety due to the rare nature of these diseases and the management of nonhematologic mast cell activation symptoms. This article presents recommendations on how to approach the diagnosis and management of patients referred for common clinical scenarios.

### Expanding spectrum of mast cell activation disorders: monoclonal and idiopathic mast cell activation syndromes [^0173ec33]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, 2 new syndromes of mast cell activation have been described in patients with episodes of mast cell mediator release that range from flushing and abdominal cramping to anaphylaxis: monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS) and idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).

Objective

This review will discuss these 2 new syndromes in the larger context of mast cell activation disorders as well as the diagnostic and treatment approaches for these conditions.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the following terms: mast cell activation disorder, mast cell activation syndrome, and clonal mast cell. Only English-language articles published up until February 27, 2013, were considered.

Results

MMAS has been diagnosed in patients with systemic reactions to hymenoptera stings and elevated baseline serum tryptase as well as in patients with unexplained episodes of anaphylaxis. A bone marrow biopsy establishes the diagnosis by revealing the presence of monoclonal mast cells that carry the D816V KIT mutation and/or express CD25 while the diagnostic requirements for systemic mastocytosis are not met. MCAS affects predominantly women in whom no mast cell abnormality or external triggers account for their episodes of mast cell activation. MCAS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and primary and secondary mast cell activation disorders as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis have to be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Patients with MCAS and MMAS are treated in a stepwise fashion with drugs that block the effects of mediators released by mast cells on activation. One third of MCAS patients experience complete resolution of symptoms with treatment, while one third have a major response and one third a minor response to treatment. A combination of drugs is usually necessary to achieve symptom control. No drug trial has been performed in patients with MMAS and MCAS.

Conclusions

MMAS and MCAS are 2 newly described, rare syndromes of mast cell activation. Further studies will be necessary to better understand the cause of these conditions and their natural evolution and to validate and improve the treatment approach. Research should also focus on developing drugs with the potential to cure these debilitating disorders. To achieve these goals, centers with expertise in mast cell activation disorders are essential as they allow for a critical mass of these patients to be enrolled in studies while providing those patients with the most up-to-date diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies.

### Mast cell activation syndrome: proposed diagnostic criteria [^c3e62051]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The term mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is finding increasing use as a diagnosis for subjects who present with signs and symptoms involving the dermis, gastrointestinal track, and cardiovascular system frequently accompanied by neurologic complaints. Such patients often have undergone multiple extensive medical evaluations by different physicians in varied disciplines without a definitive medical diagnosis until the diagnosis of MCAS is applied. However, MCAS as a distinct clinical entity has not been generally accepted, nor do there exist definitive criteria for diagnosis. Based on current understanding of this disease "syndrome" and on what we do know about mast cell activation and resulting pathology, we will explore and propose criteria for its diagnosis. The proposed criteria will be discussed in the context of other disorders involving mast cells or with similar presentations and as a basis for further scientific study and validation.

### Mast cell activation syndromes: definition and classification [^8257be87]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) occurs in a number of different clinical conditions, including IgE-dependent allergies, other inflammatory reactions, and mastocytosis. MCA-related symptoms may be mild, moderate, severe, or even life-threatening. The severity of MCA depends on a number of different factors, including genetic predisposition, the number and releasability of mast cells involved in the reaction, the type of allergen, presence of specific IgE, and presence of certain comorbidities. In severe reactions, MCA can be documented by a substantial increase in the serum tryptase level above baseline. When symptoms are recurrent, are accompanied by an increase in mast cell-derived mediators in biological fluids, and are responsive to treatment with mast cell-stabilizing or mediator-targeting drugs, the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is appropriate. Based on the underlying condition, these patients can further be classified into i) primary MCAS where KIT-mutated, clonal mast cells are detected, ii) secondary MCAS where an underlying inflammatory disease, often in the form of an IgE-dependent allergy, but no KIT-mutated mast cells, is found, and iii) idiopathic MCAS, where neither an allergy or other underlying disease, nor KIT-mutated mast cells are detectable. It is important to note that in many patients with MCAS, several different factors act together to lead to severe or even life-threatening anaphylaxis. Detailed knowledge about the pathogenesis and complexity of MCAS, and thus establishing the exact final diagnosis, may greatly help in the management and therapy of these patients.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^db14536b]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndromes diagnostic criteria — In patients who otherwise do not fulfill the clinical definition of anaphylaxis, diagnosis has been proposed to include 3 criteria, all of which should be fulfilled: symptoms consistent with mast cell activation in at least 2 different organ systems, documentation of elevated mast cell mediator levels during an episode with a post-event tryptase obtained within 4 hours, and a positive response to mediator-targeting drugs.

### Mast cell activation syndrome and mastocytosis: initial treatment options and long-term management [^644aa8da]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with clonal mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) including cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis (SM) may present with symptoms of mast cell activation, but in addition can have organ damage from the local effects of tissue infiltration by clonal mast cells. Patients with nonclonal MCAS may have chronic or episodic mast cell activation symptoms with an increase in serum tryptase and/or urinary metabolites of histamine, prostaglandin D2, and leukotrienes. Symptoms of MCAS and SM can be managed by blockade of mediator receptors (H1 and H2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor blockade), inhibition of mediator synthesis (aspirin, zileuton), mediator release (sodium cromolyn), anti-IgE therapy, or a combination of these approaches. Acute episodes of mast cell activation require epinephrine, and prolonged episodes may be addressed with corticosteroids. Patients with clonal mast cell syndromes may need a reduction in the number of mast cells to prevent severe symptoms including anaphylaxis and/or progression to aggressive diseases.

### A review of the dermatologic symptoms of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome [^85282829]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the first reported cases in 2007, idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome has been increasingly recognized. Understanding of the cutaneous manifestations of this condition is imperative for dermatologists given the substantial clinical heterogeneity in its presentation and high estimated prevalence. A review of PubMed® and SCOPUS® databases was performed in order to investigate the most common dermatologic manifestations of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome. Evidence to date suggests that flushing, pruritus, and clotting dysfunction or bleeding disorder are the most frequently observed dermatologic symptoms in idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome, while dermatographism has been identified as a common finding in patients as well. Mast cell activation syndromes have also been linked to connective tissue disorders, including an Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-like phenotype possibly mediated by matrix metalloproteinases and tryptase released by mast cells. Current literature regarding dermatologic manifestations of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome is limited by the heterogeneity of studies including clinical descriptions, inconsistency of diagnostic criteria implemented, and a paucity of literature available. This work provides a guide for dermatologists to strengthen diagnostic acuity for idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome, therefore contributing toward a goal of helping patients to receive timely, effective, and targeted therapy.

### H1-antihistamines for primary mast cell activation syndromes: a systematic review [^260194a5]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) are a group of disorders presenting with symptoms of mast cell mediator release.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of orally administered H1 -antihistamines in the treatment of primary MCAS compared with placebo and other pharmacologic treatments.

Methods

We systematically searched five databases and three trial repositories and contacted an international panel of experts to identify published and unpublished trials.

Results

A total of 36 potentially relevant studies were identified. Of these, five crossover trials, enrolling a total of 71 patients (63 adults), met the eligibility criteria. All five of these studies were judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias. Two studies compared an H1 -antihistamine with placebo, two compared two different H1 -antihistamines, and one study compared H1 - and H2 -antihistamines with oral cromolyn sodium. Four of the five randomized controlled trials were historic (reported from 1983–1993), small (enrolling 8–15 patients), and used agents and/or dosing regimens that are now less commonly used in clinical practice (i.e. azelastine, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, and ketotifen). The fifth trial, which enrolled 33 adults with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis found 4 weeks of treatment with the second-generation H1 -antihistamine rupatadine, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvements in quality of life, symptom control (itching, wheals and flares, flushing, tachycardia, and headache, but not gastrointestinal symptoms), and reduction in itching and whealing after standardized skin provocation to elicit Darier's sign.

Conclusions

There is an urgent need for large, well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of second-generation H1 -antihistamines in treatment of primary MCAS.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^bb33b47c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis of MCAS: clinical signs, biomarker criteria, and evaluation — MCAS is a diagnosis that should be entertained in patients with an appropriate clinical and laboratory profile when other conditions have been excluded; a key feature is recurrent episodes of systemic anaphylaxis with concurrent involvement of at least 2 of the 4 organ systems listed below. The clinical symptoms have to be associated with an acute increase in specific biologic mediator levels, and patients should respond to therapy with mast cell mediator blocking agents, mast cell stabilizers, or both, with the most validated mediators including histamine, PGD2, and LTC4 and metabolites (with tryptase) serving as biomarkers for mast cell activation. A patient with episodic symptoms affecting 2 or more organ systems should be evaluated for MCAS, and the evaluation should include measuring mediator levels at baseline and during an acute episode; if only urinary histamine products are increased, histamine-blocking agents might improve symptoms, whereas if PG levels are increased, aspirin (with appropriate precautions discussed later in the article) will reduce PG levels and should alleviate symptoms. The presence of the specific symptom during which levels of a mediator are increased and the clinical response to appropriate therapy are prerequisites for the diagnosis of MCAS. Persistent symptoms, such as in chronic urticaria or poorly controlled asthma, should direct the clinician to a different underlying diagnosis, and chronic increases in mediator levels such as tryptase might reflect underlying systemic mastocytosis or hereditary α-tryptasemia that can be but are not always associated with MCAS.

### Mast cell activation syndrome: tools for diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^6e9d3c4d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The current consensus diagnostic criteria for mast cell activation syndrome(s) (MCAS[s]) were first established in 2012 and updated in 2019. This diagnosis has been attached to multiple medical conditions not intended as part of the diagnosis. In this article, the diagnostic criteria are reviewed and other diseases in the differential diagnosis outlined. The goal of this review is to provide a tool for evaluation of patients with conditions that can mimic MCAS. Furthermore, the potential role for hereditary alpha-tryptasemia in this group of disorders is discussed.

### Mast cell diseases in practice and research: issues and perspectives raised by patients and their recommendations to the scientific community and beyond [^f9144497]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since 2010, patients and physicians have collaborated to understand unmet needs of patients with mast cell diseases, incorporating mastocytosis and mast cell activation disorders, which include mast cell activation syndromes.

Objective

This Open Innovation in Science project aims to expand understanding of the needs of patients affected by mast cell diseases, and encourage global communication among patient advocacy groups, physicians, researchers, industry, and government. A major aim is to support the scientific community's efforts to improve diagnosis, management, therapy, and patients' quality of life by addressing unmet needs.

Methods

In collaboration with mast cell disease specialists, 13 patient advocacy groups from 12 countries and regions developed lists of top patient needs. A core team of leaders from patient advocacy groups collected and analyzed the data and proposed possible actions to address patient needs.

Results

Findings identified similarities and differences among participating countries in unmet needs between patients with mastocytosis and those with mast cell activation syndromes. Issues emphasized struggles relating to the nature and rarity of mast cell diseases, their impact on quality of life, the diagnostic process, access to appropriate care, more effective treatment, and the need for research.

Conclusions

Solutions vary across countries because situations differ, in particular regarding the existence of and access to centers of excellence and reference centers. Multifaceted mast cell activation syndrome barriers necessitate innovative approaches to improve access to appropriate care. The outcomes of this project should greatly support scientists and clinicians in their efforts to improve diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation disorders.

### Anaphylaxis: a review of causes and mechanisms [^f90630d8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the circulation. Foods and medications cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause this syndrome. This review discusses the pathophysiologic mechanisms of anaphylaxis, its causes, and its treatment.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — antihistamines for prevention and symptom control: Nonsedating H1 antihistamines are generally preferred and can be increased to 2 to 4 times the standard dose; sedating H1 antihistamines might acutely cause drowsiness and chronically lead to cognitive decline, particularly in the elderly. H2R antihistamines can be used as first-line therapy for gastrointestinal symptoms and might help H1R antihistamines attenuate cardiovascular symptoms. Recommendations for antihistamine therapy for MC activation disorders are based on expert opinion, and H1R and H2R antihistamine receptors work better as prophylactic than acute treatment. In patients with MCAS, H1R blockers reduce dermatologic manifestations, such as flushing and pruritus, along with tachycardia and abdominal discomfort, and later-generation nonsedating H1R antihistamines, such as fexofenadine and cetirizine, are often used at 2 to 4 times US Food and Drug Administration–approved doses.

### Proposed diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected mast cell activation syndrome [^16b9c86c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) accompanies diverse physiologic and pathologic processes and is one of the more frequently encountered conditions in medicine. MCA-related symptoms are usually mild and often transient. In such cases, histamine receptor blockers and other mediator-targeting drugs can usually control MCA. In severe cases, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. However, overt MCAS is an unusual condition, and many patients referred because of suspected MCAS are diagnosed with other diseases (autoimmune, neoplastic, or infectious) unrelated to MCA or suffer from MCA-related (eg, allergic) disorders and/or comorbidities without fulfilling criteria of an overt MCAS. These considerations are important as more and more patients are informed that they may have MCA or even MCAS without completing a thorough medical evaluation. In fact, in several instances, symptoms are misinterpreted as MCA/MCAS, and other clinically relevant conditions are not thoroughly pursued. The number of such referrals is increasing. To avoid such unnecessary referrals and to prevent misdiagnoses, we here propose a diagnostic algorithm through which a clinically relevant (systemic) MCA can be suspected and MCAS can subsequently be documented or excluded. In addition, the algorithm proposed should help guide the investigating care providers to consider the 2 principal diagnoses that may underlie MCAS, namely, severe allergy and systemic mastocytosis accompanied by severe MCA. Although validation is required, we anticipate that this algorithm will facilitate the management of patients with suspected MCAS.

### Mast cell activation syndrome: a newly recognized disorder with systemic clinical manifestations [^9bcd08ec]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic criteria for mast cell (MC) activation syndrome have been recently proposed, but clinical studies to validate these criteria are lacking.

Objective

We sought to determine the clinical manifestations of this newly recognized syndrome in a cohort of patients.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated 18 patients seen at our institution with MC activation syndrome from 2006 to 2009. Patients enrolled had at least 4 of the signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, dermatographism, memory and concentration difficulties, or headache. Response to treatment with anti-MC mediator medications was assessed based on established criteria. Laboratory tests indicating MC mediator release and histopathology and immunohistochemical studies on gastrointestinal biopsy samples were performed.

Results

Ninety-four percent of the patients had abdominal pain, 89% had dermatographism, 89% had flushing, and 72% had the constellation of all 3 symptoms. Patients additionally had headache, diarrhea, and memory and concentration difficulties. All patients had at least 1 positive laboratory test result for an increased MC mediator level. On the basis of the response to treatment criteria, 67% of the patients in the cohort had either a complete or major regression in symptoms while taking medications targeting MC mediators. There was no significant difference in the numbers of intestinal mucosal MCs between our patients and healthy control subjects.

Conclusion

MC activation syndrome might be the underlying cause of unexplained symptoms when several organ systems are involved, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the skin. It is especially important to be able to recognize the constellation of clinical features because response to anti-MC mediator medications is often excellent.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) definition and mediator-directed therapy — MCAS is defined as a primary clinical condition with spontaneous episodic systemic anaphylaxis affecting at least 2 organ systems and resulting from secreted mast cell mediators; symptoms occur with secretion of mast cell products (tryptase, histamine, prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4) leading to increased blood or urine levels of these mediators or metabolites (N-methylhistamine, 11β-PGF2α, LTE4/LTD4), and symptoms should improve with medications that block receptor binding or reduce production, including H1 histamine receptor and H2 histamine receptor antihistamines and type 1 cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists, inhibitors of COX for PGD2 or 5-lipoxygenase for LTC4, and mast cell stabilizers such as omalizumab.

### Mast cell activation disorders [^18e39442]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Disorders associated with mast cell activation range from relatively common IgE-mediated disease and chronic urticaria to rarer conditions such as mastocytosis or monoclonal mast cell activation disorder. Mast cell activation disorders can be mechanistically classified into primary (associated with abnormal production of mast cells that carry pathologic markers of clonality), secondary (normal mast cells activated in reaction to a microenvironmental trigger), and idiopathic (no etiology is found). Clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria as well as general principles of a stepwise therapy approach are discussed.

### Mast cell activation syndrome [^68b3377b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) involves the skin, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic systems, classified as primary, secondary, and idiopathic. Earlier criteria for MCAS diagnosis included episodic symptoms with mast cell mediators affecting two or more organ systems with urticaria, angioedema, flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, hypotensive syncope, tachycardia, wheezing, conjunctival injection, pruritus, nasal stuffiness, decrease in frequency, severity, or resolution of symptoms with anti-mediator therapy including H 1 /H 2 receptor antagonists, anti-leukotrienes, or mast cell stabilizers. Laboratory data includes an increased validated urinary or serum markers of MCAS, documentation of an increase of the marker above the patient's baseline value during symptomatic periods on more than two occasions, or baseline serum tryptase levels that are persistently above 15 ng/mL. Laboratory data also includes an increase of the tryptase level above baseline value on one occasion. Other assays are 24-h urine histamine metabolites, PGD 2 or its metabolite, and 11-β-prostaglandin F 2 alpha. A recent global classification is a response of clinical symptoms, a substantial transient increase in serum total tryptase or increase in other mast cell-derived mediators, histamine or PGD2 or urinary metabolites, and agents that attenuate production or mast cell mediator activities. "Spectrum of MCAS disorders" has been proposed, highlighting symptoms' diagnostic tests and treatments.

### Personalized management strategies in mast cell disorders: ECNM-AIM user's guide for daily clinical practice [^b1467f6b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mastocytosis is a myeloid neoplasm defined by expansion and focal accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in one or more organs. The disease exhibits a complex pathology and may be complicated by MC activation, bone abnormalities, neurological problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, and/or hematologic progression. The World Health Organization divides mastocytosis into cutaneous forms, systemic mastocytosis (SM) and MC sarcoma. In most patients with SM, somatic mutations in KIT are detected. Patients with indolent SM have a normal to near-normal life expectancy, whereas patients with advanced SM, including aggressive SM and MC leukemia, have a poor prognosis. In those with advanced SM, multiple somatic mutations and an associated hematologic neoplasm may be detected. Mediator-related symptoms can occur in any type of mastocytosis. Symptoms may be mild, severe, or even life-threatening. In patients with severe acute symptoms, an MC activation syndrome may be diagnosed. In these patients, relevant comorbidities include IgE-dependent and IgE-independent allergies. Management of patients with SM is an emerging challenge in daily practice and requires in-depth knowledge and a multidisciplinary and personalized approach with selection of appropriate procedures and interventions. In this article, we review the current knowledge on SM and MC activation syndrome, with emphasis on multidisciplinary aspects in diagnosis and patient-specific management. In addition, we provide a user's guide for application of markers, algorithms, prognostic scores, and treatments for use in daily practice.

### Mast cell activation syndromes presenting as anaphylaxis [^678ad9ea]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis results from severe systemic mast cell activation. In addition to IgE-mediated and physical triggers, it may occur with a clonal mast cell disease and in an idiopathic fashion without clear provoking factors. Disorders of mast cell activation are classified into primary (clonal), secondary, and idiopathic. Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by objective documentation of elevated mast cell mediators during attacks and a favorable response to antimediator therapy. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with recurrent anaphylaxis without a clear cause. This article discusses the diagnosis of MCAS.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^bc31bba4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis — overview and guideline scope: Mastocytosis is a group of heterogeneous disorders resulting from the clonal growth of abnormal mast cells and their accumulation in the skin and/or in extracutaneous organs. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is the most common form of mastocytosis diagnosed in adults, characterized by mast cell infiltration of one or more extracutaneous organs (with or without skin involvement). The identification of KIT D816V mutation and the emergence of new targeted therapies have significantly improved the diagnosis and treatment of SM, yet certain aspects of clinical care, particularly the diagnosis, assessment, and management of mast cell activation symptoms, continue to present challenges. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Systemic Mastocytosis provide recommendations for the diagnosis and comprehensive care of patients with SM; management of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is not included. Comprehensive care requires a multidisciplinary team approach, preferably in specialized centers with expertise in mast cell disorders, and referral to centers with expertise in mastocytosis is strongly recommended.

### Diagnostic criteria and classification of mastocytosis in 2014 [^d9870ae6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis is characterized by accumulation of pathologic mast cells in tissues. Most patients with mastocytosis experience mast cell activation symptoms in response to various triggers. The diagnosis of mastocytosis should be made from objective pathologic findings. Modern diagnostic criteria and classification of mastocytosis were proposed in 2000 by an international consensus group and formed the basis of the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which have been validated to correlate with prognosis and help selection of therapy. In this article, the WHO criteria for diagnosis and classification are summarized and practical aspects to avoid common pitfalls in diagnostic workup are discussed.

Management and therapeutic options for patients with mast cell disorders: Treatment of patients with MCAS is highly individualized and targeted to bothersome symptoms and the underlying pathology. Acute management of an activation attack corresponds to systemic anaphylaxis care: hypotensive episodes should be managed by patients assuming the supine position, followed by administration of intramuscular epinephrine; laryngeal angioedema requires intramuscular epinephrine; bronchospasm can be treated with intramuscular epinephrine or an inhaled rapidly acting bronchodilator, such as albuterol. Patients at risk for such events should carry an epinephrine autoinjector, and if epinephrine is used, the patient should strongly consider being taken to the emergency department by ambulance while remaining in the supine position. Prevention focuses on identifying and avoiding triggers (insect venoms, temperature extremes, mechanical irritation, alcohol, or medications such as aspirin, radiocontrast agents, and certain anesthetic agents), attenuating mediator effects, and potentially reducing MC responsiveness or numbers. A patient with SM sensitive to insect venom, particularly with a history of systemic anaphylaxis to a prior insect sting, should undergo lifelong venom immunotherapy, and using omalizumab during immunotherapy appears to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis to venom immunotherapy. Eliminating additives in drugs by compounding to treat or prevent anaphylaxis is not recommended; notably, for 100 patients with chronic urticaria, 43 of whom complained of additive allergies, single- or double-blind challenges ruled this out in all patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^82f78f81]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — definition, scope, and basic criteria: MCAS refers to disorders with episodic symptoms related to mast cell mediator release and can be divided into primary, secondary, and idiopathic. Primary MCAS is also called monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). MCAS is not considered a subtype of systemic mastocytosis and is not associated with an overproliferation of cells or a prediagnostic condition that progresses to SM, though mediator symptoms may still occur. Basic defining criteria include: 1) episodic symptoms consistent with mast cell mediator release affecting greater than or equal to two organ systems; 2) a decrease in the frequency or severity, or resolution of symptoms with anti-mediator drug therapy; and 3) elevation of a validated urinary or serum marker of mast cell activation, such as serum tryptase (marker of choice). In patients with mast cell activation symptoms but normal mast cell morphology/immunophenotype without KIT D816V, other causes of mast cell activation should be considered, and if no cause is identified, a diagnosis of idiopathic MCAS is rendered on a provisional basis until a specific cause is found.

Prognosis and length of therapy in MCAS state that there are no specific studies evaluating the prognosis of patients with MCAS. Some patients with clonal MCAS can progress to SM, most likely indolent SM, but none of the patients in the Mayo Clinic cohort followed for more than 15 years had mastocytosis, and data regarding patients with indolent SM demonstrate a normal life expectancy. We propose treatment based on symptoms and increased levels of MC mediators; for example, if a patient with MCAS has increased urinary LTE4 levels, then LT antagonists are recommended, and if urinary PG metabolite levels were increased, then treatment with aspirin might help; therefore the therapeutic intervention should be adjusted to fit each patient.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — histamine receptor–targeted therapies are outlined: First-generation H1R antihistamines include diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and chlorpheniramine, but a limitation is their sedative action, impairing driving ability and leading to cognitive decline, particularly in elderly patients, with concern about use in patients with MCAS who are prone to cardiovascular events. Cyproheptadine would function as a sedating H1R blocker and a serotonin receptor antagonist and has been used to treat diarrhea and nausea in MCAS, and ketotifen is available as a compounded medication in the United States and is used to treat dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Rupatadine, an H1R blocker that also blocks platelet-activating factor binding to its receptor, is approved for use in many countries but not in the United States, and in patients with mastocytosis improved control of pruritus, flushing, tachycardia, and headache but not gastrointestinal symptoms; studies for treating MCAS were promising, but not conclusive. H2R blocking agents are commonly used to treat abdominal and/or vascular signs or symptoms of MCAS, with options including nizatidine, famotidine, and cimetidine; H2R antihistamines prevent histamine-mediated acid secretion from parietal cells and blunt vasoactive effects of intravenously infused histamine if combined with an H1R antagonist. Importantly, H1R and H2R blocking agents, especially those with anticholinergic effects, can be associated with cognitive decline that is worse in elderly populations, and therapeutic antagonists for H3 and H4 receptors are in development and might have novel clinical value, particularly H4 receptor antagonists, which reduce pruritus and inflammation in atopic dermatitis.

### Clustering of clinical symptoms using large language models reveals low diagnostic specificity of proposed alternatives to consensus mast cell activation syndrome criteria [^a71428fd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) originated as a term to describe the phenotype of mast cell activation (MCA) in patients with features of systemic mastocytosis. Sonneck et al. used the term to unify patients with profound hypotension in response to hymenoptera envenomation who either fully or partially met systemic mastocytosis criteria. Akin et al. used mast cell activation to describe patients with recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis with or without features of monoclonal mast cell disease. Throughout multiple iterations, MCAS consensus criteria have consistently required (i) the presence of severe, systemic, and recurrent symptoms associated with mast cell degranulation (e.g. anaphylaxis), in addition to (ii) evidence of acute mast cell mediator elevation above a patient-specific baseline and (iii) therapeutic response to mast cell-directed therapies –. The European Competence Network on Mastocytosis and the American Initiative in Mast Cell Diseases (ECNM-AIM) consortium criteria (hereafter designated "consortium MCAS criteria") reaffirm this definition and further expand on the relation of MCAS to the broader MCA disorders (MCADs), including monoclonal (e.g. clonal mast cell disease with activating mutations in c-KIT), secondary (e.g. severe IgE-mediated hypersensitivities), and idiopathic MCAS.

However, alternatives definitions for MCAS have been proposed outside of expert organizations like ECNM and AIM and utilized as unvalidated clinical criteria (hereafter designated "alternative MCAS criteria"). The symptoms accepted by these proposed alternative criteria are more numerous than those of the consortium MCAS criteria (153 vs. 18, respectively), invoke a broader range of clinical systems, appear less specific to the physiologic effects of mast cell mediators, and do not require the severity of consortium MCAS criteria. Laboratory criteria can be satisfied by isolated mast cell mediator elevation above a reference range, rather than acute elevation above a patient-specific baseline. However, baseline mast cell mediator levels exhibit significant inter- and intra-personal variation –, limiting laboratory specificity and increasing the relative influence of symptoms alone in satisfying alternative criteria compared to consortium criteria.

### Mast cell mediators in allergic inflammation and mastocytosis [^f4eca208]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Mast cells possess an array of potent inflammatory mediators capable of inducing acute symptoms after cell activation, including urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, diarrhea, vomiting, hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and death in few minutes. In contrast, mast cells can provide an array of beneficial mediators in the setting of acute infections, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The balance between the detrimental and beneficial roles of mast cells is not completely understood. Although the symptoms of acute mast cell mediator release can be reversed with epinephrine, adrenergic agonists, and mediator blockers, the continued release of histamine, proteases, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and chemokines leads to chronic and debilitating disease, such as mastocytosis. Identification of the molecular factors and mechanisms that control the synthesis and release of mast cell mediators should benefit all patients with mast cell activation syndromes and mastocytosis.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — additional preventive pharmacologic agents: Cromolyn sodium can reduce abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and cramps; benefit might extend to neuropsychiatric manifestations, and divided dosing with weekly upward titration might improve tolerance and adherence. Doxepin, a potent H1 + H2 antihistamine with tricyclic antidepressant activity, might reduce central nervous system manifestations in patients with MCAS or SM but might cause drowsiness and cognitive decline and might increase suicidal tendencies in children and young adults with depression. Aspirin might reduce flushing and hypotension in some patients but is contraindicated in those with allergic or adverse reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and clinical improvement might require a dosing increase up to 650 mg twice daily. For refractory signs or symptoms, a steroid taper/steroid burst might be useful at an initial oral dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/day, followed by a slow taper over 1 to 3 months, and it might be helpful to give 50 mg of prednisone 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before radiologic or invasive procedures when MC activation has been problematic.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — leukotriene pathway modulation, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)–targeting with aspirin, cromolyn, and glucocorticosteroids are described: Other therapies include cysteinyl leukotriene receptor blocking agents, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton, and these medications might work best in conjunction with H1R antihistamines, being most efficacious for dermatologic symptoms. Aspirin has been used to attenuate refractory flushing and hypotensive spells associated with PGD2 secretion by inhibiting its synthesis and should be introduced in a controlled clinical setting because of the risk of triggering MC degranulation. Oral cromolyn is used predominantly for gastrointestinal symptoms, and cromolyn taken orally or applied topically also might reduce pruritus; patients should be counseled that the onset of action can be delayed and should be taken for at least 1 month before deciding whether it is helping, and dosing can be gradually increased to 200 mg 4 times a day, given before each meal and at bedtime. Systemic steroids might help some patients, as indicated in case reports, but should be tapered as quickly as possible to limit their numerous adverse effects.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — acute management: Patients with a history of systemic anaphylaxis or airway angioedema should be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector and instructed how and when to use it. Those with recurrent hypotensive episodes should be trained to assume a supine position as soon as possible by using a bedpan for diarrhea and an emesis basin after rolling on to the side or abdomen. A bronchodilator (albuterol) can be inhaled by using a nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler to treat symptoms or signs of bronchospasm.

Current classification and unmet needs explain that the recommendations make use of the latest studies and consensus guidelines for clinically diagnosing systemic anaphylaxis in real time, regardless of whether allergens were triggered through the IgE pathway or through other pathways, and also do not address the occurrence of local MC activation. An increase in MC numbers in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere by itself does not provide a diagnosis of MC activation or indicate that MC activity is affected. Detection of an activating KIT mutation, such as one causing D816V, in peripheral blood or tissue demonstrates clonality; surface expression of CD25 on MCs is a surrogate marker for clonality; and the presence of dense aggregates of spindle-shaped MCs suggests underlying mastocytosis. Whether the plasticity of human MCs, governed largely by their local tissue or inflammatory environment, might affect their activation into a clinically significant manner needs to be better understood.

### Mastocytosis… [^1bb4afec]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Mastocytosis is characterized by large amounts of mast cells accumulating in the body. Abnormal activation of MCs leads to accelerated growth and accumulation in the skin, bone marrow, and internal organs. Mastocytosis is divided into 7 categories based on World Health Organization classification. Two major types are cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis. There are several types of CM, including maculopapular and diffuse. SM also has several subtypes, including indolent and aggressive. These classifications are defined by the age of the patient at disease onset and histopathologic criteria. There are a variety of symptoms due to histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, chemokines, and tryptase, which are released during MC activation. Skin manifestations range from mild pruritus to anaphylaxis, with 10% of pediatric patients developing anaphylaxis.

However, in SM, symptoms may include flushing and pruritus, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and hypotension. Comments.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in mast cell activation disorders [^671b5baa]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are commonly reported in patients with mast cell disease. GI involvement in systemic mastocytosis is heterogeneous and symptoms may be caused by infiltration of abnormal mast cells in the GI tract and/or by the downstream effect of mast cell mediators on GI tissues. GI symptoms described the monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome are best characterized in the context of acute anaphylaxis. The presence of GI symptoms and a subjective response of symptoms to anti-mast cell mediator therapy are considered qualifying criteria in the diagnosis of the idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome. Antimediator therapy may help alleviate GI symptoms in mast cell disease.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — anti-IgE, cytoreductive therapy, and kinase inhibitors are considered: Omalizumab binds free IgE, preventing its binding to FcεRI, reduces the severity and frequency of allergic reactions during aeroallergen rush immunotherapy and insect venom immunotherapy in patients with mastocytosis, and prevents spontaneous episodes of anaphylaxis in case reports and case series; therefore it should be considered in cases of MCAS resistant to mediator-targeted therapies. For patients with clonal MCAS in advanced systemic mastocytosis with signs and symptoms refractory to antimediator therapy, cytoreductive therapy should be considered, with IFN-α and cladribine among the most commonly used agents; commonly observed adverse events of IFN-α include flu-like symptoms, depression, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disorders, and cladribine can be efficacious in advanced SM with severe life-threatening or disabling anaphylaxis but is associated with an increased risk of infection. Based on laboratory studies, inhibitors of Kit tyrosine kinase decrease MC activation and survival and might be helpful; midostaurin has activity against wild-type and D816V Kit and has been approved for treating advanced SM, and for most patients nausea can be controlled by taking ondansetron 30 to 60 minutes before midostaurin, with cytopenias managed by dose adjustment, and this agent can replace IFN-α and cladribine in the treatment paradigm for clonal MC disorders. Additional agents noted include masitinib (asthenia is a common side effect), imatinib (not indicated if the D816V mutation or another mutation at this position is present), and ibrutinib (decreases IgE-mediated reactivity but not non–IgE-mediated MC activation); current studies using an mAb targeting sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 reported reductions in eosinophil numbers and MC activation in humanized mice, but human data have not yet been published.

### Risk and management of patients with mastocytosis and MCAS in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic: expert opinions [^13fc3b02]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic has massively distorted our health care systems and caused catastrophic consequences in our affected communities. The number of victims continues to increase, and patients at risk can only be protected to a degree, because the virulent state may be asymptomatic. Risk factors concerning COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality include advanced age, an impaired immune system, cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer treated with chemotherapy. Here, we discuss the risk and impact of COVID-19 in patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. Because no published data are yet available, expert opinions are, by necessity, based on case experience and reports from patients. Although the overall risk to acquire the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may not be elevated in mast cell disease, certain conditions may increase the risk of infected patients to develop severe COVID-19. These factors include certain comorbidities, mast cell activation-related events affecting the cardiovascular or bronchopulmonary system, and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, such treatments should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis during a COVID-19 infection. In contrast, other therapies, such as anti-mediator-type drugs, venom immunotherapy, or vitamin D, should be continued. Overall, patients with mast cell disorders should follow the general and local guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic and advice from their medical provider.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — other agents targeting mast cell mediators: Omalizumab has cases indicating prevention of anaphylactic episodes in some patients with MCAS or SM or in those who cannot otherwise tolerate needed insect venom immunotherapy. Cysteinyl leukotriene inhibitor (eg, montelukast) or 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (zileuton) agents might reduce bronchospasm or gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with MCAS or SM, particularly if urinary LTE4 levels are increased, but they are not well studied. Cyproheptadine is a sedating H1 antihistamine with extended anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activities and might help gastrointestinal symptoms. Ketotifen is a sedating H1R antagonist approved in the United States for allergic eye disease that can be compounded as tablets, but whether it is beneficial beyond other antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, is unproved.

### Acute / baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^28bb6938]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is recognized that the criterion standard for diagnosing mast cell (MC) activation syndrome (MCAS) in patients presenting with symptoms of MC degranulation in 2 or more organ systems is the finding of an acute elevation of serum tryptase level above baseline by 20% plus an additional 2 ng/mL. Additionally, patients with MCAS must satisfy a third criterion, namely, improvement with MC-directed treatment. Patients presenting with stage 1 (mild) idiopathic anaphylaxis (ie, having skin rash, itching, redness, or hives) or stage 2 (moderate) idiopathic anaphylaxis (ie, having more widespread skin rash and hives or mild angioedema of the lips or tongue) would not qualify as having idiopathic MCAS because of only single-organ involvement. Patients having the more severe idiopathic anaphylaxis, stage 3 or 4 with multiorgan involvement, must still meet the criteria of tryptase level elevation and clinical response to be diagnosed as having MCAS. Although these clinical and laboratory criteria are commonly reported, it is difficult to find reports that the third criterion for defining MCAS, namely, clinical improvement or prevention of attacks, has been satisfied following institution of treatment. This, in part, could be ascribed to the difficulty of prescribing appropriate therapy without knowledge that levels of MC mediator(s) are elevated during attacks. Urinary samples obtained contemporaneously with attacks can be used to measure levels of the MC mediator metabolites N-methyl histamine (N-MH), (2,3-dinor)-11β–prostaglandin F₂α (PGF₂α), and leukotriene E₄ (LTE₄). Currently, however, despite their utility, these mediators are not currently included in the definition of MCAS. Several other mediators are synthesized and secreted by MCs; however, these are not commonly measured in clinical laboratories and are not as yet included in defining systemic mastocytosis or MCAS. Of the 3 urinary MC mediator measurements, those of LTE 4 have received the least attention. Here we present the cases of 3 patients with MCAS, confirming the marked increases in LTE 4 excretion and providing evidence that blockade of this product can contribute to beneficial clinical effects.

### Acute / baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^cb8dcebf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Key messages

- Episodes of anaphylaxis have an acute/baseline rise in the serum tryptase level greater than 1.685; however, the accompanying increases in levels of 3 urinary MC mediator metabolites are only sparsely reported in these cases.
- The acute/baseline ratios of the urinary metabolite of LTC₄ (LTE₄) can exceed metabolites of both histamine and PGD₂, as well as that of serum tryptase during anaphylaxis.
- In addition to measuring urinary excretion of both histamine and PGD 2 metabolites, documentation of acute/baseline urinary levels of LTE 4, is warranted in patients with anaphylaxis and can contribute to therapeutic options for these patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^6ce341bb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis — management of chronic symptoms related to mast cell mediator release uses a stepwise approach that should be considered for all patients with symptoms, and standard doses need to be titrated with higher doses possibly necessary for refractory symptoms. Histamine receptor type 1 (H1) and histamine receptor type 2 (H2) blockers have been shown to control skin, gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and naso-ocular symptoms. For symptoms refractory to other options, aspirin, corticosteroids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists are useful; leukotriene receptor antagonists have been used for skin and gastrointestinal symptoms that have not responded to other therapies. Aspirin has been shown to be effective when symptoms are associated with elevated urinary prostaglandin levels, but the risks and benefits of aspirin need to be weighed carefully since it can trigger mast cell activation in some patients.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnostic symptom clusters — anaphylaxis organ system involvement is summarized across four systems, and symptoms affecting at least 2 of these 4 organ systems should occur concurrently. Cardiovascular involvement includes hypotension, tachycardia, and syncope or near syncope. Respiratory involvement includes wheezing (inspiratory or expiratory), shortness of breath, and inspiratory stridor. Dermatologic involvement includes flushing, urticaria, pruritus, and angioedema. Gastrointestinal involvement includes diarrhea, nausea with vomiting, and crampy abdominal pain.

### Acute / baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^37a7a1ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mast cell (MC) activation syndrome (MCAS) can be a challenge to diagnose and treat despite the near continuous appearance of publications outlining specific criteria. Follow-up of the clinical responses to treatment is often lacking, and confirmation that leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) is an active participant in MCAS has been overlooked.

Objective

Three patients with MCAS characterized by anaphylaxis are presented to illustrate (1) the value of contemporaneous urinary mediator sampling during MCAS in addition to serum tryptase measurements and (2) substantiation of the fact that not only can LTC 4 (measured metabolite LTE 4) be the highest metabolite measured, but (3) blockade of the LTE 4 receptor can contribute to symptom prevention.

Method

The study methods comprised clinical review and quantitation of acute and baseline levels of tryptase and urinary MC mediators.

Results

The cases of 3 patients with MCAS are reviewed. In the first case, vespid sting–induced anaphylaxis was associated with a marked increase in the LTE 4 excretion. The addition of montelukast was instituted, and subsequent stings did not evoke symptoms. In the second case, acute measurements showed substantial increased levels of (2,3-dinor)-11β-prostaglandin F 2α, and LTE 4. The addition of aspirin plus montelukast prevented subsequent attacks. The third case documents a perioperative anaphylactic event with an acute/baseline LTE 4 ratio far higher than those of tryptase or other metabolites.

Conclusions

The value of measuring all 3 MC mediator metabolites during MCAS should not be overlooked. These measurements can facilitate the successful prevention of attacks. Furthermore, results from these tests show that histamine is often a minor player, whereas acute/baseline levels of the metabolites of LTC 4 and prostaglandin D 2 are frequently much higher, warranting nonantihistamine treatment.

Key Points

Abnormalities of epithelial barrier integrity resulting from activation by mast cell mediators may lead to increased mucosal permeability and development of visceral hypersensitivity.
Recent studies have focused on interaction between gastrointestinal mast cells and the enteric microbiome which can modulate gut inflammatory process underlying IBS symptom exacerbations.
Future studies addressing mast cell participation in IBS symptom genesis will define patient subsets who respond to treatments that reverse visceral hypersensitivity, permeability defects, and microbiome alterations in this condition.

Tryptase testing for suspected systemic mast cell (MC) activation — mature tryptase peaks 30 to 90 minutes after onset and declines with a half-life of about 2 hours. Optimal use of total tryptase requires an acute sample collected between 30 minutes and 2 hours after onset, with increases up to 4 to 6 hours still informative, and a baseline sample obtained before the event or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have abated. For an increase in the acute total tryptase (sAT) to be considered clinically significant relative to the baseline tryptase (sBT), the formula sAT > (1.2×bST) + 2 is recommended, and physicians should consider using this assay and an algorithm for any clinical event thought to be due to systemic activation of MCs, particularly if hypotension is present or in patients with hereditary α-tryptasemia or a somatic KIT mutation.

### The mastocytosis society survey on mast cell disorders: patient experiences and perceptions [^6fd5296d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mast cell diseases include mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes, some of which have been shown to involve clonal defects in mast cells that result in abnormal cellular proliferation or activation. Numerous clinical studies of mastocytosis have been published, but no population-based comprehensive surveys of patients in the United States have been identified. Few mast cell disease specialty centers exist in the United States, and awareness of these mast cell disorders is limited among nonspecialists. Accordingly, information concerning the experiences of the overall estimated population of these patients has been lacking.

Objective

To identify the experiences and perceptions of patients with mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndromes, and related disorders, The Mastocytosis Society (TMS), a US based patient advocacy, research, and education organization, conducted a survey of its members and other people known or suspected to be part of this patient population.

Methods

A Web-based survey was publicized through clinics that treat these patients and through TMS's newsletter, Web site, and online blogs. Both online and paper copies of the questionnaire were provided, together with required statements of consent.

Results

The first results are presented for 420 patients. These results include demographics, diagnoses, symptoms, allergies, provoking factors of mast cell symptoms, and disease impact.

Conclusion

Patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes have provided clinical specialists, collaborators, and other patients with information to enable them to explore and deepen their understanding of the experiences and perceptions of people coping with these disorders.

Tests not recommended for diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS): The report highlights assays that are problematic and not recommended, noting that putative biomarkers include heparin, which has not been validated as a marker of MC activation in blood, and chromogranin A, which resides in neuroendocrine cells but not in MCs; it also states that neither plasma nor urine histamine levels are recommended over histamine metabolites.

Algorithm for diagnosing mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is depicted as: recurrent symptoms consistent with mast cell activation with involvement of two organs; elevation of one or more validated mast cell mediators in association with the symptoms; and response to targeted therapeutic interventions, followed by TEST of peripheral blood or bone marrow GOF KIT mutation or buccal swab increased TPSAB1 α-tryptase CNV. IF Positive THEN Primary MCAS with somatic or germ line mutation; IF Negative THEN MCAS without known mutation. The figure notes that somatic KIT mutation assays have limited sensitivity, that the germline TPSAB1 α-tryptase CNV test is available from Gene by Gene (Houston, Tex.), and that if the peripheral blood allele-specific D816V KIT mutation is negative but REMA or NIH scores are positive, then a bone marrow study for a GOF KIT mutation should be considered.

Treatment recommendations — systemic mastocytosis care emphasizes specialized referral, multidisciplinary input, symptom assessment, anti-mediator therapy, and anaphylaxis precautions. Referral to specialized centers with expertise in the management of mastocytosis is strongly recommended, and multidisciplinary collaboration with subspecialists is recommended. Assessment of symptoms at baseline and during treatment with MLQLQ and MSAF is recommended for patients with ISM and SSM. Anti-mediator drug therapy for mast cell activation symptoms is recommended for all patients with SM, and patients should be counseled about signs/symptoms and avoiding known triggers. The advanced SM symptom assessment form (AdvSM-SAF) is a 10-item instrument covering abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, spots, itching, flushing, and fatigue, and frequency of vomiting and diarrhea is also considered. Anaphylactic reactions are significantly more frequent in ISM and should be managed with the use of epinephrine injection; all patients should carry two auto injectors of epinephrine. Pre-medications are recommended for most procedures in SM because surgery, endoscopy, and other invasive and radiologic procedures can induce mast cell activation and anaphylaxis.

Histamine mediator assessment in MCAS — once released, histamine is metabolized rapidly (half-life, 1–2 minutes), primarily to N-methylhistamine. For investigating MCAS, measurement of urine N-methylhistamine levels has demonstrated little clinical utility, although increased levels can be supportive if found with other mediators such as PGD2 metabolites, and further studies are needed to evaluate how urine N-methylhistamine measurement might be optimally used for evaluation and management of MCAS.

### Doctor, I think I Am suffering from MCAS: differential diagnosis and separating facts from fiction [^31baa8e8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a rare condition defined by a severe systemic reaction to mast cell (MC)-derived mediators. Most cases present with clinical signs of anaphylaxis, and some have an underlying IgE-dependent allergy. A primary MC disease (mastocytosis) may also be detected. Severe recurrent MCAS episodes requiring intensive care or even resuscitation are typically found in patients who suffer from both mastocytosis and allergy against certain triggers, such as hymenoptera venom components. A less severe form and a local form of MC activation (MCA) also exist. For these patients, diagnostic criteria are lacking. Moreover, a number of different, unrelated, conditions with overlapping symptoms may be confused with MCAS. As a result, many patients believe that they are suffering from MCAS but have in fact a less severe form of MCA or another underlying disease. In the current article, we review the potential differential diagnoses of MCA and MCAS and discuss available diagnostic criteria and diagnostic tools. These criteria and assays may be useful in daily practice and help avoid unnecessary referrals and unjustified fears in patients.

### Nontryptase urinary and hematologic biomarkers of mast cell expansion and mast cell activation: status 2022 [^b36f6d96]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Quantitation of urinary metabolites of histamine, prostaglandin D 2, and leukotriene E 4 can fill the gap in our current efforts to improve diagnosis and management of symptomatic patients with systemic mastocytosis, and/or mast cell activation syndrome, In addition, patients symptomatic due to mast cell activation but who do not meet all the criteria for mast cell activation syndrome can have elevated baseline mediator metabolites. Serum tryptase levels have been the workhorse in diagnosing these disorders, but it has several drawbacks including the need to obtain acute and baseline samples, which require 2 visits to health care facilities and 2 venipunctures. Recently, increased baseline tryptase level has been reported in hereditary alpha tryptasemia, complicating diagnostic possibilities of an increased baseline tryptase level. Furthermore, no treatment can specifically be targeted at tryptase itself. In contrast, the finding of 1 or more elevated urinary levels of histamine, prostaglandin D 2, and/or leukotriene E 4 metabolites (1) greatly narrows diagnostic possibilities for causes of symptoms; (2) informs the practitioner what specific metabolic pathways are involved; and (3) targets the treatment in a specific, direct fashion. As a bonus, baseline spot/random urine samples can be obtained by the patients themselves and repeated at exactly the correct time when symptoms occur.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

Anti-mediator drug therapy for chronic symptoms — A stepwise treatment approach for specific symptoms should be considered for all patients who present with symptoms related to mast cell mediator release; standard doses need to be titrated and higher doses may be necessary for symptoms refractory to standard dose treatment. Histamine receptor type 1 (H1) and histamine receptor type 2 (H2) blockers have been shown to control skin, gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and naso-ocular symptoms. Cromolyn sodium is effective for the management of cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms, and topical cromolyn sodium (emulsion, ointment, or cream; 1%–4%) is effective for the symptomatic relief of pruritus, itch, and flare caused by intradermal histamine and can be used to decrease flare-ups of cutaneous symptoms in response to triggers. Aspirin, corticosteroids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists are useful for the management of symptoms that are refractory to other treatment options; leukotriene receptor antagonists have been used for the management of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms that have not responded to other therapies, and aspirin has been shown to be effective for the management of symptoms associated with elevated urinary prostaglandin levels, although the risks and benefits of aspirin need to be weighed carefully since it can trigger mast cell activation in some patients. Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be effective for symptoms related to mast cell mediator release in patients with mastocytosis, and was particularly effective for recurrent anaphylaxis, skin, and gastrointestinal symptoms as opposed to for neuropsychiatric, respiratory, and musculoskeletal symptoms.

### Mast cell mediation of visceral sensation and permeability in irritable bowel syndrome [^5a8e1058]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

Validating the importance of any purported pathogenic factor in IBS should include characterizing effective treatments which target underlying mechanistic defects. To date, treatments that alter mast cell activity (mast cell stabilizers) or function (histamine antagonists) have shown only modest benefits in IBS and are not widely adopted in clinical practice. Limitations of published studies include recruitment of small samples and poor experimental designs. Currently, no biomarkers are available to define mast cell causation of symptoms in specific IBS subsets. A blood panel that measures interleukins released by mast cells has shown 88% sensitivity and 86% specificity in distinguishing IBS patients from healthy controls, but these findings have not been specifically ascribed to mast cell abnormalities. Studies in IBS and animal models suggest potential treatments to reverse visceral hypersensitivity, epithelial dysfunction, or microbial abnormalities. Novel pharmaceuticals have been proposed which reduce IBS symptoms by modifying mast cell activity include next‐generation histamine antagonists, anti‐Th2 cytokine antibodies, PAR antagonists, anti‐IgE antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, miRNA inhibitors or precursors, and dietary therapies. Omalizumab, a medication that blocks IgE, elicited responses in a small study in IBS‐D. A recent 12‐week controlled trial of palmitoylethanolamide and polydatin, two dietary compounds which synergistically reduce mast cell activation, reported reductions in abdominal pain in IBS patients without decreasing mast cell numbers. Randomized trials of these and other therapies will define roles of mast cell dysfunction in well‐defined IBS subsets.

Tryptase algorithm for diagnosing systemic anaphylaxis — serum acute tryptase (SAT) relative to baseline tryptase (BT) uses the threshold "SAT > (1.2×BT) + 2"; neither an sBT nor an sAT alone has sufficient sensitivity, and sensitivity increases with clinical severity, primarily correlating with hypotension. For sampling, the optimal acute blood collection is 30 to 120 minutes after symptom onset, and the optimal baseline sample is either before the event or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved. The test has high specificity (> 90%), while sensitivity varies with time of collection, clinical severity, and trigger.

3.1.3 Treatments that target mast cell pathways in IBS

Treatments to control mast cell activation or reduce actions of mast cell mediators have been studied in IBS. Disodium cromoglycate, a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits histamine and leukotriene release, decreased tryptase release and TLR2 and TLR4 expression in preliminary studies in IBS‐D. In double‐blind trials, cromoglycate was superior to placebo in reducing symptoms in IBS patients with food intolerance. A placebo‐controlled trial found that ketotifen, a mast cell stabilizer with histamine H 1 antagonist properties, decreased IBS symptoms and improved quality of life but did not reduce mast cells.

Other studies suggest benefits of H 1 antagonists in IBS. In a placebo‐controlled trial in 28 IBS patients, the H 1 antagonist ebastine reduced abdominal pain and overall symptoms and improved quality of life. A retrospective analysis from 307 children with functional gastrointestinal disorders reported symptom improvement with cyproheptadine — an antihistamine with anticholinergic and antiserotonergic properties. Some propose that benefits of tricyclic antidepressants in IBS may result from histamine antagonism.

Other drugs which influence mast cell function have been proposed as IBS treatment. Mesalamine, an anti‐inflammatory agent which acts by COX and prostaglandin inhibition, reduced symptoms in some early studies in IBS‐D. However, two more recent controlled trials in IBS failed to show benefit of mesalamine over placebo. Corticosteroids were ineffective in one report, possibly due to an inability to affect mast cell appearance and degranulation.

### Mast cell mediation of visceral sensation and permeability in irritable bowel syndrome [^014f41fd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder and presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. IBS pathophysiology is heterogeneous and variable from patient to patient. Visceral hypersensitivity may underlie symptoms in large IBS subsets, Dysfunction of epithelial barrier function with increases in permeability may contribute to altered defecation and pain in IBS. Alterations in gut bacterial populations are common and may participate in IBS pathophysiology. Each of these factors interact with each other and other factors including bile acids, enteric and central nervous activity, and the immune system to produce IBS symptoms. Better understanding of mechanisms underlying development of hypersensitivity, epithelial dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis in IBS will provide insight into symptom pathogenesis and facilitate drug discovery for improved treatment of this condition.

Mucosal mast cells are increased and show heightened activation in some IBS subsets. Mast cells can elicit visceral hypersensitivity, influence epithelial function, and interact with gut microbes providing a possible link between the neuroimmune system and other contributors to IBS pathogenesis. The aims of this review are to describe gut mast cell biology, characterize mast cell abnormalities in IBS, detail roles of mast cell activity in visceral hypersensitivity, epithelial barrier function, and enteric microbial activity, and to speculate on the potential for future therapies targeting mast cell functions in IBS.

### Risk factors and management of severe life-threatening anaphylaxis in patients with clonal mast cell disorders [^78563045]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Several different risk factors and conditions may predispose to severe life-threatening anaphylaxis. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is one such condition. Although many SM patients are suffering from mild or even no mediator-related symptoms, others have recurrent episodes of severe anaphylaxis, with clear signs of a mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) despite prophylactic therapy with anti-mediator-type drugs. In several of these patients, an IgE-dependent allergy is diagnosed. The severity and frequency of MCAS reactions neither correlate with the burden of neoplastic mast cells nor with the levels of specific IgE or the basal tryptase level. However, there is a relationship between severe anaphylaxis in SM and the type of allergen. Notably, many of these patients suffer from hymenoptera venom allergy. Currently recommended therapies include the prophylactic use of anti-mediator-type drugs, long-term immunotherapy for hymenoptera venom allergic patients, and epinephrine-self-injector treatment for emergency situations. In patients who present with an excess burden of mast cells, such as smouldering SM, cytoreductive therapy with cladribine (2CdA) may reduce the frequency of severe events. For the future, additional treatment options, such as IgE-depletion or the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocking IgE-dependent mediator secretion as well as KIT activation, may be useful alternatives.

Additional allergic indications may also benefit from treatment with BTKis, though the exact potential in these spaces remains uncertain. Because BTK is not thought to play a role in signaling through IgE-independent receptors on mast cells or basophils, diseases that primarily involve these pathways or other non-specific methods of activating these cells would not likely respond to BTK inhibition. Likewise, targeting the FcεRI pathway may not be efficacious in disorders which display mast cell activation by unknown or non-specific triggers, including idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome, idiopathic anaphylaxis, and mastocytosis. For some IgE-mediated disorders, such as allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, systemic BTKis would likely have an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio. One could speculate, however, that topical versions in nasal spray or eyedrop form could effectively treat these conditions.

### Mast cell deposition and activation may be a new explanation for epiploic appendagitis [^9f356659]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Epiploic appendagitis is as an acute painful condition of the fat on the outside of the intestine. Thus far, there have been no publications to our knowledge that appendagitis can be caused by mast cells or can be associated with chronic pain. A patient with multisystemic disorders suffered with both chronic and acute attacks of abdominal pain for ayear. The worst attack led to surgical resection of an enlarged sigmoid colon epiploic appendage. Careful review of her complex medical history and mast cell stains of gastrointestinal biopsies led to the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome. Re-examination of the resected appendage using an immunohistochemical stain demonstrated a high mast cell density which is a new histopathological finding. Treatment of mast cell activation syndrome and other related syndromes led to marked improvement in her health, including all types of chronic abdominal pain.

### Cannabinomimetic control of mast cell mediator release: new perspective in chronic inflammation [^0a5035bd]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The present review aims to elucidate the emerging role played by cannabinomimetic compounds in the control of mast cell activation. Mast cells are immune competent cells strategically localised at the sites directly interfacing with the external environment, which, in case of injury, regulate the immune response by the release of a plethora of both pre-formed and newly-synthesised mediators. However, although the main goal of mast cell activation is to initiate the inflammatory reaction, and thus maintain internal homeostasis, the consequences of dysregulated mast cell activation could be to chronically activate the inflammatory response as occurs in arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, atherosclerosis and asthma. Therefore, much effort has been made to develop compounds that act to prevent mast cell degranulation. Cannabinomimetic compounds (i.e. agents able to modulate endocannabinoid function) are considered as an emerging class of regulators of mast cell behaviour. We focus on the evidence for a cannabinomimetic control of both acute and chronic inflammatory disease, recognising a common mast cell origin for problems such as dermatitis, inflammatory gastrointestinal syndrome and granuloma formation. Special emphasis is provided for the recent promising results obtained with palmitoylethanolamide in human studies. In the light of evidence suggesting that the control of mast cell activation at an early time during an inflammatory process may account for its resolution, it is reasonable to propose that cannabinomimetic compounds, including palmitoylethanolamide and its congeners, could represent possible candidates for treating several chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Clustering of clinical symptoms using large language models reveals low diagnostic specificity of proposed alternatives to consensus mast cell activation syndrome criteria [^5872113d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients referred to allergists for idiopathic MCAS often do not demonstrate abnormal mast cell activation. In a study of MCAS referrals, only 3% of patients demonstrated elevated tryptase levels during acute episodes and only 21% achieved symptom control with mast cell-directed therapies, suggesting an alternative pathophysiology. Importantly, 56% of referrals were based on patient self-evaluation and internet research, which are unlikely to be accompanied by supportive laboratory data due to the specialized nature of mast cell mediator testing and interpretation.

Due to the disproportionate weight of symptomatology in alternative MCAS criteria and the factors that motivate referrals for evaluation of MCAS, we sought to address whether differences in symptom-based criteria between consortium and alternative MCAS criteria could contribute to overdiagnosis. We utilized multiple transformer-based large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, to evaluate criteria specificity based on symptom-diagnosis associations. These LLMs model complex semantic relationships to derive computational understanding of natural language, are capable of numerous natural language tasks within medicine, and have been shown to encode clinical knowledge within their internalized embeddings. Here, we utilized these LLMs to generate diagnosis probability distributions to evaluate MCAS criteria specificity.

### Effective doses of low-dose naltrexone for chronic pain-an observational study [^b010ab46]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Mast Cell Activation Disorder (MCAD)

Mast cells are inflammatory cells that when activated may release substances that cause or enhance clinical pain syndromes. Increased numbers of mast cells are present in Systemic Mastocytosis. Patients that have normal numbers of mast cells that are productive of increased amounts of inflammatory substances may be diagnosed as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. When Mast Cell Activation Syndrome criteria are not fulfilled but mast cell involvement is possible, the [provisional] diagnosis MCAD, not otherwise specified, may be present. Approximately 30% of patients (12/41), all of whom had hEDS, were diagnosed with MCAD, not otherwise specified. There is general recognition of the increased incidence of MCAD in hEDS. Mediators released from the mast cells may further stimulate microglia. Pathological activity of mast cells could be suppressed through the effect of LDN on various Toll-Like Receptors on mast cells.

### Potential neuro-immune therapeutic targets in irritable bowel syndrome [^0da22edf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mast cells

Intestinal mast cells are granulated cells located mainly in the lamina propria and the submucosa of the intestine. Mast cells can regulate permeability, secretion, peristalsis, nociception, innate and adaptive immunity. Increased numbers of mast cells have been found in IBS patients compared with healthy individuals, both in the colon and in the small bowel. In IBS, mast cell cellularity of the colonic mucosa correlates with fatigue, depression and visceral hypersensitivity. Besides the number, their activation level has also been proved increased in IBS patients. The degranulation of mast cells causes the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine, serotonin and proteases that can activate enteric neurons. In addition, studies have shown that the number of mucosal mast cells located in close proximity to enteric nerves correlates to severity and frequency of abdominal pain. In rats, mediators from IBS patients, but not controls, activated mesenteric nerves that were inhibited by histamine H 1 -receptors blockade and serine protease inactivation. Histamine is an amine produced and stored mainly by mast cells able to modulate GI motility, gastric acid production and ion secretion. Moreover, it interacts and modulates the immune system regulating cytokine production, upregulates T-helper cell (Th) 1 proliferation and downregulates Th2. Levels of histamine are increased in IBS patients compared with healthy controls, and it participates, together with tryptase and serotonin, in the activation of visceral nociceptive sensory pathways. Histamine receptors 1 (H 1 R), H 2 R and H 4 R, but not H 3 R, are expressed in the GI tract; of those, the expression of H 1 R and H 2 R have been found to be upregulated in the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients. These findings together indicate that mast cells, and especially histamine and its receptors, should be considered as relevant targets in the treatment for IBS. So far, attempts to target mast cells involve oral treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug mesalazine, which was shown initially to reduce mast cell infiltration. However, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that mesalazine is not superior to placebo in relieving abdominal pain or bloating, defecation frequency, or immune cell infiltration. More successfully, the H 1 R antagonist ebastine is a phase IV drug that has been shown to reduce symptoms and visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients. An interventional clinical trial is further evaluating its efficacy as IBS treatment (ID: NCT01908465). We previously showed that, when pretreating colonic biopsies from patients with IBS ex vivo with the mast cell stabilizer and H 1 R antagonist ketotifen, that increased bacterial translocation through IBS mucosa was inhibited, suggesting a direct role of mast cells in regulating the intestinal barrier. Ketotifen further reduced symptoms of visceral perception after oral administration to patients with IBS. Treatment with disodium cromoglycate, another mast cell stabilizer, has been tested in clinical trials, resulting in reduced mast cell activation and clinical implications such as improved symptoms in IBS-diarrhoea patients. A more novel way to target mast cells would be to aim for receptors on the surface, such as receptors for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and substance P (SP), which will be discussed further below.

### Successful treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia and mast cell activation syndromes using naltrexone, immunoglobulin and antibiotic treatment [^bbf89e5b]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A patient with severe postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) received immunotherapy with low-dose naltrexone (LDN) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and antibiotic therapy for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). A dramatic and sustained response was documented. The utility of IVIg in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases has been published, but clinical experience with POTS is relatively unknown and has not been reported in MCAS. As a short-acting mu-opioid antagonist, LDN paradoxically increases endorphins which then bind to regulatory T cells which regulate T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte production and this reduces cytokine and antibody production. IVIg is emerging as a promising therapy for POTS. Diagnosis and treatment of SIBO in POTS is a new concept and appears to play an important role.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: expert review [^0a58d553]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Care considerations for gastrointestinal (GI) disorders associated with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS)/hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) state that accumulating evidence suggests these conditions may be linked but mechanisms are not fully understood; gastroenterology providers should be aware of their features to recognize multisystemic presentations, offer informed counseling, and guide patients away from unreliable sources or fragmented care to foster therapeutic relationships and evidence-based care. Early diagnostic testing of gastric motor or anorectal functions, treatment of POTS symptoms, use of histamine receptor antagonists, and/or referral to an allergy specialist or mast cell research center may be considered in some, however the overall approach should follow general recommendations for management of DGBI and GI motility disorders. Care for patients with hEDS/HSDs who exhibit symptoms suggestive of POTS or MCAS should align with existing approaches to management of DGBI and GI motility disorders in the general population, including integrated multidisciplinary care involving multiple specialties where appropriate, and further work will be necessary to identify the biological mechanisms connecting these disorders, develop new diagnostic tools, and identify novel therapeutics such as immunotherapy to optimize care and improve long-term outcomes.

### Management of mediator symptoms, allergy, and anaphylaxis in mastocytosis [^a61f9650]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Mastocytosis is characterized by expansion and activation of clonally aberrant mast cells (MCs) in one or more organ systems. Inappropriate MC activation is a key finding in both allergy and mastocytosis; therefore, symptoms in both conditions show some degree of overlap. When mediator release is excessive and involves multiple systems, anaphylaxis may occur. In mastocytosis, the prevalence of atopy is similar to those of the general population, whereas the incidence of anaphylaxis is significantly higher. The purpose of this review is to discuss features of allergy and anaphylaxis as well as the principles of managing MC mediator release symptoms in mastocytosis.

Outcome and follow-up

After 10 IVIg treatments, a previously scheduled appointment at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale included autonomic testing which showed resolution of tachycardia with head-up tilt along with improvement in sudomotor function. At the time of submission of this report, the patient has had 20 IVIg treatments with a maximum of 5 weeks without one because the effects start to wear off. A trial of mycophenolate mofetil led to immune suppression. The next plan is to add new mast cell therapies in combination with IVIg and LDN.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^51aafb5a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis — perioperative mediator-release management and anaphylaxis workup: Management of symptoms related to mast cell mediator release depends on their severity, and the use of benzodiazepines, anti-histamines (H1 and H2 blockers), and corticosteroids is probably helpful in reducing the frequency and/or severity of symptoms; other options include fluid resuscitation, intravenous epinephrine, and discontinuation of the suspected drug or anesthetic agent. The risk of anaphylaxis in the perioperative period is estimated to be higher in patients with SM relative to the general population, and in the event of anaphylaxis or other mast cell activation event, a full allergic workup should be initiated. The workup should include skin tests or detection of specific IgE antibodies and measurement of serum tryptase level within 30 to 120 minutes of symptom onset and also after full recovery.

### Successful treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia and mast cell activation syndromes using naltrexone, immunoglobulin and antibiotic treatment [^cc4275a6]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

I feel like I won the lottery last year by discovering LDN, IVIg and SIBO treatment. LDN made me feel noticeably happier, more energetic, in less pain and with better digestion (and these things got better with each dose increase). IVIg was an absolute miracle and within a week gave me a life back, with a huge improvement of numerous symptoms, most importantly fainting, nerve pain and delayed pressure angioedema. But I still had daily crippling stomach aches and more gas than a field of Holsteins until I took the rifaximin. I can't believe I went decades feeling so bad when I only needed 2 weeks of antibiotics and a low-sulfur diet! Now I'm back to standing, eating, sleeping, working, living and feeling exceptionally lucky. I give permission to Leonard Weinstock, his associates, and any medical journals to use my uncensored photographs in medical presentations or publications.

Learning points

Patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) have a wide array of symptoms and require an open mind to entertain the diagnoses.
POTS can imitate severe gastrointestinal motility disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or frequent 'IBS' or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) relapses after antibiotic therapy.
Treatments for hyperadrenergic POTS have had limited in efficacy but treatment directed at MCAS can help.
Combined therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and low-dose naltrexone led to significant improvement in a severely affected patient.
Antibiotic therapy for SIBO contributed to clinical improvement in the case presentation and others in our practice for both GI symptoms and POTS/MCAS symptoms.

### Low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet improves colonic barrier function and mast cell activation in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: a mechanistic trial [^aaa50487]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

A diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) (LFD) is the most efficacious dietary therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the mechanisms by which FODMAPs drive IBS pathophysiology are unclear.

Methods

Patients with Rome IV diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) underwent barrier function evaluation pre- and post-LFD along with assessment of mast cell number and activation profile. Finally, fecal supernatants (FS) were administered intracolonically to wildtype mice with/without pharmacological inhibition, tlr4 -/- mice and mast cell-deficient mice with/without mast cell reconstitution.

Results

Of 42 patients, 34 responded to LFD and 8 did not. IBS-D patients had a significant improvement in colonic barrier structure and function, mast cell number, and levels of mast cell mediators post-LFD. The magnitude of physiological changes did not correlate with the magnitude of clinical response. Humanization of germ-free mice with pre-LFD feces caused barrier dysfunction while post-LFD feces did not. Similarly, pre-LFD FS caused barrier dysfunction in wildtype mice, whereas post-LFD FS did not. LPS removal and TLR4 antagonism reversed pre-LFD IBS FS-induced barrier dysfunction. Barrier dysfunction was absent in tlr4 -/- mice treated with pre-LFD FS. Similarly, pre-LFD IBS FS did not cause barrier dysfunction in wildtype mice treated with mast cell stabilizer, or in mast cell-deficient mice. However, barrier dysfunction was inducible in mast cell-deficient mice upon reconstitution with wildtype mast cells but not tlr4 -/- mast cells.

Conclusions

IBS-D patients exhibited improvement in colonic barrier dysfunction, mast cell recruitment, and activation post-LFD. FODMAP-mediated barrier dysfunction in IBS-D is mediated by direct activation of the TLR4 receptor on colonic mast cells by fecal LPS.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^8c62a592]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis associated with CMML — Patients with CMML may have systemic mastocytosis with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) with a KIT D816V mutation in neoplastic monocytes and mast cells, and may present with marked hepatosplenomegaly, mast cell activation symptoms, or cutaneous lesions with elevated serum tryptase levels; the mastocytosis may be responsive to midostaurin treatment, and each disease should be treated independently depending on its severity, being aware of drug-drug interactions. For KIT testing, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has low sensitivity for KIT D816V mutation, and allele-specific PCR is more sensitive and recommended in patients with high clinical suspicion of mast cell disease, and cKIT-directed therapy should be considered for systemic mastocytosis.

### Dysregulated brain immunity and neurotrophin signaling in Rett syndrome and autism spectrum disorders [^7fd593b9]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which occurs in about 1:15,000 females and presents with neurologic and communication defects. It is transmitted as an X-linked dominant linked to mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2), a gene transcription suppressor, but its definitive pathogenesis is unknown thus hindering development of effective treatments. Almost half of children with Rett syndrome also have behavioral symptoms consistent with those of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). PubMed was searched (2005–2014) using the terms: allergy, atopy, brain, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), cytokines, gene mutations, inflammation, mast cells (MCs), microglia, mitochondria, neurotensin (NT), neurotrophins, seizures, stress, and treatment. There are a number of intriguing differences and similarities between Rett syndrome and ASDs. Rett syndrome occurs in females, while ASDs more often in males, and the former has neurologic disabilities unlike ASDs. There is evidence of dysregulated immune system early in life in both conditions. Lack of microglial phagocytosis and decreased levels of BDNF appear to distinguish Rett syndrome from ASDs, in which there is instead microglia activation and/or proliferation and possibly defective BDNF signaling. Moreover, brain mast cell (MC) activation and focal inflammation may be more prominent in ASDs than Rett syndrome. The flavonoid luteolin blocks microglia and MC activation, provides BDNF-like activity, reverses Rett phenotype in mouse models, and has a significant benefit in children with ASDs. Appropriate formulations of luteolin or other natural molecules may be useful in the treatment of Rett syndrome.
