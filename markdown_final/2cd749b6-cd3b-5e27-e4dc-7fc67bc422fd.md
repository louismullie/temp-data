## Question

long-term treatment options pseudotumor cerebri?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about long-term treatment options for pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and the overarching treatment goals. Then, I should verify first-line disease-modifying therapy and its evidence base. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options and their limitations. After that, I need to review surgical interventions for refractory disease and compare shunting versus optic nerve sheath fenestration. I will then consider venous sinus stenting as an emerging option. Finally, I should integrate special populations, monitoring, and a practical long-term algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the condition and the clinical priorities. Pseudotumor cerebri, now termed idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure without mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or infection, typically in young women with obesity, and the two paramount long-term goals are to prevent permanent vision loss and to control disabling headaches, which often persist chronically even when vision is stabilized.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation. I should verify the disease-modifying strategy. Weight loss is the only proven disease-modifying therapy that reduces intracranial pressure and improves papilledema and headaches; a prospective study showed that a 15% weight reduction significantly lowered ICP and improved papilledema and headache, and sustained weight loss correlates with long-term remission, though achieving durable loss is challenging and often requires structured programs or bariatric strategies in selected patients [^116GXR4c] [^111FR8qo].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit and practical thresholds. Observational and interventional data consistently associate substantial weight loss with clinical improvement, and expert guidance emphasizes that even modest, sustained reductions can be meaningful, though many patients require more than 10% loss to achieve remission; this is why multidisciplinary weight management is a cornerstone of long-term care [^116GXR4c] [^111FR8qo].

> I need to check pharmacologic therapy next. Acetazolamide remains first-line to lower CSF production and improve symptoms, but tolerance is limited; in the only randomized trial, over half discontinued due to side effects, so many patients require dose adjustments or alternative agents, and topiramate is a reasonable second-line option with evidence in pediatrics and adults for improving papilledema and headaches, albeit with cognitive slowing in some patients [^114CoxkD] [^111y4ZUh].

> Let me consider surgical options for refractory cases, and I should double-check comparative outcomes. CSF shunting (lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal) provides immediate symptom relief in most patients, but long-term failure is common, with recurrence of headache in about 19% by 12 months and 48% by 36 months; ventricular shunts have lower obstruction and revision rates than LP shunts, and shunting is generally considered temporizing rather than curative, often requiring revisions over time [^111tpFC2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) had a 30% failure rate at 1 year and 45% at 3 years. Let me verify that. The failure figures I cited actually reflect worsening vision after initial stabilization in 34% at 1 year and 45% at 3 years, whereas clinical success in reducing papilledema and improving visual function occurs in roughly 80–90% initially, with a meaningful subset requiring retreatment or alternative therapy over time; ONSF is particularly useful for asymmetric papilledema or when rapid visual stabilization is needed, and it does not reliably treat headache [^111vgNLX] [^117Cwj49].

> I should confirm the role of venous sinus stenting. Many patients with IIH have transverse sinus stenosis with pressure gradients, and stenting can normalize venous pressures and improve symptoms in selected cases, but the evidence is observational, complications can occur, and long-term efficacy remains uncertain; guidelines advise caution and restrict use to specialized centers after failed maximal medical therapy, with prolonged antithrombotic therapy post-stenting [^111vgNLX] [^113QJv86].

> Next, I should review special populations and secondary causes. In pediatrics, recurrence is common and longer treatment durations are associated with fewer relapses; adrenal insufficiency can masquerade as or contribute to IIH in young children, and physiologic hydrocortisone replacement can hasten resolution in those cases; medication-induced IIH, particularly tetracyclines and retinoids, requires withdrawal of the offending agent and carries a different recurrence risk profile than idiopathic disease [^116juicW] [^114LTMmY] [^116tB7LZ].

> Let me think about pregnancy, because management nuances matter. Acetazolamide is generally avoided in the first trimester but may be used cautiously thereafter if vision is threatened, and weight management remains central; most patients can be managed conservatively with close ophthalmologic and neurologic monitoring, reserving procedures for rapid visual decline [^113xFzXL].

> I should double-check the long-term monitoring cadence. Given relapse risk, especially within 1–3 years after treatment cessation, patients require structured follow-up with serial visual acuity, visual fields, funduscopy or OCT, and symptom assessment; interdisciplinary clinics improve coordination and outcomes, and MRI signs such as empty sella and globe flattening correlate with disease severity and long-term sequelae, supporting the use of imaging to stratify risk and guide intensity of follow-up [^116juicW] [^116juicW] [^114KjvxQ].

> But wait, what if the patient has medication-induced IIH rather than idiopathic disease. I need to ensure we identify and stop culprit drugs such as tetracyclines, retinoids, growth hormone, or GnRH agonists, because removal of the trigger changes both acute management and long-term prognosis; recurrence after drug withdrawal is less common than in idiopathic IIH, though a subset later develops IIH, underscoring the need for ongoing surveillance even after the offending agent is stopped [^116tB7LZ] [^114Adwtb] [^115vhxT5] [^114QGQXP].

> Let me synthesize a practical long-term algorithm, and I will correct myself if I overgeneralize. First-line remains sustained weight loss with structured support, plus acetazolamide titrated to effect and tolerance; if acetazolamide is not tolerated or is insufficient, consider topiramate; if vision threatens to deteriorate or papilledema fails to improve, proceed to ONSF for rapid optic nerve decompression; if headache persists or recurs despite these measures, or if shunt dependence is undesirable, consider venous sinus stenting in a gradient-proven stenosis at an experienced center; throughout, maintain multidisciplinary follow-up and escalate weight-loss intensity, including bariatric evaluation for eligible patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² or those with class I obesity and refractory IIH, recognizing that surgery can be both disease-modifying and shunt-sparing in select cases [^116W5sbh] [^111FR8qo] [^114U1zi8] [^113fDMYH].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit. Long-term control of IIH hinges on disease-modifying weight loss, pharmacologic therapy with acetazolamide or topiramate as tolerated, and selective use of ONSF, CSF shunting, or venous sinus stenting for refractory visual or headache disease; recurrence is common, so durable remission requires sustained weight management and structured follow-up, with special attention to secondary causes, pediatric nuances, and pregnancy considerations [^116W5sbh] [^111FR8qo] [^116juicW].

Long-term management of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) centers on **weight loss** [^116GXR4c] and **acetazolamide** [^116W5sbh] as first-line therapy, with sustained weight reduction being the only proven disease-modifying strategy [^111FR8qo]. For refractory cases, options include topiramate [^111y4ZUh], CSF shunting (LP or VP) [^111tpFC2], optic nerve sheath fenestration [^117Cwj49], or venous sinus stenting [^111vgNLX]; shunting and ONSF are effective but carry risks of failure or revision, while stenting is promising yet still evolving [^111vgNLX]. Lifelong ophthalmologic follow-up is essential to monitor for vision loss, and multidisciplinary care improves outcomes [^111AMUX1].

## Medical management

### Weight loss

- **First-line therapy**: Weight loss is the only proven disease-modifying treatment [^111FR8qo], with a 15% reduction significantly lowering intracranial pressure and improving symptoms [^116GXR4c].
- **Sustained weight loss**: Essential for long-term remission; bariatric surgery may be considered for severe obesity or refractory cases [^111FR8qo] [^114U1zi8].
- **Pediatric considerations**: Weight management is critical; bariatric surgery may be considered in adolescents with severe obesity and refractory symptoms [^115966PR].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

- **Acetazolamide**: First-line medication [^116W5sbh]; reduces CSF production and intracranial pressure. Long-term use is common, but side effects (paresthesia, dysgeusia, fatigue) may limit tolerance [^114CoxkD].
- **Topiramate**: Alternative or adjunctive therapy [^111y4ZUh]; benefits include weight loss and headache control, though cognitive effects may limit use.
- **Other diuretics**: Furosemide or thiazides may be used cautiously if acetazolamide is not tolerated, though evidence is limited.

---

## Surgical management

Surgical options are reserved for **refractory cases** or when vision is threatened despite medical therapy [^1168FBbp].

| **Procedure** | **Indication** | **Long-term outcomes** | **Complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CSF shunting (LP or VP) | - Refractory headache <br/> - Progressive vision loss | - Effective symptom control <br/> - High revision rates (20–50%) <br/> - Infection and over/underdrainage | - Headache <br/> - Infection <br/> - Shunt failure <br/> - Low-pressure headaches [^111tpFC2] |
| Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) | - Progressive vision loss <br/> - Papilledema | - Vision stabilization/improvement in 80–90% <br/> - Headache may persist <br/> - 30% failure requiring repeat surgery | - Diplopia <br/> - Hemorrhage <br/> - Infection [^117Cwj49] |
| Venous sinus stenting | - Refractory cases with venous sinus stenosis | - Promising results <br/> - 85% symptom improvement <br/> - 10–15% restenosis | - Stent thrombosis <br/> - Migration <br/> - Long-term antiplatelet therapy required [^111vgNLX] |

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **endovascular venous sinus stenting**, which shows promise for refractory IIH with venous stenosis but requires further long-term data [^111vgNLX], and **novel pharmacologic agents** targeting CSF production or venous dynamics, which are under investigation.

---

## Long-term monitoring and follow-up

Regular ophthalmologic assessments are essential to detect and manage **vision loss** [^116W5sbh]. Multidisciplinary care involving neurology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and endocrinology improves outcomes [^111AMUX1]. Patient education on adherence, weight management, and symptom recognition is critical for long-term success [^111FR8qo].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is generally favorable with treatment, but **recurrence is common** (20–50%), especially with weight regain or medication nonadherence [^116juicW]. Permanent vision loss can occur if untreated or undertreated, underscoring the need for sustained therapy and follow-up [^1168FBbp].

---

Long-term management of pseudotumor cerebri requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^111AMUX1] centered on weight loss and acetazolamide, with escalation to surgery or stenting for refractory cases. Lifelong ophthalmologic follow-up is essential to prevent vision loss, and emerging therapies may expand options for refractory disease.

Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is an uncommon disorder in the pediatric population. It is not a benign condition. It can cause permanent vision loss. The most recently recognized risk factor for this disorder is recombinant human growth hormone (GH) therapy. Data from Genentech's National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS), a postmarketing surveillance program, are analyzed to examine the relationship between GH therapy and PTC. Several areas are addressed, including plausibility, probability, clinical and laboratory presentations, management, clinical outcome, present state of knowledge, and future recommendations.

### Cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement for pseudotumor cerebri-associated intractable headache: predictors of treatment response and an analysis of long-term outcomes [^111tpFC2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts effectively reverse symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri postoperatively, but long-term outcome has not been investigated. Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts are the mainstay of CSF shunts for pseudotumor cerebri; however, image-guided stereotaxy and neuroendoscopy now allow effective placement of a ventricular catheter without causing ventriculomegaly in these cases. To date it remains unknown if CSF shunts provide long-term relief from pseudotumor cerebri and whether a ventricular shunt is better than an LP shunt. The authors investigated these possibilities.

Methods

The authors reviewed the records of all shunt placement procedures that were performed for intractable headache due to pseudotumor cerebri at one institution between 1973 and 2003. Using proportional hazards regression analysis, predictors of treatment failure (continued headache despite a properly functioning shunt) were assessed, and shunt revision and complication rates were compared between LP and ventricular (ventriculoperitoneal [VP] or ventriculoatrial [VAT]) shunts. Forty-two patients underwent 115 shunt placement procedures: 79 in which an LP shunt was used and 36 in which a VP or VAT shunt was used. Forty patients (95%) experienced a significant improvement in their headaches immediately after the shunt was inserted. Severe headache recurred despite a properly functioning shunt in eight (19%) and 20 (48%) patients by 12 and 36 months, respectively, after the initial shunt placement surgery. Seventeen patients without papilledema and 19 patients in whom preoperative symptoms had occurred for longer than 2 years experienced recurrent headache, making patients with papilledema or long-term symptoms fivefold (relative risk [RR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–17.8; p < 0.01) or 2.5-fold (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.01–9.39; p = 0.05) more likely to experience headache recurrence, respectively. In contrast to VP or VAT shunts, LP shunts were associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of shunt revision (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5–4.3; p < 0.001) due to a threefold increased risk of shunt obstruction (RR 3, 95% CI 1.5–5.7; p < 0.005), but there were similar risks between the two types of shunts for overdrainage (RR 2.3, 95% CI 0.8–7.9; p = 0.22), distal catheter migration (RR 2.1, 95% CI 0.3–19.3; p = 0.55), and shunt infection (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.3–13.2; p = 0.75).

Conclusions

Based on their 30-year experience in the treatment of these patients, the authors found that CSF shunts were extremely effective in the acute treatment of pseudotumor cerebri-associated intractable headache, providing long-term relief in the majority of patients. Lack of papilledema and long-standing symptoms were risk factors for treatment failure. The use of ventricular shunts for pseudotumor cerebri was associated with a lower risk of shunt obstruction and revision than the use of LP shunts. Using ventricular shunts in patients with papilledema or symptoms lasting less than 2 years should be considered for those with pseudotumor cerebri-associated intractable headache.

### Current concepts in pseudotumor cerebri [^117KiWeV]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a potentially blinding disorder of unknown cause, characterized by elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion, venous sinus thrombosis, or meningitis. This review summarizes recent developments and insights from leading treatment trials, emerging treatment options, and evolving ways to evaluate IIH.

Recent Findings

The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial is the first large-scale, randomized, prospective study to evaluate medical treatment of patients with mild vision loss. These data have facilitated our understanding of baseline clinical manifestations, including impact on quality of life and treatment outcomes. Recent hypotheses and studies evaluating the role of cerebral venous sinus stenosis and stenting are discussed. Technological advances in optical coherence tomography are emerging to provide novel ways of evaluating and tracking optic disc swelling in IIH.

Summary

Recent changes in defining IIH, understanding the impact and treatment of mild visual loss, and the roles that cerebral venous stenting and optical coherence tomography might have in clinical practice provide the framework to better treat patients with IIH.

### Long-term follow-up of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in prepubertal children, adolescents, and adults [^116juicW]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome can have a recurrent course. We compared the long-term disease course, recurrences, and final visual outcomes in prepubertal children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, patients were divided into prepubertal children (group A) adolescents (group B), and adults (group C).

Results

Sixty-five patients (56 females, nine males) were included, 26.2% in group A, 24.6% in group B, and 49.2% in group C. Age at diagnosis was 8.6 ± 2.0 years, 14.3 ± 1.5 years, and 31.9 ± 9.7 years for the prepubertal children, adolescents, and adults, respectively. Medical treatment duration was similar (2.4 to 3.3 years, P > 0.05). Recurrences were observed in 23.5% of prepubertal children, 50% of adolescents, and 28.1% of adults. Recurrences occurred within 1.3 ± 0.6 years from treatment cessation in the prepubertal group compared with 3.8 ± 5.1 years in adolescents and 2.7 ± 2.0 years in adults (P = 0.267). Optic neuropathy was evident in 41% of group A, 31% of group B, and 87.5% of group C (P < 0.001). Obesity and cerebrospinal fluid opening pressures were unassociated with either relapsing rates or final visual outcomes in all groups.

Conclusions

Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome exhibits a relapsing course in a third of cases. Recurrences tend to occur within one year after treatment cessation in prepubertal children, and within three years in older patients, revealing the importance of longer follow-up, especially in adults. Optic neuropathy was more common in adults along with a tendency for visual decline. Longer treatment times were associated with fewer recurrences.

### Assessment of pediatric pseudotumor cerebri clinical characteristics and outcomes [^111sfmd4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a relatively uncommon disorder of unknown pathophysiology. Although pseudotumor cerebri occurs in both children and adults, the pseudotumor cerebri literature is heavily dominated by adult studies. The aim of this study is to retrospectively describe the clinical presentation, imaging, treatment, and outcomes of a large pediatric pseudotumor cerebri population over a 23-year period. We also discuss secondary pseudotumor cerebri (44%) as well as the increasingly recognized patient subgroups without headache (13.3%) and without papilledema (7.3%). Female sex, obesity, and initial symptoms were consistent with the literature; however radiographic findings were surprisingly low in this cohort. Headache outcomes at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following initial lumbar puncture/treatment and visual function outcomes are reported.

### 2022 American society of metabolic and bariatric surgery (ASMBS) and international federation for the surgery of obesity and metabolic disorders (IFSO) indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery [^114U1zi8]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, randomized trials designed specifically to study the population with BMI < 35 kg/m² also demonstrate significant benefits of MBS in individuals with class I obesity compared with other treatment. O'Brien et al. in a randomized controlled trial of 80 patients with BMI 30–35 kg/m² assigned to nonsurgical treatment or MBS, demonstrated that patients undergoing MBS had superior long-term weight reduction and improvement of metabolic disease. A short-term follow-up randomized trial examining patients with T2D demonstrated significantly improved remission of diabetes and weight loss in those individuals undergoing MBS compared with medical weight management. In a study of 51 patients with class I obesity diabetes randomized to either medical therapy or medical therapy plus MBS, the cohort who underwent surgery has superior diabetes control up to 2 years postoperatively.

Medical weight loss is considered to have greater durability in individuals with BMI < 35 kg/m² than individuals with BMI > 35 kg/m², and thus it is recommended that a trial of nonsurgical therapy is attempted before considering surgical treatment. However, if attempts at treating obesity and obesity-related co-morbidities such as T2D, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease (e.g. coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation), asthma, fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, chronic kidney disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pseudotumor cerebri, and bone and joint diseases have not been effective, MBS should be considered for suitable individuals with class I obesity.

BMI > 35 kg/m². Given the presence of high-quality scientific data on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of MBS in improving survival and quality of life in patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², MBS should be strongly recommended in these patients regardless of presence or absence of evident obesity-related co-morbidities. Current nonsurgical treatment options for patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² are ineffective in achieving a substantial and sustained weight reduction necessary to significantly improve their general health. Physical problems related to excess body weight, undiagnosed obesity-related co-morbidities, risk of developing obesity-related co-morbidities in the future, and impaired quality of life related to physical and mental consequences of obesity threaten the general health of individuals with moderate to severe obesity even in the absence of diagnosed obesity-related co-morbidities. Thus, MBS is recommended in this population.

### Pseudotumor cerebri induced by all-trans retinoic acid treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia… [^111gXV5t]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Normally, the RAR gene encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors. After binding retinoic acid, the retinoic acid receptor can promote expression of a variety of genes. However, in APML, the PML/RAR fusion protein tends to suppress gene transcription and blocks differentiation of the promyelocytes. Treatment with the RAR ligand, all-trans retinoic acid, relieves the block and promotes differentiation and is associated with an 80% complete remission rate. This report describes the occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri induced by ATRA treatment of APML. Report of a Case A 30-year-old man with APML being treated with ATRA had had headaches and diplopia within 2 weeks of the initiation of ATRA treatment. Examination disclosed a visual acuity of 20/15 OU, a left abducens palsy, and a blood pressure of 120/92 mmHg. The fundus picture is shown in Figure 1. The right fundus was similar in appearance. Spontaneous venous pulsations were absent.

Treatment with ATRA was discontinued, and the APML was treated with a combination of arsenic trioxide, daunorubicin hydrochloride, and cytosine arabinoside. Over the next 6 weeks, subsequent to and corresponding with the discontinuation of ATRA therapy, the headache, papilledema, and abducens palsy resolved. Treatment with arsenic trioxide, daunorubicin, and cytosine arabinoside was continued for 3 months, and the patient has remained in remission. Comment The differential diagnosis in this case included meningeal invasion of APML cells that then caused increased intracranial pressure and bacterial meningitis in an immunocompromised patient. Pseudotumor cerebri was diagnosed. Abducens palsy and papilledema reversed following discontinuance of treatment with ATRA.

In this patient, papilledema was secondary to pseudotumor cerebri induced by treatment with ATRA. Retinoic acid is an oxidized form of retinol.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111A5ZWC]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumour cerebri is primarily a disorder of young obese women characterised by symptoms and signs associated with raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a space-occupying lesion or other identifiable cause.

Summary

The overall incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is approximately two per 100,000, but is considerably higher among obese individuals and, given the global obesity epidemic, is likely to rise further. The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly understood, but most theories focus on the presence of intracranial venous hypertension and/or increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and how this relates to obesity. A lack of randomised clinical trials has resulted in unsatisfactory treatment guidelines and although weight loss is important, especially when used in conjunction with drugs that reduce cerebrospinal fluid production, resistant cases remain difficult to manage and patients invariably undergo neurosurgical shunting procedures. The use of transverse cerebral sinus stenting remains contentious and long-term benefits are yet to be determined.

Conclusion

An understanding of the clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic options available for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is important both for neurologists and ophthalmologists as visual loss maybe permanent if untreated.

### Best practice updates for pediatric / adolescent weight loss surgery [^115966PR]. Obesity (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to update evidence-based best practice guidelines for pediatric/adolescent weight loss surgery (WLS). We performed a systematic search of English-language literature on WLS and pediatric, adolescent, gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric banding, and extreme obesity published between April 2004 and May 2007 in PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. Keywords were used to narrow the search for a selective review of abstracts, retrieval of full articles, and grading of evidence according to systems used in established evidence-based models. In light of evidence on the natural history of obesity and on outcomes of WLS in adolescents, guidelines for surgical treatment of obesity in this age group need to be updated. We recommend modification of selection criteria to include adolescents with BMI ≥ 35 and specific obesity-related comorbidities for which there is clear evidence of important short-term morbidity (i.e., type 2 diabetes, severe steatohepatitis, pseudotumor cerebri, and moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea). In addition, WLS should be considered for adolescents with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40) and other comorbidities associated with long-term risks. We identified > 1,085 papers; 186 of the most relevant were reviewed in detail. Regular updates of evidence-based recommendations for best practices in pediatric/adolescent WLS are required to address advances in technology and the growing evidence base in pediatric WLS. Key considerations in patient safety include carefully designed criteria for patient selection, multidisciplinary evaluation, choice of appropriate procedure, thorough screening and management of comorbidities, optimization of long-term compliance, and age-appropriate fully informed consent.

### Secondary pseudotumor cerebri in pediatric oncology and hematology: an unpredictable condition of varying etiology [^1159tnNa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Secondary pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) in pediatric oncology and hematology is an unpredictable and under-recognized condition. It is characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of more than 25 cm H₂O in the absence of underlying structural causes. Numerous conditions and medications have been implicated in the etiology of secondary PTC. Patients may suffer from incapacitating headaches and permanent visual loss, if they are not managed properly. We retrospectively analyzed the records of eight children, diagnosed with secondary PTC with an underlying hematological or oncological disease. Our study highlights the clinical features, contributing factors, and treatment options of this syndrome in children.

Introduction

Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS), also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or underlying infection or inflammation; it is often associated with weight gain, especially in young women of childbearing age. Optic nerve swelling (papilledema) is the clinical hallmark of PTCS and can lead to irreversible vision loss if untreated. Headache, transient visual obscurations, double vision, and pulsatile tinnitus are also common symptoms. The majority of patients with PTCS are effectively treated with oral acetazolamide and weight loss. However, surgical treatment with optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting is sometimes performed for patients with severe or refractory cases. In an ONSF, a temporary surgical opening in the dural sheath that surrounds the optic nerve is created, thereby releasing the local pressure responsible for papilledema and vision loss. In a shunting procedure, an indwelling catheter is placed to provide continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from the lateral ventricle or lumbar subarachnoid space to the peritoneal cavity, which lowers intracranial pressure and relieves headache, papilledema, and other symptoms.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^114CoxkD]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Conservative management

Weight loss

Some patients volunteer recent weight gain before presentation, others do not, but weight loss is currently the only proven disease-modifying treatment for all overweight patients. Our recent prospective study highlighted that a 15% reduction of body weight, using a low calorie meal replacement liquid diet for 3 months, significantly reduced intracranial pressure, papilloedema and headaches. However, strategies to achieve long-term significant weight loss are notoriously difficult with typically as little as 2–4 kg of weight loss maintained at 2 years irrespective of the diet followed. Many case reports describe the benefits of bariatric surgery in IIH. We are currently recruiting to a randomised controlled trial comparing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the most effective community weight loss programmeversus bariatric surgery.

Pharmacological management

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can provide symptomatic relief of raised intracranial pressure, although there is no evidence to support their benefit. Additionally, in the only randomised controlled trial looking at acetazolamide, over half the patients in the acetazolamide arm stopped treatment due to side effects. This aligns with our clinical experience that many cannot tolerate it. For these reasons, we manage many of our patients with active IIH without acetazolamide. The maximum dose is up to 2 g/daily; in our experience, up to 1 g daily is adequate, depending on body weight. If we do prescribe acetazolamide, we use the modified release preparation to reduce side effects.

Managing venous stenoses

Many patients with pseudotumour cerebri have venous sinus stenosis (narrowing), particularly of the transverse sinuses, reflecting elevated intracranial pressure. Several research centres are now evaluating the therapeutic potential of stenting the transverse sinus in IIH. There is growing consensus that the stents do not treat the underlying cause of IIH. Reducing intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture can resolve the stenoses. Stenting the stenoses may, however, improve IIH by increasing CSF drainage at the arachnoid granulations, thereby lowering intracranial pressure and improving the signs and symptoms of IIH. Serious complication of the procedure (venous sinus perforation, stent migration, in-stent thrombosis, subdural haemorrhage and the development of recurrent stenoses immediately proximal to the stent) suggest the need for caution with this approach. We need larger long-term randomised clinical trials to evaluate this treatment before it can become routine clinical practice.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a comprehensive overview [^111pqmwR]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also called pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, is a disorder defined as elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in most cases, and all other forms of elevated ICP must be ruled out. With its increasing prevalence, it is much more likely for physicians, otolaryngologists included, to encounter this condition. It is important to have a clear understanding of the typical and atypical presentation of this disease, along with its evaluative workup and management options. This article reviews IIH with a focus on those factors that are specifically relevant to otolaryngologic care.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1124zduJ]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The history, diagnosis, and therapy of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (pseudotumor cerebri) are reviewed. Theories of pathogenesis are considered, the clinical presentation is described, and potential diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are explored.

Methods

An extensive literature review of IIH and related conditions (secondary pseudotumor syndromes) was performed. The history of and rationale for the diagnosis and medical and surgical approaches to treatment are reviewed. Available outcome studies are presented.

Results

Diagnosis of IIH requires that the modified Dandy criteria be satisfied. Multiple potential contributing causes of intracranial hypertension must be identified or excluded. The clinical presentation most often includes headaches and papilledema, but many other findings have been described. The most important goal of therapy is to prevent or arrest progressive visual loss. Medical therapies include alleviation of associated systemic diseases, discontinuation of contributing medications, provision of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and weight loss. Surgical therapies include lumboperitoneal shunting, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration. On the basis of the advantages and disadvantages of these treatment modalities, a suggested treatment paradigm is presented.

Conclusion

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the term to be adopted instead of pseudotumor cerebri. IIH remains an enigmatic diagnosis of exclusion. However, prompt diagnosis and thorough evaluation and treatment are crucial for preventing visual loss and improving associated symptoms.

### Clinical resolution of severely symptomatic pseudotumor cerebri after gastric bypass in an adolescent [^1149n76v]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri is a disease characterized by increased intracranial pressure, often manifested by headaches, and occasionally leading to severe visual impairment or even blindness. Most cases in adolescents, as in adults, are associated with obesity. We report a 16-year-old morbidly obese adolescent girl (body mass index 42.3 kg/m²) with severely symptomatic pseudotumor cerebri who had progressive visual field deficits and elevated intracranial pressure (opening pressure on lumbar puncture of 50 cm H₂O) despite intensive medical management and placement of both ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts. Six months after she underwent gastric bypass surgery, she had lost 43% of her excess body weight and had had near complete regression of her visual field deficits, along with normalization of her intracranial pressures. This case demonstrates the dramatic reversal of symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri with surgically induced weight loss. Gastric bypass should be considered as a treatment option for adolescents with severe and progressive pseudotumor cerebri.

### Isotretinoin (sotret) [^114Adwtb]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor Cerebri

Isotretinoin capsule use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue Sotret immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological).

Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Sotret should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, hormones, and 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases [^116upq8K]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), previously known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is a disabling condition of predominantly young, obese women of childbearing age. The condition results in raised ICP, of no known cause, resulting in visual loss, headaches, and papilledema. IIH without papilledema can also occur but is rare and not the focus of this review.

IIH affects 0.5–2 per 100,000 annually in the general population, but increases to 12–20 per 100,000 for obese women of reproductive age.–Female sex and obesity are strongly associated with the condition. In a cohort of 721 IIH patients, 91% were reported as femalewith 70%–88% being obese.

A diagnosis of IIH is made using the updated modified Dandy criteria. This is based on the presence of papilledema, with an absence of secondary causes and raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure > 25 cm CSF, measured by lumbar puncture in the lateral decubitus. The current management options for the condition are limited and include disease modification to promote weight loss and acetazolamide, but other diuretics may also be used. Surgical management varies although it mainly involves CSF shunting or sometimes optic nerve sheath fenestration and remains reserved for rapid or progressive loss of vision. Venous sinus stenting is used in some specialist centers although long-term efficacy data are awaited.

The etiology of this debilitating condition remains undetermined. Dysregulation of CSF dynamics is key and may involve hypersecretion of CSF at the choroid plexus, reduced drainage at the arachnoid granulations and/or lymphatics, and aberrant venous pressure gradients. It is unlikely that a single anatomical location for CSF dysregulation is exclusively responsible for the raised ICP in IIH, and multiple sites and mechanisms may be involved in impairing ICP homeostasis. As > 70% of patients with the condition are obese, adiposity is felt to have a causative role in IIH, but the mechanisms by which obesity predisposes to the condition have not been fully elucidated.

Human fat is an active endocrine tissue, secreting a myriad of neuroendocrine molecules that could potentially play a role in IIH. Given the very strong female preponderance, steroid hormones are also likely to be involved.

This review provides an overview of the potential role of hormones, adipokines, and cytokines in IIH and describes new potential pathogenic mechanisms in this disease.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in adults and children [^116rKBEj]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) may be primary (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) or arise from an identifiable secondary cause. Characterization of typical neuroimaging abnormalities, clarification of normal opening pressure in children, and features distinguishing the syndrome of intracranial hypertension without papilledema from intracranial hypertension with papilledema have furthered our understanding of this disorder. We propose updated diagnostic criteria for PTCS to incorporate advances and insights into the disorder realized over the past 10 years.

### Pseudotumor cerebri after surgical remission of Cushing's disease [^116CJNSf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Pseudotumor cerebri has only been described after successful surgery for Cushing's disease (CD) in case reports. We sought to establish the incidence and timing of its occurrence, identify predisposing factors, characterize the clinical presentations and their severity, and examine the effects of treatment in patients who underwent surgery for CD.

Setting

This study was conducted at two tertiary care centers: The University of Virginia and the National Institutes of Health.

Patients

We conducted a retrospective review of 941 surgeries for CD (723 adults, 218 children) to identify patients who developed pseudotumor cerebri after surgery for CD and examine the associated clinical features.

Results

Seven children (four males, three females; 3%), but no adults, developed pseudotumor cerebri postoperatively. All underwent resection of an ACTH-secreting adenoma, and postoperative serum cortisol reached a nadir of less than 2 microg/dl. After surgery, all were placed on tapering hydrocortisone replacement therapy. Within 3–52 wk, all seven patients experienced symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri and had ophthalmological examination demonstrating papilledema. One patient had diplopia from a unilateral VIth nerve palsy. Six patients were still on steroid replacement at onset of symptoms. In three patients, a lumbar puncture demonstrated elevated opening pressure. Four patients were treated successfully with a lumbar puncture, steroids, and/or Diamox. Three patients did not receive treatment, and their symptoms resolved over several months. There was no correlation between the degree of hypercortisolism (24-h urinary free cortisol) before surgery and the likelihood of developing pseudotumor cerebri after surgery (P < 0.23).

Conclusions

This series demonstrates a 3% occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri in children after successful surgery for CD, but the absence of the syndrome in adults. Pseudotumor cerebri manifests itself within 1 yr of surgery, often while patients are still undergoing replacement steroid therapy. A patient exhibiting signs of intracranial hypertension after surgery for CD should undergo an evaluation for pseudotumor cerebri. Recognition of the symptoms and treatment should correct and/or prevent ophthalmological sequelae.

### Efficacy and side effects of topiramate in treatment of children with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome [^111y4ZUh]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Topiramate is often considered as a second-line medication for the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS), but limited studies exist that evaluate its efficacy in children.

Methods

Retrospective study of patients aged < 21 years with PTCS who were treated with topiramate alone or in combination with acetazolamide was performed. Data regarding clinical courses and visual outcomes were recorded.

Results

A total of 46 patients were identified. Three (6.5%) patients were treated with topiramate alone, 31 (67.4%) transitioned to topiramate from acetazolamide, and 12 (26.1%) took both topiramate and acetazolamide concurrently. The median time to resolution of papilledema on topiramate was 0.57 years (interquartile range 0.32 to 0.84). Among eyes with papilledema graded on the Frisen scale at topiramate initiation, 40 of 57 (70.2%) were grade 1, nine of 57 (15.8%) were grade 2, and eight of 57 (14.0%) were grade 3. Twenty-seven of 46 (58.7%) reported headache improvement after starting topiramate. The mean dose of topiramate was 1.3 ± 0.8 mg/kg/day. The most common side effect was patient report of cognitive slowing (10 of 46 [21.7%]). All patients on topiramate monotherapy who were compliant with treatment and follow-up had resolution of papilledema with no evidence of visual function loss.

Conclusions

Topiramate can effectively treat PTCS in children with mild to moderate papilledema or in those unable to tolerate acetazolamide. More research is needed to assess the efficacy of topiramate for higher grade papilledema.

### Pediatric obesity-long-term consequences and effect of weight loss [^111b4xFi]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Depression and anxiety

The association between pediatric obesity and psychiatric problems, such as depression and anxiety, is complex since neurodevelopmental disorders and low SES are known risk factors for anxiety and depression and prevalent in the pediatric obesity population. Nevertheless, there is an increasing body of literature supporting the link between obesity and depression. The results are mixed, and the link seems to be bidirectional. Hence, obesity increases the risk for depression and vice versa. Successful obesity treatment has been associated with lower risk of depression, but not anxiety, in males but not females. However, long term follow‐up of adolescents after bariatric surgery indicates that, despite good short‐term effects, the positive effects of weight loss on depression and anxiety are very limited. These results indicate that depression and anxiety, at least among adolescents with severe obesity, are associated with but not caused by obesity.

In conclusion, obesity in childhood affects the likelihood to reach the same level of education as that for their normal‐weighted peers. Despite that, the full mechanisms of the mediating factors for this are yet to be determined and the association seems to be partly reversible by weight reduction. Further, it is important to identify children with altered executive functions since ADHD/ADD is common in the obesity population. An attention deficit disorder can worsen the obesity‐related psychosocial consequences and increase the risk for stigmatization. Further, depression is prevalent in the pediatric obesity population and needs to be addressed to enable realistic conditions for obesity treatment.

Pseudotumor cerebri

Pseudotumor cerebri, also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension or benign intracranial hypertension, is a neurologic syndrome consisting of headache caused by elevated intracranial pressure. Severe cases may also have signs of vision loss and cranial nerve symptoms, which can be permanent. When it occurs, it is often present together with obesity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The diagnosis is often delayed as the initial symptom, headache, occurs frequently among individuals with obesity. A substantial weight loss — 10% or more — is an effective treatment.

### SAGES guideline for clinical application of laparoscopic bariatric surgery [^1157rewe]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction and rationale for surgery — The United States of America has experienced a steady rise in obesity prevalence over the last 20 years; at the turn of the millennium, nearly two-thirds of Americans were overweight or obese, and almost 5% were morbidly obese. Morbid obesity predisposes to comorbid diseases affecting nearly every organ system, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypoventilation syndrome, asthma, sleep apnea, stroke, pseudotumor cerebri, arthritis, several types of cancers, urinary incontinence, gallbladder disease, and depression. Obesity shortens life expectancy, with increasing body mass index (BMI) resulting in proportionally shorter lifespan, and with over 300,000 victims in the USA each year, morbid obesity is projected to overtake smoking as the leading cause of death in the near future. There are now more than nine million morbidly obese Americans who need help, and nonoperative management with diet, exercise, behavior modification, and medications rarely achieves adequate durable weight loss. Four long-term studies of nonoperative management of obesity showed an average weight loss of only 4%.

### Doxyclycline hyclate (doxycycline hyclate) [^111Rtvk5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline hyclate. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline hyclate should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

5.7 Antianabolic Action

The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.

5.8 Incomplete Suppression of Malaria

Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains.

Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum 's sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.

5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing doxycycline hyclate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

5.10 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth

Doxycycline hyclate may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.

5.11 Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy

In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.

### Isotretinoin (Amnesteem) [^111nt7Vh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pseudotumor Cerebri

Amnesteem use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue Amnesteem immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological).

Serious Skin Reactions

There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization, or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions, and discontinuation of Amnesteem should be considered if warranted.

Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Amnesteem should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur.

Methods: The data of the patients who were followed up in Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Rheumatology was retrospectively analyzed. The study included 52 patients. Gender, age at the time of diagnosis, time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, follow-up period, presence of Behçet's disease in first-degree relatives, system involvement, HLA-B51 positivity, skin pathergy test positivity, laboratory tests and treatment options were evaluated. In terms of prognosis, variables such as response to treatment at 6 months, response to treatment at 12 months, complete remission with drug treatment, partial remission, treatment-resistant disease and mortality were analyzed.

Results: 55.8% of the patients were female and the average age of onset of the disease was 11 years. The median time from disease onset to diagnosis was 11 months. 26.9% of the patients had a history of Behçet's disease in their first-degree relatives. HLA-B51 test was positive in 50% of the patients, and pathergy test was positive in 18.1%. While pseudotumor cerebri was observed in 24% of patients with a positive HLA-B51 test, pseudotumor cerebri was not observed in any of the HLA-B51 negative patients. It was determined that all patients used colchicine, and the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs were corticosteroids and azathioprine. The average follow-up period of the study group was 40.5 months. It was determined that 71.2% of the patients responded to the treatment completely or partially in the 6th month of treatment and 80.8% in the 12th month. At the end of the follow-up, it was determined that 26.1% of the patients were in complete remission and drug-free, and 73.9% were in complete or partial remission but continued drug treatment. It was determined that those who responded to treatment in the first six months were more likely to achieve complete remission.

### Clinical review: the surgical treatment of idiopathic pseudotumour cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) [^115vyuHB]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

To review the literature on the surgical treatment of idiopathic pseudotumour cerebri (PTC) [idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)]. When medical therapy fails or when visual dysfunction deteriorates, surgical therapies for PTC should be considered. The main procedures performed include lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF). Recently, venous sinus stenting procedures have been performed on selected patients with PTC, especially those with venous sinus occlusive disease. The literature is summarized and appraised in the form of a narrative review. It is evident that ONSF, LPS, VPS and, in selected cases, venous sinus stenting may improve vision and prevent deterioration of vision in patients with PTC. All of the procedures have their advantages and disadvantages and may fail with time no matter what procedure is used. Various authorities have vehemently advocated one or the other of these procedures. Until a prospective, randomized study comparing ONSF with LPS or VPS for PTC is performed, and until the role of venous sinus obstruction as the aetiology of PTC is better defined, the question of which surgical procedure is best for the treatment of PTC remains unanswered.

Acitretin adverse effects and hepatic concerns — key safety findings include that elevation in transaminases is seen in 13% to 16% of patients and, when major increases in liver function test results do occur, this could suggest acitretin-induced toxic hepatitis and requires prompt discontinuation. Other less common adverse effects include pseudotumor cerebri-like symptoms, mood changes, decreased night and color vision, and minor myalgia/arthralgia; diffuse idiopathic hyperostosis is a rarely reported adverse effect of systemic retinoids and in some cases may be severe and debilitating. Whether acitretin causes osteoporosis is controversial, the risk appears highest with long-term, high-dose retinoids, and systemic retinoids may cause premature epiphyseal growth plate closure in young patients.

Rare incidences of pseudotumor cerebri in young patients taking concomitant tetracyclines for acne have been noted, and other neurologic side effects include tremor, asthenia, and fatigue; psychiatric side effects have also been reported. Patients with a history of seizures should be made aware that CSA can lower the seizure threshold. Pulmonary and respiratory symptoms including cough, rhinitis, and dyspnea occur in about 5% of patients, and gastrointestinal side effects include abdominal pain, which may resolve after a few days, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### Minocycline hydrochloride [^115AjoV9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension

Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes

Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately.

5.8 Photosensitivity

Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician.

### Tetracycline hydrochloride [^111G5Ef3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including Achromycin V. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and tetracycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

Skeletal Development

All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.

Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Tetracycline drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.

Antianabolic Action

The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.

Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy

In long-term therapy, perform periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and, if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1138Umn5]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a disorder of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) that typically affects women of reproductive age. Although the cause of IIH is poorly understood, the condition is inextricably linked with obesity and metabolic dysregulation, evidenced by the increasing prevalence of IIH in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. The classic presentation of IIH with headache and papilledema, remains substantially unchanged from Walter Dandy's original description of the condition in 1937. However, it is increasingly recognized that IIH can manifest with other symptoms and signs. This review will explore the expanding clinical spectrum of IIH, focusing on the insights they provide regarding the pathophysiology of IIH and implications for their management.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114RvRVj]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) — risk, symptoms, evaluation, and vigilance in youth with obesity: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (previously known as pseudotumor cerebri) is a neurologic condition with serious long-term morbidity. It occurs most often in females of childbearing age, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. In a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the incidence of IIH among adult females aged 15 to 44 years with obesity was 3.5-fold higher than that of all females in that age group. Typical symptoms are persistent headaches, pulsatile synchronous tinnitus, and visual changes or loss, although the history can be variable. Physical examination includes a fundoscopy for papilledema and a thorough neurologic evaluation for cranial nerve deficits such as sixth nerve palsy. The serious sequelae for IIH is vision loss. Thus, a review of system should be obtained to evaluate any child with obesity who has significant or progressive headaches. There should also be a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset headaches and significant weight gain (5% to 15% of body weight), particularly when it occurs in the prior 12 to 18 months. Initial evaluation for IIH involves conducting comprehensive evaluation by the neurologist and ophthalmologist or at an integrated IIH clinic. Consensus recommendation: Maintain a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset or progressive headaches in the context of significant weight gain, especially for females.

### Long-tunnelled external ventricular drain as a long-term treatment option for hydrocephalus in a child with an unresectable low-grade supratentorial tumor: case report [^11599sML]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The authors report a case of a child with hypothalamic-origin pilocytic astrocytoma and hydrocephalus, which was refractory to treatment with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to high CSF protein content. With parental education, the child's hydrocephalus was managed long-term in the community with a long-tunnelled external ventricular drain, which was maintained by his parents. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of this management option as a long-term measure. No harm has come to the patient. The authors propose long-term, long-tunnelled external ventricular drain as a viable treatment option for such patients.

### Patterns of retinal damage and visual long-term consequences in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^11426GG1]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient Cohort

This prospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with clinically suspected IIH at 2 tertiary headache centers in Denmark (Odense University Hospital [OUH] and the Danish Headache Center, Copenhagen University Hospital-Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, from January 2018 to September 2022). Clinical suspicion of IIH was based on objective findings (papilledema, abducens nerve palsy), symptoms (visual disturbances, headache, pulsatile tinnitus), and phenotype (young women with obesity). Patients had to be 18 years or older and were able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria were missing data that impeded diagnosis, optic disc edema for reasons other than elevated ICP, pseudopapilledema, and elevated LPOP without papilledema due to other diseases. The diagnostic workup was standardized at both centers and included a structured interview, neurologic and ophthalmologic investigation, lumbar puncture, radiologic diagnostics, routine blood samples, and electrocardiography.

According to the 2013 diagnostic criteria, patients were classified as definite IIH, probable IIH, and definite IIH without papilledema (IIHWOP), suggested IIHWOP (IIH hereafter), or "without IIH" if not fulfilling the criteria (in "Diagnosis of IIH" further down in the "Methods" section). Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) was diagnosed in patients in whom a recognized condition known to induce intracranial hypertension and papilledema was found. Patients with secondary PTCS were excluded.

In this study, we included only patients with IIH. Participants were investigated longitudinally from baseline to ophthalmologic remission (mentioned in "Definitions of Baseline, Remission, and IIH Severity" further down in the "Methods" section). If tolerated, patients were treated with acetazolamide from baseline until they achieved ophthalmologic remission. The daily acetazolamide dose was adjusted according to IIH severity and side effects.

Parts of this cohort are published elsewhereand were used to develop an evidence-based update of the diagnostic criteria.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Southern Denmark (VEK S-20170058) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (nos. 16/20512, June 6, 2016, and April 7, 2017). Data are reported in line with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendationsand adherent to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent.

### Coronavirus infections in the nervous system of children: a scoping review making the case for long-term neurodevelopmental surveillance [^112uj6iz]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to describe the case literature of human coronavirus infections in the nervous system of children, including from SARS-CoV-2, and to provide guidance to pediatric providers for managing the potential long-term effects on neurodevelopment of human coronavirus infections in the nervous system.

Methods

Using a structured strategy, the PubMed and Ovid:Embase databases were queried for articles about the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of coronavirus infections in the nervous system of children and young adults, aged 0 to 24 years.

Results

Of 2302 articles reviewed, 31 described SARS-CoV-2 infections in the nervous system of children and 21 described other human coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1. Excepting MERS-CoV, we found cases of neurological disease in children from each human coronavirus. Children with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections have suffered acute flaccid paralysis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, and seizures. In addition, cases of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and microvascular strokes have occurred in children with SARS-CoV-2. Patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children have suffered encephalitis, stroke, pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, and cytotoxic lesions of deep brain structures. Despite these reports, few articles evaluated the impact of human coronavirus infections on long-term neurodevelopmental domains including cognitive, language, academic, motor, and psychosocial outcomes.

Conclusions

Neurological manifestations of human coronavirus infections can cause severe disease in children. The case literature suggests a critical gap in knowledge of the long-term effects on child neurodevelopment of these infections. As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, this gap must be filled to facilitate optimal outcomes in recovering children.

### Association of adrenal insufficiency with pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome [^114LTMmY]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome pathophysiology is complex and not well delineated. Therefore, it is important to identify potential contributors or targets underlying the primary pathogenesis for its development.

Objective

To report cases highlighting the association of pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome with adrenal insufficiency.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This noncontrolled, observational case series included pediatric patients diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and adrenal insufficiency at an urban academic children's hospital in Houston, Texas, from June 2015 to October 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monitoring optic nerve edema by clinical examination, fundus photography, and optical coherence topography images of the optic nerve.

Results

Data were collected from 5 pediatric patients (age range, 5–10 years) diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and adrenal insufficiency. One was a girl; all were White and prepubertal. Three patients had unrecognized glucocorticoid exposure. All patients had bilateral optic nerve edema that was initially treated with acetazolamide or topiramate, but cortisol functional testing by either 8 am cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation tests revealed a diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency. Treatment with physiological doses of hydrocortisone resulted in resolution of optic nerve edema and clinical symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, as well as a shorter time receiving medical therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this case series, adrenal insufficiency was associated with both primary and secondary prepubertal pediatric pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. As a potential target specific to causative mechanism, physiologic hydrocortisone therapy resolved the condition. To date, there remains a global unawareness among clinicians about the suppressive outcome that glucocorticoids may have on the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in adrenal insufficiency and so-called episodic pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in young children. Ophthalmologists and pediatric subspecialists should implement cortisol testing via either 8 am cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation tests at initial evaluation of all children with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and risk factors for adrenal insufficiency, no predisposing causes, or nonresponse to conventional treatment. Further management and treatment should be in combination with ophthalmology and endocrine services.

### A comparison between the clinical features of pseudotumor cerebri secondary to tetracyclines and idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116tB7LZ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Comparisons between clinical features of tetracycline-induced pseudotumor cerebri (PTC-T) and those of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are absent in the literature. We hypothesized that significant clinical differences between these etiologies exist and could be better understood by retrospective analysis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

We reviewed patients diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) at our center and identified those who developed PTC-T after treatment with a tetracycline-class antibiotic and those with IIH. Groups were compared by demographics, body mass index, ophthalmic examination, treatment, clinical course, and visual outcomes.

Results

We identified 52 cases of PTC-T and 302 cases of IIH. Obesity rates were significantly different (43.8% for PTC-T vs 79.2% for IIH, P < .001). The mean age at diagnosis was younger for PTC-T (19.8 years vs 28.1 years for IIH, P < .001). Diplopia was more common with PTC-T (40.4% vs 20.1% for IIH, P = 0.001). The mean illness duration was shorter for PTC-T (18.3 weeks vs 62.9 weeks for IIH, P < .0001). Recurrence rates were significantly different (4.0% for PTC-T vs 16.5% for IIH, P < .001). The frequency of surgical intervention was similar. Vision loss was uncommon but occurred with similar frequency.

Conclusion

We identified significant clinical differences but also identified important similarities between the 2 groups. There appear to be nonobese patients who develop PTC-T, discontinue the antibiotic, and never develop PTCS again. There are other patients who develop PTC-T, discontinue the antibiotic, and later develop IIH. We conclude that PTC-T represents a spectrum of disease in susceptible individuals.

### Novel advances in monitoring and therapeutic approaches in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1118JFcd]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with no identifiable cause. IIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a syndrome with the major risk factor of recent weight gain, occurring mainly in overweight women of working age. There is a rising incidence in this disease and the incidence appears related to country-specific prevalence of obesity.

In the majority of those presenting with IIH, they will have headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, with a divergence of traditional considerations of a raised ICP headache to a phenotype that is highly variable and commonly mimics migraine. Other reported symptoms include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically lasting seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain, and horizontal diplopia. Prognosis is variable as IIH can either be self-limited or have a lifelong chronic course with significant affects on quality of life.

In 2018, the first consensus IIH guidance was published. The document was reviewed by a committee of international key opinion leaders and a patient group, which established a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for adult IIH. It sets out key diagnostic and management principles. The diagnostic principles of the investigation of papilloedema are to find any underlying treatable cause in a timely manner, protect the vision and ensure timely re-examination when vision is at risk, and to enable onward care of the patient with the input from the most appropriate experienced clinician. Key considerations are to exclude secondary causes, such as venous sinus thrombosis with appropriate imaging and check blood pressure to exclude malignant hypertension. The Friedman et al. 2013 diagnostic criteria are used, although a key area of uncertainty still exists with the diagnostic cut-off, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) 25 cm cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as was then recognized. A grey zone between 25 and 30 cm CSF exists with the recommendation that wherever measured LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, consideration should be given to repeat measurement or ICP monitoring.

### Isotretinoin (Myorisan) [^116Xewb2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric Disorders

Myorisan may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Myorisan therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure ("Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults"), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Myorisan and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Myorisan therapy may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Myorisan therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Myorisan therapy.

Pseudotumor Cerebri

Myorisan use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue Myorisan immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological).

### Reduction in syrinx size and severity after venous sinus stenting in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari malformation: technical case report [^116WCNCo]. Operative Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

Pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari I malformation are found to coexist in a subset of patients. Surgical cranial decompression has been the mainstay of Chiari malformation management, whereas venous sinus stenting has emerged as an effective treatment modality for pseudotumor cerebri. Gaps in our current understanding of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation and the pathophysiology behind CSF-related disorders present difficulties in the simultaneous management of these conditions. A case is presented of the successful management of both conditions with venous sinus stenting, with sustained improvement in symptoms and structural abnormalities of the Chiari malformation and associated syrinxes.

Clinical Presentation

An obese woman in her 20s with a history of occipital headaches who presented with progressively worsening intermittent visual obscurations was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri, Chiari I malformation, and associated spinal syrinxes. Magnetic resonance venography demonstrated right transverse sinus narrowing with an elevated pressure gradient. Successful endovascular intervention with venous sinus stenting achieved normalization of the venous sinus pressure gradient and symptomatic improvement. After stenting, the cervical syrinx was observed to have decreased in size, with a decrease in the extent of cerebellar tonsillar herniation and an increase in CSF signal around the cerebellar tonsils.

Conclusion

Venous sinus stenting for treatment of concomitant pseudotumor cerebri and Chiari I malformation can be effective in patients demonstrating transverse sinus stenosis.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .) If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted.

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

### Phenotyping non-idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri syndrome – A prospective cohort study [^111nCTtc]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the most frequent causes of secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and compare phenotype, clinical presentation, and symptoms of secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome to the primary form of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Methods

The study was a prospective cohort study including patients with new-onset pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. Diagnostic work up was standardized. Patients were diagnosed with secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome or idiopathic intracranial hypertension according to the revised Friedman criteria. Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome patients were categorized into five causes: medication, systemic causes, sleep apnea, cerebrovascular causes, and several competing causes. Phenotype, clinical presentation, symptoms and neuroimaging were compared between groups.

Results

Out of 278 cases, 28 secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and 120 idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients were included. The most frequent causes of secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome were medication (n = 8, 28.6%) and systemic causes (n = 8, 28.6%), followed by sleep apnea (n = 5, 17.9%), cerebrovascular causes (n = 4, 14.3%) and several competing causes (n = 3, 10.7%). Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients were phenotypically alike and predominately female, premenopausal, and obese. Symptoms and objective findings at disease onset were similar between groups.

Conclusion

Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome should be considered in all patients with suspected pseudotumor cerebri syndrome as secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients are phenotypically and clinically alike. A thorough diagnostic workup is needed as treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome is markedly different.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: contemporary review and implications for the otolaryngologist [^114LbeWB]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

1) Review controversies pertaining to the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. 2) Discuss the evolving role of otolaryngologists in managing this disease and related disorders.

Data Sources

Primary literature review, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the primary literature was performed from 1990 to 2016 utilizing keywords idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, benign intracranial hypertension, spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak, and encephalocele. Articles were included at the discretion of the authors based on novel and/or historical contributions to the literature.

Results

The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is increasing along with the obesity epidemic. Undiagnosed patients may present to otolaryngologists with pulsatile tinnitus, dizziness, sleep apnea, and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Although diagnosis is predicated upon imaging findings and lumbar puncture, radiographic signs including empty sella, optic nerve dilation, and globe flattening may suggest the diagnosis. The most effective intervention is weight loss combined with acetazolamide. Surgery is reserved for severe or refractory symptoms and can be highly morbid. Otolaryngologists are increasingly responsible for managing a number of secondary disorders including cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea. Failure to manage intracranial hypertension may lead to adverse surgical outcomes.

Conclusions

The knowledge base for idiopathic intracranial hypertension has greatly expanded over the past 25 years. This disease is associated with a number of conditions directly relevant to otolaryngologists. A keen understanding of this disorder and its management may optimize outcomes in a growing number of patients. Laryngoscope, 128:248–256, 2018.

### Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^114zFHZC]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or mass lesion and with normal CSF composition, previously referred to as pseudotumor cerebri, is a diagnosis of exclusion now termed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Diagnostic criteria of this disorder have not been updated since the Modified Dandy Criteria were articulated in 1985. Since then, new developments, including advances in neuroimaging technology and recognition of additional secondary causes of intracranial hypertension, have further enhanced the ability to diagnose conditions that may mimic IIH. These factors are not addressed in the Modified Dandy Criteria. This report describes updated diagnostic criteria for IIH that may be used for routine patient management and for research purposes.

### An interdisciplinary integrated specialized one-stop outpatient clinic for idiopathic intracranial hypertension-a comprehensive assessment of clinical outcome [^111AMUX1]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (formerly also referred to as pseudotumour cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension) is a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure of unknown aetiology. Considered rare in the general population, IIH typically occurs in obese women of childbearing age with incidence increasing markedly due to the obesity pandemic. In addition to the risk of visual impairment, long‐term outcome is determined by disabling and often chronic headaches. Once a diagnosis of IIH has been made, treatment goals are to preserve vision and alleviate headaches. Treatment of IIH should include a combination of weight loss, pharmacological treatment and, in severe or refractory cases, invasive neurosurgical intervention. Due to the increasing complexity of diagnosing, treating and monitoring patients with IIH, international consensus guidelines recommend that IIH care should be provided in specialized centres with access to the necessary resources and therefore recommend interdisciplinary management of IIH. Despite this broad consensus, there are very few descriptions in the literature as to how such interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary management should be structured and organized in practice.

An interdisciplinary integrated special outpatient clinic for IIH has recently been established at our centre providing a one‐stop approach to diagnosis and treatment. Although such one‐stop approaches are often promoted as a means of improving care, especially for chronic diseases with complex management, objective data on their outcome are very scarce. To date, there are no data on the explicit effects of interdisciplinary integrated care on the outcome of IIH.

The aim of this study was to describe the effects of specialized one‐stop interdisciplinary integrated care for IIH on clinical outcome parameters and to compare it with standard care.

### Shunt freedom and clinical resolution of idiopathic intracranial hypertension after bariatric surgery in the pediatric population: report of 3 cases [^113fDMYH]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a disease of elevated intracranial pressure that is thought to develop due to impaired CSF absorption related to elevated venous sinus pressure in the setting of increased intraabdominal and thoracic pressures. Symptoms can be disabling and, if left untreated, can lead to permanent visual loss. Previous treatments directed toward vision preservation include CSF diversion through shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration. Recently, attention has been turned toward surgical weight loss strategies as an alternative to shunt treatment. The authors present a report of 3 patients with adolescent-onset IIH that was treated at the authors' institution (Duke University) in whom bariatric surgery was pursued successfully. The patients had previously undergone CSF shunting at ages 12, 15, and 23 years. They were shunt dependent for a collective average of 3.3 years prior to bariatriwc surgery. All patients reported "low-pressure" or postural headaches after bariatric surgery that correlated with dramatic reduction in their weight. Two of the 3 patients had their shunts removed and continued to be shunt free 1.5 years later at last follow-up; the third patient remained shunt dependent with the pressure set at 200 mm H₂O. Given the significant complications inherent to multiple shunt revisions, earlier intervention for weight loss, including bariatric surgery, in these patients might have prevented complications and the associated health care burden. The authors recommend a multidisciplinary approach for IIH treatment with early consideration for weight loss interventions in select patients.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111NtYTQ]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with papilloedema need careful evaluation and timely investigation. This is required to exclude all other causes of swollen optic nerves and raised intracranial pressure: IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion. Acute management depends on the immediate risk to vision. For most patients, this is a chronic condition associated with significant disability from headache. Disease-modifying therapy is weight loss. CSF shunting should be considered temporary. IIH requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, neurologists and neurosurgeons. These patients are best managed in centres with expertise in IIH.

Practice points

Distinguishing papilloedema from pseudopapilloedema is not always straightforward, and may require a senior ophthalmology opinion.
Pseudotumour cerebri describes raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema in the absence of a space-occupying lesion and can be caused by several conditions (box 2). Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a diagnosis of exclusion where NO cause can be found.
A single lumbar puncture opening pressure reading can be misleading. Where the opening pressure is out of keeping with the clinical picture, the clinician should review the whole case.
Monitoring of visual fields can be problematic in many patients who have functional overlay.
Treat the patient. High-risk patients lose vision rapidly. Headaches may be multifactorial, and require specialist evaluation and treatment to reduce disability.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115SoUCs]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is becoming increasingly prevalent in line with the global epidemic of obesity. In the UK, 22.7% of people are obese (Body Mass Index > 30 kg/m²), while obesity throughout the world has doubled since 1980. Clinicians' attitudes to IIH vary: in our experience, only a minority of patients are at high risk of rapid visual loss. The previously quoted figure of 25% developing severe permanent visual loss is probably an overestimate. The reality for patients is that it is a chronic condition characterised by significantly disabling headaches and psychological morbidity.

The nomenclature for IIH has changed over the years: previous names being serous meningitis, pseudotumour cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension. The latter became inappropriate with awareness that this is not a benign condition, given the risk of visual loss and disabling chronic headaches. Pseudotumour cerebri is becoming increasingly popular as a term to encompass primary raised intracranial pressure where there is no identifiable cause — which we term IIH — and secondary causes of raised pressure.

The diagnostic criteria of IIH are well known and have evolved since Dandy's initial description in 1937; they include a CSF opening pressure of ≥ 25 cm H₂O (box 1). However, these criteria recommend imaging only to exclude a venous sinus thrombosis in patients without the typical IIH phenotype (obesity and female sex). We feel, however, that it is essential to exclude venous sinus thrombosis (using MRI or CT with venography) in all patients presenting with pseudotumour cerebri, since being female and obese does not preclude the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis. The diagnosis can be difficult and the consequences of error can lead either to the neglect of a serious treatable cause of raised intracranial pressure, blindness or inappropriate treatment of patients who do not have IIH. Although there is insufficient literature to generate an evidence-based management strategy for IIH, experienced clinicians can manage it well.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy. A systematic review on clinical course, treatments, delivery and maternal-fetal outcome [^117GsHT5]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) 2020 guidelines. The PICO framework (Population: pregnant women with IIH; Intervention: medical and surgical treatment; Comparison: management strategies and mode of delivery; Outcome: maternal and fetal safety) was used to formulate the research question.

2.1 Search Strategy

Two Authors (GT and MP) performed a comprehensive search on PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases to identify relevant studies comparing treatment methodologies for women with IIH using the search terms: "(idiopathic OR benign) AND (intracranial hypertension OR psedotumor cerebri) AND (pregnant OR pregnancy)".

The search was updated to February 2nd, 2025, with no time limit. A forward search on references of the retrieved articles was also performed to increase the search power.

2.2 Study Selection

The search was limited to peer‐reviewed studies published in English.

Other inclusion criteria were papers reporting case reports and series illustrating clinical management and procedural interventions for patients affected by IIH during pregnancy. Review papers and studies not presenting explicit data were excluded. Two authors (CLS and MP) independently screened titles and abstracts of the articles retrieved by the search algorithm and selected studies according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria.

After the exclusion of ineligible articles, full texts of the remaining studies were assessed for eligibility according to the same criteria. Disagreements were resolved in a consensus meeting through a new reading of the article and collegial re‐evaluation of the extracted data.

### Otolaryngologists and orbital pseudotumor: a case report [^115auFcC]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation) is the third most common orbital disease, accounting for 5 to 6% of orbital disorders. It often presents in a manner very similar to inflammatory or neoplastic sinus disease. In addition, sinus disease is often a cause of orbital pseudotumor, although the etiology of this entity has yet to be defined. Treatment with steroids is usually successful early on, but long-term treatment-failure and recurrence rates are high. Despite otolaryngologists' intimate knowledge of sinus pathology, we have generally not been heavily involved in researching the causes and treatment of orbital pseudotumors. In this article, we report the case of an affected patient who presented with an orbital mass on radiography. The mass was likely the result of sinus disease in the setting of an untreated orbital floor fracture. We describe the clinical, radiographic, and operative features of this case, and we discuss the otolaryngologist's role in the management of orbital pseudotumors.

### Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in children with systemic lupus erythematosus: case series and review [^114wTECC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that typically affects multiple organ systems and can lead to potentially fatal complications. Management of moderate to severe SLE is often challenging and requires chronic use of immunotherapy and systemic corticosteroids (CS). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in SLE is common, especially in children, and can present nonspecifically with various neuropsychiatric manifestations; collectively termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). Pediatric rheumatologists have adopted the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) adult guidelines for NPSLE nomenclature; however, NPSLE is the least understood feature of lupus disease across age groups. Headache (HA), cognitive dysfunction, and cerebrovascular disease are the most common manifestations of NPSLE in adults and children but are not part of the current ACR classification criteria.

Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a term used to describe intracranial hypertension, which can be idiopathic or secondary to underlying etiology such as abnormal brain parenchyma, venous thrombosis, space-occupying lesion, medication, infection, inflammation, and other related medical conditions. It was described in 1937 as "benign" intracranial hypertension despite reported vision loss. Acute episodes usually present with refractory HA, sixth nerve palsy, and/or papilledema. Obese adolescent females are most commonly affected, and more frequent relapses are reported in the prepubertal age. In 2013, Friedman et al. revised the diagnostic criteria for PTC syndrome (PTCS) according to their body habitus and sedation. In a correctly performed lumbar puncture (LP), they defined the threshold of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure in children versus adults according to their body habitus and sedation in a properly performed lumbar puncture (LP). According to their definition, ruling out underlying possible secondary etiologies through normal neuroimaging, neurologic examination, and CSF composition to rule out secondary etiologies is essential for PTCS diagnosis.

Cases of PTCS in children with SLE have been reported; however, there is no evidence to prove an association between both. Here, we describe a case series of eight children who developed NPSLE in the form of PTCS after diagnosis or as the first manifestation of SLE to highlight the importance of proper neurologic and ophthalmologic evaluation of refractory HA in children with SLE.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^1113zZrW]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

While many meningiomas are diagnosed symptomatically, approximately 20% are found incidentally, a proportion likely to increase with an aging population with increased access to neuroimaging. Incidental meningiomas can be a source of significant anxiety for patients, an economic burden due to the need for regular follow-up imaging, and a clinical dilemma for clinicians due to their unpredictable biology given the absence of diagnostic tissue. Natural history studies on incidental meningiomas typically only extend to the 10-year follow-up mark and most have found a relatively slow rate of growth (average < 5% volumetric increase per year). Approximately 5–8% of patients will develop new symptoms during a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years (standard deviation 2.4 years). Imaging features that may portend a higher risk of progression of an incidental meningioma include: lack of calcification, hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI, presence of peritumoral edema, large tumor volume at diagnosis (> 10 cm³), non-skull base location, and closer proximity to a dural venous sinus. There are currently no standardized guidelines for the interval or duration of monitoring for incidental meningiomas. Although most meningiomas that progress will do so within 5 years of observation, some cases can remain indolent for a longer period before demonstrating accelerated recurrence or growth. Consequently, many clinicians may follow incidental meningiomas in younger patients for a longer duration of time, progressively lengthening the interval between neuroimaging while elderly patients may be discharged from follow-up earlier after a confirmatory period of radiographic stability. Several prognostic models such as IMPACT (Incidental Meningioma: Prognostic Analysis Using Patient Comorbidity and MRI Tests) have been developed to assist clinicians in tailoring follow-up to a specific patient based on individualized clinical and tumor factors but these models all require prospective validation. Upfront treatment of incidental meningiomas is also an option, with surgical resection for often larger tumors, and SRS as a reasonable option for smaller volume cases or for patients with contraindications to surgery. Decisions to treat usually hinges on a combination of patient wishes, clinician preference, and tumor factors including proximity of the meningioma to critical neurovascular structures such that further enlargement or growth could make later resection more challenging or higher risk. Newer technologies such as liquid biopsy or 18 F-FLT PET could be used to help predict the risk of recurrence non-invasively and better individualize management for these cases. While SRS improves radiographic local control of asymptomatic meningiomas compared to observation, this may not translate to a reduced risk of developing new symptoms over time. Furthermore, even though a subset of incidental meningiomas will grow radiographically, these changes may not become clinically significant until tumor size reaches a certain threshold or nears eloquent brain areas. As usual, treatment decisions should weigh the risks of progression versus the risks of intervention, while also taking into consideration the psychosocial, neurocognitive, and socioeconomic effects of active surveillance for the patient versus upfront treatment.

### Infantile idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a case study and review of the literature [^115Nqooi]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or pseudotumor cerebri, is an increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure of unknown etiology. It is mostly seen in adults, less frequently in adolescents, rarely in younger children. Only 5 infants meeting idiopathic intracranial hypertension criteria have been mentioned in the literature. We report a case of a previously healthy 9-month-old boy who presented with irritability, decreased appetite, and a bulging fontanelle. Computed tomography (CT) head imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed normal results. The patient's symptoms transiently resolved after the initial lumbar puncture, but 11 days later, his fontanelle bulged again. A second lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 35 cmH₂O and led to a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in accordance with the modified Dandy Criteria. Treatment with acetazolamide at a dose of 25 mg/kg/d was initiated and the patient remained symptom-free for 6 weeks, followed by another relapse. His acetazolamide dose was increased to 37 mg/kg/d, with no further relapses to date. A diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is challenging in infants, because the patients cannot yet verbalize typical idiopathic intracranial hypertension-related symptoms such as positional headaches, diplopia, or pulsatile tinnitus. Furthermore, it is more difficult to assess papilledema in that age group. If undetected and untreated, idiopathic intracranial hypertension may result in permanent visual deficits. Little is known about idiopathic intracranial hypertension in infants, and age-specific treatment guidelines are lacking. We discuss this rare case of infantile idiopathic intracranial hypertension and provide a review of the literature, including an overview of disease characteristics and outcomes of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in this very young age group.

### Tolerability, safety and survival in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with intravenous epoprostenol (veletri): a prospective, 6-months, open label, observational, non-interventional study [^115xmJ2M]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Safety of Veletri®

Sixteen serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in 12 patients. Three SAE were related to Veletri® treatment: catheter infection n = 2, catheter occlusion n = 1 (Table 2). The 10 SAEs unrelated to Veletri® comprised two cases of death 30 days and 77 days after treatment initiation, respectively, both considered unrelated to i.v. epoprostenol (Fig. 1). Another patient succumbed to PAH-associated right heart failure 19 days after i.v. epoprostenol initiation.

Table 2
Safety analysis

All three patients who died within 6 months from baseline had a history of cancer or suspected cancer (suspected pseudotumor cerebri and a mediastinal mass, mass in the right lower lobe of the lung, history of mamma carcinoma). Furthermore, all three patients had arterial hypertension, one patient showed coronary artery disease and one COPD II, GOLD B. All three patients presented with a NT-proBNP > 12.000 pg/l at baseline. Six-minute walking distance was 20 and 201 m; walking distance from one patient was not obtained. These patients were therefore classified as WHO functional class IV. Two out of the three patients died due to multiple organ failure, one due to right heart failure.

Out of the other four patients who died during long-term follow-up, two had concomitant systemic sclerosis, one patient a history of pulmonary embolism (though no CTEPH) and one patient suffered from liver cirrhosis. Two patients died due to acute renal failure, two due to suspected right heart failure.

Out of thirteen adverse events (AEs), 7 were related to Veletri ®: nausea n = 3, flushing n = 2, diarrhea n = 1 and headaches n = 1 (Table 2) occurred within 120.1 ± 87.3 days of i.v. epoprostenol initiation. One of the patients had to discontinue epoprostenol treatment due to intolerance and therapy resistance after the 3-month follow-up visit. The other 6 epoprostenol-associated AEs were well manageable without hospitalization and could be improved or resolved without causing complications or treatment interruptions. Two patients experienced flushing as a dose-limiting AE, which resolved at a reduced dosage.

### Why don't ventricles dilate in pseudotumor cerebri? A circuit model of the cerebral windkessel [^1171nNZG]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pseudotumor cerebri is a disorder of intracranial dynamics characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and chronic cerebral venous hypertension without structural abnormalities. A perplexing feature of pseudotumor is the absence of the ventriculomegaly found in obstructive hydrocephalus, although both diseases are associated with increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption. Traditionally, the pathophysiology of ventricular dilation and obstructive hydrocephalus has been attributed to the backup of CSF due to impaired absorption, and it is unclear why backup of CSF with resulting ventriculomegaly would not occur in pseudotumor. In this study, the authors used an electrical circuit model to simulate the cerebral windkessel effect and explain the presence of ventriculomegaly in obstructive hydrocephalus but not in pseudotumor cerebri.

Methods

The cerebral windkessel is a band-stop filter that dampens the arterial blood pressure pulse in the cranium. The authors used a tank circuit with parallel inductance and capacitance to model the windkessel. The authors distinguished the smooth flow of blood and CSF and the pulsatile flow of blood and CSF by using direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) sources, respectively. The authors measured the dampening notch from ABP to ICP as the band-stop filter of the windkessel.

Results

In obstructive hydrocephalus, loss of CSF pathway volume impaired the flow of AC power in the cranium and caused windkessel impairment, to which ventriculomegaly is an adaptation. In pseudotumor, venous hypertension affected DC power flow in the capillaries but did not affect AC power or the windkessel, therefore obviating the need for adaptive ventriculomegaly.

Conclusions

In pseudotumor, the CSF spaces are unaffected and the windkessel remains effective. Therefore, ventricles remain normal in size. In hydrocephalus, the windkessel, which depends on the flow of AC power in patent CSF spaces, is impaired, and the ventricles dilate as an adaptive process to restore CSF pathway volume. The windkessel model explains both ventriculomegaly in obstructive hydrocephalus and the lack of ventriculomegaly in pseudotumor. This model provides a novel understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of CSF dynamics and has significant implications in clinical management.

### Bilateral transverse sinus stenosis causing intracranial hypertension [^112KuHzU]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has been associated with transverse sinus stenosis in a number of cases. Some authors advocate for stent placement when transverse sinus stenosis is responsible for pseudotumor symptoms. A 19-year-old man with IIH, bilateral transverse sinus stenosis was apparent on a CT venography, with reconstitution of the lateral sinus. MRI was then performed, and transverse sinus stenosis was confirmed. An impressive network of dilated collateral veins became apparent on VENBOLD sequences. Treatment options in this case include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting, optic nerve fenestrations and transverse sinus stenting. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed in this patient, with prompt resolution of pseudotumor symptoms.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^113xFzXL]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prepregnancy

Contraception

Hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated in IIHand there is no preferred contraceptive method. Previously, case reports have linked oral contraceptives to secondary causes of raised intracranial pressure (pseudotumour cerebri); however, more recent literature has shown that they are not associated with increased incidence of raised intracranial pressure. We have noted that weight gain can be associated with starting oral contraceptives, and this may be something to explore sensitively with patients. Advice to withhold contraception may put women at risk of unplanned pregnancy. Where there is a clear temporal relationship between a patient starting the contraceptive and developing raised intracranial pressure, our pragmatic approach is to withdraw the contraceptive initially (with discussion about alternative methods) and to investigate for secondary causes, that is, coagulopathies. If the intracranial hypertension does not remit and no secondary cause is identified, then it is unlikely to be driven by the contraceptive, and so we would restart the medication with monitoring.

Medical management

When a woman with IIH wishes to conceive, the aim is to achieve disease remission or stable disease with mild papilloedema. The International IIH Guideline details this management and follow-up dependent on papilloedema severity and visual function. We recommend using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to monitor papilloedema and to track disease activity. The increased monitoring needed in pregnancy is discussed later.

Question 3: Which of the following is a promising long-term treatment option for this patient?
A. Corticosteroids
B. Cyclosporine
C. Surgery
E. Radiation therapy
F. Dupilumab

Answers:
A. Corticosteroids – Incorrect. Although most patients respond to oral corticosteroids, the recurrence rate is high once the treatment is discontinued, and there are various adverse effects associated with long-term therapy.
B. Cyclosporine – Incorrect. Cyclosporine is a highly effective immunosuppressant medication, but long-term use is associated with renal toxicity and increased risk of malignant neoplasms.
C. Surgery – Incorrect. Although surgical excision can be performed for diagnostic and treatment purposes, it is associated with high morbidity and disease recurrence. Surgery followed by radiation therapy is associated with lower disease recurrence than either treatment alone and can be reserved for treatment-resistant cases.
D. Radiation therapy – Incorrect. Radiotherapy was occasionally used in patients with treatment-resistant disease or who had recurrence after surgery. It is rarely used nowadays, given the long-term carcinogenesis risk and the availability of effective and safe long-term treatment options.
E. Dupilumab – Correct. Dupilumab is an interleukin 4 (IL-4) alpha antagonist that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling and has been shown to be an effective long-term treatment option in patients with Kimura disease. It would also be helpful for our patient's comorbid conditions, atopic dermatitis, and asthma.

### Low energy diet and intracranial pressure in women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: prospective cohort study [^116GXR4c]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumour cerebri, is a condition of unknown cause characterised by raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema. It typically affects young obese women, causing disabling daily headaches and loss of vision, which is severe and permanent in up to a quarter. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension among obese women is 20 per 100 000, and the prevalence is predicted to rise in conjunction with the global epidemic of obesity.

There is insufficient evidence to guide therapeutic strategies, as highlighted in the 2005 Cochrane review. The condition has a striking association with obesity (greater than 93%), and consequently weight loss is often suggested as a treatment. Nevertheless, there has been only one previous prospective weight modifying study, carried out 35 years ago, which observed subjective improvement in the papilloedema in nine patients on a low calorie rice diet; these findings were supported by retrospective review of case notes. These studies relied on subjective observation of papilloedema and included people with newly diagnosed idiopathic intracranial hypertension, many of whom improve irrespective of any treatment given. Furthermore, they did not monitor concomitant changes in intracranial pressure with either weight loss or resolution of papilloedema.

We carried out a detailed examination of the interplay between weight loss in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with objective measures of papilloedema and visual function, headache scores and, crucially, changes in intracranial pressure.

### Subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111Wp7wi]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

A variety of treatment modalities have been shown to be effective in the management of juxtapapillary CNVMs in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Fearing a poor visual prognosis, Wendel et alelected for photodynamic therapy or argon laser therapy for 3 neovascular membranes that extended toward the fovea; these case had good visual outcomes. The authors concluded that clinical and angiographic monitoring of the neovascular network might be an indication for treatment given that the CNVMs, which remained in the juxtapapillary region, were self-limiting. In a 2009 study by Jamerson et aland a 2013 study by Lee et al, a single dose of intravitreal bevacizumab led to recession of the peripapillary CNVM in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This mirrors our patient's results. Her vision improved significantly — from 20/320 to 20/40 — 1 month after a single dose of treatment. Castellarin et albecame the first team to outline the histopathology results of surgical excision of CNVM in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They noted that choriocapillaris nonperfusion and atrophy could stimulate incomplete ingrowth of the retinal pigment epithelium into the dissection bed, ultimately leading to poor visual recovery.

One of the proposed mechanisms for idiopathic intracranial hypertension–related CNVM was introduced by Morse et al. This team postulated that peripapillary CNVMs result from pressure deformities at the border of Bruch membrane adjacent to the optic disc, leading to discontinuity in the normal chorioretinal layers. In addition, Morse et al postulated that hypoxia created from axonal swelling and poor vascular perfusion of surrounding tissue can promote subretinal angiogenesis. We postulate that in the setting of a normal choroid based on OCT, pressure-related deformities and hypoxia from poor perfusion resulting from our patient's disc edema could have caused microscopic breaks in Bruch membrane, leading to a submacular CNVM.

In summary, this rare case of subfoveal CNVM secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension adds to the existing literature of retinal complications in the setting of pseudotumor cerebri. Given the good visual recovery after intravitreal anti-VEGF and poor vision at presentation based on past cases of juxtapapillary neovascularization, we elected to use intravitreal aflibercept to treat the subfoveal CNVM. OCTA helped determine the location of neovascularization, ultimately guiding the treatment decision and disease monitoring. Additional investigation is required to further elucidate the pathophysiology of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Long-term outcomes of modern radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma-different techniques: single institute experience [^116C43zE]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary adenomas represent a significant proportion of primary intracranial tumors, accounting for roughly 10–15% of all cases. These tumors may be classified according to their hormonal activity as either functioning (hormone-secreting) or non-functioning adenomas. Clinically, they often contribute to pituitary dysfunction, presenting either through hormone excess syndromes or through deficiencies resulting from compression of normal pituitary tissue. Visual symptoms are also common, particularly in macroadenomas, due to involvement of the optic apparatus or extension into the cavernous sinus, which may affect ocular motor function.

Radiotherapy (RT) plays a well-established role in the management of pituitary adenomas, especially in cases where surgery is incomplete, not feasible, or when hormonal normalization is not achieved postoperatively. The optimal timing of RT, particularly the value of early adjuvant therapy following surgery, remains a subject of ongoing clinical discussion. While effective in tumor control, RT targeting the sellar region is frequently associated with long-term endocrine complications, most notably hypopituitarism. The onset of radiation-induced hormonal deficits varies widely, from as early as one year to more than a decade post-treatment. Furthermore, specific radiation dose thresholds for different hormone-secreting cell types have been established, with growth hormone deficiencies often appearing first. Other potential adverse effects of RT, such as visual dysfunction, cerebral radiation injury, and secondary tumor formation, have led to ongoing discussions about its use in treating benign pituitary tumors Several clinically relevant aspects of radiotherapy (RT) for pituitary adenomas remain a matter of ongoing investigation. These include determining the most appropriate timepoint for intervention — whether as primary treatment, postoperative adjuvant therapy, or salvage after recurrence — as well as selecting patient subgroups who may benefit most, such as those with secreting versus non-secreting tumors. Furthermore, the comparative value of available RT modalities, including fractionated stereotactic techniques, radiosurgery, and intensity-modulated approaches, continues to be explored. Although numerous studies have described the short- and intermediate-term effects of RT in this context, long-term data — particularly with respect to tumor control and late toxicities — remain limited. Earlier reports have primarily focused on near-term outcomes, leaving a gap in understanding the durability and safety of treatment over extended follow-up.

This study aims to address that gap by reporting our institution's long-term experience with RT in a cohort of 122 patients with pituitary adenomas, offering insight into clinical outcomes and radiation-associated adverse effects over a period of several decades.

3 Results

Among 42 patients with an initial diagnosis of IDON from the two cohorts, 36 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients excluded had an insufficient follow‐up (n = 1), no follow‐up MRI (n = 4) or unknown MOG/AQP4 status (n = 1). Median clinical follow‐up was 9 years (mean, 9.3; range, 5.1–26.2) and median radiological follow‐up was 5.8 years (mean, 5.5; range, 0.5–17.6). All ON relapses were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day for at least 3 days).

3.1 Alternative Diagnosis (n = 8)

At the end of the follow‐up, 22.2% (n = 8) converted to an alternative diagnosis. Six patients converted to MS (n = 4) or CIS (n = 2) and two patients to NMO‐SD. The median time to conversion to an alternative diagnosis was 6 years (range, 2.1–8.9).

Diagnosis of MS was made through radiological follow‐up without any clinical manifestation in two patients. NMO‐SD was diagnosed by clinical manifestation: one patient experienced recurrent myelitis, and one patient experienced a pseudo‐tumoral lesion leading to hemiparesis. No predictive factors for conversion to an alternative diagnosis were identified (Table 1).

Terminology

The nomenclature and diagnostic criteria used to describe this condition have evolved over time. The first case of IIH, then termed serous meningitis, was probably reported in the 1890s by Henrich Quincke, a German physician, when lumbar puncture (LP) was first introduced. Nonnedescribed a series of cases, similar to Dandy, of raised ICP without tumour termed pseudotumour cerebri. Both series contained cases that we now recognise as raised ICP secondary to a known aetiology. The maturing nomenclature and diagnostic criteria have reflected the advances in investigating patients, particularly neuroimaging and understanding of normal CSF opening pressure measurements, and our increasing appreciation of the clinical course of the disease. Some patients have a mild and self-limiting course, while others experience substantial morbidity from visual loss and persistent headache.

1 Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a neurological disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) manifesting with refractory headache (94%), pulsatile tinnitus (58%), papilledema, progressive visual field cut (VFC) and acuity impairment (68%).

The pathophysiology of IIH is complex, and despite being believed to be primarily associated with impaired cerebrospinal fluid drainage and increased venous pressure, may encompass other factors including hormonal changes i.e. altered testosterone or androsterone levels.

IIH mainly affects overweight women in reproductive life.

Although IIH is considered an idiopathic condition without a known cause, recurrent findings such as chronic stenosis or thrombosis of intracranial (e.g. the transverse‐sigmoid sinuses) and extracranial venous structures (e.g. the jugular veins) are often identifiable.

Historically speaking, the Dandy criteria represented the gold standard for diagnosing and were based on a triad including specific typical neuroradiological signs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressures > 250 mmHg, and exclusion of other potential causes. Since 2024, the Friedman criteria were introduced to refine the diagnosis of IIH, leading to a quintad of the former criteria: symptoms of increased ICP; papilledema; CSF pressure > 250 mmHg; normal neuroimaging; exclusion of secondary causes.

First line management is based on weight reduction for mild cases, whereas severe conditions presenting with significant headaches and visual impairment may require a pharmacological approach with diuretic drugs and steroids. Refractory cases or those presenting with rapid visual deterioration may require surgical interventions of CSF diversion such as ventriculo‐peritoneal shunt (VPS) or lumbo‐peritoneal shunt (LPS) and in some selected cases an optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF).

The concomitant presence of venous sinus stenosis can be managed with angiographic pressure gradient measurements and eventual stenting.

Management of IIH during pregnancy is a unique challenge due to the lack of a protocol and the necessity of a tailored approach. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of drugs and surgical maneuvers need to be carefully considered to preserve both fetal and mother's health.

This paper is a systematic review of the literature focusing on this topic, which aims to collect and discuss all the retrievable findings in order to illustrate the commonly agreed treatment strategies for IIH during pregnancy.

Q5 What other surgical procedures are performed for visual loss in IIH?

ONSF is performed more frequently in Europe and the USA and rarely in the UK. ONSF is reported to have less complications than CSF diversion, and there have been no reports of mortalities in the literature. The reported temporary adverse effects include double vision, ansiocoria and optic nerve head haemorrhages. Very rarely more permanent sequelae that include branch and central retinal artery occlusions have been reported. Some consider ONSF as the first treatment step in malignant fulminant cases and eventually also for those with asymmetric papilloedema causing visual loss in one eye. If this procedure fails, then the more invasive CSF diversion can be considered. ONSF should be performed by an experienced clinician trained in this technique.

Uncertainty

The literature is observational and mainly case series based. Treatment failure rates include worsening in vision after a period of stabilisation in 34% of patients at 1 year and 45% at 3 years. There is also failure to improve headache in one third to one-half.

Q6 What is the current role of neurovascular stenting in acute IIH to prevent loss of vision?

Improvements in venography imaging now detail that many with IIH have anatomical abnormalities of the cerebral venous sinus system. These include stenosis of the dominant or both transverse sinus. The stenosis may result from intrinsic dural sinus anatomy or extrinsic compression by the increased intracranial pressure and reducing ICP can led to resolution of stenosis. The degree of stenosis does not appear to uniformly correlate with intracranial pressure or visual loss. Neurovascular stenting has been reported, in a number of series, to lead to an improvement in symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Complications of the procedure include a short-lived ipsilateral headache in many, stent-adjacent stenosis that require retreatment in a third and in rare cases vessel perforation leading to acute subdural haematoma, stent migration and thrombosis.
The role of neurovascular stenting in IIH is not yet established.
Long-term antithrombotic therapy is required for longer than 6 months following neurovascular stenting treatment.

Uncertainty

The literature is observational and mainly case series based, and there is no long-term data regarding efficacy and safety. The role of neurovascular stenting in IIH to preserve rapidly deteriorating vision is not yet established, as there is a lack of quality data in this area. It may be useful for highly selected patients with IIH with venous sinus stenosis with an elevated pressure gradient and elevated ICP in whom traditional therapies have not worked.

### Optic nerve sheath decompression with adjunctive mitomycin and molteno device implantation… [^117Cwj49]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Optic nerve sheath decompression is an effective treatment for pseudotumor cerebri and visual loss. Although this treatment is successful in reducing papilledema and improving visual function in 80% to 90% of patients, 30% of successful optic nerve sheath decompressions eventually fail. 1 There are several treatment options after a failed optic nerve sheath decompression: repeated optic nerve sheath decompression, acetazolamide sodium, lumboperitoneal shunting, serial lumbar punctures, and corticosteroids. Acetazolamide use is limited by patient intolerance, gastrointestinal-tract side effects, and paresthesia. Corticosteroids are only practical in the short term and can increase intracranial pressure when therapy is tapered. Lumboperitoneal shunts frequently fail and become infected, and visual loss may continue in spite of a functioning shunt.

Repeated optic nerve sheath decompressions require meticulous dissection through extensive orbital scarring and are not as successful as primary decompressions.

Neurosurgery — brain therapeutic exposure — late effects and follow-up indicate motor and/or sensory deficits with paralysis, movement disorders, ataxia, and eye problems (ocular nerve palsy, gaze paresis, nystagmus, papilledema, optic atrophy). Periodic evaluation lists HISTORY for paralysis, movement problems, ataxia, and eye problems, Yearly, and PHYSICAL neurologic exam, Yearly. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include evaluation by neurologist for persistent neurologic symptoms; speech, physical, and occupational therapy in patients with persistent deficits; evaluation by physiatrist/rehabilitation medicine specialist in patients with motor dysfunction; and ophthalmology evaluation as clinically indicated. Additional information advises to consider patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk, with cancer/treatment factors including Primary CNS tumor, skull base tumors, optic pathway tumor, hypothalamic tumor, and supra-sellar tumor (eye problems), and pre-morbid/co-morbid medical conditions including Hydrocephalus. System classification is noted as SYSTEM = CNS SCORE = 1.

### Pseudotumour cerebri associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and treatment with levofloxacin: a case report [^115KCofG]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The delay of lumbar puncture was due to the fact that during the first days of hospitalization the symptoms (headache and diplopia) were dramatically and spontaneously reduced. For the same reason, a short therapy with oral prednisone was attempted with the aim of promoting the reduction of the symptoms which had already spontaneously started.

A 24-h Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring was performed because a positive family history for essential hypertension at a young age was reported.

CSF oligoclonal bands were absent on CSF and blood tests. It supported the absence of a neurological inflammatory disease.

Although lumbar puncture was performed later, when the symptoms had already improved, we hypothesize that the CSF pressure must have been higher when the symptoms peaked and the papilloedema probably developed.

A CSF opening pressure (OP) of ≥ 28 cm H₂O is considered a diagnostic criterion for PTCS in children. However, it has been proposed that a diagnosis of "probable" PTCS can be made with an OP < 28 cm H₂O, if the other diagnostic criteria are met; OP values must always be interpreted within the clinical context as a whole. In our patient OP was 20 cm H₂O, but the presence of 1) clinical signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (headache, diplopia, papilloedema and abducent nerve palsy) without additional abnormal neurological signs 2) normal magnetic resonance imaging and 3) unremarkable examination of CSF constituents are supportive for a diagnosis of "probable" PTCS, according to the definition of probable PTCS given by Tibussek et al.

Treatment principles for "probable" PTCS should be similar to those used for demonstrated PTCS.

Finally, our case suggests that PTCS pathophysiology may be multifactorial and its specific features and severity may be a consequence of different factors interacting synergistically. This observation needs to be verified in larger studies, but it may be useful for paediatricians to know that some antibiotics may have the potential to precipitate PTCS in patients who already have an increased CSF pressure due to a transient imbalanced CSF circulation caused by infections such as M. pneumoniae, with headache being the first and most sensitive, but also least specific, symptom.

This case also confirmed the importance of a multidisciplinary team including paediatricians, paediatric neurologists, ophthalmologists and neurosurgeons to ensure the good management of PTCS and its complications. Although the prognosis is good in most cases, serial ophthalmological evaluation is required in order to monitor the evolution of papilloedema and preserve visual function.

### Differential diagnosis of patients with intracranial sinus venous thrombosis related isolated intracranial hypertension from those with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111vKit3]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2003). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with intracranial hypertension without hydrocephalus, mass lesions, and with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition (pseudotumor cerebri syndrome), the diagnosis of intracranial sinus venous thrombosis (ISVT) has crucial etiological, therapeutic and prognostic implications. Utilizing two well-defined groups of pseudotumor cerebri patients, one with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or angiography confirmed ISVT (17 patients) and the other in whom ISVT has been excluded (idiopathic intracranial hypertension [IIH], 27 patients), we investigated the characteristics that might be helpful in distinguishing them. No clinical or auxiliary findings differed between the ISVT and IIH groups except for female gender and lower CSF protein level, which were significantly associated with the latter. While the syndrome pseudotumor cerebri could be due to multiple causes including ISVT, the term IIH should be restricted for patients with isolated intracranial hypertension attributable to no other neurological or systemic disease. Since CT frequently misses ISVT, patients with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome should undergo MRI and MR venography before being labeled as IIH. We conclude that Modified Dandy's Diagnostic Criteria of pseudotumor cerebri, formulated prior to MRI era, can no longer be applied for the diagnosis of IIH.

Neurosurgery — brain (applies only to neurosurgery with potential to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis) — diabetes insipidus follow-up identifies diabetes insipidus as a potential late effect and specifies periodic evaluation via history with assessment of excessive thirst/polyuria yearly. Health links note hypopituitarism. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include Na, K, Cl, CO2, serum osmolality, and urine osmolality as clinically indicated if history is consistent with excessive thirst and/or polyuria; evaluation for other central endocrinopathies, including growth hormone (GH) deficiency, central hypothyroidism, central adrenal insufficiency, precocious puberty, and gonadotropin deficiency; and referral to endocrine to manage hormonal dysfunction. Diabetes insipidus is described as unlikely to occur as a late effect past two years from therapeutic exposure, and other causes should be considered if symptoms are present. The pathway is tagged as SYSTEM = Endocrine/Metabolic with SCORE = 1. Additional information advises considering patient and cancer/treatment factors, including craniopharyngioma, extension of tumor into hypothalamus, surgery in supra-sellar region, and reoperation for recurrent tumor.

Score Validation

On internal validation, the MRI score was associated with the maximum reported lumbar puncture opening pressure (82 patients) (Figure A) and ophthalmological long-term sequelae (83 patients) (Figure B). The maximum reported lumbar puncture opening pressure correlated with the MRI score (Spearman ρ = 0.267; P = 0.02). The MRI score did not differentiate between IIH and secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (221 patients) (Figure C).

Figure.
Validation of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Score

A and B, MRI scans of patients with clinically suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were used, allowing for the assessment of all variables without imputation. A, The number of MRI score variables depending on the maximum reported lumbar puncture opening pressure is shown (n = 82; P < .001, χ² test for all comparisons). B, The number of MRI score variables depending on the presence of ophthalmological long-term sequelae is shown (n = 83; P = 0.004, χ² test for all comparisons). C, The number of MRI score variables depending on the diagnosis is shown. Because of the small number of patients with secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS), all patients with clinically suspected IIH were included independent of the quality of their scans and therefore also included those MRI scans that did not allow for sufficient evaluation of all variables (n = 221; P < .001, χ² test for all comparisons). D, The number of MRI score variables depending on the diagnosis in 3 independent international patient cohorts is shown (P < .001, χ² test for all comparisons).

External validation of the score was difficult, given the lack of published clinically relevant data from similar cohorts. The MRI score was found to correlate strongly with the presence or absence of papilledema in validation cohorts 1 to 3 and in patients with confirmed IIH and controls in the present Danish cohort (Figure D and eTables 3 and 4 in Supplement 1). For the combined cohort comprising all 587 patients and controls, the MRI score had a sensitivity of 47.5% and a specificity of 96.8% (AUROC, 0.86). Positive and negative predictive values were not calculated owing to the heterogeneity of the cohorts and arbitrary prevalence of IIH.

### Weight management interventions for adults with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and practice recommendations [^111FR8qo]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sustained weight loss therefore is essential for long-term remission of the disease. However, clinical practice is varied in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategies for IIH. Indeed, sustained weight loss has been demonstrated to be essential for long-term remission of the disease. The optimal weight loss method for IIH is yet to be determined, especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity.

Hence, the aim of this study was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant published studies relating to weight loss interventions for IIH for their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcomes, such as vision and headache. A second aim of this study was to convene a panel of experts in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice points to help guide clinicians who may not have formal training in weight management.
