## Question

best oral antibiotic for cellulitis of foot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best oral antibiotic for cellulitis of the foot. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is non-diabetic cellulitis or a diabetes-related foot infection. Then, I should assess purulence and MRSA risk factors. Next, I will gauge severity to decide if oral outpatient therapy is appropriate. After that, I will choose an evidence-based oral regimen tailored to the scenario and confirm duration. Finally, I should review wound care, culture strategy, follow-up, and recurrence prevention to ensure comprehensive management.

> Let me first confirm the likely microbiology. In non-diabetic lower extremity cellulitis, β-hemolytic streptococci predominate, with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus as a contributor; diabetic foot infections are often polymicrobial and managed by separate IDSA/IWGDF guidance, so I should differentiate these up front to avoid over- or under-coverage [^1119mx9Q] [^112hv8YA] [^114vKkeL].

> Wait, I need to check purulence and MRSA risk before picking an agent. Nonpurulent cellulitis points toward streptococci and usually does not require routine MRSA coverage, whereas purulent lesions or abscesses raise concern for S. aureus including MRSA; MRSA-active therapy is indicated if there is penetrating trauma, MRSA elsewhere, nasal MRSA colonization, injection drug use, or sepsis syndrome [^111zAoE9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral therapy until I confirm severity and disposition. Systemically well patients without SIRS or hemodynamic instability can typically be treated as outpatients with oral agents, whereas severe infection, systemic toxicity, immunocompromise, or concern for deeper/necrotizing infection warrants hospitalization and initial IV therapy or broader coverage [^111ek3cL] [^113PjKu3] [^112iZpuV] [^115UecZb].

> For non-diabetic, nonpurulent foot cellulitis without MRSA risk factors, cephalexin is my first-line oral choice; a typical regimen is 500 mg four times daily for 5–7 days, with extension if clinical response is slow. Let me verify the data: IDSA endorses streptococcal-active therapy for typical cellulitis, ACP supports short-course 5–6 days when monitoring is reliable, and a multicenter RCT showed no benefit to adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, so narrow therapy is appropriate here [^116aZEV3] [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf] [^1112uFJm] [^112hv8YA].

> If MRSA risks are present or the cellulitis is purulent, I should broaden. Clindamycin monotherapy can cover both MRSA and streptococci orally, and an alternative is TMP/SMX combined with amoxicillin to ensure streptococcal coverage, given TMP/SMX's variable streptococcal activity; linezolid is active but usually reserved due to cost and toxicity monitoring. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially considered doxycycline or minocycline alone here, but I should correct that: tetracyclines have inconsistent streptococcal activity, so pairing doxycycline with a β-lactam such as amoxicillin is safer when dual coverage is desired unless local data strongly support monotherapy [^115M76PW] [^1166kUD4] [^116PoWQe] [^114ZhUEW].

> For mild to moderate diabetic foot infections limited to soft tissue, amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily is a pragmatic oral first-line choice for 1–2 weeks, given the polymicrobial milieu; if MRSA risk is present, I need to add MRSA coverage or choose an agent active against both MRSA and streptococci, recognizing clindamycin as an option. I should confirm I am not reflexively covering Pseudomonas unless there are specific risks such as tropical climate, recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, or water exposure, and I should tailor therapy to post-debridement cultures when available [^112MQFYo] [^116W5KuF] [^115gaEyS] [^1137BPuj] [^113UaZyo].

> Next, I should review key adjuncts that reduce failure and recurrence. Let me first confirm the toe-web exam: interdigital fissuring, scaling, or maceration are common portals, and treating tinea pedis can prevent relapses; elevation helps edema control and symptom resolution; debridement if necrosis or abscess is present is essential in diabetic feet. I need to ensure I am not over-ordering cultures in typical nonpurulent cellulitis because the yield is low, but I will obtain cultures for purulence, diabetic foot infection, severe disease, immunocompromise, or non-responders [^111Mrdn1] [^117WMmEy] [^112VzzR1] [^112Y49h4] [^115oHTUY].

> I will now examine follow-up and treatment failure. Reassess clinically at 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, I should double-check the diagnosis for mimics like stasis dermatitis or DVT, look for an undrained abscess or deeper infection such as osteomyelitis, and consider escalating to MRSA-active or broader coverage as indicated. Let me verify predictors of outpatient oral failure: tachypnea, chronic ulcers, prior MRSA, and recent cellulitis increase risk, and failure rates across trials show substantial variability, underscoring the need for early reassessment [^116PoWQe] [^113rC2Kf] [^1138M9cS].

> Finally, I need to ensure recurrent cellulitis prevention is addressed. Treat predisposing factors consistently, including edema, toe-web abnormalities, obesity, eczema, and venous insufficiency; for patients with three to four episodes per year despite risk-factor control, consider prophylactic penicillin or erythromycin orally, or benzathine penicillin intramuscularly, continuing as long as risk factors persist. Hold on, I should verify the evidence base: Cochrane data support antibiotic prophylaxis reducing recurrence while non-antibiotic skin care and compression remain foundational [^115fTU2J] [^117MYykE] [^115ssoEa] [^1139Z69g] [^116NB7ww].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is: for most uncomplicated, non-diabetic, nonpurulent foot cellulitis without MRSA risks, cephalexin for 5–7 days is the best oral first-line choice; when MRSA risks or purulence are present, use clindamycin or combine TMP/SMX or doxycycline with a β-lactam to secure streptococcal coverage; for mild to moderate diabetic foot infections, amoxicillin-clavulanate for 1–2 weeks is appropriate with MRSA coverage added when indicated, avoiding routine Pseudomonas coverage unless specific risk factors exist [^116PoWQe] [^1112uFJm] [^112MQFYo] [^116W5KuF] [^113UaZyo].

---

For uncomplicated, non-purulent foot cellulitis [^116aZEV3], **cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours** [^1112uFJm] is the first-line oral antibiotic [^112hv8YA] because it reliably covers streptococci and MSSA, the most common pathogens [^1119mx9Q]. If MRSA is suspected or confirmed [^1166kUD4], use **clindamycin 300–450 mg every 6–8 hours** or **doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours** plus a beta-lactam [^111zAoE9] to ensure streptococcal coverage [^115M76PW]. For mild diabetic foot infections, amoxicillin-clavulanate or clindamycin plus a fluoroquinolone are appropriate [^112MQFYo]; for moderate infections, broader agents such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin plus a fluoroquinolone, or linezolid are recommended [^114vKkeL] [^1137BPuj]. Treat for 5–7 days, extending to 10–14 days if slow response or comorbidities are present [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe].

## Common pathogens in foot cellulitis

Foot cellulitis is most often caused by gram-positive organisms [^1119mx9Q], with **streptococci predominating** in non-purulent infections [^116aZEV3] and S. aureus (including MRSA) more frequent in purulent or complicated cases [^112hv8YA]. In diabetic foot infections, polymicrobial flora, including gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes, are common [^112VzzR1], particularly in chronic or severe infections [^112jn4yc].

| **Pathogen** | **Clinical scenario** |
|-|-|
| β-hemolytic streptococci | Non-purulent cellulitis |
| Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA/MRSA) | Purulent or complicated cellulitis |
| Gram-negative bacilli | Chronic or severe diabetic foot infections |
| Anaerobes | Chronic or severe diabetic foot infections |

---

## Recommended oral antibiotics for uncomplicated foot cellulitis

For uncomplicated, non-purulent foot cellulitis [^116aZEV3], **beta-lactams are first-line** for their efficacy, safety, and narrow spectrum [^112hv8YA] [^114KLBse].

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Coverage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally every 6 hours | Streptococci, MSSA | First-line; well tolerated |
| Dicloxacillin | 500 mg orally every 6 hours | Streptococci, MSSA | Alternative to cephalexin |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg orally every 12 hours | Streptococci, MSSA, some gram-negatives | Useful if gram-negative coverage needed |

---

## Oral antibiotics for MRSA coverage

When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, use **MRSA-active agents** [^114ZhUEW] [^1166kUD4] [^111zAoE9].

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Coverage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg orally every 6–8 hours | MRSA, streptococci | Monotherapy option |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally every 12 hours | MRSA | Combine with beta-lactam for streptococcal coverage |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally every 12 hours | MRSA | Combine with beta-lactam for streptococcal coverage |
| Linezolid | 600 mg orally every 12 hours | MRSA, streptococci | Reserve for severe cases due to cost and side effects |

---

## Oral antibiotics for diabetic foot infections

Diabetic foot infections often require broader coverage because they are frequently polymicrobial; **severity guides selection** [^112VzzR1] [^112MQFYo] [^113UaZyo] [^112swx9V].

| **Severity** | **Recommended oral antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| Mild | Amoxicillin-clavulanate or clindamycin plus a fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) [^112MQFYo] |
| Moderate | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Clindamycin plus fluoroquinolone <br/> - Linezolid <br/> - Moxifloxacin |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **typical duration** for uncomplicated foot cellulitis is 5–7 days [^111gsSaf], extended to 10–14 days if response is slow or comorbidities are present [^116PoWQe].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

Antibiotic selection depends on several **factors**, including:

- **Patient allergies**: Avoid beta-lactams in severe allergy; use clindamycin or doxycycline [^116aZEV3].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, immunosuppression, or chronic ulcers may require broader coverage [^113C1iip].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Consider local MRSA prevalence and resistance data [^111zAoE9].
- **Clinical severity**: Severe infections may require initial IV therapy or broader oral agents [^111ek3cL].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Clinical outcomes are generally favorable with appropriate therapy, but **recurrence is common** (14–45% within 1–3 years) [^1119mx9Q]. Recurrence risk increases with obesity, chronic edema, and inadequate management of predisposing conditions [^117MYykE].

---

## Patient adherence and side effects

Patient adherence is critical; **shorter courses** (5–7 days) improve adherence and reduce side effects [^111gsSaf]. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, rash, and, rarely, severe reactions (e.g. C. difficile colitis).

---

## Emerging antibiotic resistance

Emerging resistance, particularly MRSA, necessitates **judicious antibiotic use** and adherence to guidelines [^111zAoE9]. Regular monitoring of local resistance patterns is essential [^114zdKRg].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines **emphasize**:

- **Empiric therapy**: Beta-lactams for uncomplicated cellulitis; add MRSA coverage if indicated [^116aZEV3] [^1166kUD4].
- **Duration**: 5–7 days, extended if necessary [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Elevation, wound care, and management of predisposing conditions [^117WMmEy] [^115fTU2J].

---

Cephalexin is the **preferred oral antibiotic** for uncomplicated foot cellulitis, with clindamycin or doxycycline plus a beta-lactam for MRSA risk. Diabetic foot infections often need broader coverage, and therapy should be individualized by severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns.

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% of cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization. It is frequently encountered by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. Despite its prevalence, cellulitis can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is diagnosed clinically, based on the history of present illness and physical examination, as there is no gold standard for diagnosis.

The typical clinical presentation includes an acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and pain. However, it can be difficult to diagnose due to numerous infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers, such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often challenging due to the poor sensitivity of culture specimens.

The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are attributed to β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. In these cases, targeted coverage with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is usually sufficient. Even with increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, additional coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

- **Data sources**: The following databases were searched up to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, five trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary endpoints, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results from a total of 43 studies were analyzed, which provided valuable insights into the most effective treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: A systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics, which can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019.

Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic types, administration routes, treatment durations, or doses. LLC may be overtreated, and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

### Predictors of oral antibiotic treatment failure for nonpurulent skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department [^113rC2Kf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Guideline recommendations for the optimal management of nonpurulent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are based on expert consensus. There is a lack of evidence to guide emergency physicians in selecting patients for oral versus intravenous antibiotic therapy. The primary objective was to identify predictors associated with oral antibiotic treatment failure.

Methods - **Health records review**: We performed a health records review of adults (age ≥ 18 years) with nonpurulent SSTIs treated at two tertiary care emergency departments (EDs). Oral antibiotic treatment failure was defined as any of the following a minimum of 48 hours of oral therapy due to worsening infection: 1) hospitalization, 2) change in class of oral antibiotic, or 3) switch to intravenous therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors independently associated with oral antibiotic treatment failure.

Results - **Patient analysis**: We identified 500 patients (mean ± SD age = 64 ± 19 years, 279 male [55.8%], and 126 [25.2%] with diabetes). Of the 288 patients who had received a minimum of 48 hours of oral antibiotics, there were 85 oral antibiotic treatment failures (29.5%). Tachypnea at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 6.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.80 to 22.08), chronic ulcers (OR = 4.90, 95% CI = 1.68–14.27), history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization or infection (OR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.51 to 15.44), and cellulitis in the past 12 months (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.01 to 4.96) were independently associated with oral antibiotic treatment failure.

### Failure of antibiotics in cellulitis trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138M9cS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The objectives of the study are to quantify trial-to-trial variability in antibiotic failure rates in randomized clinical trials of cellulitis treatment, and to provide a point estimate for the treatment failure rate across trials.

- **Methods**: We conducted a structured search for clinical trials evaluating antibiotic treatment of cellulitis, indexed in PubMed by August 2015. We included studies published in English and excluded studies conducted wholly outside of developed countries because the pathophysiology of cellulitis is likely to be different in such settings. Two authors reviewed all abstracts identified for possible inclusion. Of studies identified initially, 5% met the selection criteria. Two reviewers extracted data independently, and data were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey transformation under a random-effects model. Our primary outcome was the summary estimate of treatment failure across intent-to-treat and clinically evaluable participants.

- **Results**: We included 19 articles reporting data from 20 studies, for a total of 3935 patients. Treatment failure was reported in 6% to 37% of participants in the 9 trials reporting intent-to-treat results, with a summary point estimate of 18% failing treatment (95% confidence interval, 15%-21%). In the 15 articles evaluating clinically evaluable participants, treatment failure rates ranged from 3% to 42%, and overall, 12% (95% confidence interval, 10%-14%) were designated treatment failures.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment failure rates vary widely across cellulitis trials, from 6% to 37%. This may be due to confusion or variability in trial design and execution.

### Outcome assessment in cellulitis clinical trials: Is telephone follow up sufficient [^113Kcirx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has scrutinized clinical trial methodology in cellulitis, partly because the definition and timing of cure are debatable. We analyzed the validity of telephone self-report as a proxy for in-person follow-up in a cellulitis treatment trial comparing cephalexin alone with cephalexin-plus-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our results demonstrate poor agreement between these two methods of outcome determination and have implications for future cellulitis clinical trial design and clinical management.

### Randomised controlled trial of intravenous antibiotic treatment for cellulitis at home compared with hospital [^113V7eyn]. BMJ (2005). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of treatment with intravenous antibiotics for cellulitis at home versus in a hospital setting.

The study was designed as a prospective randomised controlled trial and took place in Christchurch, New Zealand. It included 200 patients who either presented to or were referred to the only emergency department in Christchurch. These patients were thought to require intravenous antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and did not have any contraindications to receiving home care. They were randomly assigned to receive treatment either at home or in the hospital.

- **Main outcome measures**: Days to no advancement of cellulitis was the primary outcome measure. Other recorded outcomes included days on intravenous and oral antibiotics, days in hospital or in the home care programme, complications, degree of functioning and pain, and satisfaction with site of care.

- **Results**: The two treatment groups did not differ significantly concerning the primary outcome of days to no advancement of cellulitis, with a mean of 1.50 days (SD 0.11) for the group receiving treatment at home and 1.49 days (SD 0.10) for the group receiving treatment in hospital (mean difference 0.01 days, 95% confidence interval -0.3 to 0.28). None of the other outcome measures differed significantly except for patients' satisfaction, which was greater in patients treated at home.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment of cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics can be safely delivered at home. Patients showed a preference for home treatment, but in this study, only about one-third of patients presenting at the hospital for intravenous treatment of cellulitis were considered suitable for home treatment.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant healthcare costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision-making to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Empiric outpatient therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, or clindamycin for cellulitis [^114ha5U7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on optimal empiric oral antibiotic treatment for outpatients with cellulitis in areas with a high prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 3-year retrospective cohort study of outpatients with cellulitis empirically treated at a teaching clinic of a tertiary-care medical center in Hawaii. Patients who received more than one oral antibiotic, were hospitalized, or had no follow-up information were excluded. Treatment success rates for empiric therapy were compared among commonly prescribed antibiotics in our clinic: cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin. Risk factors for treatment failure were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: Of 544 patients with cellulitis, 405 met the inclusion criteria. The overall treatment success rate of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher than the rate of cephalexin (91% vs 74%; p < 0.001), whereas clindamycin success rates were higher than those of cephalexin in patients who had subsequently culture-confirmed MRSA infections (P = 0.01), had moderately severe cellulitis (P = 0.03), and were obese (P = 0.04). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was recovered in 72 of 117 positive culture specimens (62%). Compliance and adverse drug reaction rates were not significantly different among patients who received these three antibiotics. Factors associated with treatment failure included therapy with an antibiotic that was not active against community-associated MRSA (adjusted odds ratio 4.22; 95%.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: A randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^112kVctu]. Annals of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

- **Adverse events**: We noted 19 different adverse events (AE) that occurred in 25 separate treatment episodes (25/66; 38%), of which we classified 12 as serious (SAE). The incidence of AE was not significantly different in the two study arms (Supplementary Digital Content File 4). While the most serious AE were unrelated to infection (6 were due to acute ischemia, 3 to postoperative bronchial aspiration, 2 to acute gout crisis), we attributed 6 to the study-related antibiotic therapy. These included 1 case of fungal intertrigo requiring topical antimycotic treatment, 1 skin rash related to clindamycin, 1 toxic skin reaction due to either co-amoxiclav or levofloxacin, 1 cardiac decompensation due to a salt load from therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, and 2 episodes of nausea attributed to co-amoxiclav.

- **Per-protocol analysis**: Among the 66 soft tissue diabetic foot infection (ST-DFI) episodes composing the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, we removed 7 (11%) when constituting the per-protocol (PP) population. In the PP population, the rate of clinical remission was similar to that in the ITT population: 25 of 32 episodes in the 10-day arm versus 18 of 27 episodes in the 20-day arm (78% vs 67%; P = 0.32). The rate of AE was also similar to the ITT population and for the two arms: 13/32 in the short course versus 10/27 in the long course (P = 0.78). Specifically, looking at antibiotic-related AEs, rates were similar in the short versus long treatment arms (2/32 versus 3/24 cases, P = 0.50).

- **Multivariate adjustment**: To further adjust for non-randomized variables, we added a cluster-controlled Cox regression analysis (Supplementary Digital Content File 5; left part). As in previous analyses, this adjustment was necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the outcomes.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful, and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can significantly impact patients. The associated pain, feeling of being very unwell, and the need to elevate the affected limb can result in a reduced quality of life and extended periods of work absence among individuals with cellulitis. Cellulitis also imposes a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). For instance, between 2015 and 2016, 123,644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England due to cellulitis. While even a single episode of cellulitis can substantially affect quality of life, approximately one-third of those with cellulitis experience recurrent episodes. Risk factors for recurrence include previous episodes of cellulitis, lymphoedema, obesity, diabetes, and skin disorders that create breaks in the skin, such as fungal foot disease, dry skin, or insect bites.

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. However, this strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly due to the increasing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescriptions amid concerns about antibiotic resistance and potential side effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced through the use of emollients to prevent dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments.

There has been limited research into the role of skincare in the prevention of cellulitis; however, a role for dry skin has been hypothesized, and regular application of emollients has been shown to reduce dryness.

### Do patients with cellulitis need to be hospitalized? A systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality rates of inpatients with cellulitis [^114RuFHK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause of hospitalization. In the United States, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code "other cellulitis and abscess" accounts for 1.4% of all admissions and $5.5 billion in annual costs. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends hospitalization for patients with cellulitis under certain circumstances, but there is little actual clinical evidence to guide the decision to admit. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cellulitis and to ascertain if the rate is comparable to the rate for low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia that are currently recommended for outpatient management.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of consecutive patients hospitalized with cellulitis or erysipelas that reported inpatient mortality. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The mortality rates from the included studies were pooled using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I² statistic.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The overall worldwide mortality rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7–1.8). For studies from the United States, the rate was 0.5% (95% CI 0.3–0.9). The actual cause of death was generally poorly described, and only one-third of deaths appeared to be due to infection.

- **Discussion**: The estimated mortality rate for patients currently being hospitalized for cellulitis is comparable to the mortality rate of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas [^114KLBse]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas are typically considered manifestations of the same condition, presenting as a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A variety of antibiotic treatments are recommended in guidelines.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

- **Search strategy**: In May 2010, we searched for randomized controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included 25 studies with a total of 2,488 participants. Our primary outcome, 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free', was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, so we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (risk ratio [RR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In three trials involving 419 people, two studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (IV) penicillin, demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than IV therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1).

### Executive summary: 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections [^112VzzR1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Foot infections are a common and serious problem in persons with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by ≥ 2 classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations). This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation. Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC), and especially staphylococci, being the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds. Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. For infected wounds, obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms, or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections, usually require broader spectrum regimens. Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

- **Objective**: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial conducted in 5 US emergency departments. The study involved outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess. Participants were enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012, and all underwent soft tissue ultrasound at enrollment to exclude abscesses. The final follow-up was in August 2012.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either cephalexin, 500 mg four times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure. Clinical cure was defined as the absence of the following clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness by days 3–4; no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness by days 8–10; and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness by days 14–21.

### Linezolid [^1137BPuj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adult diabetic patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections, known as diabetic foot infections, were enrolled in a randomized (2:1 ratio), multi-center, open-label trial. The study compared medications administered intravenously or orally for a total of 14 to 28 days of treatment.

One group of patients received linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours, either intravenously or orally. The other group received either ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5 to 3 g intravenously or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 to 875 mg every 8 to 12 hours orally. In countries where ampicillin/sulbactam is not marketed, amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg to 2 g every 6 hours was used for the intravenous regimen.

Patients in the comparator group could also be treated with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours intravenously if MRSA was isolated from the foot infection. Patients in either treatment group who had Gram-negative bacilli isolated from the infection site could receive aztreonam 1 to 2 g every 8–12 hours intravenously.

All patients were eligible to receive appropriate adjunctive treatment methods, such as debridement and off-loading, as typically required in the treatment of diabetic foot infections, and most patients received these treatments.

There were 241 linezolid-treated and 120 comparator-treated patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) study population. Two hundred twelve (86%) linezolid-treated patients and 105 (85%) comparator-treated patients were clinically evaluable. In the ITT population, the cure rates were 68.5% (165/241) in linezolid-treated patients and 64% (77/120) in comparator-treated patients.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure, defined as failed initial antibiotic therapy requiring a change of antibiotics or hospital admission.

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years, and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and…

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: A randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^116XsXvs]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

We analyzed a sufficient number of episodes of ST-DFIs to achieve the pre-scheduled statistical non-inferiority in the ITT population. For clinical remission, the calculated confidence intervals excluded the 25% non-inferiority margin (6.2 difference points [90% CI -24% to +12%]) in the ITT population. Similarly, there was statistical non-inferiority for antibiotic-related AE (7.2 difference points [90% CI -7% to +21%]) in the ITT population.

The corresponding results in the PP population were 11.5 difference points [90% CI -31% to +8%] for clinical remission and 7.3 difference points [90% CI -10% to +19%] for antibiotic-related AE. Hence, we formally failed to achieve non-inferiority for clinical remission in the PP population.

### Antibiotic treatment for 6 days versus 12 days in patients with severe cellulitis: a multicentre randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial [^112eJiED]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). High credibility.

To investigate whether antibiotic treatment of 6 days' duration is non-inferior to treatment for 12 days in patients hospitalized for cellulitis, this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted. Adults hospitalized for severe cellulitis and treated with intravenous flucloxacillin were enrolled. On day 6, participants with symptom improvement who were afebrile were randomized to receive either an additional 6 days of oral flucloxacillin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification for diabetes and hospital.

- **Primary outcome**: Cure by day 14, without relapse by day 28.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Modified cure assessment and relapse rate by day 90.

Between August 2014 and June 2017, 151 of 248 included participants were randomized. The intention-to-treat population comprised 76 and 73 participants allocated to 12 and 6 days of antibiotic therapy, respectively (mean age 62 years, 67% males, 24% diabetics). Cure rates were 50.0% in the 12-day group and 49.3% in the 6-day group (ARR 0.7 percentage points, 95% CI: -15.0 to 16.3). With the modified cure assessment, rates were 73.7% in the 12-day group and 67.1% in the 6-day group (ARR 6.6, 95% CI: -8.0 to 20.8). After initial cure without relapse, day 90 relapse rates were significantly higher in the 6-day group (6% versus 24%, p < 0.05).

Given the wide confidence intervals, we can neither confirm nor refute our hypothesis that 6 days of therapy is non-inferior to 12 days of therapy. However, a 6-day course resulted in significantly more frequent relapses by day 90.

### Principles and practice of antibiotic therapy of diabetic foot infections [^112jn4yc]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2000). Low credibility.

Foot infections are a common and serious problem in diabetic patients. They usually occur as a consequence of a skin ulceration, which initially is colonized with normal flora and later infected with pathogens. Infection is defined clinically by evidence of inflammation, and appropriate cultures can determine the microbial etiology. Aerobic gram-positive cocci are the most important pathogens; in chronic, complex, or previously treated wounds, gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes may join in a polymicrobial infection.

In all diabetic foot infections, a primary consideration is whether surgical intervention is required, such as for undrained pus, wound debridement, or revascularization. Antibiotic regimens are usually selected empirically initially, then modified if needed based on results of culture and sensitivity tests and the patient's clinical response. Initial therapy, especially in serious infections, may need to be broad-spectrum, but definitive therapy can often be more targeted. Severe infections usually require intravenous therapy initially, but milder cases can be treated with oral agents.

Treatment duration ranges from 1–2 weeks for mild soft tissue infections to more than 6 weeks for osteomyelitis. The choice of a specific agent should be based on the usual microbiology of these infections, data from published clinical trials, the severity of the patient's infection, and the culture results. Extension of infection into underlying bone can be difficult to diagnose and may require imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance scans.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^111WuyAf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Some participants spoke about keeping precautionary antibiotics at home, which had been prescribed by their GP for immediate use if their cellulitis recurred. This seemed to reduce their anxiety about recurrence.

"When I've got it, it just — it is debilitating, it just knocks you out and you can't do anything. The best thing is to see a doctor and get an immediate course of antibiotics. This last time I saw my GP, I got an emergency pack of antibiotics, flucloxacillin, that I can take in case it recurs. Thinking about it happening again fills me with dread almost, but the good thing is I've got this back-up emergency course of antibiotics that I can take if it happens again".

For some participants, the uncertainty around what caused their cellulitis seemed to have created uncertainty about the prevention of recurrence. Participants who had only experienced one episode of cellulitis felt that it was difficult to know how to prevent it from returning, as they were not certain what had caused their first episode of cellulitis.

"And I must admit, I didn't know that it was cellulitis till it was all written down; I thought I'd just got Strep A because — I mean, can cellulitis alone do that to you? I mean, it nearly killed me. I'm very lucky to be alive and I certainly don't want it again, but I don't know what to do not to get it again. And no one does, and no one knows how I got it".

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. It is clinically diagnosed and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging is often not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common, and predisposing conditions should be assessed and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: A randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^115ZGvFB]. Annals of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for soft-tissue infections of the diabetic foot remains unknown. We determine if antibiotic therapy after debridement for a short (10 days), compared with a long (20 days), duration for soft-tissue infections of the diabetic foot results in similar rates of clinical remission and adverse events (AE).

- **Summary of background data**: The optimal duration of systemic antibiotic therapy, after successful debridement, for soft tissue infections of diabetic patients is unknown. Because of the high recurrence risk, overuse is commonplace.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority pilot trial of cases of diabetic foot infection (excluding osteomyelitis) with the primary outcome of "clinical remission at 2-months follow-up".

- **Results**: Among 66 enrolled episodes (17% females; median age 71 years), we randomized 35 to the 10-day arm and 31 to the 20-day arm. The median duration of the parenteral antibiotic therapy was 1 day, with the remainder given orally. In the intention-to-treat population, we achieved clinical remission in 27 (77%) patients in the 10-day arm compared to 22 (71%) in the 20-day arm (P = 0.57). There were a similar proportion in each arm of AE (14/35 versus 11/31; P = 0.71) and remission in the per-protocol population (25/32 vs. 18/27; P = 0.32). Overall, 8 soft tissue DFIs in the 10-day arm and 5 cases in the 20-day arm recurred as a new osteomyelitis [8/35 (23%) versus 5/31 (16%); P = 0.53]. Overall, the number of recurrences limited to the soft tissues was 4 (6%).

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Additionally, we searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings and BIOSIS Previews.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis while on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalization, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions, and mortality.

- **Main results**: We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^117EPjNH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissues that recurs in approximately one-third of cases. The only proven strategy to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. Given concerns about antibiotic resistance and the pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing, other prevention strategies are needed.

- **Objectives**: To explore patients' views about cellulitis and different ways of preventing recurrent episodes.

- **Methods**: Adults aged ≥ 18 years with a history of first-episode or recurrent cellulitis were invited through primary care, hospitals, and advertising to complete a survey, take part in an interview, or both.

- **Results**: Thirty interviews were conducted between August 2016 and July 2017. Two hundred and forty surveys were completed (response rate 17%). Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data showed that people who have had cellulitis have wide-ranging beliefs about what can cause cellulitis and are often unaware of the risk of recurrence or potential strategies to prevent recurrence. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercise, and losing weight were more popular potential strategies than the use of compression stockings or long-term antibiotics. Participants expressed caution about long-term oral antibiotics, particularly those who had experienced only one episode of cellulitis.

- **Conclusions**: People who have had cellulitis are keen to know about possible ways to prevent further episodes. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercise, and losing weight were generally viewed as favorable strategies.

### Oral versus intravenous antibiotics for residual osteomyelitis after amputation in the diabetic foot [^112AyUHX]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The standard management for residual osteomyelitis following amputation in a diabetic foot infection includes a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotic agents. The purpose of this analysis was to investigate whether oral antibiotic therapy led to treatment failure more than intravenous antibiotic therapy for this indication. The primary endpoint was treatment failure within one year of the initial amputation, defined by re-operation for residual osteomyelitic infection or a remaining nonhealing wound at the surgical site. All patients received at least four weeks of antibiotics and were chosen for oral or intravenous route of administration by infectious disease specialists. Characteristics, including age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, BMI, tobacco use, PVD, homelessness, and IDSA classification, were also assessed for their influence on antibiotic success and failure. Of the 65 patients meeting inclusion criteria, treatment failure occurred in 32 and treatment success occurred in 33. Of the treatment failures, 17 (53%) were in the intravenous group, and 15 (47%) were in the oral group. The differences between the modalities of antibiotic administration and their failure rates were not found to be statistically significant (p = .28 [proportional difference: -14%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -36% to 10%]).

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1131R2RH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common and painful infection of the skin and underlying tissues, recurring in approximately one-third of cases. Currently, the only proven strategy to reduce recurrence risk is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. However, due to concerns about antibiotic resistance and pressures to reduce antibiotic prescribing, alternative prevention strategies are necessary.

The study aimed to explore patients' views about cellulitis and various ways to prevent recurrent episodes. Adults aged 18 and over, with a history of cellulitis, were invited through primary care outlets, hospitals, and advertising to either complete a survey, participate in an interview, or both.

Thirty interviews were conducted between August 2016 and July 2017, and 240 surveys were completed (response rate 17%). The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that individuals who have had cellulitis possess a wide range of beliefs about its causes. Moreover, many are unaware of the risk of recurrence or potential preventive strategies. Enhanced foot hygiene, daily application of emollients, exercise, and weight loss emerged as more popular strategies compared to the use of compression stockings or long-term antibiotics. Participants expressed caution about long-term oral antibiotics, especially those who had only experienced a single episode of cellulitis.

Overall, individuals with a history of cellulitis are eager to learn about possible methods to prevent further episodes. Enhanced foot hygiene, daily emollient application, exercise, and weight loss were generally favored prevention strategies.

### Diabetic osteomyelitis: Oral versus intravenous antibiotics at a single Level 1 academic medical trauma center [^111iHUYq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Residual osteomyelitis is a frequent problem following surgical intervention for diabetic foot infection. The Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines recommend a prolonged course of antibiotics for the treatment of residual osteomyelitis. Recent literature suggests oral antibiotic therapy is not inferior to IV therapy. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate treatment success in 128 patients receiving oral versus IV antibiotics for residual osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot after amputation at a Level 1 academic medical trauma center. Treatment success was defined as completion of at least 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy, complete surgical wound healing, and no residual infection requiring further debridement or amputation within one year of the initial surgery. Patients with peripheral arterial disease were excluded.

A retrospective chart review was performed, and we found no statistically significant difference in treatment success between these two groups (p = .2766). The median time to healing for oral antibiotic treatment was 3.17 months compared to 4.06 months for IV treatment (p = .1045). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in group demographics or comorbidities, aside from more patients in the IV group having coronary artery disease (p = .0416). The type of closure and whether the infection was single or polymicrobial were also not associated with a difference in outcomes between the two treatment arms. The results of the present study suggest oral antibiotics for the treatment of residual osteomyelitis are not inferior to IV therapy and may be more beneficial.

### What are the patterns of prophylactic postoperative oral antibiotic use after foot and ankle surgery [^113xL96a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

The CDC estimates that 23% of healthcare-associated infections are surgical site infections, with an alarming prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. While there is consensus regarding preoperative prophylaxis, the use of prophylactic postoperative oral antibiotics by orthopedic surgeons is less defined.

- **Questions/purposes**: We investigated surgeons' use of prophylactic postoperative oral antibiotics after elective outpatient foot or ankle procedures, identifying the following: (1) frequency of use, (2) regimen preferences, (3) personal indications, and (4) associated experience and demographics.

- **Methods**: Using a cross-sectional survey design, a questionnaire was emailed to all active and candidate members of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society. Supplementary questions captured demographic information. We invited 1136 members to participate; 22 addresses produced delivery failure messages, leaving 1114 members as potential participants. After nonresponses and exclusions, 312 (28%) responses were analyzed. Statistical analysis used Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and multivariate regression.

- **Results**: The majority (75%) of respondents reported the use of prophylactic postoperative oral antibiotics. Most users (69%) prescribed them to fewer than 25% of patients, although 16% prescribed them for all elective cases. The most frequent regimen was cephalexin 500 mg four times a day (63%), and the most common duration was 5 to 7 days (50%). Surgeons' most common indications were previous infection (71%), medical comorbidities (65%), and previous wound-healing difficulties.
