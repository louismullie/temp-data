## Question

What is the recommended treatment for a 90-year-old with a chronic dry, itchy cough?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for a 90-year-old with a chronic dry, "itchy" cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming chronicity, red flags, and baseline imaging. Then, I should verify medication triggers, especially ACE inhibitors. Next, I will consider the common etiologies to target empiric trials for UACS, GERD/LPR, and asthma/NAEB. After that, if symptoms persist, I will prioritize nonpharmacologic cough control therapy before cautiously layering pharmacologic options tailored to geriatric risks. Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring with validated tools and plan escalation or referral for refractory or unusual causes, including structural airway disorders [^112NbbbN] [^116q3BMN].

> Let me first confirm the classification and phenotype. I should verify that the cough has persisted beyond eight weeks to meet the definition of chronic cough and note that an "itchy" or tickle quality raises suspicion for cough hypersensitivity syndrome, which is common in refractory presentations, particularly in older adults reporting laryngeal sensations to trivial stimuli. I need to ensure we start with a chest radiograph to exclude overt structural or parenchymal disease before assuming benign causes, given age-related risk for serious pathology [^115ThUt5] [^112NbbbN] [^112fGGXP].

> Wait, let me verify I am not missing red flags before any empiric trials. I should explicitly check for hemoptysis, weight loss, fevers, dysphagia or aspiration events, progressive dyspnea at rest, or focal lung findings that would push me to expedited imaging beyond a CXR, such as CT, or targeted evaluation for malignancy, heart failure, or pulmonary embolism. Given the patient's age, my threshold for imaging is low and a CXR is appropriate as the first test, escalating based on findings or persistent concern despite a normal film [^112fGGXP] [^116q3BMN].

> I need to check medications next because this is a reversible trigger I can remove immediately. ACE inhibitor-induced cough can present as a dry cough days to months after initiation and typically resolves one to four weeks after discontinuation, though occasionally up to three months; replacing an ACE inhibitor with an ARB is reasonable given a cough incidence near placebo for ARBs. I should double-check the medication list for agents with anticholinergic burden that worsen airway dryness in a 90-year-old as well, but step one is stopping the ACE inhibitor if present and monitoring for resolution [^112BzfjR] [^114kQ7mD] [^111VZPBZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the most common etiologies before labeling the cough as refractory. In adults with a normal chest radiograph and no ACE inhibitor exposure, the dominant causes are upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and asthma or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis; I should target these with focused history, minimal testing, and time-bound therapeutic trials rather than treating everything indiscriminately, particularly in a frail nonagenarian [^112NbbbN] [^116q3BMN].

> For reflux, I almost said to start an empiric PPI right away, but wait, let me reconsider that. Guidelines advise against routine empiric acid suppression for unexplained chronic cough when typical GERD symptoms and objective evidence are absent due to limited efficacy and potential harms in older adults; I should reserve PPIs for those with classic symptoms like heartburn or regurgitation, and otherwise avoid acid suppression in the negative workup scenario. I need to emphasize lifestyle measures and careful assessment for LPR symptoms rather than reflexive PPIs in this age group [^111QAu5c] [^1122coLg].

> For asthma or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, I should confirm the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation when feasible using FeNO or sputum eosinophils because this predicts response to inhaled corticosteroids; if elevated or strongly suspected clinically, a short trial of ICS for about two to four weeks is reasonable, with careful geriatric dosing, a spacer, oral rinsing, and vigilance for thrush or bone effects. If cough variant asthma or NAEB is only partially responsive, I should consider stepping up ICS or adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist thoughtfully, after double-checking for alternative causes [^112Fobu6] [^112aZVVt] [^117CvTe3] [^116TEfuL].

> For upper airway cough syndrome, I need to check for nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, and throat clearing; if present, a time-limited trial of intranasal corticosteroid and, if allergic features exist, an antihistamine can be used, with careful attention to anticholinergic burden from first-generation agents in the elderly. I should confirm symptom changes within a few weeks to decide on continuation or step-down, avoiding long-term polypharmacy without justification in this vulnerable age group [^116q3BMN] [^112NbbbN].

> If symptoms persist despite optimized, guideline-concordant management of common causes, I should classify this as refractory chronic cough and, before adding systemic drugs, prioritize nonpharmacologic cough control therapy. Let me verify that multimodal speech-language pathology interventions are recommended first-line for refractory or unexplained chronic cough, as they improve laryngeal hypersensitivity with a strong safety profile that suits a 90-year-old, minimizing drug interactions and fall risk [^115tDYYg] [^112Rv1yB] [^116xvoUV] [^112NbbbN].

> If nonpharmacologic therapy is insufficient, I should consider neuromodulators cautiously. Gabapentin or pregabalin can reduce cough hypersensitivity, but I need to start low, go slow, adjust for renal function, and reassess the risk-benefit at six months, given sedation, dizziness, and falls in the elderly; I should document shared decision-making and set clear stop rules if benefits are not sustained [^1136XdHs] [^112tF1bg] [^112RevEc].

> Low-dose morphine can be considered only for severe, refractory cough with major quality-of-life impairment after other options fail. I must emphasize high caution in a 90-year-old due to constipation, delirium, respiratory depression, and falls, and I should use the lowest effective dose for a short monitored trial with frequent reassessment and clear discontinuation criteria if risks outweigh benefits [^114P88QZ] [^1133DQDu] [^114tCVZP].

> I should confirm the status of peripherally acting P2X3 antagonists. Gefapixant has phase 3 evidence supporting efficacy in refractory or unexplained chronic cough, but availability varies and it is not approved in the US or Canada, with taste disturbance being common and potentially problematic for nutrition in an older adult; next-generation agents such as camlipixant show promise in early trials, but I must acknowledge limited geriatric-specific data and keep these options as conditional, context-dependent considerations [^112NbbbN] [^112NbbbN] [^113NRogX].

> Next, I should review age-specific aggravating factors that can amplify cough hypersensitivity. Xerotrachea from dehydration or anticholinergic medications, unrecognized aspiration from dysphagia, and multimorbidity such as heart failure, COPD, or significant reflux can all perpetuate cough; I need to ensure adequate hydration, humidified air, medication simplification, and, when suggested by history, a swallowing evaluation. In patients with sicca features, I should remember that dryness-related cough warrants assessment for other treatable contributors beyond xerotrachea, with therapy tailored to the whole syndrome [^112NbbbN] [^1148Zbhq] [^113FwYZx] [^115HTGxU].

> I should double-check that monitoring is structured and objective. Using a validated quality-of-life tool such as the Leicester Cough Questionnaire at baseline and follow-up helps quantify change, guide shared decisions, and flag adverse impacts like stress incontinence or mood effects in older adults; persistent refractory symptoms despite optimized care should prompt referral to a specialized cough clinic to evaluate less common etiologies such as tracheobronchomalacia or habit cough, which can be missed without targeted assessment [^117E97xq] [^113GbbtL] [^113jETaj] [^113A7V65].

> Putting this together, let me outline the care sequence and timings so I do not miss opportunities or prolong ineffective therapy. First, obtain a chest radiograph and screen for red flags while stopping any ACE inhibitor and reassessing over one to four weeks; second, run focused, time-limited trials addressing UACS, reflux only if symptomatic, and eosinophilic airway disease with ICS if indicated over two to four weeks each; third, if cough persists, initiate cough control therapy with a speech-language pathologist; fourth, add neuromodulators such as gabapentin with geriatric safeguards and clear reassessment points, reserving low-dose morphine for rare, severe refractory cases; finally, consider clinical trial or regionally available P2X3 antagonists with careful attention to taste-related adverse effects and nutrition, and use LCQ-guided follow-up every four to eight weeks with escalation or referral as needed. I need to ensure each step has a defined stop point and objective assessment so we avoid therapeutic drift in this 90-year-old patient [^116q3BMN] [^115tDYYg] [^1136XdHs] [^111QAu5c] [^112aZVVt] [^117E97xq].

For a 90-year-old with a chronic, dry, itchy cough, prioritize **identifying and treating the underlying cause** (UACS, GERD, asthma, ACE inhibitors, ILD, or malignancy) [^116q3BMN] and **start with nonpharmacologic measures** (humidification, hydration, speech therapy) [^115tDYYg]. If cough persists, **consider a short trial** of low-dose morphine (2.5–5 mg BID) or gabapentin (100–300 mg at bedtime), with close monitoring for sedation, constipation, and falls. Avoid routine use of **PPIs, bronchodilators, or mucolytics** unless indicated by a specific diagnosis (PPIs [^1122coLg], bronchodilators [^116y4KEW], mucolytics [^112sjUPJ]). Reassess regularly, escalating care only if cough significantly impairs **quality of life** [^117E97xq].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough **diagnostic evaluation** is essential [^1136XdHs] to identify and treat underlying causes:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for GERD, UACS, asthma [^116q3BMN], ACE inhibitor use [^112BzfjR], ILD, malignancy, and medication side effects.

- **Chest radiograph**: Recommended initial imaging [^112fGGXP] for chronic cough > 8 weeks.

- **Pulmonary function tests**: Evaluate for asthma, COPD, or ILD.

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, thyroid function, and ACE levels if sarcoidosis is suspected.

- **Specialist referral**: Consider pulmonology or ENT if initial evaluation is inconclusive.

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are **first-line** given their safety and efficacy [^112Rv1yB]:

- **Humidification and hydration**: Use humidifiers and maintain adequate hydration to reduce mucosal dryness.

- **Speech therapy**: Cough control therapy is recommended [^112Rv1yB] for chronic refractory cough.

- **Environmental modifications**: Avoid irritants (smoke, strong odors, allergens).

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic therapy should be **individualized**, starting with the safest options [^112NbbbN]:

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Recommended use** | **Cautions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antitussives (dextromethorphan, codeine) | Short-term symptomatic relief [^114BiT1W] | Use cautiously; monitor for sedation, constipation, respiratory depression | Sedation, constipation, respiratory depression |
| Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) | Chronic refractory cough | Consider trial [^1136XdHs]; monitor for sedation, dizziness, falls | Sedation, dizziness, falls |
| Low-dose morphine | Chronic refractory cough | 2.5–5 mg BID [^114P88QZ]; monitor closely | Sedation, constipation, respiratory depression |
| Inhaled corticosteroids | Asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis | Short-term trial (2–4 weeks) | Oral thrush, dysphonia |
| Proton pump inhibitors | GERD-related cough | Only if GERD confirmed [^1122coLg] | Avoid routine use |
| Bronchodilators | Asthma, COPD | Only if airflow obstruction present [^116y4KEW] | Tremor, tachycardia |

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

Elderly patients require **careful monitoring** given their increased risk of adverse effects — including sedation and cognitive impairment — with antitussives, gabapentinoids, or opioids. Assess fall risk regularly and review medications to minimize interactions and side effects.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular **follow-up** is essential to assess efficacy and safety; track cough severity, frequency, and impact on quality of life [^113GbbtL]. Monitor for sedation, cognitive impairment, constipation, and respiratory depression, and titrate or discontinue medications based on response and side effects.

---

## When to escalate care

Escalate care when:

- **Persistent cough**: Despite initial interventions [^1136XdHs].

- **Severe adverse effects**: From medications [^112tF1bg].

- **Underlying disease progression**: Suspected or confirmed [^115wQR2b].

- **Significant quality of life impairment**: Due to cough [^115BPbfD].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging **therapies** such as P2X3 receptor antagonists (e.g. gefapixant) [^112NbbbN] show promise but are not yet widely available or approved in all regions.

---

## Conclusion

Management of a chronic, dry, itchy cough in a 90-year-old requires a structured approach: start by identifying and treating underlying causes, follow with nonpharmacologic interventions, and use pharmacologic therapies cautiously. Regular **monitoring** and **individualized care** are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects [^116q3BMN].

The characterization of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough (RCC and UCC, respectively) primarily stems from relatively small clinical studies. This study reports the baseline medical history and clinical characteristics of individuals with RCC or UCC who were enrolled in COUGH-1 and COUGH-2, two large, global phase 3 trials of gefapixant, a P2×3-receptor antagonist.

- **Methods**: Adults with a chronic cough lasting for more than 1 year, diagnosed with RCC or UCC, and scoring greater than 40 mm on a 100-mm cough severity visual analog scale at both screening and baseline were eligible for enrollment. Demographics, medical history, and cough characteristics were collected at baseline. Cough-related measures included objective cough frequency, cough severity visual analog scale, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, and Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire. The data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Of 2044 participants, 75% were women. The mean age was 58 years, and the mean cough duration was approximately 11 years. Among all participants, 73% were previously diagnosed with asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or upper airway cough syndrome. The mean Leicester Cough Questionnaire total score was 10.4, with domain scores reflecting impaired cough-specific quality of life across physical, psychological, and social domains. The mean Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire score was 39.6, with some of the most burdensome reported items being consistent with features of cough-reflex hypersensitivity.

### Cough hypersensitivity and chronic cough [^111iNfDa]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is globally prevalent across all age groups. This disorder is challenging to treat because many pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions can present with chronic cough, and cough can also be present without any identifiable underlying cause or be refractory to therapies that improve associated conditions. Most patients with chronic cough have cough hypersensitivity, characterized by increased neural responsivity to a range of stimuli that affect the airways, lungs, and other tissues innervated by common nerve supplies.

Cough hypersensitivity presents as excessive coughing often in response to relatively innocuous stimuli, causing significant psychophysical morbidity and affecting patients' quality of life. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to cough hypersensitivity and excessive coughing in different patient populations and across the lifespan is advancing and has contributed to the development of new therapies for chronic cough in adults. Owing to differences in the pathology, the organs involved, and individual patient factors, the treatment of chronic cough is progressing towards a personalized approach. In the future, novel ways to endotype patients with cough may prove valuable in management.

### Tools for assessing outcomes in studies of chronic cough: Chest guideline and expert panel report [^113GbbtL]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the 2006 American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) cough guidelines, a variety of tools has been developed or further refined for assessing cough. The purpose of the present committee was to evaluate instruments used by investigators performing clinical research on chronic cough. The specific aims were to (1) assess the performance of tools designed to measure cough frequency, severity, and impact in adults, adolescents, and children with chronic cough, and (2) make recommendations or suggestions related to these findings.

- **Methods**: By following the CHEST methodologic guidelines, the CHEST Expert Cough Panel based its recommendations and suggestions on a recently published comparative effectiveness review commissioned by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a corresponding summary published in CHEST, and an updated systematic review through November 2013. Recommendations or suggestions based on these data were discussed, graded, and voted on during a meeting of the Expert Cough Panel.

- **Results**: We recommend for adults, adolescents (≥ 14 years of age), and children complaining of chronic cough that validated and reliable health-related quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires be used as the measurement of choice to assess the impact of cough, such as the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire in adult and adolescent patients, and the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire in children. We recommend acoustic cough counting to assess cough frequency but not cough severity.

### Unexplained (idiopathic) cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1142fp6n]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

To review the literature on unexplained cough, previously referred to as idiopathic cough, we conducted a search of MEDLINE through May 2004. We focused on studies published in English since 1980 concerning human subjects, using medical subject heading terms such as "cough", "unexplained cough", and "idiopathic cough". Selected materials included case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials. References from these studies relevant to the topic were also obtained.

The diagnosis of unexplained (idiopathic) cough should only be considered following a thorough diagnostic and treatment approach for the most common causes of cough has been completed, and uncommon causes have been adequately evaluated. Unless this is done, it is likely that many patients with a definable cause of cough will be misdiagnosed as having "unexplained cough".

The diagnosis of unexplained cough is probably made too often based on an inadequate diagnostic workup or treatment course to determine the specific cause of cough. Nevertheless, there may be a group of patients in whom none of the usual explanations for cough may be present. For this group, the committee unanimously recommends using the diagnostic term "unexplained cough" rather than "idiopathic cough".

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFLÙ in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): A pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^116pRmnY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Coughing and irritation of the mucosa are mainly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. In young children, respiratory tract infections are extremely common and frequently recurrent. Pathogens often colonize the upper respiratory tract (nose or mouth) prior to causing lower respiratory infections or invasive diseases. The oral mucosa and epithelium play a protective role against the entry of microorganisms into the body. This mucosa is the main target tissue of microorganisms, such as viruses. Normally, primary infection results in viral replication at mucosal surfaces.

Upper respiratory tract infection is very frequent. Adult subjects experience 2 to 5 episodes per year, whereas school children suffer 7 to 10 episodes per year, coughing up to 140 days per year. Children are almost 4 times more likely to experience upper respiratory infection-associated acute coughs than adults. In this context, coughing is the most common symptom of many inflammatory diseases.

Coughing is a physiological response to airway irritation. It has two main functions: (1) to prevent the entry of food and fluids into the lower airways and (2) to favor the removal of material that exceeds the transport capacity of the mucociliary system. Coughing can be initiated by pharyngeal stimulation or mucosal dehydration. A cough may be classified according to its duration and characteristics. It is considered to be occasional when it lasts less than 3 days. Persistent coughs that last more than 7 days are usually treated with medicinal products. However, persistent…

### Cough and ACE inhibitors: The truth beyond placebo [^114kQ7mD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are extensively used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, supported by a wide range of clinical recommendations. However, the use of ACE inhibitors can lead to the onset of a dry cough. This symptom's prevalence may have been overestimated due to the lack of adequate control. A correct interpretation of available data necessitates a careful evaluation of placebo-controlled studies to definitively assess the rate of this most frequent adverse event associated with ACE inhibition.

### Therapeutic and mechanistic advances in chronic cough [^112NbbbN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Cough is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care in the outpatient setting. Chronic cough (CC) in adults is defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks, with a global prevalence of approximately 10%. CC significantly impairs quality of life, affecting physical, social, and psychological well-being. In most cases, CC is attributed to one or more of the following three key conditions: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis — assuming a normal chest x-ray result and no use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If the cough persists despite thorough guideline-based evaluation and treatment, it is classified as refractory CC (RCC). RCC is thought to arise from neuronal dysregulation involving both peripheral and central mechanisms, termed cough hypersensitivity syndrome. This is typically characterized by a tickle or itch sensation in the throat, leading to an urge to cough in response to seemingly harmless stimuli. Treatment options for RCC include "off-label" use of centrally acting neuromodulators and speech therapy. In addition, a new peripherally acting oral P2×3 receptor antagonist, gefapixant, has been approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Japan, though not in the United States or Canada. Emerging treatments hold promise for improving management in the future.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1131Cxg4]. Chest (2014). High credibility.

This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.

- **Methods**: The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics; these, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.

- **Results**: Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to health-care providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

- **Conclusions**: The resulting guidance statements are based on a rigorous methodology and transparency of process. Unless otherwise stated, the recommendations and suggestions meet the guidelines for trustworthiness.

### Management of chronic refractory cough [^115pU6u8]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic refractory cough (CRC) is defined as a cough that persists despite guideline-based treatment. It is seen in 20–46% of patients presenting to specialist cough clinics and has a substantial impact on quality of life and healthcare utilization. Several terms have been used to describe this condition, including the recently introduced term "cough hypersensitivity syndrome".

Key symptoms include a dry, irritated cough localized around the laryngeal region. Symptoms are not restricted to cough and can include globus, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Chronic refractory cough shares factors in common with laryngeal hypersensitivity syndromes and chronic pain syndromes, and these similarities help shed light on the pathophysiology of the condition. Its pathophysiology is complex and includes cough reflex sensitivity, central sensitization, peripheral sensitization, and paradoxical vocal fold movement.

Chronic refractory cough often occurs following a viral infection. The diagnosis is made once the main diseases that cause chronic cough have been excluded (or treated) and the cough remains refractory to medical treatment. Several treatments have been developed over the past decade. These include speech pathology interventions using techniques adapted from the treatment of hyperfunctional voice disorders, as well as the use of centrally acting neuromodulators such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Potential new treatments in development also show promise.

### Understanding the economic burden of chronic cough: A systematic literature review [^111uip1s]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC) is typically defined as a cough persisting for more than eight weeks. Although cough is a common reflex mechanism, excessive and prolonged cough can be highly burdensome to patients, disrupting daily activities for the individual and those around them. In severe cases, patients with CC may experience complications such as stress urinary incontinence, interference with speech, depression, and syncope, which can have a substantial negative impact on quality of life (QoL) and on activities of daily living.

Many patients with CC are believed to have cough reflex hypersensitivity, in which the reflex response occurs in response to low levels of stimulation from thermal, chemical, or mechanical sources. In some cases, CC is associated with an underlying comorbid condition, such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). When cough persists despite treatment of the associated condition, this is defined as refractory chronic cough (RCC). Conversely, unexplained chronic cough (UCC) may be diagnosed when all other aetiologies have been excluded through a thorough clinical evaluation and work-up. In both RCC and UCC, cough reflex hypersensitivity has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of CC. This review focuses on CC, inclusive of RCC and UCC.

### A register-based study: Cough - a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^116MZuen]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Over a period of 10 years (2008–2017), 203,688 patients redeemed ≥ 2 relevant prescriptions within 90 days. Of these, 99,472 were ineligible, and 104,216 were included in the prescription registry population (group 1). During the same period, 57,754 patients were diagnosed with a cough in the patient registry. Of these, 23,494 were ineligible, and 34,260 were included (group 2). A total of 4004 (6.9%) patients were excluded due to ACE inhibitor initiation less than 12 weeks prior to the diagnosis of cough. In the combined prescription and patient registry population, 11,209 patients had both ≥ 2 redeemed prescriptions and a diagnosis of cough. Of these, 8024 were ineligible, and 3185 were included (group 3).

All patients included are sorted in Table 1 using the definitions for UCC (no relevant co-morbidity ± 12 months from diagnosis) and RCC (cough-relevant co-morbidity related to diagnosis) and divided into three groups: prescription registry, patient registry, and the combination of the two. Of the 104,216 patients from the prescription registry group, 52,727 were classified as having UCC (primary outcome), and 51,489 were classified with RCC (secondary outcome). Of the 32,260 patients from the patient registry, 12,278 were classified as having UCC (primary outcome) and 21,982 as having RCC. There were 3185 patients present in both the prescription registry and the patient registry, where 529 were classified as having UCC and 2656 as having RCC.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than eight weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^113P5vYx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

CC is a burdensome condition that is thought to be characterized by dysregulation of the vagal sensory neurons that mediate cough. Several molecular targets have been investigated based on their potential roles in the underlying pathophysiology of RCC and UCC. Although results at the time of writing have varied between investigative approaches and there are currently no new approved treatments with indications for these conditions, promising results have been reported for some investigated pharmacologic treatments. Owing to the heterogeneity underlying chronic cough, it is likely that the best therapeutic approach will vary by patient, and further multidisciplinary research is needed to establish the best treatment pathways for this patient population.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112BzfjR]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

A dry, persistent cough is a well-described class effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medications. The mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough remains unresolved, but likely involves the protussive mediators bradykinin and substance P, agents that are degraded by ACE and therefore accumulate in the upper respiratory tract or lung when the enzyme is inhibited, and prostaglandins, the production of which may be stimulated by bradykinin.

- **Methods**: Data for this review were obtained from a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, which was performed in May 2004, covering the literature published in the English language from 1985 to 2004. The search terms used were "angiotensin-converting enzyme", "angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors", and "cough".

- **Results**: The incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough has been reported to range from 5 to 35% among patients treated with these agents. However, a much lower incidence has been described in studies of patients presenting for the evaluation of chronic cough. The onset of ACE inhibitor-induced cough can occur within hours of the first dose to months after the initiation of therapy. Resolution typically occurs within 1 to 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy, but cough may linger for up to 3 months. The only uniformly effective treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced cough is the cessation of treatment with the offending agent. The incidence of cough associated with therapy with angiotensin-receptor blockers appears to be similar to that of the control drug. In a minority of patients, cough may persist.

### What causes cough in pulmonary fibrosis, and how should we treat it [^113rqQ5N]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cough in pulmonary fibrosis is a common and distressing symptom that significantly affects patients' quality of life. Understanding the mechanisms behind cough is crucial for developing effective treatments. Various factors, including inflammation, fibrosis, and altered cough reflexes, contribute to this condition.

Current treatment options are limited, with most focusing on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying causes. Therapies under investigation include the use of antitussive agents and therapies targeting specific mechanisms of cough generation. Comprehensive research is necessary to better understand these mechanisms and develop targeted therapies that can improve patient outcomes.

### Chronic cough: State-of-the-art review [^112gKJvB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common presenting complaint in adults seeking medical treatment in an ambulatory setting. Chronic cough, persisting longer than 3 weeks, can be associated with myriad diseases that may overlap multiple medical specialties. For this reason, a thorough assessment of the patient with chronic cough relies on a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation between pulmonary medicine, gastroenterology, and otolaryngology. Despite this daunting task, success can be achieved in up to 90% of patients with chronic cough if a systematic and thorough approach is used. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state-of-the-art in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough for the practicing otolaryngologist.

### The heterogeneity of chronic cough: A case for endotypes of cough hypersensitivity [^1132ANRb]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018).

Cough is a troublesome and difficult-to-treat symptom that accompanies a diverse range of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Although considerable advances have been made over recent years in basic cough biology, this has not translated into improved clinical management. A major challenge has been in understanding the heterogeneity underlying the development and persistence of chronic cough in different patients. We present evidence that such heterogeneity begins with the multiple peripheral and central neural pathways capable of eliciting cough and associated respiratory behaviors and extends to incorporate the diversity of diseases that underlie cough and the clinical phenotypic and pathological endotypic presentations that can vary substantially between individual patients with cough. A better understanding of how these sources of heterogeneity are expressed across individual patients with chronic cough is needed to better predict the efficacy of clinical management strategies and of specifically targeted therapies, which will facilitate the development of more personalized clinical approaches to treat patients with chronic cough.

### Characteristics of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-associated cough: A case-control study [^115JJFum]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cough is the most common symptom for seeking medical advice worldwide. Successful management of chronic cough involves identifying the underlying disorder that maintains the cough and providing effective therapy for it. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one, though rare, possible underlying disorder for cough. IPF is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) with an unknown cause. The prognosis of IPF after diagnosis is only 3–5 years, depending on the variable course of the disease. Due to the progressive nature of IPF, recognizing early signs of the disease is crucial. Early diagnosis is needed to initiate anti-fibrotic medication and slow down disease progression. The first symptoms of IPF include exertional dyspnea and cough. The prevalence of cough among IPF patients varies between 75–85%. Cough is associated with impairment of quality of life (QoL) and also predicts the time to hospitalization, death, and lung transplantation. IPF cough is commonly characterized as dry or non-productive; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous controlled studies on this issue.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether cough in early-stage IPF is less productive than chronic cough in a community-based population. We also investigated whether there are differences between these populations with respect to the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) total score, domain scores, and four special questions raised from the LCQ: cough response to paint or fumes, cough disturbing sleep, and cough frequency.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent, and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

### Hyzaar [^111VZPBZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Persistent dry cough has been associated with the use of ACE inhibitors and can lead to the discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy in practice. Two prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had previously experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who exhibited a typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril, and whose cough subsided with placebo, were randomized to receive either losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, placebo (one study, n = 97), or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 135). The double-blind treatment period lasted up to eight weeks. These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy, in a population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy, is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy.

Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of Hyzaar. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
	- **Digestive**: Hepatitis has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan.
	- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia.
	- **Hypersensitivity**: Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx.

### Unexplained disabling and long-lasting cough: a case report [^113jETaj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old woman was referred to our department due to a chronic dry cough lasting six years without an etiological diagnosis. The patient suffered from chronic deterioration in her quality of life due to a persistent cough that sounded like a barking seal.

- **Case presentation**: A severe form of malacia involving the inferior third of the trachea and the main bronchi was diagnosed. According to our protocol, a self-expandable prosthesis was placed in the distal portion of the trachea via rigid bronchoscopy with excellent results in cough relief. The patient was subsequently scheduled for tracheobronchoplastic surgery with a polypropylene matrix. Two and a half years after surgery, the patient had a significant improvement in quality of life with a complete resolution of her symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: This report demonstrated that tracheobronchomalacia can be difficult to diagnose with a serious impact on the patient's life. Referral to a specialized center is essential in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of this disease. Surgical treatment by tracheobronchoplasty may represent a good solution in selected patients.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^112GCyRn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC), defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks, is a common medical condition with a global prevalence of approximately 10%, and a higher prevalence in Oceania, Europe, and the United States. The burden of CC can be severe, as patients with CC experience substantial physical effects such as stress urinary incontinence, sleep disturbance, and chest pain. Psychological consequences include frustration, anxiety, and depression. Social impairments, including social distress/isolation and the inability to carry out daily activities, also contribute, leading to a reduced quality of life. Moreover, the burden of CC is often long-lasting, as some patients experience symptoms that persist for several years despite numerous doctor visits, empirical treatment trials, and frequent medical testing.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: Part 2. Demographic and clinical considerations: CHEST expert panel report [^1148Zbhq]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Cough characteristics vary between patients, and this variability can impact clinical diagnosis and care. The purpose of part two of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on the global physiology and pathophysiology of cough.

- **Study design and methods**: A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019 with prespecified search terms.

- **Results**: We describe the demographics of typical patients with cough in the clinical setting, including how cough characteristics change across age. We summarize the effect of common clinical conditions impacting cough mechanics and the physical properties of mucus on airway clearance.

- **Interpretation**: This is the second of a two-part update to the 2006 CHEST cough guideline; it complements part one on the basic phenomenology of cough by providing an extended clinical picture of cough along with the factors that alter cough mechanics and efficiency in patients. A greater understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cough will improve clinical management.

### Long-term prognosis of chronic cough: a prospective, observational cohort study [^116NcWDa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cough is a clinically important symptom. It is the most common reason people seek medical attention and has a strong negative effect on the quality of life (QoL). This is particularly true for chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting longer than eight weeks. Understanding the long-term prognosis of chronic cough and its determinants would be valuable to guide the management of individuals with this condition.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study on the long-term prognosis of chronic cough. This study included 42 subjects with unexplained (idiopathic) chronic cough who attended a specialist cough clinic seven years earlier. At reassessment, the cough was unchanged or had worsened in 60% of the patients. The population of that study can be regarded as selected because one or more treatable causes of chronic cough can usually be identified. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the long-term prognosis and its determinants in a more representative group of subjects with chronic cough.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion. With the emergence of the new clinical and mechanistic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^1167P47N]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Recently, we identified in patients with chronic cough a sensory dysregulation whereby the urge-to-cough (UTC) or coughing is mechanically evoked from "somatic points for cough" (SPCs) in the neck and upper trunk. We investigated the prevalence and clinical relevance of SPCs in an unselected population of patients with chronic cough.

From 2018 to 2021, symptoms of 317 consecutive patients with chronic cough (233 females) were collected over four visits (V1–V4) two months apart at the Cough Clinic of the University Hospital in Florence, Italy. Participants rated the disturbance caused by the cough (0–9 modified Borg Scale). We attempted to evoke coughing and/or UTC using mechanical actions in all participants, who were subsequently categorized as responsive (somatic point for cough positive, SPC+) or unresponsive (SPC−) to these actions. An association was established between chronic cough and its common causes; treatments were administered accordingly.

- **Findings**: 169 patients were SPC+ and had a higher baseline cough score (p < 0.01). In most patients, treatments reduced (p < 0.01) cough-associated symptoms. All patients reported a decrease (p < 0.01) in cough score at V2 (from 5.70 ± 1.4 to 3.43 ± 1.9 and from 5.01 ± 1.5 to 2.74 ± 1.7 for SPC+ and SPC− patients respectively). However, while in SPC− patients the cough score continued to decrease, indicating virtually complete cough disappearance at V4 (0.97 ± 0.8), in SPC+ patients this variable remained close to V2 values during the entire follow-up.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: Part 1: Cough phenomenology - CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116djdQt]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians 2006 guideline on the global physiology and pathophysiology of cough. A literature review was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019, utilizing prespecified search terms. We describe the basic phenomenology of cough patterns, behaviors, and morphological features. We update the understanding of mechanical and physiological characteristics of cough, adding a contemporary view of the types of cough and their associated behaviors and sensations. New information about acoustic characteristics is presented, and recent insights into cough triggers and the patient cough hypersensitivity phenotype are explored. Lastly, because the clinical assessment of patients largely focuses on the duration rather than morphological features of cough, we review the morphological features of cough that can be measured in the clinic. This is the first of a two-part update to the American College of Chest Physicians 2006 cough guideline; it provides a more global consideration of cough phenomenology, beyond simply the mechanical aspects of a cough. A greater understanding of the typical features of cough, and their variations, may allow for a more informed interpretation of cough measurements and their clinical relevance for patients.

### Habit cough [^113A7V65]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review habit cough and its treatments to raise awareness of this condition as a potential cause of chronic cough.

Data sources included relevant articles and references published between January 1, 1962, and April 30, 2008, which were located through a PubMed search using the keywords: habit cough, psychogenic cough, chronic cough, and tic cough.

Study selection involved reviewing all key relevant articles, with the most pertinent ones selected for inclusion in this review.

Results indicated that habit cough is a diagnosis of exclusion and can occur in both children and adults with chronic cough. Characteristic features include a loud honking or barking cough, disruption of normal activities, and the frequent presence of a secondary gain (such as school absence). Successful treatment has been described in several case reports and predominantly involves nonpharmacologic measures.

The conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering habit cough in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough, as early diagnosis can help to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and potential iatrogenic complications.

### Camlipixant in refractory chronic cough: A phase 2a, randomized controlled trial (RELIEF) [^113NRogX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years, had refractory chronic cough (RCC) for one or more years, and exhibited an awake cough frequency of ten or more coughs per hour at screening, measured by ambulatory cough recording. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive camlipixant or placebo for 16 days. After a 10- to 14-day washout period, patients crossed over to the alternative 16-day treatment period. Escalating camlipixant doses were orally administered (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg, all twice daily), each over four days. Matched placebo tablets were administered twice daily during the placebo treatment period.

- **Study design and results**: A forest plot showed the mean placebo-adjusted change in awake cough frequency for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and prespecified subgroups at each dose level. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and P values (two-sided) are presented, with ✱ p < 0.05* indicating significance. Patients were treated BID for four days at each dose level. A mixed model for repeated measures was used to compare camlipixant with placebo for all cough frequency endpoints, with data analyzed on a natural log scale. Sensitivity analyses assessed the primary efficacy endpoint in the per-protocol and completers groups, through worst-case imputation, and in the ITT population. BID = twice daily; CI = confidence interval.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the placebo-adjusted change from baseline in awake cough frequency at each dose. Prespecified analyses also investigated the interaction between baseline awake cough frequency and treatment effect.

### Methods of cough assessment [^113RoK2m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

The accurate and consistent assessment of cough is essential not only for optimum standards of clinical care but also to drive forward advances in our understanding of cough. A range of tools for the subjective and objective measurement of cough exists, and their ongoing development has coincided with growth in clinical and preclinical research in cough, resulting in novel findings and promising new treatments. The most widely used and most fruitful approaches to assessing cough are discussed, along with some newer and preliminary techniques and directions for the future. These include methods for measuring cough-specific quality of life, subjective severity, cough frequency, intensity, and sensitivity of the underlying cough reflex. Ongoing development and more widespread adoption of cough assessment tools should help describe the heterogeneity of cough phenotypes and may better guide treatment by enabling prediction of responses to pharmacological and nonpharmacological antitussive therapies. More detailed assessments of cough may also bring benefits in measuring the transmission of respiratory infections or in managing reduced airway protection in neuromuscular disease. Population-wide assessments should also help understand the epidemiology of cough and assist in screening for disease.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treatment of these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care.

Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and jeopardizing development of improved treatments. We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough.

We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.
