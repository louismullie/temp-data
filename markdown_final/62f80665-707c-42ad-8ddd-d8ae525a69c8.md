## Question

How often to do echocardiogram on patient with prior valve replacement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the appropriate frequency of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) after prosthetic valve replacement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline post-procedural TTE timing. Then, I should distinguish mechanical versus bioprosthetic valves. Next, I will review special cases such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), mitral valve repair, and tricuspid/pulmonary valve replacements. After that, I need to integrate clinical status and risk modifiers that change surveillance intervals. Finally, I should align the approach with imaging modality choices, cost and system constraints, and a practical implementation summary, making sure each point is guideline-anchored and internally consistent.

> Let me first confirm the baseline study. A post-procedural TTE is recommended for all patients after valve replacement to establish baseline hemodynamics and ventricular function, ideally at 1 to 3 months after discharge, although in some centers it is performed during the index hospitalization. If pre-discharge TTE is omitted, contemporary data suggest safety with routine 30-day imaging, but the guideline default remains 1 to 3 months, and this baseline becomes the "fingerprint" for future comparisons [^115TzQJq] [^111DFDfL] [^1175mcUo] [^112i2TTT] [^1168LhmN].

> Now, I will examine mechanical valves. Hold on, let me verify the surveillance cadence: for normally functioning mechanical valves, routine annual TTE is not indicated if the postoperative baseline is normal and there is no clinical change. Surveillance should be symptom-driven with TTE prompted by new or changing signs or symptoms suggesting dysfunction, with adjunct imaging such as TEE, gated CT, or fluoroscopy if TTE is non-diagnostic or suspicion remains high [^115TzQJq] [^111pRXwa] [^116mcqPJ] [^116tMwtj].

> Next, I should review bioprosthetic surgical valves. Wait, let me verify the timing: TTE at 5 and 10 years after implantation, then annually thereafter, is reasonable even without clinical change. This schedule recognizes that structural valve degeneration accelerates after 5 years and is common by 10 years, with risk influenced by age and valve position. If risk factors for early degeneration are present, more frequent imaging may be justified in shared decision-making discussions [^115TzQJq] [^111pRXwa] [^1175mcUo] [^111F6GyY].

> For TAVI, I need to check the surveillance pattern. Annual TTE is reasonable after the baseline study, reflecting early and evolving experience and the need to track durability and hemodynamics over time. While some trial frameworks adopted more frequent early checks (discharge, 30 days, 1 year), the ACC/AHA guidance supports annual TTE in stable patients absent clinical change, and emerging data suggest that eliminating a routine pre-discharge TTE can be safe in carefully selected cohorts with early follow-up secured [^115TzQJq] [^111pRXwa] [^11732JYY] [^112i2TTT].

> I will now examine surgical mitral valve repair. Let me confirm: a baseline TTE at 1 to 3 months is recommended, then a TTE at 1 year, followed by every 2 to 3 years if stable. Importantly, residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation is the strongest predictor of long-term failure, so any change in symptoms or examination warrants earlier reassessment [^115Qxf6M] [^1175mcUo].

> For transcatheter mitral interventions, I should double-check the early schedule. TTE is typically performed at 1 day, 30 days, and 6 to 12 months to assess acute results and device effectiveness, with annual TTE thereafter in stable patients; these early checkpoints are crucial for procedural complications and durability, and they complement the long-term ACC/AHA surveillance cadence [^117T1RSB] [^1175mcUo].

> Tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacements deserve separate consideration. Let me verify pulmonary valve follow-up: many programs use TTE at discharge, 1 month, 3 or 6 months, 1 year, and then annually, with CMR often at 6 months to a year and then every 3 years; tricuspid prostheses are often more amenable to TTE assessment, but still require attention to RV size and function and pulmonary pressures during surveillance [^115N5gCi] [^115ukXKa].

> But wait, what if clinical status changes? I need to ensure we do not miss symptom-driven imaging. Any new or changing symptoms, exam findings, or concerns for endocarditis should prompt immediate TTE, with TEE, gated CT, or fluoroscopy added if TTE is non-diagnostic or suspicion persists; in suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis, TEE has higher sensitivity and a single negative TEE does not exclude infection if clinical suspicion remains, warranting repeat imaging [^115TzQJq] [^116tMwtj] [^112cWWrv] [^111ydtSk].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that may intensify surveillance. In pregnancy, imaging frequency should increase to monitor maternal and fetal tolerance. In patients with LV dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, or other comorbidities that alter hemodynamics, closer intervals may be appropriate. For bicuspid aortopathy with aortic diameter ≥ 4.0 cm at the time of AVR, lifelong aortic surveillance for enlargement is recommended at intervals determined by size and growth rate. In infective endocarditis, follow-up TTE/TEE is indicated to track response and complications. Finally, patients should be educated to report symptoms promptly to trigger earlier imaging when indicated [^112m3R9c] [^111ydtSk] [^116tMwtj] [^1175mcUo].

> I should also confirm imaging modality selection. TTE is the primary modality for periodic surveillance. TEE is preferred when prosthetic mitral regurgitation is suspected or TTE is limited by shadowing. Gated cardiac CT or fluoroscopy can help distinguish thrombus from pannus and assess leaflet/occluder motion. In selected cases, CMR can add value for regurgitation quantification and tissue characterization, and multimodality imaging should be integrated with clinical context and the baseline "fingerprint" study [^115TzQJq] [^1153RwQK] [^111sqak5].

> Hold on, I should verify the system-level constraints and cost considerations. The British Heart Valve Society highlights long echocardiography wait times and supports tiered approaches with basic/focused scans to safely increase capacity; in valve clinics, protocolized surveillance reduces unnecessary comprehensive studies and cardiologist visits without compromising safety, and adherence to guideline intervals helps avoid low-yield routine imaging while protecting those who truly need it [^115ozoFe] [^112GPECS] [^114WgntU].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-centered cadence and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Baseline TTE at 1 to 3 months for all prosthetic valves to establish a benchmark; mechanical valves: no routine annual TTE if baseline is normal and no clinical change, reassess with new symptoms or exam changes; bioprosthetic surgical valves: TTE at 5 and 10 years, then annually; TAVI: annual TTE after baseline; mitral repair: baseline, 1 year, then every 2 to 3 years; transcatheter mitral: 1 day, 30 days, 6 to 12 months, then annually; pulmonary valve replacement: discharge, 1 month, 3 to 6 months, 1 year, then annually, with CMR at 6 to 12 months and then every 3 years; all schedules are accelerated by new symptoms, exam changes, suspected endocarditis, or device-related complications [^115TzQJq] [^1175mcUo] [^117T1RSB] [^115N5gCi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought some programs mandated annual TTE for mechanical valves across the board; let me reconsider and verify. That would be overly conservative in stable patients with a normal baseline and no clinical change, and the ACC/AHA guidance explicitly states routine annual TTE is not needed for mechanical valves in this scenario, reinforcing a symptom-triggered strategy instead of fixed-interval imaging [^115TzQJq] [^116mcqPJ].

> Finally, I should double-check that this plan is adaptable to evolving evidence and local practice. Guidelines emphasize tailoring surveillance to valve type, time since implantation, ventricular function, concurrent conditions, and patient-reported status; as durability data mature and risk stratification improves, surveillance intensity can be individualized within the framework above, always returning to the baseline TTE for comparative assessment and escalating to TEE or CT when the clinical question demands it [^115uLeRL] [^111DFDfL] [^115TzQJq].

For patients with prior valve replacement, obtain a **baseline TTE 1–3 months post-procedure** [^1175mcUo] to establish prosthesis function and ventricular status [^115TzQJq]. After that, use **annual TTE for bioprosthetic valves (including TAVI)** [^1175mcUo] [^11732JYY] given the risk of structural degeneration [^116mcqPJ]. For mechanical valves, routine annual TTE is not required if the baseline is normal and the patient is asymptomatic; instead, use symptom-triggered TTE [^114YS8ot] [^116tMwtj]. For all valve types, repeat TTE promptly if new symptoms or signs of dysfunction occur [^115TzQJq], and add TEE, CT, or fluoroscopy if TTE is inconclusive or suspicion remains high [^1153RwQK].

---

## Baseline echocardiography after valve replacement

A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended **1–3 months after valve replacement** [^115TzQJq] to assess prosthesis function and ventricular size/function; if clinically indicated, it may be performed during the index hospitalization [^111DFDfL] [^115uLeRL].

---

## Follow-up echocardiography frequency based on valve type

### Bioprosthetic valves

For bioprosthetic valves, **annual TTE** [^111pRXwa] is reasonable after the baseline study, as structural valve degeneration can develop over time [^116mcqPJ]. Specifically, for surgical bioprostheses, TTE at 5 and 10 years, then annually thereafter, is reasonable even without clinical change [^113NJP3b].

---

### Mechanical valves

For mechanical valves, routine annual TTE is **not indicated** [^116mcqPJ] if the baseline study is normal and there are no clinical changes; imaging should be symptom-triggered [^114YS8ot].

---

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)

For TAVI, **annual TTE** [^111pRXwa] is reasonable [^11732JYY] after the baseline study to monitor for late complications or degeneration.

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting earlier or additional echocardiography

Regardless of routine schedule, obtain **earlier or additional echocardiography** in the following scenarios:

- **New or worsening symptoms**: Dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or signs of heart failure [^116tMwtj].
- **Suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction**: New murmur, hemolysis, or embolic events [^115TzQJq] [^116e4WNJ].
- **Infective endocarditis suspicion**: Fever with positive blood cultures or new regurgitation [^116TKFuc].
- **Perioperative evaluation**: Before noncardiac surgery if there has been no recent echocardiogram [^113REeec].

---

## Additional imaging modalities

When TTE is inconclusive or suspicion for complications remains high, **TEE, CT, or fluoroscopy** are recommended to better define prosthesis function or complications [^1153RwQK] [^115TzQJq].

---

## Echocardiography frequency after valve replacement

| **Valve type** | **Baseline TTE** | **Routine follow-up TTE** | **Additional imaging** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bioprosthetic (surgical) | 1–3 months post-op | - Annual after baseline <br/> - Then 5 and 10 years, then annually | TEE, CT, or fluoroscopy if suspected dysfunction |
| Mechanical | 1–3 months post-op | Symptom-triggered only | TEE, CT, or fluoroscopy if suspected dysfunction |
| TAVI | 1–3 months post-op | Annual after baseline | TEE, CT, or fluoroscopy if suspected dysfunction |

---

## Clinical implications of inadequate follow-up

Inadequate follow-up can delay detection of **structural degeneration, thrombosis, or endocarditis**, increasing morbidity and mortality. Regular, guideline-directed imaging ensures timely intervention and improves outcomes [^1163jCg9].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing follow-up frequency

Patient-specific factors may necessitate **more frequent imaging**:

- **Age**: Younger patients may require closer monitoring due to longer expected valve longevity.
- **Comorbidities**: Atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction, or hypercoagulable states may increase risk of complications.
- **Valve position**: Mitral valves may require closer monitoring due to higher complication rates.

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend baseline TTE 1–3 months post-procedure, with subsequent imaging tailored to valve type, patient status, and clinical changes [^115TzQJq] [^1175mcUo]. Annual TTE is reasonable for bioprosthetic valves, whereas mechanical valves require only symptom-triggered imaging if the baseline is normal [^116mcqPJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with prior valve replacement should have a **baseline TTE 1–3 months post-procedure**, followed by annual TTE for bioprosthetic valves (including TAVI) and symptom-triggered imaging for mechanical valves. Earlier or additional imaging is warranted for new symptoms, suspected dysfunction, or endocarditis.

Evaluation of suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction — TEE is the preferred approach for initial assessment of suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction because it measures transvalvular velocity, gradient, and valve area and quantifies LV volumes and LVEF, estimates pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and evaluates right heart function. The LA side of a prosthetic mitral valve is obscured by acoustic shadowing from the TTE approach, whereas TEE provides superior imaging of the LA side and is accurate for diagnosis of prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction; both TTE and TEE are needed when acoustic shadowing affects different aspects of prosthetic aortic valves. TEE has superior sensitivity for detecting vegetations and abscess in suspected prosthetic valve (or annuloplasty ring) endocarditis, and with mechanical valve obstruction, fluoroscopy or CT can be helpful to detect reduced motion due to pannus ingrowth or thrombus. Repeat noninvasive assessment begins with transthoracic echocardiography, comparison with the index postoperative study when available, and additional modalities as dictated by clinical context; attention should be directed to trends in recent INR determinations.

Table 1
The four levels of echocardiogram (TTE).

In the early literature, now 15–20 years old, comparisons of basic/level 1 studies using a hand‐held machine against standard TTE on a high‐end machine occasionally showed that abnormalities may be missed. However even with early technology the negative predictive accuracy was 90%–97%.

Since then, machines and practice have advanced. The American Society of Echocardiography published guidelines covering indications, practice and training in basic/level 1 and focussed studies in 2013. The European Society published guidance in 2011 with an update in 2019 stressing that hand‐held devices were inevitable and desirable, mainly based on the improved quality of such hand‐held devices.

More recent clinical studies have used defined protocols for a basic/level 1 study with qualified and appropriately experienced personnel and a hierarchical approach progressing to a broader study (Table 1) guided by abnormalities in the basic/level 1 study. In these clinical validation papers, significant pathology has not been missed. A recent report showed that a basic/level 1 study could be supplemented by focussed "add‐ons" according to the clinical question with no safety concerns and significant saving of time. As an example supporting this, in a chest pain clinic, basic/level 1 studies detected unexpected HVD with a median scan time of 7 min. The adoption of a basic/level 1 protocol in place of a comprehensive study cut the waiting time for an outpatient echocardiogram from 42 to 14 days and a recent meta‐analysis also confirmed the safety and efficacy of hand‐held scans for assessing LV function.

2 Conclusion

This Consensus Statement from the British Heart Valve Society aims to address the increasing waiting lists for echocardiography for patients with suspected valvular heart disease in the UK. It may not be applicable for other countries where echocardiography provision could vary. While a full comprehensive study has long been considered necessary, currently we advocate for shorter studies to enable a higher number of patients to have a suitable scan earlier on. The objective of our Recommendations is to increase capacity safely, thus minimizing potential risks linked to delays in obtaining timely scans.

Prosthetic heart valve echocardiography — evaluation challenges are highlighted: echocardiography of prosthetic heart valves is more demanding than for native valves, almost all replacement valves are obstructive compared with normal native valves and the degree of obstruction varies with valve type and size, making it difficult to differentiate design‑related obstruction from mild obstruction due to pathologic changes and prosthesis‑patient mismatch, most mechanical valves and many biologic valves are associated with trivial or mild transprosthetic regurgitation with patterns varying by design, shielding and artifacts can make insonation of the valve and associated regurgitant jets difficult, a full transthoracic echocardiographic study requires multiple angulations and off‑axis views, intermittent obstruction may rarely necessitate prolonged Doppler examination, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more likely to be needed than for native valves — especially in the mitral position — to evaluate prosthetic structure and complications including regurgitation.

1.4.2 Recommendation 6

Echocardiography is indicated if infective endocarditis is likely from the presentation and from the results of initial tests, particularly blood cultures. It should not be used as a screen for endocarditis in someone with fever.

1.4.2.1 Background to Recommendation 6

Requests based on presence of fever alone are common, but not indicated. There is a trend to use the Duke criteria as a protocol for tests. The Duke criteria are intended to aid the formulation in clinical practice. The initial suspicion of infective endocarditis is based on clinical characteristics and not presence of fever alone. We would advocate for a multidisciplinary approach involving medical teams, cardiology and infectious disease/microbiology before requesting echocardiography.

Using echocardiography as a "fever screen" wastes resources since the yield is very low and risks minor abnormalities or normal variants confounding the diagnosis for example, minor calcification, fibrin strands.

Early antibiotic therapy is key and particularly important for reducing the risk of embolization. Therefore, patients with a moderate or high likelihood of infective endocarditis should have echocardiography on the day of the request. If the patient is in heart failure or critically ill and might require urgent or emergency surgery, the study should be performed immediately. Ideally a member of the infective endocarditis team will guide the clinical urgency.

A comprehensive study (and not a basic/level 1 or focussed study) is required since multiple views may be needed to show vegetations and local complications including an aortic root abscess, and communication with the cardiology team for consideration of transoesophageal echocardiography.

Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) — left atrioventricular valve surgery considerations indicate that although this valve is not anatomically the same as a mitral valve, criteria for considering surgery can be extrapolated from the VHD guideline for mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis; anatomic differences and the anterior, narrow, potentially obstructed LVOT mean congenital surgical expertise is needed; patients often have had at least 1 prior repair and may have subaortic stenosis; pacemaker need was higher with valve replacement than repair; one third of repaired patients required an additional reoperation; when replacement is required mechanical versus bioprosthetic choice is individualized, but mechanical is usually necessary due to potential LVOT obstruction from bioprosthetic struts; and valve repair is preferred when technically feasible.

### Echocardiographic assessment of prosthetic heart valves [^1168LhmN]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Valvular heart disease is a global health problem. It is estimated that more than 280,000 prosthetic heart valves are implanted worldwide each year. As the world's population is aging, the incidence of prosthetic heart valve implantation and the prevalence of prosthetic heart valves continue to increase. Assessing heart valve prosthesis function remains challenging, as prosthesis malfunction is unpredictable but not uncommon. Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is the preferred method for assessing prosthetic valve function. Clinically useful Doppler-derived measures for assessing prosthetic valve hemodynamic profiles have been reported for aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve prostheses, but echocardiographic data regarding pulmonary valve prostheses remain limited. Complete prosthetic valve evaluation by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is sometimes challenging due to acoustic shadowing and artifacts. In these cases, further imaging with transesophageal echocardiography, fluoroscopy and/or gated CT may be warranted, particularly if prosthetic valve dysfunction is suspected. Being able to differentiate pathologic versus functional obstruction of an individual prosthesis is extremely important, as this distinction affects management decisions. Transprosthetic and periprosthetic regurgitation may be difficult to visualize on TTE, so careful review of Doppler-derived data combined with a high index of suspicion is warranted, particularly in symptomatic patients. A baseline TTE soon after valve implantation is indicated in order to "fingerprint" the prosthesis hemodynamic profile. It remains unclear how frequently serial imaging should be performed in order to assess prosthetic valve function, as this issue has not been systematically studied.

1 Introduction

Heart valve disease (HVD) is a common, but frequently undetected condition (Figure 1). Under‐detection leads to late presentation with almost half of patients having severe (grade III/IV) symptoms at the time of assessment for surgery, something that adversely affects their longer‐term prognosis. Moderate or severe HVD is also common in patients with acute de novo heart failure.

Figure 1
Pyramid of valve disease All numbers are from England and Wales in 2020/21. Tip of the pyramid: There were 4178 aortic valve replacements, 6730 TAVI and 1813 mitral procedures (1118 repairs and 695 replacements). Valve clinic: From OxVALVE 625 000 people aged > 65 were projected to have moderate or severe valve disease detected. Community prevalence: 1 750 000 people aged > 65 were projected to have detected or undetected moderate or severe HVD and to this was added 1% of the population or 596 000 as a conservative estimate of younger patients with bicuspid valves and mitral prolapse. On census day 2021 the population of England and Wales was 59 597 542.

A major barrier to early detection in the United Kingdom currently, is the waiting time for outpatient transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Early in 2022, 155 000 people were waiting for TTE. We know that outpatient TTEs are indicated for a murmur in 30%–59% of cases and that about 18% have moderate or severe HVD. This means that up to 91 450 on the waiting list were indicated as a result of clinical auscultation of a murmur and of those. From them, an estimate of 16 000 having moderate or severe HVD. Inevidably, these patients with moderate or severe HVD are at a potential risk of decompensation. In our experience, it is usually extremely difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate those with significant HVD from those with mild or no HVD based on the request form alone, acknowledging that the request can come from a variety of specialists including cardiologists, other physicians, surgeons and general practitioners.

Meanwhile, staffing levels remain inadequate to cope with demand. A pertinent survey by the British Society of Echocardiography in February 2022 noted that 10% of the workforce were locums with up to 3 posts being simultaneously unfilled in some Trusts. This causes significant problems in trying to reduce the waiting lists, with many places seeing an increase in the numbers of patients waiting for echocardiography.

### Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's guidelines and standards committee and the task force on prosthetic valves, developed in conjunction with the American college of cardiology cardiovascular imaging committee, cardiac imaging committee of the American Heart Association, the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography and the Canadian society of echocardiography, endorsed by the American college of cardiology foundation, American Heart Association, European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography, and Canadian society of echocardiography [^116qee9y].

Prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation — Imaging considerations on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) rely on indirect signs because "Given that direct detection of prosthetic MR is often not possible with transthoracic Doppler techniques, particularly in mechanical valves, one must rely on indirect signs". The most accurate signs of increased prosthetic flow are "peak early velocity ≥ 1.9 m/s in mechanical valves, mean gradient ≥ 6 mm Hg", particularly when disproportionate to systemic flow with "VTIPrMV/VTILVo > 2.2". "Pressure half-time is not useful in prosthetic MR unless there is concomitant stenosis", and "The presence of any one of these findings in a patient with appropriate clinical symptoms represents a clear indication for TEE".

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^115ozoFe]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3.4 Recommendation 4

Determine whether echocardiography is indicated or not. If indicated, determine what level of echocardiography is appropriate for the clinical question (Figure 3).

1.3.4.1 Background to Recommendation 4

Triage requires collaboration between the clinician and echocardiographer. The decision is based on:
The likelihood of disease (e.g. lower in asymptomatic young patient with murmur).
Symptoms.
The results of previous studies.
The clinical question.

1.3.4.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Asymptomatic murmur. These can be assigned to a murmur clinic or a general outpatient basic/level 1 echocardiography session.

1.3.4.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

The cardiologist has a specific clinical question that can be answered by a focussed scan usually in the context of a specialist valve clinic where the clinical assessment and echocardiogram are done at the same time. These are therefore unlikely to appear on a general outpatient list:
In an asymptomatic patient to look for thickening of a biological aortic valve replacement.
In a patient with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis or moderate or severe mitral regurgitation to detect a fall in LV ejection fraction or a rise in the peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation.
Previous mild HVD to detect progression requiring a minimum standard study.

1.3.4.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Previous studies show significant HVD, and the request is at a guideline‐compliant frequency or otherwise clinically justified.

1.3.4.1.4 Examples of Studies Not Indicated are

Repeat studies for any HVD earlier than recommended by guidelines in the absence of a clinical change.
Repeat studies for normally functioning biological valves (without any clinical symptoms/signs to suggest failure) before guideline indications.
Repeat study for most patients with mild native valve regurgitation and for studies previously shown to be normal.
Repeat studies in the absence of symptoms/signs, for patients who received TAVI, who would not be suitable for re‐intervention.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision Pathway on the management of mitral regurgitation: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on expert consensus decision pathways [^115zWUKn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a complex valve lesion that can pose significant management challenges for the cardiovascular clinician. This Expert Consensus Document emphasizes that recognition of MR should prompt an assessment of its etiology, mechanism, and severity, as well as indications for treatment. A structured approach to evaluation based on clinical findings, precise echocardiographic imaging, and when necessary, adjunctive testing, can help clarify decision making. Treatment goals include timely intervention by an experienced heart team to prevent left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, reduced quality of life, and premature death.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116WzxKh]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors — transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for carcinoid (NET-related) heart disease (CHD) should include morphologic evaluation of the valves (especially tricuspid and pulmonary) and assessment of the right heart size and function, and when valve disease is present an agitated saline injection should be performed to determine whether there is an atrial level shunt. Post valve replacement, patients should be followed with serial echocardiograms according to institutional practice, and if valves are abnormal by echocardiogram, consider the potential for clots requiring resumption of anticoagulants versus recurrent CHD. Repeat TTE recommendations for patients with NETs include, for those without known CHD, symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, edema, or ascites, physical exam findings including elevated jugular venous pressure, edema, or ascites, prior to planned bowel/liver resection, and reassessment every 1–3 years; for those with known CHD with or without prior valve surgery, decision-making in conjunction with a multidisciplinary care team, annual reassessment of all valves (native ± prosthetic) in conjunction with specialty cardiology consultation, new symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, edema, or ascites, change in physical exam including elevated jugular venous pressure, edema, or ascites, and prior to planned bowel/liver resection. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Bicuspid aortic valve natural history and surveillance intensity — Among patients followed with serial imaging, "47% required valve surgery but only 3.8% required aortic grafting without valve replacement, and < 0.1% had aortic dissection". A systematic review reported that "In a systematic review of 13 studies with > 11000 patients with a BAV, aortic dilation was present in 20% to 40%, but only 0.4% suffered aortic dissection". Surveillance frequency guidance states "Aortic imaging at least annually is prudent in patients with BAV and significant aortic dilation (> 4.5 cm) to determine the appropriate timing of surgical intervention", and patients with added risk "may also require more frequent monitoring". After isolated AVR, outcomes included that "In a retrospective review of 1286 patients with a BAV who underwent isolated AVR with a median of 12 years of follow-up, subsequent aortic dissection occurred in 1%, ascending aortic replacement surgery was needed in 0.9%, and progressive aortic enlargement was noted in 9.9%", and in "a smaller cohort of 153 patients with a BAV with prior AVR, 3% required proximal aortic surgery after 15 years of follow-up. No cases of aortic dissection were noted".

### Is it ever too late to operate on the patient with valvular heart disease? [^112ctCbQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

All valvular heart disease imparts a hemodynamic burden on the left and/or right ventricle. This burden can only be removed effectively by correcting the responsible valvular lesion. Although a percutaneous approach is usually used to correct mitral stenosis, other valve lesions require surgical intervention. Over the past 40 years there has been a persistent improvement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of valvular heart disease and in the surgical techniques for correcting it. These factors have acted in concert to alter our view of the proper timing and applicability of surgery. On one hand it is no longer necessary or even advisable to delay surgery until advanced symptoms are present, and thus surgery is timed earlier today than it was even a decade ago. On the other hand, many but not all patients with far advanced disease, once considered inoperable, are now often helped substantially by valve surgery. However, selection of which of these very ill patients will or will not benefit from valve surgery remains a challenge for all of us. It is this group of patients that is addressed in the review.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: updated guidance from the joint British societies [^114RpVCf]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is clear consensus that MDTs should drive the care of patients with IE, despite a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide these recommendations (with most studies at serious or critical risk of bias). The infrequent nature of IE means that clinical decision making should be guided by clinicians who gain and share their experience of the care of these patients. More evidence is needed to guide the development of optimal models of care delivery, clinical training, patient information and follow-up.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111pRXwa]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valves — In patients with a surgical or transcatheter prosthetic valve and in patients who have had valve repair, an initial postprocedural TTE study is recommended for evaluation of valve hemodynamics and ventricular function; in patients with a prosthetic valve or prior valve repair and a change in clinical symptoms or signs suggesting valve dysfunction, repeat TTE is recommended; in patients with a prosthetic valve replacement or prior valve repair and clinical symptoms or signs that suggest prosthetic valve dysfunction, additional imaging with TEE, gated cardiac CT, or fluoroscopy is recommended, even if TTE does not show valve dysfunction; in patients with a bioprosthetic surgical valve, TTE at 5 and 10 years and then annually after implantation is reasonable, even in the absence of a change in clinical status; and in patients with a bioprosthetic TAVI, TTE annually is reasonable.

### Operationalizing the 2014 ACC / AHA guidelines for valvular heart disease: a guide for clinicians [^114NX8U5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for valvular heart disease were released to help guide the clinician in caring for patients with this ever more prevalent and complex group of diseases and have been instrumental in providing a foundation of knowledge for the management of patients with valvular heart disease. However, there are many caveats in applying the guidelines to individual patients. As clinicians, we wish to outline important aspects to be considered by other clinicians, including the integration of the echocardiogram with the history and physical examination, recognition of discordant data within an echocardiographic examination, and proper interpretation of the cutoff measurements applied to timing of intervention. Decisions regarding management should be individualized to the institution, particularly when recommending early operation for an asymptomatic patient. Finally, all decisions should be individualized to each patient by not only recognizing specific comorbidities, but also understanding the patient's needs and preferences.

Prosthetic valve complications — early postoperative issues include technical or infectious dysfunction, paravalvular leak, patient–prosthesis mismatch (PPM), and infrequent endocarditis. Valvular dysfunction after surgery is usually related to technical challenges during surgery or early infection; paravalvular leak is more frequent after debridement of calcium, repeat valvular surgery, and reconstruction of the aortic or mitral annulus and in older patients, and early leaks are usually small and may not be detected clinically or by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). PPM and geometric mismatch are increasingly recognized, rare chordal entrapment/obstruction can follow chordal preservation in mitral prostheses, and acute endocarditis occurs in < 1% of patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® infective endocarditis [^112B8Kty]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis can involve a normal, abnormal, or prosthetic cardiac valve. The diagnosis is typically made clinically with persistently positive blood cultures, characteristic signs and symptoms, and echocardiographic evidence of valvular vegetations or valvular complications such as abscess, dehiscence, or new regurgitation. Imaging plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of infective endocarditis, identifying complications, prognostication, and informing the next steps in therapy. This document outlines the initial imaging appropriateness of a patient with suspected infective endocarditis and for additional imaging in a patient with known or suspected infective endocarditis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Management of the symptomatic patient with VHD undergoing noncardiac surgery — In patients who meet standard indications for intervention for VHD (replacement and repair) on the basis of symptoms and disease severity, intervention should be performed before elective noncardiac surgery to reduce perioperative risk if possible, depending on the urgency and risk of the noncardiac procedure.

### Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's guidelines and standards committee and the task force on prosthetic valves, developed in conjunction with the American college of cardiology cardiovascular imaging committee, cardiac imaging committee of the American Heart Association, the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography and the Canadian society of echocardiography, endorsed by the American college of cardiology foundation, American Heart Association, European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography, and Canadian society of echocardiography [^1169YCp8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic valve types, classification, sizing, and implantation positions — over the past 40 years many valves have been developed, yet there is no ideal valve and all prosthetic valves are prone to dysfunction; currently implanted types include bileaflet and tilting disc mechanical valves and bioprostheses, and prosthetic valves are broadly grouped as biologic or mechanical, with the most frequently implanted biologic valve being a stented xenograft and the most frequently implanted mechanical valves being bileaflet valves, while Starr‑Edwards caged ball valves are rarely used; prosthesis size reporting usually refers to the outer diameter of the valve ring in millimeters but sizing conventions vary such that the patient "tissue annulus" diameter ranged from 3.5 mm smaller to 3.0 mm larger than the labeled size in one comparison; implantation position can be intra‑annular, partially supra‑annular, or wholly supra‑annular, with the supra‑annular position designed to maximize the orifice area available for flow.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of prosthetic valve function with cardiovascular imaging: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^111sqak5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with significant cardiac valvular disease, intervention with either valve repair or valve replacement may be inevitable. Although valve repair is frequently performed, especially for mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, valve replacement remains common, particularly in adults. Diagnostic methods are often needed to assess the function of the prosthesis. Echocardiography is the first-line method for noninvasive evaluation of prosthetic valve function. The transthoracic approach is complemented with two-dimensional and three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography for further refinement of valve morphology and function when needed. More recently, advances in computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance have enhanced their roles in evaluating valvular heart disease. This document offers a review of the echocardiographic techniques used and provides recommendations and general guidelines for evaluation of prosthetic valve function on the basis of the scientific literature and consensus of a panel of experts. This guideline discusses the role of advanced imaging with transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance in evaluating prosthetic valve structure, function, and regurgitation. It replaces the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography guideline on prosthetic valves and complements the 2019 guideline on the evaluation of valvular regurgitation after percutaneous valve repair or replacement.

Intraoperative TEE use and indications — Among available imaging routes such as TEE and epicardial and epiaortic ultrasound, TEE remains the most widely used, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists has recommended intraoperative TEE as a category II indication in patients undergoing valve surgery, while American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association practice guidelines recommend TEE as a class I indication for patients undergoing valve replacement with stentless xenograft, homograft, or autograft valves. Prosthetic valves may be assessed intraoperatively in 3 situations: (1) after the replacement of a diseased native valve, (2) in unrelated cardiac surgery as a part of comprehensive TEE, and (3) prior to redo valve surgery in dysfunctional prosthetic valves.

Perioperative evaluation and monitoring for severe VHD undergoing noncardiac surgery — If the patient meets standard criteria for a cardiac intervention, it is prudent to defer elective noncardiac procedures and proceed to valve intervention first. All patients with severe VHD who are undergoing noncardiac surgery benefit from an evaluation by a Heart Team consisting of a cardiologist, cardiac anesthesiologist, and cardiac surgeons, in conjunction with the surgeon performing the procedure. In patients with severe VHD who are undergoing low-risk surgical procedures or in patients with mild to moderate VHD, noninvasive monitoring in consultation with a cardiovascular anesthesiologist may be all that is needed. In patients with severe VHD who are undergoing elevated-risk noncardiac surgery, decisions should be made as to whether to proceed with the noncardiac surgery and whether invasive hemodynamic or TEE imaging monitoring should be performed intraoperatively and postoperatively in an intensive care setting. For diagnostic work-up, patients being evaluated for noncardiac surgery who have known or suspected VHD of moderate or greater degree benefit from TTE, and if there has been no change in clinical course, an echocardiogram within the past 12 months can be used.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic valve echocardiography — essential parameters for comprehensive evaluation include clinical information (date of valve replacement; type and size of the prosthetic valve; height, weight, body surface area; symptoms and related clinical findings; blood pressure and heart rate), imaging of the valve (motion of leaflets or occluder; presence of calcification on the leaflets or abnormal echo densities on the various components of the prosthesis; valve sewing ring integrity and motion), Doppler echocardiography of the valve (contour of the jet velocity signal; peak velocity and gradient; mean pressure gradient; VTI of the jet; DVI; pressure half-time in MV and TV; EOA; presence, location, and severity of regurgitation), other echocardiographic data (LV and RV size, function, and hypertrophy; LA and right atrial size; concomitant valvular disease; estimation of pulmonary artery pressure), and previous postoperative studies when available, noting that comparison of above parameters is particularly helpful in suspected prosthetic valvular dysfunction; additional notes specify that EOA using the continuity equation needs to be compared with normal Doppler values of the valve type and size and that transthoracic Doppler is less sensitive to detection of valvular regurgitation in mitral and tricuspid prostheses, with TEE frequently needed for a more definitive assessment.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^1169Mty8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) preprocedural imaging — initial assessment and staging of aortic stenosis severity is best performed by guideline-based transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and multimodality imaging is needed for preprocedural planning. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a core element of the standard imaging pathway for the preprocedural planning of TAVR. In patients being evaluated for TAVR, MDCT systems with at least 64 detectors and a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm to 0.6 mm are recommended. Typical protocols involve 2 main components: an electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisition of the aortic annulus and aortic root, followed by a full chest, abdomen, and pelvic acquisition of the arterial vasculature, which does not typically require ECG gating. Because a standard bolus of 80 to 120 mL of low-osmolar iodinated contrast is necessary, the benefits and risks of iodinated contrast need to be carefully weighed, particularly in elderly patients, and in patients in whom iodinated contrast is absolutely contraindicated, alternative imaging includes magnetic resonance imaging for vascular access and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for valve sizing.

1.1 Solutions Incorporating Basic/Level 1 Studies and Focussed Studies

This demand/activity imbalance in the face of inadequate staffing levels requires a rethink of attitudes to echocardiography, to enable more patients to be scanned quicker but maintaining safety.

It would not appear appropriate for every single case to require a full comprehensive study as stipulated by some Imaging Societies. Such comprehensive scan takes a minimum 45 min with the help of a support worker. Whilst the rationale for this approach is to avoid missing pathology in the patients that do receive a scan, it fails to acknowledge the large demand in echocardiography at the moment, and the significant number of patients with a clinically detected murmur, that will not be able to receive their scan for months. Therefore the safety of the patients with a known murmur who are unable to get an echocardiogram for many months or even more than a year, is compromised. As such HVD patients remain without a diagnosis on a waiting list, with potentially adverse outcomes. What transpires, is that in the apparent pursuit of safety for an individual case, the safety of the wider community is compromised. Reassuringly, there is abundant evidence that basic (or level 1) and focussed echocardiograms are safe and sufficient to answer most clinical questions when performed by appropriately trained and experienced specialists. Minimum standard and disease‐specific studies can then be done only when clinically indicated (Table 1).

### Are valve clinics a sound investment for the health service? A cost-effectiveness model and an automated tool for cost estimation [^114WgntU]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Final cumulative costs are given in GB£ and in US$, rounded to the nearest decimal. The main savings are expected to be the cost of cardiologist time and in reducing unnecessary echocardiograms.

Taggu et al showed that physician visits fell by 97%, from 998 to 31 in a year. However, 5% of patients from the surveillance clinics need to be seen by the cardiologist because of a new symptom or change in echo, although the cardiology time needed is usually less than for a full visit as a result of the prior assessment by the sonographer or nurse. A further 10% require brief discussion by the sonographer or nurse with the cardiologist. A proportion of patients require follow-up with the cardiologist because of complex disease or proximity to thresholds for surgery.

Echocardiograms

Compliance with guidelines is patchy and echocardiograms tend to be performed unnecessarilyparticularly after valve replacement. In some centres, all replacement valves are examined annually. We modelled the cost of an echocardiogram at £74 ($117) which is the National Health Service (NHS) tariff, and we assumed that 100% of patients would have echos in the conventional model compared with 25% of those seen in a valve clinic.

Other tests

Exercise test are underutilised and requested in only about 10% of those in whom it would be indicated. This means that allowing 100 new patients of whom 50 might have asymptomatic severe disease, 5 tests might be performed using the conventional model and 50 using the new model. We assumed the cost of an ETT to be £60 ($94), according to the NHS tariff. Numbers of chest X-ray, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) estimation, Holter, CT were assumed to be similar in all groups and were therefore not included in the analysis.

All costs are expressed per 100 patients seen in the clinic.

### What does transesophageal echocardiography add to valvular heart surgery? [^112sba4E]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

No single monitoring tool in the last decade has had more of an effect on intraoperative decision making and surgical management of cardiac valvular pathologies than has TEE. It has become the standard of care for evaluating reparative valvular procedures, thus providing an immediate gauge of the surgical results and helping to avoid suboptimal surgical outcomes. As the technology of TEE and its application advance, so too should the ability to diagnose and manage valvular pathologies, broaden the range of surgical options, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Mitral valve (MV) repair candidacy and postoperative imaging — patients with a single segment flail of the posterior leaflet due to fibroelastic deficiency without annular or leaflet calcification have the highest chance of technically successful and durable valve repair and should not undergo valve replacement unless a repair has been attempted and was unsuccessful. Patients with severe anterior, bileaflet, Barlow's, or mixed disease that may require extensive and complex reparative techniques should be preferentially referred to an experienced MV surgeon at a high-volume institution. The most important predictor of long-term failure is the presence of moderate or greater residual MR at the time of the index operation. A small subgroup with primary MR may be better served by valve replacement rather than repair, such as those with prior cardiac operation or prior chest radiation where any subsequent operation for a failed repair would be at substantially increased risk. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended either prior to discharge or by 1 to 3 months after surgical MV repair or replacement, with longitudinal TTE thereafter dictated by clinical findings and by the presence of a prosthetic heart valve replacement.

Prosthetic valve performance

The clinical presentation of patients with prosthetic valve dysfunction is usually consistent with symptoms and signs of either valvular regurgitation or stenosis. Valve Academic Research Consortium proposes only two criteria to evaluate impaired prosthetic valve performance: (i) prosthetic valve haemodynamics assessed by echocardiography and (ii) associated clinical findings indicating impaired cardiovascular or valvular function (e.g. new or worsening congestive heart failure). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is usually adequate to evaluate prosthetic aortic valve function, although transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be very useful in the setting of technically challenging or complex cases. Serial echocardiography evaluations after surgical AVR and TAVI should be performed at baseline, soon after the index procedure (ideally within 24–48 h, but always before discharge), at 1 month (especially for TAVI), 12 months, and yearly thereafter. This follow-up schedule is more intensive than recommended in the AHA/ACC and ESC guidelines for follow-up after surgical AVR, but more frequent documentation of valve function and position is considered desirable for TAVI clinical trials.

Although the VARC definitions for impaired prosthetic valve performance discount mechanistic characterizations, valve failure mode(s) should be recorded whenever possible in case report forms (Table 7). In addition to echocardiography, multi-slice computed tomography may also provide useful insights into the responsible patho-biological mechanisms of device malfunction.

### Echocardiography in the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^111xXRx1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) prosthetic valves and congenital heart disease — perioperative considerations: When indicated, prosthetic valve assessment by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is critical for surgical decision-making. LVAD-supported patients must receive systemic anticoagulation, and a higher target prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT INR) may be necessary if a mechanical valve is present. Because reduced flow through a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis increases postoperative thrombosis and thromboembolism risk, replacement of even a normally functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with a bioprosthesis or valve closure should be considered at the time of LVAD implantation, whereas adequately functioning bioprosthetic aortic valves do not require removal or replacement. Surgical replacement of a normally functioning mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is typically not recommended, with consideration for mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis at LVAD implantation only in the presence of moderate or worse mechanical mitral stenosis; tricuspid or pulmonary valve prosthesis dysfunction is important as it could adversely affect postoperative right ventricular function. In congenital heart disease, prior imaging should be reviewed, a patent foramen ovale, present in up to 30% of the general population, increases risk, and PFOs or any other interatrial communications should be closed at the time of device implantation.

1.7 Expected Benefits of These Recommendations

The expectation is that utilizing shorter scans will enable a substantially greater number of individuals on the waiting list to undergo echocardiography within a specific time frame. This approach is anticipated to be safe, given that most do not have significant valvular disease and the option to extend the scans if an abnormality is identified exists. Consequently, it mitigates the risk of patients with significant valvular heart disease enduring prolonged waits for their minimum standard scan. While there may be a small subset of individuals with nonvalvular pathology that could be overlooked in a basic/level 1 or focused scan, the overall safety benefits at a population level outweighs this potential limitation.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation After percutaneous valve repair or Replacement: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^111yLihq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions and future directions for evaluating regurgitation after valve repair or replacement emphasize that "such an evaluation after valve repair or replacement is important for both guidance of the intervention in the catheterization laboratory and for the overall outcome of patients after the procedure", and "the imager is an integral member of the heart valve team". Early post-deployment stenosis is "rare, except after edge-to-edge MV repair with multiple devices", shifting emphasis to residual regurgitation. In the outpatient setting, "an integrative transthoracic echocardiographic approach is always needed as a first-line assessment", and "Further imaging with TEE, CMR, and occasionally MDCT may be needed". As experience grows, "further data on validation, comparative accuracy, and prognostic impact are needed in echocardiography as well as CMR to identify the most optimal quantitative approach and enhance the accuracy and confidence of evaluation of valve regurgitation after catheter-based interventions".

Infective endocarditis (IE) echocardiography — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) versus transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): TTE has a sensitivity between 50% and 90% and a specificity > 90% for native valve vegetations, but in prosthetic valve endocarditis TTE sensitivity is 36% to 69%; by contrast, the sensitivity of TEE in native valve endocarditis ranges from 90% to 100%, with sensitivity slightly lower in prosthetic valves. TTE exhibits superior imaging over TEE for the anterior aspect of a prosthetic aortic valve and allows measurement of aortic transvalvular velocity/gradient not always possible on TEE. TTE and TEE are complementary, and TEE should be used as an adjunct in patients with echocardiographic features of IE on TTE to rule out abscesses that may alter management.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular heart disease, imposing a substantial burden on global public health. AS frequently coexists with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three decades ago, it was recognized that the pivotal aspect in managing patients with AS lies in the timely decision to refer for intervention.

Contemporary guidelines currently advocate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in those with severe symptomatic AS and, by extension, in those who are asymptomatic but experience reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 55% by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, class of recommendation IIa; and LVEF < 50% by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, class of recommendation I). The latter is owed to the adverse impact of elevated afterload on the already diseased left ventricle. On the contrary, in those with moderate AS, both guidelines advocate for a "watchful waiting approach" with frequent surveillance echocardiograms (yearly by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, and every 1–2 years by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines) to detect any disease progression. The rationale behind the contrasting recommendations concerning the timing of intervention in AS remains a matter of discussion. Recent large‐scale observational studies found the prognosis of patients with moderate AS may be more unfavorable than previously thought, particularly when concurrent systolic dysfunction is present. Moderate AS has been associated with an ≈2‐fold increased risk of all‐cause death, which increases to ≈3‐fold among those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Consequently, specific factors such as systolic dysfunction or coronary artery disease contribute to adverse outcomes, while the mortality risk solely attributable to isolated moderate AS remains incompletely characterized.

1.4.1 Recommendation 5

Discuss clinical urgency and level of echocardiography with a clinician.

1.4.1.1 Background to Recommendation 5

The need for clinical collaboration is greater for inpatient than for outpatient requests since the presentation may be acute, not necessarily associated with a murmur and the dangers of progression much higher.

There can be no safe target time‐delays and every case must be considered individually.

No level of echocardiography is universally applicable. A combination of a basic/level 1 study can be used to exclude life‐threatening pathology and a minimum standard study performed at greater leisure if required.

1.4.1.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Incidental murmur in a patient admitted with a nonvalve problem for example, neck of femur fracture. It is reasonable to perform a basic/level 1 study in patients with a murmur as an emergency if identifying HVD will change management.

After insertion of an electrical device or other invasive intervention a basic/level 1 study is frequently sufficient to exclude a new pericardial effusion.
In an acutely unwell patient, a basic/level 1 study may indicate the need for immediate life‐saving treatment.

1.4.1.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

Predischarge after cardiac surgery to detect pathology that might require immediate management for example, large pericardial effusion or LV dysfunction or prosthetic valve dysfunction.

1.4.1.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Patients with known HVD admitted with heart failure.
Murmur after acute myocardial infarction since it may indicate mitral regurgitation or a VSD.
Urgent echocardiography should be done if there is unexplained LV failure or shock since these might complicate critical HVD.

1.4.1.1.4 Examples of Studies Often Not Indicated

Fever with a low clinical likelihood of infective endocarditis (see recommendation 6).
Recent TTE with no evidence of clinical deterioration.

### Bioprosthetic aortic valve hemodynamics: definitions, outcomes, and evidence gaps: JACC state-of-the-art review [^115zRABH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

A virtual workshop was organized by the Heart Valve Collaboratory to identify areas of expert consensus, areas of disagreement, and evidence gaps related to bioprosthetic aortic valve hemodynamics. Impaired functional performance of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement is associated with adverse patient outcomes; however, this assessment is complicated by the lack of standardization for labelling, definitions, and measurement techniques, both after surgical and transcatheter valve replacement. Echocardiography remains the standard assessment methodology because of its ease of performance, widespread availability, ability to do serial measurements over time, and correlation with outcomes. Management of a high gradient after replacement requires integration of the patient's clinical status, physical examination, and multimodality imaging in addition to shared patient decisions regarding treatment options. Future priorities that are underway include efforts to standardize prosthesis sizing and labelling for both surgical and transcatheter valves as well as trials to characterize the consequences of adverse hemodynamics.

Aortic stenosis — when to intervene?

When assessing a patient with aortic valve stenosis, some essential questions have to be asked and answered. How severe is the aortic stenosis? Does the patient have symptoms? Are the symptoms related to valvular disease? What are the patient's life expectancy and expected quality of life? Do the expected benefits of intervention outweigh its risks? Are local resources optimal for the planned intervention? What is the patient's preference?

Echocardiography is the key diagnostic tool. It confirms the presence of aortic valve stenosis; assesses the degree of valve calcification, left ventricular (LV)function and wall thickness and detects the presence of other associated valve disease or aortic pathology. Doppler echocardiography is the preferred technique for assessing the severity of the aortic valve stenosis.

In accordance with the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines, early therapy is strongly recommended in all symptomatic patients with severe high-gradient aortic stenosis (mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg or peak velocity ≥ 4 m/s; class I, level of evidence (LoE) B). For this patient group, there is virtually no lower ejection fraction limit for intervention. The only exceptions are patients with severe comorbidities indicating a survival of < 1 year and patients in whom severe comorbidities or their general condition at an advanced age make it unlikely that the intervention will improve quality of life or survival (class III, LoE C).

Prosthetic mitral valves — PPM thresholds and outcomes are as follows: PPM has been described in the mitral position, and it has been suggested that the indexed EOA of mitral prostheses should ideally be no less than 1.2 to 1.3 cm²/m² to avoid abnormally high postoperative gradients; reported prevalence for mitral PPM varies between 39% and 71% and was shown to be associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension and decreased long-term survival.

Prosthetic valve regurgitation — clinical presentation and key evaluation points include that the clinical presentation varies depending on its severity, hemodynamic effects, and etiology; it may be found incidentally in asymptomatic patients on routine clinical or imaging follow-up; a change in auscultatory findings should prompt suspicion of prosthetic valve dysfunction; symptomatic patients may present with unexplained or new-onset HF or significant hemolysis with or without anemia; TTE is inadequate for evaluation of prosthetic mitral valves and TEE is needed when prosthetic MR is a concern; and distinguishing transvalvular from paravalvular leak also requires TEE in addition to TTE.

### Recurrent mitral regurgitation after repair: should the mitral valve be re-repaired? [^112taEQf]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of reoperation for failed mitral valve repair.

Methods

One hundred forty-five patients with recurrent mitral regurgitation after primary mitral valve repair of degenerative leaflet prolapse underwent mitral valve reoperations between January 1, 1970, and January 1, 2005. The mean age was 66 years, and 102 (70%) were men.

Results

The mean duration from initial repair to reoperation was 4.1 years (standard deviation = ± 5.1 years). Indications for reoperation were regurgitation alone (n = 109 [75%]), hemolysis (n = 27 [19%]), obstruction from systolic anterior motion (n = 3 [2%]), endocarditis (n = 3 [2%]) and stenosis-other (n = 3 [2%]). New pathology was found in 80 (55%) patients, and failure of the initial repair was found in 61 (42%) patients. The mitral valve was re-repaired in 64 (44%) patients and replaced in 81 (56%) patients. Early operative mortality was similar after re-repair and replacement (1.6% vs 4.9%, P = 0.38). Independent predictors of improved survival on multivariate analysis were mitral re-repair (hazard ratio = 0.44, P = 0.03), younger age (hazard ratio = 1.06, P = 0.001), and an operative indication of mitral regurgitation alone (hazard ratio = 0.31, P = 0.005). Seven patients had a third mitral operation (all replacements), 6 after re-repair and 1 after replacement. At last follow-up echocardiogram (n = 96), ejection fraction was greater (P < .001) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension was smaller (P = 0.009) in patients undergoing re-repair compared with values in those undergoing valve replacement.

Conclusion

Recurrent mitral regurgitation after prior repair is frequently caused by new valve pathology. Mitral re-repair is performed in almost half of patients and is associated with superior survival, improved ejection fraction, and greater regression in ventricular dimension compared with valve replacement.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter mitral valve (MV) interventions — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) follow-up timing and objectives are specified as follows: patients who have undergone a transcatheter MV intervention should typically receive TTE one day, 30 days, and 6–12 months after the procedure, with additional TTE studies performed sooner if clinically indicated. Echocardiograms on day 1 and 30 are primarily for assessing complications and acute results, and the study at 6–12 months is performed to determine primary effectiveness of the device, including favorable reverse remodeling of the LV and LA and possible decrease in elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The post-procedure TTE is more informative if comprehensive echocardiograms are performed before, during, and immediately after the procedure and are available for comparison, and at the time of follow-up TTE it is important to document any changes in medical therapy or clinical condition, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and assess cardiac rhythm to ensure studies are performed under similar clinical and hemodynamic conditions.

Periodic imaging after valve intervention — In asymptomatic patients with any type of valve intervention, a baseline postprocedural transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) followed by periodic monitoring with TTE is recommended (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Initial postprocedural TTE is recommended for all patients, ideally 1 to 3 months after the procedure. Minimal imaging frequency is specified as mechanical valve (surgical) baseline; bioprosthetic valve (surgical) baseline, 5, and 10 y after surgery, and then annually; bioprosthetic valve (transcatheter) baseline and then annually; surgical mitral valve repair baseline, 1 y, and then every 2 to 3 y; transcatheter mitral valve repair baseline and then annually; and in bicuspid aortic valve disease continued post-AVR monitoring of aortic size if aortic diameter is ≥ 4.0 cm at time of AVR. Repeat imaging is appropriate at shorter intervals for changing signs or symptoms, during pregnancy, and to monitor residual or concurrent cardiac dysfunction, and imaging may be done more frequently in patients with bioprosthetic surgical valves if there are risk factors for early valve degeneration. Repeat TTE is recommended with either new symptoms or a change in the physical examination.

### Effect of eliminating pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiogram on outcomes after TAVR [^112i2TTT]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the safety of eliminating the pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Background

TTE is utilized before, during, and after TAVR. Post-procedural, pre-discharge TTE assists in assessment of prosthesis function and detection of clinically significant paravalvular leak (PVL) after TAVR.

Methods

Patients who underwent TAVR at Mayo Clinic from July 2018 to July 2019 were included in a prospective institutional registry. Patients undergoing TAVR prior to February 2019 received a pre-discharge TTE, while those undergoing TAVR after February 2019 did not. Both cohorts were evaluated with TTE at 30days post-TAVR.

Results

A total of 330 consecutive patients were included. Of these, 160 patients (age 81.1 ± 7.6) had routine pre-discharge TTE, while 170 patients (age 78.9 ± 7.5) were dismissed without routine pre-discharge TTE. Mortality at 30days was similar between the two groups (0% and 1.2%, respectively). One episode of PVL requiring intervention (0.6%) occurred in the pre-discharge TTE group and none in the group without pre-discharge TTE at 30-day follow-up. There was a similar incidence of total composite primary and secondary adverse events between the cohort receiving a pre-discharge TTE and those without (28.1% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.56) at 30days. The most common event was need for permanent pacemaker or ICD implantation in both groups (13.1% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.71).

Conclusions

Elimination of the pre-discharge TTE is safe and associated with comparable 30-day outcomes to routine pre-discharge TTE. These findings have implication for TAVR practice cost-efficiency and health care utilization.

### Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's guidelines and standards committee and the task force on prosthetic valves, developed in conjunction with the American college of cardiology cardiovascular imaging committee, cardiac imaging committee of the American Heart Association, the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography and the Canadian society of echocardiography, endorsed by the American college of cardiology foundation, American Heart Association, European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography, and Canadian society of echocardiography [^111F6GyY].

Prosthetic valve complications — late complications vary by prosthesis type and patient factors and include thromboembolism, pannus/obstruction, structural valve degeneration, and reoperation. Thromboembolism is determined by valve type and patient factors (left ventricular function, left atrial size, atrial fibrillation); mechanical valves are associated with a significant incidence of thromboembolic complications, though critical valve thrombosis is uncommon and usually due to inadequate anticoagulation. Both mechanical and tissue valves risk pannus causing progressive obstruction; in one series, reoperation for prosthetic valve malfunction was required in 251 patients due to dehiscence in 133, pannus in 48 (a linearized rate of 0.24%/patient-year), and thrombosis in 29 (a linearized rate of 0.15%/patient-year), with risk increasing from aortic to mitral to double-valve implants. Obstruction of stentless or autograft valves due to thrombosis is rare and pannus is much less frequent, while biologic valves most commonly fail from degeneration; for the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve, freedom from structural valve failure in the mitral position ranges from 65% to 85% at 10 years in patients with a mean age of 60 to 70 years.

### Management strategies and future challenges for aortic valve disease [^115qBjv9]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The management of aortic valve disease has been improved by accurate diagnosis and assessment of severity by echocardiography and advanced imaging techniques, efforts to elicit symptoms or objective markers of disease severity and progression, and consideration of optimum timing of aortic valve replacement, even in elderly patients. Prevalence of calcific aortic stenosis is growing in ageing populations. Conventional surgery remains the most appropriate option for most patients who require aortic valve replacement, but the transcatheter approach is established for high-risk patients or poor candidates for surgery. The rapid growth of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been fuelled by improved technology, evidence-based clinical research, and setting up of multidisciplinary heart teams. Aortic regurgitation can be difficult to diagnose and quantify. Left ventricular dysfunction often precedes symptoms, needing active surveillance by echocardiography to determine the optimum time for aortic valve replacement. Development of transcatheter approaches for aortic regurgitation is challenging, owing to the absence of valvular calcification and distortion of aortic root anatomy in many patients.

Valve intervention follow-up imaging — In patients who have had a valve intervention, most cardiologists continue to see patients for a clinical history and physical examination at annual intervals, or more frequently if needed for symptoms or concurrent conditions, and a baseline transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) study is recommended after all valve interventions, including replacement with a prosthetic valve; this baseline postprocedural study ideally is performed 1 to 3 months after intervention, though in some cases it may be done during the index hospitalization. The timing of subsequent periodic imaging after valve intervention is based on the type of valve prosthesis or repair, length of time after valve intervention, residual valve dysfunction, ventricular size and systolic function, and any concurrent cardiac conditions; TTE is the standard approach for periodic imaging, supplemented by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) when prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction is a concern, and additional imaging with CT, fluoroscopy, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), or PET is reserved for concern about valve dysfunction or endocarditis.

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

### Mitral valve regurgitation in the contemporary era: insights into diagnosis, management, and future directions [^111xpVva]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular heart disease. Primary MR is a disease of the mitral valve apparatus, whereas secondary MR is a disease of the left ventricle. Diagnosing and managing MR is often challenging and requires a structured approach, integrating findings on history, physical examination, and imaging. Decisions regarding treatment depend on knowledge of the etiology, natural history, and outcome of interventions for these patients with mitral valve disease. The optimal timing of intervention requires a comprehensive 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiogram in each patient to determine the cause of the mitral valve disease, the severity of the regurgitation, and the effect of the volume overload on the left ventricle, as well as determining if a durable valve repair can be performed. Advances in both surgical and catheter-based therapies have resulted in recommendations for lower thresholds for operation and extension of interventional treatments to the older, sicker population of patients with MR. The current review discusses the pathophysiological rationale for current diagnostic and management strategies in MR.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116TKFuc]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — diagnosis recommendations emphasize that in at‑risk patients with unexplained fever, blood culture samples should be obtained, and in recent onset left‑sided valve regurgitation, at least 2 sets of blood culture samples should be obtained. In patients with suspected IE, the Modified Duke Criteria should be used for diagnosis, and patients with IE should be evaluated and managed with consultation with a multispecialty Heart Valve Team. For imaging, in patients with suspected IE, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended to identify vegetations, characterize the hemodynamic severity of valvular lesions, assess ventricular function and pulmonary pressures, and detect complications. If TTE is nondiagnostic, complications have developed or are clinically suspected, or intracardiac device leads are present, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended; TTE and/or TEE are recommended for reevaluation when there is a change in clinical signs or symptoms or high risk of complications. In patients undergoing valve surgery for IE, intraoperative TEE is recommended. For stable IE patients considered for an early change to oral antibiotic therapy, a baseline TEE before switching to oral therapy and a repeat TEE 1 to 3 days before completion of the oral antibiotic regimen should be performed. Additional advanced imaging recommendations include that CT imaging is reasonable when anatomy cannot be clearly delineated by echocardiography in suspected paravalvular infections, and in nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with a known extracardiac source, TEE might be considered to detect concomitant staphylococcal IE.

Diagnostic testing: routine follow-up in asymptomatic VHD states that after initial evaluation the clinician should continue regular follow-up with periodic examinations and TTE, with the purpose to prevent irreversible consequences that may occur without symptoms; at a minimum, a yearly history and physical examination are necessary, the frequency of repeat echocardiography is based on lesion type, severity, and impact on the ventricle, and follow-up intervals may be extended in mild regurgitation showing no change over a 10- to 15-year period, with new symptoms or exam changes necessitating a repeat TTE.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis — perioperative risk, evaluation, and monitoring for noncardiac surgery are defined by study outcomes and specific testing/management directives. In 1 study, there were no perioperative deaths among 161 patients with severe AS who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) before noncardiac surgery, whereas the 30-day mortality was 4.3% in 187 patients with untreated severe AS (P = 0.008); in another study of 491 patients, those with prior AVR (n = 203) had fewer perioperative MACE (5.4% versus 20.5%, P < 0.001). Patients with suspected moderate or severe AS who have not had an echocardiogram within 12 months before planned noncardiac surgery should undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to aid in perioperative decision-making, and if the echocardiogram reveals severe AS, consultation with a heart valve team, if available, should be obtained. The available evidence, while limited, favors proceeding with low-risk noncardiac surgery in patients with asymptomatic AS and preserved LVEF ≥ 50%, especially in the absence of severe CAD, while patients with asymptomatic severe AS undergoing high-risk surgery may benefit from additional preoperative evaluation. All patients with severe AS should be monitored closely throughout surgery and the early postoperative period, and such monitoring may include invasive hemodynamic monitoring and/or intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

Prosthetic valve surveillance and TAVI follow-up: Patients with a surgical aortic valve develop hemodynamic valve dysfunction at a median of 6.7 to 9.9 years after implantation. In patients with mechanical valve prostheses, routine annual transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluation is not needed if the postoperative baseline study is normal and no clinical change is apparent. TAVI-based protocols typically include routine TTE before discharge and at 30 days and 1 year, in part because of reporting requirements, and in the absence of clinical change, routine annual TTE studies are reasonable as experience continues to accumulate. For the most part, these data reflect observations made in older patients and may not be applicable to younger populations (eg, < 70 years).

Postoperative prosthetic or repaired valve imaging — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary imaging modality for postoperative assessment of prosthetic valve or repaired native valve function, with the index study performed during hospitalization or within the first several weeks thereafter; additional imaging with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac CT, or fluoroscopy may be required when valve dysfunction is suspected, and surveillance TTE has become an established feature of long-term follow-up, although the frequency of routine studies without clinical change varies by valve type.

Infective endocarditis complications and indications for repeat imaging: Heart failure, paravalvular extension, and embolic events represent the 3 most frequent and severe complications of IE and are the 3 main indications for early surgery, which is performed in almost 50% of cases. If signs or symptoms of these complications exist, there should be a very low threshold for repeat imaging; a single negative TEE cannot rule out underlying IE, and a repeat TEE should be performed when persistence of infection is suspected or if complications ensue. Conversely, without clinical deterioration or new signs and symptoms, routine follow-up echocardiography is probably of only limited clinical utility. During therapy, increasing vegetation size is a risk factor for new embolic events, whereas unchanged or reduced vegetation size under therapy may be more difficult to interpret.
