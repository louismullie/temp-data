## Question

Can you explain the BMR test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) test, including what it measures, how it is measured, alternative estimation methods, procedural requirements, and clinical implications for decision-making and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological definition and clinical significance of BMR versus RMR. Then, I should review the gold-standard measurement method (indirect calorimetry) and standardized testing conditions. Next, I will examine prediction equations and their validation limits across populations. After that, I need to outline a practical clinical decision framework and monitoring approach. Finally, I will consider special populations, diurnal/energy-balance effects, and succinct takeaways for practice [^114R2rwk] [^115zYrcD].

> Let me first confirm the definitions and why they matter clinically. BMR is the minimum energy expenditure to sustain vital organ function at complete rest in a thermoneutral, post-absorptive state, whereas RMR is measured under less stringent conditions and is usually 10–20% higher; both are the major component of daily energy expenditure and are fundamentally driven by the cumulative metabolic activity of organs and tissues, tightly linked to body size and composition, especially fat-free mass, with age and sex differences also contributing — so I need to ensure I distinguish when true BMR (strict) versus RMR (practical) is meant in a given testing scenario [^115NzxAo] [^113AaVFj].

> I will now examine the gold-standard measurement. Wait, let me verify the principle: the BMR/RMR test in clinical practice is performed by indirect calorimetry, measuring oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) to compute energy expenditure (via standard stoichiometric relationships), often capturing the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) to gauge substrate oxidation; equipment includes ventilated-hood/canopy systems, metabolic carts, and specialized systems for ventilated patients, with steady-state data typically required for valid estimates [^114R2rwk] [^115NzxAo].

> Next, I should review standardized testing conditions because pre-analytic rigor drives validity. Measurement ideally occurs in the morning after a 10–12 hour fast, in a thermoneutral, quiet environment, with the patient supine or reclined, after 15–30 minutes of rest, and avoiding caffeine, nicotine, and strenuous exercise for at least 12–24 hours; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diurnal effects — afternoon RMR after a shorter fast is consistently about 100 kcal/day (~6%) higher than morning values, and repeated measures within the same time window are highly correlated, so I need to check timing when interpreting differences across days [^114b6DWX].

> When direct measurement is not feasible, I need to consider prediction equations — but I should confirm which are most valid in which settings. Common equations include Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, Schofield, Oxford, and population- or condition-specific models (e.g. Penn State for critical illness), while physiologically-informed approaches linking organ/tissue mass and cellular fractions can improve mechanistic accuracy; however, even the best general equations have notable residual error, so I must flag a ± 10–20% uncertainty band in typical practice [^115zYrcD] [^1113WZpw].

> I should double-check the evidence on accuracy limits across diseases and body sizes. In HFpEF, all standard equations overestimate RMR by > 10% (e.g. HB +250 kcal/day; Mifflin +169 kcal/day), with bias worsening at higher BMI; in CKD, Schofield and Harris-Benedict both overestimate versus indirect calorimetry and show only modest correlation (ICC r≈0.48); among obese hospitalized adults, the most accurate variant still only hits within ± 10% in about half of patients; collectively, these data reinforce that disease states and altered body composition degrade equation performance, and lean mass remains the strongest determinant I should look for to explain measured interindividual variability [^113BHzJJ] [^112Tm9mG] [^116zXJek] [^113AaVFj].

> Let me think about a clinical decision framework and when to insist on measurement. I need to ensure indirect calorimetry is prioritized in patients with critical illness, ventilatory support, extreme BMI, or significant metabolic derangement where equations are unreliable; for ventilated or morbidly obese patients, the Penn State family of equations performs better than most peers but still requires caution; in spontaneously breathing acutely ill patients, a modified Penn State approach can outperform Mifflin or Ireton-Jones, though performance falls with low BMI, underscoring that IC remains the reference when precision materially affects care [^113tsLpU] [^115n49XR] [^117S1Bd7].

> I need to outline a pragmatic testing workflow with built-in verification. Hold on, I should verify quality signals: calibrate analyzers, obtain 5–10 minutes of steady-state VO2/VCO2, review RER plausibility (e.g., physiologic range) and spontaneous movement artifacts, and repeat if instability is detected; I should also standardize timing across serial assessments given diurnal variability, and adjust nutrition prescriptions based on observed clinical response, not just a single value; finally, I should remember that thyroid hormone status can shift basal oxidative metabolism, so if the clinical picture doesn't fit the number, I need to check thyroid function and therapy [^114R2rwk] [^114b6DWX] [^112v6nEJ].

> But wait, what about special populations where pitfalls are common? In obesity, predicted RMR/BMR often overshoots measured needs, and population averages show lower mass-specific RMR at higher BMI, so I should avoid relying on MET or weight-based heuristics without confirmation; in children and disease-specific pediatrics, age-appropriate methods matter because REE can diverge from WHO BMR estimates (e.g., intestinal failure) and obesity per se does not lower RMR after adjusting for FFM; in PCOS, RMR may be similar to controls when matched for composition; in pediatric obesity with subclinical hypothyroidism, BMR appears unchanged despite lipid perturbations, so I should not assume a thyroid-driven BMR reduction without measurement [^113AaVFj] [^113ZkCNW] [^115TbP9j] [^112UHL6Z] [^111ZvSRA].

> I should also consider temporal physiology, because energy balance and circadian biology can color interpretation. Hmm, wait a minute, BMR/RMR can transiently rise early with overfeeding and then plateau nonlinearly over weeks, and while metabolic adaptation after weight loss is detectable, its magnitude under weight-stable conditions is modest and not a dominant barrier to long-term weight maintenance in many cohorts — so I need to contextualize single measurements within recent diet, weight stability, and timing [^116cWNN1] [^1174vzau].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the practical takeaways. The BMR test in clinical practice is best conceptualized as indirect calorimetry under strict resting, fasting, and thermoneutral conditions, with RMR as a practical surrogate when full basal conditions are not achievable; prediction equations are useful starting points but carry sizable, population-dependent error, especially in obesity, chronic disease, and critical illness; therefore, I should standardize conditions, prefer IC when precision matters, and titrate energy prescriptions to clinical outcomes while accounting for diurnal and physiological modifiers, including thyroid status and body composition [^114R2rwk] [^115zYrcD].

The BMR test measures the **energy your body uses at complete rest** to maintain vital functions [^115zYrcD]. It is typically assessed by **indirect calorimetry** [^114R2rwk], which calculates energy expenditure from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production under strict fasting, rest, and thermoneutral conditions [^114b6DWX]. BMR is influenced by age, sex, body composition, and hormones [^113AaVFj] [^112v6nEJ] and guides nutrition and weight management. When indirect calorimetry is unavailable, predictive equations are often used but **can be inaccurate in certain populations** [^112Tm9mG] [^113tsLpU].

---

## Definition and physiological significance

BMR is the minimal energy required to sustain vital functions at rest — such as breathing, circulation, temperature regulation, and cellular metabolism — and accounts for about **60–75% of total daily energy expenditure** [^115zYrcD], making it a key determinant of **energy balance and body weight** [^115NzxAo].

---

## Methods of measurement

### Indirect calorimetry (gold standard)

Indirect calorimetry, the **gold standard** [^114R2rwk] for measuring BMR, calculates energy expenditure from oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). It is performed under standardized conditions including ≥ 12-hour overnight fasting, complete rest in a thermoneutral environment, and avoidance of recent physical activity or caffeine intake [^112cete2]. The method is highly accurate and reliable but requires specialized equipment and trained personnel [^115zYrcD].

---

### Predictive equations (alternative method)

- **Principle**: Estimates BMR using demographic and anthropometric variables (age, sex, weight, height) [^115zYrcD].

- **Common equations**: Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, and WHO equations [^115zYrcD].

- **Limitations**: Less accurate than indirect calorimetry, especially in populations with altered body composition or metabolic conditions [^113tsLpU] [^113BHzJJ].

---

## Factors influencing BMR

| **Factor** | **Effect on BMR** |
|-|-|
| Age | Decreases with age due to loss of lean body mass [^113AaVFj] |
| Sex | Higher in males due to greater muscle mass |
| Body composition | Higher with increased lean mass [^114v9zeg] |
| Hormonal status | Thyroid hormones significantly increase BMR [^112v6nEJ] |
| Genetic factors | Genetic variations influence BMR |
| Environmental temperature | Extreme temperatures increase BMR [^115zYrcD] |

---

## Clinical and research applications

- **Clinical nutrition**: Guides dietary planning and weight management strategies [^115zYrcD].

- **Endocrinology**: Assesses metabolic effects of hormonal disorders (e.g. thyroid dysfunction) [^112v6nEJ].

- **Sports medicine**: Determines energy requirements for athletes [^115vP7NQ].

- **Research**: Investigates metabolic adaptations to interventions (e.g. calorie restriction, exercise) [^1174vzau].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Variability**: BMR measurements can vary due to circadian rhythms, recent activity, and dietary intake [^114b6DWX] [^112cete2].

- **Population-specific accuracy**: Predictive equations may be inaccurate in certain populations (e.g. elderly, obese, chronic kidney disease) [^112Tm9mG] [^113tsLpU].

- **Practical constraints**: Indirect calorimetry requires specialized equipment and trained personnel [^114R2rwk].

---

The BMR test measures the energy required to maintain vital functions at rest; **indirect calorimetry** is the gold standard. BMR is influenced by age, sex, body composition, and hormones and is used in clinical nutrition, endocrinology, sports medicine, and research [^115zYrcD].

### Are prediction equations reliable for estimating resting energy expenditure in chronic kidney disease patients [^112Tm9mG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The determination of resting energy expenditure (REE) is the primary step for estimating the energy requirement of an individual. Although numerous equations have been formulated for predicting metabolic rates, there is a lack of studies addressing the reliability of those equations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the main equations developed for estimating REE can be reliably applied to CKD patients.

- **Methods**: A total of 281 CKD patients (124 non-dialysis, 99 hemodialysis, and 58 peritoneal dialysis) and 81 healthy control individuals were recruited. Indirect calorimetry and blood sample collection were performed following a 12-hour fasting period. Two of the most traditionally used equations for estimating REE were chosen for comparison with the REE measured by indirect calorimetry: (i) the equation proposed by Harris and Benedict, and (ii) the equation proposed by Schofield, which is currently recommended by the FAO/WHO/UNU.

- **Results**: Schofield's equation exhibited a higher REE [1492 ± 220 kcal/day (mean ± SD)] in relation to Harris and Benedict's equation (1431 ± 214 kcal/day; P < 0.001), and both prediction equations showed a higher REE in comparison with the reference indirect calorimetry (1352 ± 252 kcal/day; P < 0.001). In patients with diabetes, inflammation, or severe hyperparathyroidism, the REE estimated by the Harris and Benedict equation was equivalent to that measured by indirect calorimetry. The intraclass correlation of the REE measured by indirect calorimetry with Schofield's equation was r = 0.48 (P < 0.001).

### Examining variations of resting metabolic rate of adults: A public health perspective [^113AaVFj]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

There has not been a recent comprehensive effort to examine existing studies on the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adults to identify the effect of common population demographic and anthropometric characteristics. Thus, we reviewed the literature on RMR (kcal·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹) to determine the relationship of age, sex, and obesity status to RMR as compared with the commonly accepted value for the metabolic equivalent (MET; e.g. 1.0 kcal·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹).

- **Methods**: Using several databases, scientific articles published from 1980 to 2011 were identified that measured RMR; additionally, others dating back to 1920 were located. One hundred and ninety-seven studies were identified, resulting in 397 publication estimates of RMR that could represent a population subgroup. Inverse variance weighting technique was applied to compute means and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: The mean value for RMR was 0.863 kcal·kg(-1)·h(-1) (95% CI = 0.852–0.874), higher for men than women, decreasing with increasing age, and less in overweight than normal weight adults. Regardless of sex, adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg·m⁻² had the lowest RMR (< 0.741 kcal·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹).

- **Conclusions**: No single value for RMR is appropriate for all adults. Adhering to the nearly universally accepted MET convention may lead to the overestimation of the RMR of approximately 10% for men and almost 15% for women, and be as high as 20%-30% for some demographic and anthropometric combinations. These large errors raise questions about the longstanding adherence to the conventional MET value for RMR.

### Variability of measured resting metabolic rate [^114b6DWX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The necessity of a 12-hour fast before resting metabolic rate (RMR) is measured is often a barrier to obtaining accurate RMR measurements.

- **Objective**: We compared RMR measurements obtained in the morning and afternoon and across repeated days to elucidate the magnitude and sources of variability.

- **Design**: Healthy men (n = 12) and women (n = 25) aged 21–67 years, with body mass indexes (in kg/m²) ranging from 17 to 34 and body fat ranging from 6% to 54%, completed four RMR measurements. RMR measurements were made in the morning (following a 12-hour fast and 12 hours post-exercise) and in the afternoon (following a 4-hour fast and 12 hours post-exercise) on two separate days using the ventilated-hood technique. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

- **Results**: Mean (± SE) afternoon RMR was significantly higher than morning RMR on both visit 1 (1593.5 ± 35.6 compared with 1508.0 ± 31.5 kcal/d; P = 0.001) and visit 2 (1602 ± 29.3 compared with 1511.4 ± 35.9 kcal/d; P = 0.001). The two morning measurements (r = 0.93) and the two afternoon measurements (r = 0.93) were highly correlated, and no significant differences between measurements were observed. The mean difference between the morning and afternoon measurements was 99.0 ± 35.8 kcal/d (6%).

- **Conclusions**: Repeated morning and evening measurements of RMR were stable and highly correlated. Day-to-day measurements of RMR were not significantly different. RMR measured in the afternoon following a 4-hour fast and exercise was approximately 100 kcal/d higher than RMR measured in the morning.

### "Cool" topic: Feeding during moderate hypothermia after intracranial hemorrhage [^1136M8Ay]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Therapeutic moderate hypothermia (MH; T core 33°C-34°C) is being studied for the treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Nutrition assessment begins with accurate basal metabolic rate (BMR) determination. Although early enteral nutrition (EN) is associated with improved outcomes, it is often deferred until rewarming. We sought to determine the accuracy of predictive BMR equations and the safety and tolerance of EN during MH after ICH.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients were randomized to 72 hours of MH or normothermia (NT; T core 36°C-37°C). Harris-Benedict (BMR-HB) and Penn-State equation (BMR-PS) calculations were compared with indirect calorimetry (IC) at day (D) 0 and D1–3. Patients with MH received trophic semi-elemental gastric EN. Occurrences of feeding intolerance, gastrointestinal (GI)-related adverse events, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were analyzed with a double-sided matched pairs t-test.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients with ICH participated (6 MH, 7 NT). The mean time to initiate EN was 29.9 hours for MH versus 18.4 hours for NT (P = 0.046). Average daily EN calories received from D0–3 were 398 for MH versus 1006 for NT (P < .01). Three patients with MH experienced high gastric residuals prior to prokinetic agents, one had mild ileus, and one patient with NT vomited. No GI-related adverse events were reported. One patient with MH and one patient with NT had VAP. Two patients with MH received IC, and from D0 to D1–3, BMR-HB remained stable (1331 kcal), BMR-PS decreased (1511 vs 1145 kcal, P = 0.5), and IC decreased (1413 vs 985 kcal, P = 0.2).

Conclusions were incomplete in the original text.

### Are individuals with type 2 diabetes metabolically inflexible? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143t4V2]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

**Methodological considerations**: Methods for estimating metabolic flexibility, such as measurement of whole‐body gas exchange during a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp, are by far the most used method for assessing metabolic flexibility in patients with obesity and/or T2D and can be considered the gold standard. The ability to shift fuel for oxidation can also be tested during a graded step-wise exercise test with simultaneous gas exchange measurements. Although the method is being used more frequently now, there is a risk of selection bias because some exercise capacity is required of the participants. Furthermore, the number of studies that include patients with T2D and appropriate controls is limited. Similarly, changes in respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values can be seen during a meal test, reflecting the oxidation of the ingested food. However, comparisons between studies would require identical meals (form, size, and composition) and variation in gastric emptying between the subjects will be major confounders. More advanced techniques like metabolomic and flux analysis using stable isotope tracers (glucose and/or fatty acids) would provide insight into substrate preferences during fasting, feeding, or insulin stimulation by calculation of substrate turnover and oxidation rates. While these techniques have been used in the study groups of interest in the present review, the number of individual studies is not sufficient to form a basis for a meta-analysis.

### Relationship between basal metabolic rate, gender, age, and body composition in 8,780 white obese subjects [^114v9zeg]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between basal metabolic rate (BMR), gender, age, anthropometric characteristics, and body composition in severely obese white subjects. A total of 1,412 obese white children and adolescents (BMI > 97th percentile for gender and age) and 7,368 obese adults (BMI > 30 kg/m²), ranging from 7 to 74 years, were enrolled in the study. BMR was measured using an indirect calorimeter equipped with a canopy, and fat-free mass (FFM) was obtained using tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).

- **Effect of gender on BMR and predictors**:
	- Using analysis of covariance, we tested the effect of gender on the relationship between BMR, age, anthropometry, and body composition. In children and adolescents, the predictor x gender interaction was significant in all cases except for FFM x gender. In adults, all predictor x gender interactions were significant.

- **Prediction accuracy**:
	- A prediction equation based on body weight (BW), age, and gender had virtually the same accuracy as one based on FFM, age, and gender for predicting BMR in both children and adults (R²(adj) = 0.59 and 0.60, respectively).

In conclusion, gender was a significant determinant of BMR in children and adolescents but not in adults. Our results support the hypothesis that the age-related decline in BMR is due to a reduction in FFM. Finally, anthropometric predictors of BMR are as accurate as body composition estimated by BIA.

### Are individuals with type 2 diabetes metabolically inflexible? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xyvTD]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The overall impression of the basal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) from the 65 studies reviewed was that, in general, the groups did not differ significantly. However, there was large variability in the reported basal RER values, particularly among lean subjects, where a basal RER of 0.91 was reported. Basal RER is typically measured after an overnight fast, and previous research by Miles-Chan et al. found a positive relationship between the dietary proportion of carbohydrates and the post-absorptive RER. This suggests that diet composition may partly account for variability across studies. Notably, 21 out of the 35 studies with an approximately 40 mU/m²/min infusion rate did not report information about the preceding day's diet.

Basal RER has been shown to correlate inversely with ΔRER, which is crucial for interpreting changes in RER with insulin stimulation. Uniformity in basal RER values across studies enhances comparability. In this meta-analysis, the mean basal RER values clustered closely around an overall mean of 0.80 (Figure 2), with some exceptions. For instance, Fechner et al. reported a mean of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.70–0.72) in overweight individuals. Additionally, de Courten et al. and Szendroedi observed means of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.80–1.00) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67–0.75), respectively, in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Measured versus estimated resting metabolic rate in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113BHzJJ]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Obesity is common in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and a hypocaloric diet can improve functional capacity. Malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty are also frequently present, and calorie restriction could harm some patients. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is an essential determinant of caloric needs; however, it is rarely measured in clinical practice. The accuracy of commonly used predictive equations in HFpEF is unknown.

- **Methods**: RMR was measured with indirect calorimetry in 43 patients with HFpEF undergoing right heart catheterization at the University of Michigan and among 49 participants in the SECRET trial (Study of the Effects of Caloric Restriction and Exercise Training in Patients With Heart Failure and a Normal Ejection Fraction). SECRET patients also had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry body composition measures. Measured RMR was compared with RMR estimated using the Harris Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, World Health Organization, and Academy for Nutrition and Dietetics equations.

- **Results**: All predictive equations overestimated RMR (by > 10%, P < 0.001 for all), with mean (95% CI) differences as follows: Harris Benedict equation +250 (186–313), Mifflin-St. Jeor equation +169 (110–229), World Health Organization equation +300 (239–361), and Academy for Nutrition and Dietetics equation +794 (697–890) kcal/day. Results were similar across both patient groups, and the discrepancy between measured and estimated RMR tended to increase with body mass index. In SECRET, measured RMR was closely associated with lean body mass (ρ = 0.74; by linear regression).

### Resting metabolic rate and exercise capacity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112UHL6Z]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and exercise capacity (or maximal oxygen consumption [VO2 max]) of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and central adiposity.

- **Method**: In a cross-sectional study, RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry, and VO2 max by the Astrand test for 31 women with PCOS and 29 controls matched for age and body mass index but with a different body fat distribution. Differences between the means were analyzed.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in RMR or VO2 max values between the two groups.

- **Conclusion**: Central adiposity was not predictive of an altered RMR or decreased exercise capacity in women with PCOS.

### A cellular-level approach to predicting resting energy expenditure across the adult years [^1113WZpw]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

We previously derived a whole-body resting energy expenditure (REE) prediction model by using organ and tissue mass measured by magnetic resonance imaging, combined with assumed stable, specific resting metabolic rates of individual organs and tissues. Although the model predicted REE well in young persons, it overpredicted REE by approximately 11% in elderly adults. This overprediction may occur because of a decline in the fraction of organs and tissues as cell mass with aging.

- **Objective**: The aim of the present study was to develop a cellular-level REE prediction model that would be applicable across the adult age span. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that REE can be predicted from a combination of organ and tissue mass, the specific resting metabolic rates of individual organs and tissues, and the cellular fraction of fat-free mass.

- **Design**: Fifty-four healthy subjects aged 23–88 years had REE, organ and tissue mass, body cell mass, and fat-free mass measured by indirect calorimetry, magnetic resonance imaging, whole-body (40)K counting, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively.

- **Results**: REE predicted by the cellular-level model was highly correlated with measured REE (r = 0.92, P < 0.001). The mean difference between measured REE (x ± SD: 1487 ± 294 kcal/day) and predicted REE (1501 ± 300 kcal/day) for the whole group was not significant, and the difference between predicted and measured REE was not associated with age (r = 0.009, NS).

- **Conclusion**: The present approach establishes an REE-body composition link with the use of a model at the cellular level.

### Obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood: Elevated triglycerides but not basal metabolic rate [^111ZvSRA]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

Studies on the associations between obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism, basal metabolic rate, and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents are scarce.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of children with obesity (n = 294) from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Childhood Obesity cohort. Differences in basal metabolic rate were quantified by indirect calorimetry. The cardiovascular risk factors — body mass index, blood lipids, fasting and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance — were analyzed between subjects with and without subclinical hypothyroidism. The associations of baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and ΔTSH with changes in cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed.

- **Results**: Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism had elevated triacylglycerides but no alterations in basal metabolic rate or other measured cardiovascular risk factors. ΔTSH was positively associated with Δtriacylglycerides, Δtotal cholesterol, and ΔLDL cholesterol, independently of age, sex, Δbody mass index, and ΔT4. In the subclinical hypothyroidism group, 92% of individuals normalized their TSH levels within 0.9–2.9 years.

- **Conclusions**: Children with obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism did not have an altered basal metabolic rate but had elevated triacylglycerides. During the follow-up period, TSH changed in parallel with several blood lipids. Elevated TSH often normalized without pharmaceutical intervention within 3 years.

- **Impact**: The present study found that subclinical hypothyroidism in pediatric obesity is associated with elevated triacylglycerides but not with changes in basal metabolic rate.

### Weekly changes in basal metabolic rate with eight weeks of overfeeding [^116cWNN1]. Obesity (2006). Low credibility.

The contribution of basal metabolic rate (BMR) to weight gain susceptibility has long been debated. We wanted to examine whether BMR changes in a linear fashion with overfeeding. Our hypothesis was that BMR does not increase linearly with 1000-kcal/d overfeeding in lean healthy subjects over 8 weeks. The null hypothesis states that BMR increases linearly with 1000-kcal/d overfeeding in lean healthy subjects.

- **Research methods and procedures**: Initially, 16 lean healthy sedentary subjects completed 2 weeks of weight maintenance feeding at the General Clinical Research Center. The subjects were then overfed by 1000 kcal/d over 8 weeks. BMR was measured under standard conditions each week using indirect calorimetry.

- **Results**: Baseline BMR was 1693 ± 154.5 kcal/d. BMR increased from 1711 ± 201.3 kcal/d at week 1 of overfeeding to 1781 ± 171.65 kcal/d at the second week of overfeeding (p = 0.05). BMR fell during the third week of overfeeding to 1729 ± 179.5 kcal/d (p = 0.05). After 5 weeks of overfeeding, BMR reached a plateau. Thereafter, there was no further change. Comparison of BMR with weeks of overfeeding was significantly different compared with the linear model (p < 0.05).

- **Discussion**: Increases in BMR in lean sedentary healthy subjects with 1000-kcal/d overfeeding are not linear over 8 weeks. There seems to be a short-term increase in BMR in the first 2 weeks of overfeeding that is not representative of longer-term changes.

### Screening for basal metabolic rate and visceral fat among postmenopausal osteoporosis with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113eVJWQ]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Low credibility.

In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is an increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR) associated with the level of glycemic control. Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis have decreased BMR. The aim of the present study is to find the BMR using the Meffin-St Jeor predictive equation in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have attained menopause with osteoporosis.

- **Materials & methods**: 100 women who have attained menopause and were diagnosed with osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus were assessed for BMR using the Meffin-St Jeor predictive equation. A detailed history of diabetes and menopause was obtained. Blood glucose value was measured using standard glucometers. Body composition for visceral fat (VF) was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. The level of physical activity of the participants was measured using the global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ).

- **Results**: The median BMR of the participants was 1,075 (714, 1,483.25). A statistically significant correlation was found between BMR and GPAQ (r s = 0.731) and BMR and VF (r s = 0.678). However, BMR was not correlated with FBS (r s = 0.083) or the duration of diabetes (r s = -0.046).

- **Conclusion**: There is a decrease in BMR in women with T2DM and postmenopausal osteoporosis. BMR was significantly correlated with the level of physical activity and visceral fat.

### Association between basal metabolic rate and cognitive function in Chinese older adults: The mediating effect of sarcopenia [^112WxjSV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Based on the findings of this study, public health strategies should emphasize integrated interventions targeting both metabolic and muscular health. Community-based initiatives that promote protein-rich diets and resistance training can help sustain basal metabolic rate (BMR) while mitigating sarcopenia, particularly among high-risk subgroups, such as rural residents and smokers, where the associations are most pronounced. Health systems should integrate BMR and sarcopenia screening into geriatric care protocols to enable early detection and intervention. Such cost-effective measures, which align with the World Health Organization's objectives for healthy aging, can address both energy metabolism and musculoskeletal health, thereby substantially reducing the burden of cognitive decline in rapidly aging populations, including China.

Our study has several benefits. Firstly, the multi-stage sampling of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) across 28 provinces in China improves the generalizability to Chinese older adults. Secondly, this is the first longitudinal evidence that sarcopenia may mediate the relationship between BMR and cognitive function, with a mediation rate of 26.98%. Finally, BMR and sarcopenia emerged as potentially modifiable factors that could be targeted to prevent cognitive decline.

However, several limitations warrant consideration. Firstly, the study concentrated on an older population within the specific sociocultural and demographic context of China, restricting the applicability of the results to younger age groups or diverse ethnic and cultural populations. Secondly, we estimated BMR by means of the formula…

### Levothyroxine therapy, calculated deiodinases activity and basal metabolic rate in obese or nonobese patients after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, results of a retrospective observational study [^111gsp2R]. Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Basal metabolic rate evaluation**: We evaluated basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the Mifflin-St. Jeor formula (MSTF). The MSTF equation is commonly used in assessing basal metabolism, particularly in obese patients. The formula was applied differently for females and males as follows:
	- **Females**: 9.99 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 4.92 × age (years) − 161.
	- **Males**: 9.99 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 4.92 × age (years) + 5.

We studied the effect of the L-T4 replacement dose on thyroid hormone homeostasis, estimated BMR, and total deiodinase activity (GD) in obese and nonobese patients. Data were collected from patients after thyroidectomy, 131 I administration, and a persistent euthyroid state under replacement therapy for approximately 3 months without any significant changes in L-T4 dose administration, daily caloric intake, and body weight. A subgroup of 45 patients maintaining the same replacement dose over the last 6 months was also studied to better evaluate the interplay between the L-T4 administered dose and total GD in the long term.

- **Evaluation of stimulated deiodination**: GD, which reflects the maximum stimulated activity of deiodination, was calculated by SPINA Thyr 4.2 (Structure Parameter Inference Approach by Johannes W. Dietrich, Lab XU44, Bergmannsheil University Hospitals, Ruhr University of Bochum, D-44789 Bochum, NRW, Germany). This mathematical tool integrates laboratory results to calculate GD from TSH, FT4, and FT3 serum levels obtained from routine laboratory assays. The method is based on model parameters and laboratory data integration.

### Prediction of resting metabolic rate in critically ill patients at the extremes of body mass index [^113tsLpU]. JPEN, Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Although estimation of energy needs by mathematical equation is common in practice, there is relatively little validation data for the equations, especially at the upper and lower extremes of body size. The purpose of the study was to provide validation data for several common equations in underweight and morbidly obese critically ill patients.

- **Methods**: In mechanically ventilated critical care patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≤ 21.0 or ≥ 45.0 kg/m², indirect calorimetry was used to measure resting metabolic rate. Several equation methods were compared with these measurements, including the Penn State equation, Faisy equation, Ireton-Jones equation, Mifflin-St Jeor equation, Harris-Benedict equation, and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) standard, using ideal, actual, or metabolically active body weight.

- **Results**: Accuracy (percentage of estimates falling within 10% of measured) in the morbidly obese group was highest for the Penn State equation (76%) and lowest for the ACCP standard using actual body weight (0%). For the underweight group, the Penn State equation was accurate 63% of the time, but below a BMI of 20.5, the accuracy rate dropped to 58%. No other equation was more accurate than this in the underweight patients.

- **Conclusion**: The Penn State equation is valid in morbid obesity, but the accuracy rate is significantly lower in underweight critically ill patients. A modification to the equation is suggested to improve accuracy in this group.

### Metabolic adaptation is not a major barrier to weight-loss maintenance [^1174vzau]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The existence of metabolic adaptation at the level of resting metabolic rate (RMR) remains highly controversial, likely due to a lack of standardization of participants' energy balance. Moreover, its role as a driver of relapse remains unproven.

- **Objective**: The main aim was to determine if metabolic adaptation at the level of RMR was present after weight loss and at 1- and 2-year follow-up, with measurements taken under conditions of weight stability. A secondary aim was to investigate racial differences in metabolic adaptation after weight loss and if this phenomenon was associated with weight regain.

- **Methods**: A total of 171 overweight women, with a BMI (kg/m²) of 28.3 ± 1.3 and an average age of 35.2 ± 6.3 years (88 whites and 83 blacks), enrolled in a weight-loss program to achieve a BMI of less than 25 and were followed for 2 years. Body weight and composition (4-compartment model) and RMR (indirect calorimetry) were measured after 4 weeks of weight stability at baseline, after weight loss, and at 1 and 2 years. Metabolic adaptation was defined as a significantly lower measured compared with predicted RMR (from the participant's own regression model).

- **Results**: Participants lost, on average, 12 ± 2.6 kg and regained 52% ± 38% and 89% ± 54% of their initial weight lost at 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, respectively. Metabolic adaptation was found after weight loss (-54 ± 105 kcal/day; P < 0.001), with no difference between races, and was positively correlated with fat-mass loss, but not with weight regain overall. In a subset of women (n = 46) with data at all time points, metabolic adaptation was present after weight loss but not at 1-year or 2-year follow-ups.

### Variability of resting energy expenditure in infants and young children with intestinal failure-associated liver disease [^113ZkCNW]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine, in a cohort of young children with intestinal failure (IF), whether the estimates of basal metabolic rate (BMR) by standard equations can approximate measured resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry (IC).

- **Methods**: IC was performed using the dilutional canopy technique. REE measurements were compared with standard, age-based estimation equations (World Health Organization) for BMR. Subjects were classified as hypermetabolic (REE > 110% BMR), hypometabolic (REE < 90% BMR), or normometabolic (REE between 90% and 110% BMR).

- **Results**: The study found a significant variability in REE among the subjects. It was observed that REE was greater than BMR by more than 10 kcal · kg · day in 15 of 28 (54%) patients. REE was not significantly correlated with the severity of liver disease, nutritional status, total energy intake, or gestational age.

- **Conclusions**: Energy expenditure is variable among children with IF and IF-associated liver disease, with approximately 80% of the cohort showing notable variability in their energy expenditure rates.

### Resting metabolic rate in obese and nonobese Chinese Singaporean boys aged 13–15 y [^115TbP9j]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Previous studies investigating the hypothesis that a low resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a cause of obesity yielded discrepant findings. Two explanations for these findings are the use of imprecise methods to determine obesity and a failure to control for differences in fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) when comparing RMR values.

- **Objective**: This study tested the hypothesis that RMR is lower in obese than in nonobese boys (with the use of precise methods to quantify body fatness and with adjustment for differences in both FM and FFM).

- **Design**: Forty Chinese Singaporean boys aged 12.8–15.1 years were recruited. Boys were classified as obese (n = 20) or nonobese (n = 20) based on their adiposity index (ratio of FM to FFM: > 0.60 = obese, < 0.40 = nonobese) determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RMR was determined using indirect calorimetry. RMR values were compared using both linear (analysis of covariance) and log-linear (analysis of covariance with log-transformed data) regression to control for differences in FM and FFM.

- **Results**: Age, height, and FFM did not differ significantly between groups. Body mass was 13 kg greater and FM was 16 kg greater in the obese boys than in the nonobese boys (P < 0.001). After controlling for FFM and FM, RMR did not differ significantly between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: When body composition is appropriately controlled for, RMR does not differ significantly between obese and nonobese boys.

### Measurement of energy expenditure [^114R2rwk]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Although investigators have been engaged in the study of human energy metabolism for over 100 years, there remain unanswered questions regarding the role that energy expenditure plays in human health and disease. A critical examination of available methods for the measurement of various components of daily energy expenditure is presented. Using a combination of the techniques available today, each component can be reliably studied, and the role that each plays in human health can be examined. Several examples of the application of energy expenditure methods are presented. Finally, data are presented describing knowledge regarding the relation between energy metabolism and cancer, including cancer risk, response to cancer, and in cancer survivors.

### Levothyroxine therapy, calculated deiodinases activity and basal metabolic rate in obese or nonobese patients after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, results of a retrospective observational study [^113bZ48H]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Therapy for hypothyroid obese patients is still under definition since the thyrotropin‐stimulating hormone (TSH) level is a less reliable marker of euthyroidism than in nonobese patients. Indeed, TSH levels positively correlate with body mass index (BMI), and this increase may be a compensatory mechanism aimed at increasing energy expenditure in obese people. In contrast, the correlation of BMI with thyroid hormone levels is not completely clear, and conflicting results have been obtained by several studies. The L‐T4 replacement dose is more variable in obese hypothyroid patients than in nonobese patients, and a recent study indicated that the L‐T4 replacement dose is related to lean body mass in obese thyroidectomized patients.

We aimed to study the correlations of L‐T4‐administered dose, thyroid hormone levels, and TSH secretion with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total calculated deiodinase activity (GD) in obese and nonobese athyreotic patients. We also looked for individualized L‐T4 replacement dose set points to be used in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We studied retrospectively 160 athyreotic patients, 120 nonobese and 40 obese. GD was calculated by SPINA Thyr 4.2, the responsiveness of the hypothalamic/pituitary thyrotrope by Jostel's TSH index, and BMR by the Mifflin‐St. Jeor formula. The interplay of GD and BMR with L‐T4, thyroid hormones, and TSH index (TSHI) was also evaluated.

- **Results**: In our study, the L‐T4 dose was an independent predictor of GD. Approximately 30% of athyreotic patients under L‐T4 therapy had a reduced GD.

### Youth metabolic equivalents differ depending on operational definitions [^114XFAR1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Low credibility.

Youth metabolic equivalents (METy) are sometimes operationally defined as multiples of predicted basal metabolic rate (METyBMR) and other times as multiples of measured resting metabolic rate (METyRMR). This study aimed to examine the comparability of METyBMR and METyRMR.

Indirect calorimetry data (Cosmed K4b) were analyzed from two studies, with a total sample of 245 youth (125 male participants, 6–18 years old, 37.4% overweight or obese). The Schofield equations were used to predict BMR, and K4b data from 30 minutes of supine rest were used to assess RMR. Participants performed structured physical activities (PA) of various intensities, and steady-state oxygen consumption was divided by predicted BMR and measured RMR to calculate METyBMR and METyRMR, respectively. Two-way (activity-METy calculation) analysis of variance was used to compare METyBMR and METyRMR (α = 0.05), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests. Intensity classifications were also compared after encoding METyBMR and METyRMR as sedentary behavior (≤ 1.50 METy), light PA (1.51–2.99 METy), moderate PA (3.00–5.99 METy), or vigorous PA (≥ 6.00 METy).

There was a significant interaction (F(30) = 3.6, P < 0.001), and METyBMR was significantly higher than METyRMR for 28 of 31 activities (P < 0.04), with differences ranging from 15.6% (watching television) to 23.1% (basketball). Intensity classifications were the same for both METy calculations in 69.0% of cases.

In conclusion, METyBMR and METyRMR differ considerably. Greater consensus is needed regarding how metabolic equivalents should be operationally defined in youth.

### Validation of a predictive method for an accurate assessment of resting energy expenditure in medical mechanically ventilated patients [^115n49XR]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to confirm the ability of a previously described equation to predict resting energy expenditure in mechanically ventilated patients by comparing it to indirect calorimetry.

- **Design**: This was a prospective validation study.

- **Setting**: The study took place in an 18-bed medical intensive care unit at a teaching hospital.

- **Patients**: All adult patients who were intubated for more than 24 hours were assessed for eligibility. Clinical situations that could contribute to erroneous calorimetric measurements were part of the exclusion criteria.

- **Interventions**: Resting energy expenditure was calculated using several equations: the original Harris-Benedict equations, those corrected for usual stress factors, the Swinamer equation, the Fusco equation, the Ireton-Jones equation, and this study's equation: resting energy expenditure (kcal/day) = 8 × weight (kg) + 14 × height (cm) + 32 × minute ventilation (L/min) + 94 × temperature (degrees C) − 4834.

- **Measurements and main results**: The resting energy expenditure for the 45 included patients was measured using indirect calorimetry. The resting energy expenditure calculated with the study's predictive model showed a correlation (r² = .62, p < .0001) with the measured resting energy expenditure. Bland-Altman analysis indicated a mean bias of -192 ± 277 kcal/day, with limits of agreement ranging from -735 to 351 kcal/day. In contrast, resting energy expenditure calculated with the Harris-Benedict equations had a weaker correlation (r² = .41, p < .0001) with measured values. The Bland-Altman analysis for this equation showed a mean bias of 279 ± 346 kcal/day, with limits of agreement ranging from -399 to 957 kcal/day.

### Effect of calorie restriction on resting metabolic rate and spontaneous physical activity [^1147wcJP]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine if resting metabolic rate (RMR) and spontaneous physical activity (SPA) decrease in weight-reduced non-obese participants. Furthermore, it seeks to establish whether changes in SPA, as measured in a respiratory chamber, reflect changes in free-living physical activity level (PAL).

- **Research methods and procedures**: Participants (N = 48) were randomized into four groups for six months: calorie restriction (CR, 25% restriction), CR plus structured exercise (CR+EX, 12.5% restriction plus 12.5% increased energy expenditure via exercise), low-calorie diet (LCD, 890 kcal/day supplement diet until 15% weight loss, then weight maintenance), and control (weight maintenance). Measurements were taken at baseline, Month 3, and Month 6. Body composition and RMR were assessed by DXA and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Two measures of SPA were collected in a respiratory chamber (percent of time active and kcal/day). Free-living PAL (PAL = total daily energy expenditure by doubly labeled water/RMR) was also measured. Regression equations at baseline were used to adjust RMR for fat-free mass and SPA (kcal/day) for body weight.

- **Results**: Adjusted RMR decreased at Month 3 in the CR group, and at Month 6 in the CR+EX and LCD groups. Neither measure of SPA decreased significantly in any group. PAL decreased at Month 3 in the CR and LCD groups, but not in the CR+EX group, who engaged in structured exercise. Changes in SPA in the chamber and free-living PAL were not related.

- **Discussion**: Body weight is defended in non-obese participants during modest caloric restriction, as evidenced by metabolic adaptations.

### Basal metabolic rate and autonomic nervous system dysfunction in men with spinal cord injury [^116BuiNS]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between autonomic nervous system dysfunction and basal metabolic rate (BMR), and the effect of spasticity on BMR.

Twenty men (11 paraplegic and 9 tetraplegic) with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)-A and -B grade chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in this study. Total body fat mass and lean tissue mass were measured in all participants using DXA by standard methods. Patients were allocated into two groups to determine the effect of autonomic nervous system dysfunction on BMR: Group I (T6 and upper-level injuries with a history of autonomic dysreflexia) and Group II (T7 and lower-level injuries without a history of autonomic dysreflexia). Measurements of BMR were determined by indirect calorimetry under standardized conditions.

There were 13 patients in Group I and 7 patients in Group II, and the differences between these two groups in terms of time since injury, BMI, age, weight, lean tissue mass, BMR, and BMR/kg were not significant.

We concluded that autonomic nervous system dysfunction does not affect BMR, and it might be ignored when considering energy needs in spinal cord injury.

### Comparison of resting energy expenditure prediction methods with measured resting energy expenditure in obese, hospitalized adults [^116zXJek]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Several methods are available to estimate caloric needs in hospitalized, obese patients who require specialized nutrition support; however, it is unclear which of these strategies most accurately approximates the caloric needs of this patient population. The purpose of this study was to determine which strategy most accurately predicts resting energy expenditure in this subset of patients.

- **Methods**: Patients assessed at high nutrition risk who required specialized nutrition support and met inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in this observational study. Adult patients were included if they were admitted to a medical or surgical service with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m². Criteria excluding patient enrollment were pregnancy and intolerance or contraindication to indirect calorimetry procedures. Investigators calculated estimations of resting energy expenditure for each patient using variations on the following equations: Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St. Jeor, Ireton-Jones, 21 kcal/kg body weight, and 25 kcal/kg body weight. For non-ventilated patients, the MedGem handheld indirect calorimeter was used. For ventilated patients, the metabolic cart was used. The primary endpoint was to identify which estimation strategy calculated energy expenditures to within 10% of measured energy expenditures.

- **Results**: The Harris-Benedict equation, using adjusted body weight with a stress factor, most frequently estimated resting energy expenditure to within 10% of measured resting energy expenditure in 50% of patients.

- **Conclusion**: Measured energy expenditure with indirect calorimetry was a significant component of this analysis.

### Differences in basal energy expenditure and obesity [^112EixVD]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of differences in basal energy expenditure on adiposity, statistical analysis was performed on a published database containing anthropometric and energy expenditure measurements for 433 women and 335 men. Published equations derived by multiple regression analysis were used to predict basal metabolic rates in women and men as a function of age, weight, and height. The differences between the observed and predicted rates (i.e. the residuals) were computed and expressed in terms of percentage deviation from the predicted rates of basal energy expenditure (BEE). In addition, individual body fat contents were computed using equations based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Study 3 data relating to body fat content determined by bioimpedance to BMI.

- **Results**: There is no correlation between percentage body fat content and deviations from predicted (which one would refer to as normal) BEE.

- **Discussion**: It can be concluded that relatively high or relatively low rates of BEE do not influence body weights and adiposity in a statistically identifiable manner. This contradicts and challenges the widely held view that low resting metabolic rates promote the development of obesity.

### Accurate estimation of energy requirements of young patients [^116KqRkM]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The provision of optimal nutritional care is based on accurate estimations of patients' resting energy expenditure. This can be calculated with the use of predictive equations or measured with indirect calorimetry (IC). Owing to their ease of use, mathematical equations have largely replaced IC in clinical practice. This article examines the limitations and predictive inaccuracy of commonly used equations in pediatrics, which may contribute to the provision of poor nutritional care and directly affect patient outcomes. In addition, the role of IC is discussed, and the physiology of nutrient metabolism, in terms of energy expenditure, is reviewed.

### The healthy/unhealthy dietary pattern is associated with resting metabolic rate status among women with overweight/obesity [^116tTiAW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity, which is relevant in the development of various chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and various cancers, has been increasing at an alarming rate. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, there are now more than 650 million obese adults worldwide. In 2002, about 70% of recorded mortalities in Iran were associated with obesity-related chronic diseases.

It is widely accepted that transitions in dietary intakes and eating habits play prominent roles in the increased rate of obesity, a multifactorial disorder. While prior studies have predominantly focused on the intake of individual nutrients in relation to chronic diseases, the combined effects of these nutrients are of greater importance. Therefore, classifying the effects of dietary components and their metabolic interactions is both theoretically and practically significant. Using dietary patterns allows a more comprehensive approach to preventing various health outcomes. Recent investigations have shown a close link between dietary patterns and obesity. Other studies have also identified dietary patterns as major causes of obesity. However, there is conflicting data in this regard, indicating the need for more studies to provide clarity.

The basal metabolic rate (BMR), as a complementary indicator of the body's metabolism, plays a role in understanding these dynamics.

### Acute vigorous exercise decreases subsequent nonexercise physical activity and body temperature linked to weight gain [^117N17ot]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Low credibility.

Body temperature, serving as a sensitive indicator of whole-body metabolic activity, immune function, and physical activity levels, is largely influenced by NEAT and basal metabolism. Therefore, a compensatory reduction in these physiological activities following exercise is more likely to be directly linked to a reduction in body temperature. In this context, we highlighted body temperature as a marker of thermogenesis encompassing NEAT and basal metabolism. Our study revealed the vigorous exercise–specific reduction in body temperature during the dark period following exercise (Fig. 3E). This observation suggests that vigorous exercise leads to a decrease in subsequent thermogenesis, encompassing NEAT and basal metabolism.

Intriguingly, we also observed a post-exercise reduction in body temperature during the late dark period (Figs. 3B, C), a time when exercise-induced reduction in NEPA did not occur (Figs. 2B, C). This implies that thermogenesis decreased independently of NEPA during this period, namely, reducing other physiological tasks in response to exercise. Probably, the post-exercise reduction in thermogenesis during the late dark period might result from decreases in the basal metabolic rate in mice. Considering that this reduction in body temperature during the late dark period is observed consistently in both ME and VE groups, our results suggest that exercise is likely to elicit a compensatory reduction in basal metabolic rate in mice, independent of exercise intensity. This insight hints at the notion that a decrease in basal metabolic rate may preferentially occur as a response to exercise.

### Association of predicted basal metabolic rate and insulin resistance in a Chinese general population [^1139QRTo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Although indirect calorimetry remains the gold standard for measuring BMR, its high cost and operational complexity limit its feasibility in large population-based studies. As a practical alternative, predictive equations are commonly used. In this study, BMR was estimated using the Singapore equation, which has been validated as the most accurate predictor for Chinese populations. The equation is as follows: BMR (kcal) = 0.2389 × [52.6 × weight (kg) + 828 × gender (female = 0, male = 1) + 1960]. Based on estimated BMR values, participants were classified into quartiles: Q1 (< 1,198 kcal), Q2 (1,198–1,281.3 kcal), Q3 (1,281.3–1,394.8 kcal), and Q4 (≥ 1,394.8 kcal), with Q1 designated as the reference group for comparative purposes.

- **Definitions of metabolic status**: Normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was defined as FPG < 6.1 mmol/L and PPG < 7.8 mmol/L. Impaired glucose regulation (IGR) was defined when 6.1 mmol/L ≤ FPG < 7.0 mmol/L and/or 7.8 mmol/L ≤ PPG < 11.1 mmol/L. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was defined as FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L and/or PPG ≥ 11.1 mmol/L. Normal blood pressure (NBP) was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) within the range of 90 mmHg ≤ SBP < 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 60 mmHg ≤ DBP < 90 mmHg. Hypertension (HTN) was defined when SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. According to the Chinese Guideline for the Management of Dyslipidemia in Adults (revised in 2016), LDL-C was classified into two subgroups: the LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L subgroup and the LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L subgroup. Similarly, HDL-C was divided into two subgroups: the HDL-C < 1 mmol/L subgroup and the HDL-C ≥ 1 mmol/L subgroup.

### Association of predicted basal metabolic rate and insulin resistance in a Chinese general population [^111tjdCZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Despite utilizing a large nationally representative sample from diverse regions of China, this study has several limitations. First, as a cross-sectional design, it cannot establish causal relationships between predicted BMR and the IR. Second, BMR was calculated using the Singapore equation, which is the most accurate BMR prediction equation but still demonstrated only 80% accuracy in Chinese populations, with error rates of 4% underestimation and 16% overestimation. Non-differential misclassification typically biases effect estimates toward the null, potentially attenuating observed associations between BMR and insulin resistance. This attenuation could lead to underestimation of true effect sizes, particularly in subgroup analyses where sample sizes are smaller and the impact of measurement error is more pronounced. Notably, this equation shows enhanced validity in overweight and obese individuals. Although indirect calorimetry remains the gold standard for BMR measurement, its high cost and logistical constraints limit its wide usage in large-scale epidemiological studies. However, given the large sample size and population-level validation of the equation, we believe the overall trends remain informative. Third, BMR is inherently correlated with sex and BMI, which could confound its association with IR. To mitigate this issue, we included an interaction term between sex and BMR in the models and conducted stratified analyses by BMI. Nonetheless, the sex ratio in our cohort was unbalanced, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, we employed a complete.

### Association between basal metabolic rate and cognitive function in Chinese older adults: The mediating effect of sarcopenia [^116HbitV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Future research should prioritize several directions to validate and deepen insights into the BMR-sarcopenia-cognition nexus. Firstly, employ objective measures: indirect calorimetry for BMR and DXA for muscle mass to address methodological limitations. Secondly, integrate biomarker analyses (e.g. inflammatory cytokines, IGF-1, oxidative stress markers) to elucidate underlying biological pathways. Thirdly, conduct intervention trials testing combined metabolic-muscle targets (e.g. resistance training and nutritional support) to establish causality. Fourthly, extend longitudinal designs with baseline cognitive adjustments and longer follow-ups across diverse populations (younger cohorts, multi-ethnic groups) to enhance generalizability and explore life-course effects. Finally, leverage advanced neuroimaging to assess brain-metabolism interactions.

### Liothyronine sodium [^112v6nEJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. In vitro studies indicate that T3 increases aerobic mitochondrial function, thereby increasing the rates of synthesis and utilization of myocardial high-energy phosphates. This, in turn, stimulates myosin ATPase and reduces tissue lactic acidosis. Thus, thyroid hormones exert a profound influence on virtually every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system.

While the source of levothyroxine (T4) and some triiodothyronine (T3) is via secretion from the thyroid gland, it is now well-established that approximately 80% of circulating T3 arises predominantly by way of the extrathyroidal conversion of T4. The membrane-bound enzyme responsible for this reaction is iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. Activity of the enzyme is greatest in the liver and kidney. A second pathway of T4 to T3 conversion occurs via a PTU-insensitive 5'-deiodinase located primarily in the pituitary and central nervous system.

The prohormone T4 must be converted to T3 in the body before it can exert biological effects. During periods of illness or stress, this conversion is often inhibited and can be diverted to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3) moiety. Therefore, correction of the hypothyroid condition in patients with myxedema coma is facilitated by the parenteral administration of triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is bound much less firmly to serum binding proteins.

### Toward the development of predictive equations for resting metabolic rate in acutely ill spontaneously breathing patients [^117S1Bd7]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

There are many equations used for calculating the energy needs of nutrition support patients, but few are developed specifically for the subset of spontaneously breathing, acutely ill patients. The purpose of the study was to validate existing equations and to start developing new equations for this cohort.

- **Methods**: Acutely ill patients not requiring mechanical ventilation had their resting metabolic rate measured using an indirect calorimeter. Metabolic rate was also calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, the Ireton-Jones equation for spontaneously breathing patients, and a modification of the Penn State equation in which the minute ventilation-dependent variable was removed. These calculated values were compared with measured expenditure and considered accurate if they fell within 10% of the measurement.

- **Results**: Fifty-five patients were measured successfully. The modified Penn State equation was accurate in 71% of patients compared with 44% for Ireton-Jones and 42% for Mifflin-St Jeor. Several forms of a new equation were outlined but not validated. The equation with the highest R² (0.82) was as follows: resting metabolic rate (kcal/d) = weight in kg (20) - age in years (3) + male sex (197) + body mass index in kg/m² (25.9) + mean heart rate in beats/min (9.4) + 89.

- **Conclusions**: A modification of the Penn State equation for predicting resting metabolic rate was shown to accurately predict resting metabolic rate in acutely ill, spontaneously breathing patients if body mass index was ≥ 20.5 kg/m². A new set of population-specific equations was outlined.

### Are individuals with type 2 diabetes metabolically inflexible? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111bPfNo]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Data sources and search strategy**: We systematically searched the PubMed database from its inception in 1982 through February 21, 2024, for studies on metabolic flexibility (i.e. insulin‐induced changes in respiratory exchange ratio (ΔRER)) in lean individuals, overweight/obese individuals, and individuals with T2D. The literature search consisted of three separate search strings targeted at the three populations. They consisted of keywords related to (1) lean AND metabolic flexibility AND clamp; (2) overweight AND metabolic flexibility AND clamp; and (3) T2D AND metabolic flexibility AND clamp. The search strings and the PRISMA checklist are provided in Appendix S1. No ethical issues are relevant to this review.

- **Study selection criteria**: We included studies reported in the English language that involved at least one of the three human target groups, that is, lean (Lean; BMI ≤ 25 kg/m²) or T2D (as defined in each article) and where indirect calorimetry at basal and during a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic or isoglycaemic clamp was performed. We included basal (post‐absorptive) RER data from any study type. In cases where a clinical trial lacked baseline (before an intervention) results but did provide post‐sham (placebo) RER results, these were included in the analysis. The data had to be presented as ΔRER or be calculable from basal and insulin‐stimulated values. Studies were excluded if the study populations were unclear or mixed (e.g. individuals with impaired glucose tolerance in a T2D group) or if a major disease might affect the results.

### Causal associations between basal metabolic rate and COVID-19 [^1132jLRa]. Diabetes (2023). Low credibility.

Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk factors, including obesity and diabetes, are associated with an abnormal basal metabolic rate (BMR). We aimed to evaluate whether BMR could impact the susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19. We performed genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess genetic correlations and potential causal associations between BMR (n = 448,348) and three COVID-19 outcomes: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and critical COVID-19 (n = 1,086,211–2,597,856). A multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was used to estimate the direct effect of BMR on COVID-19 independent of BMI and type 2 diabetes.

BMR has positive genetic correlations with the COVID-19 outcomes (genetic correlations 0.213–0.266). The MR analyses indicated that genetic liability to BMR confers causal effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.09–1.20, P = 1.65E-07), hospitalized COVID-19 (1.31, 1.18–1.46, P = 8.69E-07), and critical COVID-19 (1.04, 1.19–1.64, P = 4.89E-05). Sensitivity analysis of MR showed no evidence of directional pleiotropy or heterogeneity, indicating the robustness of its results. The MVMR analysis showed that the causal effects of BMR on hospitalized COVID-19 and critical COVID-19 were dependent on BMI and type 2 diabetes, but BMR may affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk independently of BMI and type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.15, P = 4.82E-03). Our study indicates that a higher BMR contributes to amplifying the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19.

### Metabolic drug survey highlights cancer cell dependencies and vulnerabilities [^114WJtrY]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

To uncover the basis for these differences, we first decided to investigate the basal metabolic profiles of our cancer cell line panel. We determined the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as proxies for mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively, by performing the Seahorse mitochondrial stress test (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Generally, cell lines in Groups I, II, and IV were predominately oxidative, whereas cell lines in Groups III and V were primarily glycolytic as assessed by differences in basal OCR, maximum respiration rate achieved, and the basal OCR/ECAR ratio (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 3c).

Comparison of overall metabolic profiles (OCR vs. ECAR) showed that the examined cell lines have analogous baseline metabolic phenotypes with few exceptions, suggesting that the mitochondrial cell function as measured by Seahorse analysis did not significantly influence the cell line clustering (Fig. 2e). Evaluation of the spare respiratory capacity, an indication of cellular fitness or flexibility, implied that Group I and II had the highest energetic stress response capability, consistent with the comparable drug response profiles detected (Supplementary Fig. 3d).

Since the mitochondrial stress test functionally evaluated basal metabolic activity of cells, it is likely that it did not fully capture the complete cellular metabolic profile. Thus, it is plausible to assume that the test output had an impact only on the sensitivity of inhibitors targeting energy metabolism.

### Circadian rhythms in resting metabolic rate account for apparent daily rhythms in the thermic effect of food [^112cete2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The thermic effect of food was calculated using a premeal resting metabolic rate (RMR) and a baseline RMR from the circadian RMR model, reported as both energy expenditure in kilocalories and as a percentage of energy intake.

Energy expenditure (EE) was measured while fasting and for 15 hours over a day, following three test meals provided at breakfast (1-hour after waking, or 0 minutes), lunch (5 hours after breakfast, or 300 minutes), and dinner (5 hours after lunch, or 600 minutes). The results are presented as mean ± SEM. The solid line represents measured EE over the entire day. The dotted line shows the baseline resting metabolic rate (RMR), while short dashes depict the RMR directly before meals. Long dashes illustrate the circadian model of RMR.

### Hypermetabolism in ALS is associated with greater functional decline and shorter survival [^114mcDoo]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of hypermetabolism in ALS and control participants. Hypermetabolism was defined by a metabolic index where measured resting energy expenditure was ≥ 120% of predicted resting energy expenditure. To compare normometabolic and hypermetabolic patients with ALS, we examined differences in demographics, clinical measures, anthropomorphic measures, cognitive scores, and the prevalence of familial disease. We also examined the correlation between metabolic index and changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, fat-free mass (kg), ALSFRS-R, and FVC over a 12-month follow-up period. We compared the survival of normometabolic and hypermetabolic ALS participants over a 30-month period following metabolic assessment.

The sample size calculation was based on a study reporting hypermetabolism in 68% of patients with ALS where measured resting energy expenditure was ≥ 110% of predicted resting energy expenditure. As we used a more conservative cut-off to define hypermetabolism (metabolic index ≥ 120%), we assumed that only 30% of patients with ALS and 5% of control individuals would be hypermetabolic. Adjusting for anticipated missing data of 5% in any of the three essential covariates (weight, body composition, and resting energy expenditure) to determine hypermetabolism, the number of participants needed to achieve 90% power with a two-sided alpha of 5% was 55 participants per arm.

Variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation for continuous variables or frequency and proportion for categorical variables.

### Resting energy expenditure: From cellular to whole-body level, a mechanistic historical perspective [^115NzxAo]. Obesity (2021). Low credibility.

The basis of heat generated by the human body has been a source of speculation and research for more than 2,000 years. Basal heat production, now usually referred to as resting energy expenditure (REE), is currently recognized as deriving from biochemical reactions at subcellular and cellular levels that are expressed in the energy expended by the body's 78 organs and tissues. These organs and tissues, and the 11 systems to which they belong, influence body size and shape.

Connecting these subcellular/cellular-level reactions to organs and tissues, and then on to body size and shape, provides a comprehensive understanding of individual differences in REE, a contemporary topic of interest in obesity research and clinical practice. This review critically examines these linkages, their association with widely used statistical and physiological REE prediction formulas, and often-unappreciated aspects of measuring basal heat production in humans.

### A biometric study of human basal metabolism [^116uEsNV]. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (1918). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE)" estimates the amount of energy expended by an individual at rest, providing a measure of the minimum energy required to maintain basic physiological functions such as breathing, circulation, and cell production. This calculator is particularly applicable to patients who are critically ill, those with malnutrition, or individuals undergoing weight management programs.

The clinical utility of the BEE calculator lies in its ability to guide nutritional interventions by providing an estimate of a patient's caloric needs. It assists in determining appropriate caloric intake for managing conditions such as obesity, malnutrition, or metabolic disorders.

However, the BEE calculator should not be used in isolation. It does not account for physical activity or the thermic effect of food, both of which significantly contribute to total energy expenditure. Moreover, the BEE calculator may not be accurate in certain populations, such as those with extreme obesity or lean body mass, or in individuals with significant alterations in body composition. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other clinical assessments and individualized patient considerations.

### Non-zero basal oxygen flow a hazard to anesthesia breathing circuit leak test [^113gdU7H]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The non-zero basal flow (BF) of oxygen in anesthesia machines has been set to supply the basal metabolic requirement of oxygen. However, there is no scientific evidence of its necessity. In this study, we sought to clarify whether non-zero BF affects leak detection during preanesthetic inspections. Twenty-five participants performed leak tests on anesthesia machines to detect breathing circuit leaks. Artificial leak-producing devices were used to create leaks from 0 to 1.0 L/min. The investigator randomly chose the leak device and connected it into the breathing circuit. Participants, blinded as to the presence or the type of leak-producing device, then tested the breathing circuit for leaks. The conventional breathing system leak test was performed with and without BF. The results of leak detection in each leak procedure were analyzed statistically. The leak detection rate of the leak test with BF was less than without BF (P < 0.01). We demonstrated that non-zero BF of oxygen decreases the leak detection rate and is an obstacle for leak detection, especially for small leaks. Therefore, we recommend that breathing circuit leak tests should be performed in the absence of BF of oxygen.

### Predictive equations for energy expenditure in adult humans: From resting to free-living conditions [^115zYrcD]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

Humans acquire energy from the environment for survival. A central question for nutritional sciences is how much energy is required to sustain cellular work while maintaining an adequate body mass. Because human energy balance is not exempt from thermodynamic principles, the energy requirement can be approached from the energy expenditure. Conceptual and technological advances have allowed understanding of the physiological determinants of energy expenditure.

Body mass, sex, and age are the main factors determining energy expenditure. These factors constitute the basis for predictive equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) in healthy adults. These equations yield predictions that differ by up to ~400 kcal/d for REE and ~550 kcal/d for TEE. Identifying additional factors accounting for such variability and the most valid equations appears relevant.

This review used novel approaches based on the mathematical modeling of REE and analyses of the data from which REE predictive equations were generated. As for TEE, R² and SE were considered because only a few predictive equations are available. From these analyses, Oxford's and Plucker's equations appear valid for predicting REE and TEE in adults, respectively.

### Energy metabolism and the metabolic syndrome: Does a lower basal metabolic rate signal recovery following weight loss [^115vzdrv]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

- **Aim**: To determine whether basal metabolic rate (BMR) was causally related to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and to study the role of gender in this relationship.

- **Methods**: Seventy-two Caucasian subjects (43 women, 29 men) had changes in basal metabolic rate (BMR), carbohydrate oxidation rate (COR), fat oxidation rate (FOR), and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) assessed in response to weight loss.

- **Results**: There was a significant gender×MetS interaction in BMR at the start. Women with MetS had higher adjusted BMR, whilst men with MetS had lower adjusted BMR than their respective counterparts. Weight loss resulted in a significant decrease in fat mass (-5.2 ± 0.31 kg, p = 0.001), fat-free mass (-2.3 ± 0.27 kg, p = 0.001), BMR (-549 ± 58 kJ/d, p = 0.001), and a decreased proportion of MetS (22/72, χ(2) = 0.005). Subjects who recovered from MetS after weight loss (RMS) had approximately 250 kJ/d significantly lower adjusted BMR compared to those who were never MetS (NMS, p = 0.046) and those who still had MetS (MetS+, p = 0.047). Regression analysis showed that change (Δ) in BMR was best determined by Δglucose×gender interaction (r(2) = 23%), ΔFOR (r(2) = 20.3%), ΔCOR (r(2) = 19.4%), and Δtriglycerides (r(2) = 7.8%).

- **Conclusions**: There is a sexual dimorphism of BMR in MetS. Overall, the data support the notion that alterations in BMR may be central to the etiopathogenesis of MetS.

### Reliability of bioimpedance and indirect calorimetry to evaluate resting metabolic rate in Brazilian women with metabolic syndrome [^1158BEFG]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Precise evaluation of resting metabolic rate (RMR) is critical, especially for seniors with syndromic conditions. The study aimed to compare different methods and devices for evaluating the resting metabolic rate and assess their reliability in Brazilian women with metabolic syndrome.

- **Methods**: A single-center prospective study with forty elderly postmenopausal women was conducted to verify the reliability of indirect calorimetry (IC) versus bioimpedance (BIA) on RMR fluctuations over an interval of six months.

- **Results**: Measurements showed a high correlation between devices at baseline [BIA vs. IC, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.906 (0.822–0.950)]. Interestingly, a high correlation was maintained between BIA and IC after six months [BIA vs. IC, ICC = 0.909 (0.829–0.952)]. The results suggest that both BIA and IC are excellent strategies to measure RMR in elderly postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: However, the BIA method presents greater convenience, optimizes patients' time, and does not require prolonged fasting to obtain results that are reliable compared to IC.

### New predictive resting metabolic rate equations for high-level athletes: A cross-validation study [^115vP7NQ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Low credibility.

The present study aims (a) to assess the agreement between the measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry and different predictive equations (predicted RMR), and (b) to propose and cross-validate two new predictive equations for estimating the RMR in high-level athletes.

- **Methods**: The RMR of 102 athletes (44 women) was assessed using indirect calorimetry, while the body composition was assessed using skinfolds. Comparisons between measured and predicted RMR values were performed using one-way ANOVA. Mean difference, root mean square error (RMSE), simple linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement between measured and predicted RMR. The accuracy of predictive equations was analyzed using narrower and wider accuracy limits (± 5% and ± 10%, respectively) of measured RMR. Multiple linear regression models were employed to develop the new predictive equations based on traditional predictors (Equation 1) and the stepwise method (Equation 2).

- **Results**: The new Equations 1 and 2 presented good agreement based on the mean difference (3 and −15 kcal·d⁻¹), RMSE (200 and 192 kcal·d⁻¹), R² (0.71 and 0.74), respectively, and accuracy (61% of subjects within the limit of ± 10% of measured RMR). Cunningham's equation provided the best performance for males and females among the existing equations, whereas Harris & Benedict's equation showed the worst performance for males (mean difference = 406 kcal·d⁻¹; RMSE = 473 kcal·d⁻¹). Compared to measured RMR, most predictive equations showed a heteroscedastic distribution.

### The competitive mediating role of basal metabolic rate in the association between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure and depression risk [^112YTANy]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The effect of basal metabolic rate (BMR) on depression was unclear. This study investigated the potential role of BMR in the association of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure and depression.

- **Methods**: The study was based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). BMR was calculated using both the revised Harris-Benedict equation (BMR1) and the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (BMR2). Generalized linear and logistic regression models were applied to examine the associations between PAH metabolites, BMR, and depression. Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) were utilized to analyze the combined effects of multiple PAH metabolites. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore the role of BMR.

- **Results**: The study included 8,323 participants. A 100 kcal/day increase in BMR1 and BMR2 increased the depression risk by 5% (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10) and 7% (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13), respectively. The WQS model indicated that mixed PAH metabolites were negatively associated with BMR1 (β: -0.06, P = 0.020) and BMR2 (β: -0.06, P = 0.014). BKMR models showed that when all PAH metabolites were at P75 compared to P50, BMR1 and BMR2 decreased by 20.54 and 20.31 units, respectively, while the depression risk increased by 0.23 units (95% CI: 0.07, 0.38). Mediation analyses suggested that BMR exerted a competitive mediation effect in the association between 1-NAP, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 1-PYR, and depression.

- **Conclusion**: PAH exposure led to a reduction in BMR and contributed to depression at high levels of exposure. An increase in PAH exposure intensifies depression risk, manifesting a competitive mediation role of BMR in this association.

### Mammalian maxilloturbinal evolution does not reflect thermal biology [^111rcCKu]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The presence of the maxilloturbinal has been used to infer the endothermic conditions and basal metabolic rates of extinct tetrapods, whereas its relative size has been argued and/or tested to correlate with body temperature and metabolic rates. However, extant mammalian species differ in their thermal and metabolic characteristics. Diminished temperature regulation, relatively low body temperature, and basal metabolic rates have been documented among marsupials, monotremes, xenarthrans, subterranean rodents, and afrotherians, as well as some mammals that undergo different forms of heterothermy (e.g. long-term hibernation or daily torpor). Such thermal and physiological exceptions have been hypothesized to be linked to peculiar maxilloturbinals.

Using a comparative three-dimensional (3D) µCT dataset of 424 skulls and unstained ethanol-preserved heads for 310 species across all major mammalian orders, we explored the anatomical diversity of the maxilloturbinal based on relative surface area, morphology, and complexity. We subsequently extended the initial investigations of Owerkowicz et al. and tested the hypothesis that maxilloturbinal size reflects species thermophysiology. We specifically test the relationship between the size-corrected basal metabolic rate (cBMR) and the relative surface area of the maxilloturbinal (Maxillo RSA) as well as between body temperature (T b) and Maxillo RSA.

Here, we show that neither corrected basal metabolic rate (cBMR) nor body temperature (T b) significantly correlate with the relative surface area of the maxilloturbinal (Maxillo RSA).

### Impact of the basal metabolic ratio in predicting early deaths after allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^115mptQQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Early deaths after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) are of major concern. Assuming that both decreased and increased basal metabolism might relate to early deaths, we analyzed the risk factors for overall survival up to days 30 (OS30) and 60 (OS60). The Harris-Benedict equation was used to calculate basal metabolism. By comparing a patient's basal metabolism (PBM), calculated from pretransplant body weight, with the standard basal metabolism (SBM), calculated from standard body weight (BMI = 22), we defined the basal metabolic ratio (BMR) as a parameter (BMR = PBM/SBM).

We retrospectively analyzed 360 adult patients transplanted between 1997 and 2006 at a single center in Japan.

- **Risk factors identified**: A multivariate analysis of OS30 showed the risk factors to be a BMR > 1.05 (high BMR; HBR) (P = 0.005) and non-complete remission (non-CR) (P = 0.001), whereas a multivariate analysis of OS60 revealed risk factors to be a low BMR (LBR) (P = 0.02), HBR (P = 0.04), non-CR (P = 0.002), and performance status ≤ 1 (P = 0.01).

- **Survival rates**: OS30 and OS60 were favorable in the 0.95 < BMR ≤ 1.05 range (average BMR; ABR) with survival rates of 96.8% and 90.3% for ABR, 87.1% and 76.2% for LBR, and 87.8% and 81.1% for HBR.

In conclusion, BMR could prove to be a predictor of early death after allo-SCT.

### Obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood: Elevated triglycerides but not basal metabolic rate [^113ttDjx]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

Studies on the associations between obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism with basal metabolic rate and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents are scarce.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of children with obesity (n = 294) from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Childhood Obesity cohort. Differences in basal metabolic rate were quantified by indirect calorimetry. The cardiovascular risk factors examined included body mass index, blood lipids, fasting and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose, glycated haemoglobin, and insulin resistance, between subjects with and without subclinical hypothyroidism. The associations of baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and ΔTSH with changes in cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed.

- **Results**: Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism had elevated triacylglycerides but no alterations in basal metabolic rate or other measured cardiovascular risk factors. ΔTSH was positively associated with Δtriacylglycerides, Δtotal cholesterol, and ΔLDL cholesterol, independently of age, sex, Δbody mass index, and ΔT4. In the subclinical hypothyroidism group, 92% of individuals normalized their TSH levels within 0.9–2.9 years.

- **Conclusions**: Children with obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism did not have an altered basal metabolic rate but did have elevated triacylglycerides. During the follow-up period, TSH changed in parallel with several blood lipids. Elevated TSH often normalized without pharmaceutical intervention within 3 years.

- **Impact**: The present study found that subclinical hypothyroidism in pediatric populations was associated with elevated triglycerides despite unaltered basal metabolic rates.

### Auricular or body acupuncture: Which one is more effective in reducing abdominal fat mass in Iranian men with obesity: A randomized clinical trial [^116YAk6w]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Macronutrients in volunteers were prepared with daily food. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) refers to the amount of calories required on a daily basis if individuals do not move at all and expend the minimal amount of energy. The Harris Benedict Formula takes the number produced by the BMR formula and multiplies it according to the activity level. In our study, energy expenditure was computed using the Harris and Benedict equation. Participants consumed an isocaloric diet two weeks before starting the study and then continued with the same low-calorie diet for six weeks. This isocaloric diet is a moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-fat diet that permits volunteers to eat a variety of foods as long as they consume a consistent amount of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats daily. The low-calorie diet consisted of 500 kcal per day. Resting energy expenditure was calculated using the Harris and Benedict equation to determine the daily energy amount for each participant in both the case and control groups. Diet plans and the six-week dietary program for each participant were devised by a nutritionist based on individual energy expenditure. Participants were followed up with weekly.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Body electroacupuncture treatment in group A**: The research team identified standardized body acupuncture points according to traditional Chinese medical practice and clinical experience. Based on a short interview, participants were classified as having either an excess (phlegm-dampness or phlegm-heat) or deficiency (Spleen/Stomach Qi Defici).
