## Question

Mild degenerative changes of the interfacial joint of the left finger, distal greater than proximal. Mild/moderate degenerative changes of the first MTP, first CMC, and tirscaphe joints.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what these X-ray findings mean and what to do next regarding suspected osteoarthritis involving the interphalangeal joints (distal greater than proximal), first CMC, triscaphe, and first MTP. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis from the radiographic pattern. Then, I should correlate imaging with symptoms and functional impact. Next, I will outline evidence-based management priorities, starting with nonpharmacologic and then pharmacologic options. After that, I need to consider joint-specific strategies, potential injections or surgery, monitoring intervals, and when to escalate care. Finally, I should ensure the differential is addressed, especially inflammatory and septic arthritis, and close with key takeaways supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the radiographic diagnosis before proceeding. The described pattern — osteophytes, joint space narrowing, and subchondral sclerosis, predominating at the DIP over PIP joints, with involvement of the first CMC and scaphotrapezial (STT) joints — is classic for hand osteoarthritis, particularly nodal and thumb-base OA; this distribution fits expected phenotypes, but wait, I should verify that this constellation aligns with guideline-described features, which it does for peripheral joint OA on conventional radiographs [^notfound].

> I need to check the role and limits of imaging here. Plain radiography is appropriate to confirm OA features and to exclude alternative pathology; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about advanced imaging because EULAR and AAFP emphasize that MRI or ultrasound is not routinely needed unless there are atypical features or suspicion of inflammatory arthritis where these modalities can show synovitis or erosions, so I should reserve additional imaging for red flags or diagnostic uncertainty [^113Qrjar] [^112pPX98].

> Next, I should review how well imaging correlates with symptoms, because management must be symptom-driven. Wait, let me verify the evidence on discordance: both older and more recent summaries indicate radiographic severity correlates poorly with pain and function, so treatment decisions should hinge on pain, stiffness, and functional limitation rather than x-ray grade alone; I also need to consider risk modifiers such as female sex and age, given data on sex-related structural vulnerability, but I will not overinterpret imaging severity without clinical corroboration [^113fg6yX] [^112obdbh].

> I will now establish management goals. The priorities are to reduce pain, preserve function, and delay or avoid surgery while aligning choices with guideline evidence; I should confirm pharmacologic hierarchies and ensure we layer nonpharmacologic measures throughout, recognizing OA as a chronic condition requiring longitudinal care and realistic expectations about progression and symptom variability [^notfound].

> Before medications, I need to ensure foundational nonpharmacologic care is in place. Let me consider education, activity modification to reduce pinch/grip overload, thumb spica splinting for CMC pain, hand therapy for joint protection and adaptive strategies, and range-of-motion and heat for stiffness; although individual elements vary across guidelines, the multidisciplinary emphasis on function-focused rehabilitation is consistent, and I should confirm ongoing reinforcement at each visit [^notfound].

> Now, I should review pharmacologic first-line therapy. I should double-check current recommendations: for hand OA, start with topical NSAIDs due to favorable efficacy-safety balance, then consider oral NSAIDs if inadequate response and comorbidity risk allows, and use duloxetine as an alternative for persistent pain or when NSAIDs are contraindicated; I need to ensure GI, renal, and CV risks are screened and monitored when escalating therapy [^116wZybL].

> Wait, I initially labeled this as Step 5: Consider Adjunctive Therapy, but I see I misnumbered and duplicated step labels; let me correct that and clearly state that for focal flares, especially at the first CMC, corticosteroid injections can be considered as adjuncts when conservative measures are insufficient, recognizing that this option was not specifically detailed in the provided extracts and should be individualized with shared decision-making while continuing core therapies [^111P7sF8].

> I should review joint-specific considerations because the thumb base is functionally critical. If substantial pain and disability persist despite optimized conservative care, surgical options such as trapeziectomy with or without LRTI, or newer interposition techniques, may be appropriate; I need to ensure imaging and symptom assessment guide referral timing rather than x-ray severity alone, and remember that evidence does not establish a single superior surgical technique, so referral to a hand specialist for individualized evaluation is prudent [^114jBtx4] [^111yYgjG].

> Let me think about monitoring and reassessment. I should confirm a practical interval: reassess at about 4–6 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to evaluate pain scores, function, adherence, and adverse effects, then adjust by intensifying topical measures, adding or switching to oral NSAIDs if safe, or introducing duloxetine if needed; if response remains suboptimal and function is impaired, I should verify indications for injection or surgical referral [^116wZybL] [^111yYgjG].

> I need to ensure the long-term plan addresses chronicity and global impact. Ongoing nonpharmacologic strategies should be reinforced at every visit, with periodic medication reviews for safety and efficacy; hold on, I should also keep in mind the public health burden and progressive nature of OA when setting expectations and goals over time, emphasizing self-management and realistic functional targets [^114B85s3] [^111P7sF8].

> But wait, what about therapies outside guideline hierarchies that patients may ask about, like colchicine for hand OA? I should double-check the recent randomized evidence: a 12-week RCT of colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily in symptomatic hand OA showed no superiority over placebo for pain reduction, so I should not recommend colchicine for this indication based on current data [^1121kUcy].

> Next, I should review the differential to avoid missing inflammatory or infectious conditions. If morning stiffness is prolonged, there is synovitis or atypical distribution, or rapid progression, I need to consider inflammatory arthritis and, after initial radiography, use ultrasound or MRI to detect synovitis and erosions as recommended; if there are acute systemic symptoms, warmth, marked swelling, or inability to move the joint, I should consider septic arthritis, obtain prompt imaging to screen and guide aspiration, and proceed with diagnostic arthrocentesis as indicated [^112pPX98] [^11257Mjb] [^111YJSv5] [^1164cqXm].

> To summarize, I should confirm OA on plain radiographs but let symptoms drive treatment, begin with nonpharmacologic measures and topical NSAIDs, escalate judiciously to oral NSAIDs or duloxetine with risk assessment, consider targeted injections or surgery for refractory, function-limiting disease, monitor at 4–6 weeks for response and adverse effects, and reserve advanced imaging for atypical or inflammatory presentations, ensuring timely evaluation for infection when red flags appear [^111yYgjG] [^116wZybL] [^113Qrjar].

The findings indicate **degenerative osteoarthritis** with **greater distal involvement** in the left finger and mild to moderate changes in the first MTP, CMC, and triscaphe joints [^113fg6yX]. Management should prioritize **conservative care** (topical NSAIDs, hand/foot therapy, orthoses, and activity modification), with escalation to intra-articular corticosteroids or surgery if symptoms persist [^116wZybL] [^111P7sF8]. Prognosis is generally stable but may progress with age or repetitive use; regular follow-up is recommended to monitor function and adjust treatment [^111P7sF8].

## Clinical significance and implications

### Left finger interphalangeal joint degeneration

Distal greater than proximal involvement is **typical of osteoarthritis (OA)**, especially in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, and is often associated with Heberden's nodes and reduced dexterity. Patients may experience pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased range of motion, particularly with repetitive hand use or gripping activities [^113KCvMV]. Although mild, these changes can significantly affect fine motor skills, grip strength, and daily activities such as writing, typing, or manipulating small objects [^1111SSzN].

---

### First metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint degeneration

- **Hallux rigidus**: Mild to moderate degenerative changes in the first MTP joint are characteristic of hallux rigidus, a common form of OA affecting the big toe.

- **Clinical symptoms**: Patients typically report pain, stiffness, swelling, and difficulty with ambulation, particularly during toe-off phase of gait.

- **Functional impact**: These changes can significantly impair mobility, balance, and overall quality of life, potentially leading to compensatory gait patterns and secondary musculoskeletal issues.

---

### First carpometacarpal (CMC) joint degeneration

Mild to moderate degenerative changes in the first CMC joint indicate **thumb base OA**, a common condition, especially in postmenopausal women [^114jBtx4]. Symptoms include pain, swelling, and decreased grip strength, often exacerbated by activities requiring pinching or gripping [^113KCvMV]. Functionally, these changes can significantly impair hand use, limiting daily tasks such as opening jars, writing, or using tools.

---

### Triscaphe joint degeneration

Mild to moderate degenerative changes in the triscaphe joint (scaphoid, trapezium, trapezoid) indicate **wrist OA**, often related to repetitive use or prior trauma. Patients may experience pain, stiffness, and decreased wrist mobility, particularly during repetitive tasks [^113KCvMV]. Functionally, these changes can significantly impair hand and wrist performance, limiting tasks that require wrist flexibility and strength [^1111SSzN].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and assessment

- **Radiography**: Plain radiographs are the primary imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring OA, providing information on joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis [^113fg6yX] [^113Qrjar].

- **MRI**: MRI is useful for detecting early cartilage changes, synovitis, and bone marrow lesions, particularly in cases where radiographic findings are inconclusive or when soft tissue involvement is suspected [^1152ewor] [^113PBCQ4].

- **Ultrasound**: Ultrasound can be useful for detecting synovitis and guiding intra-articular injections, particularly in hand and wrist OA [^1119PiSL] [^116f4QqD].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Topical NSAIDs are recommended as first-line treatment for hand OA due to their effectiveness and minimal adverse effects. Oral NSAIDs and duloxetine may be considered if topical treatments are insufficient [^116wZybL] [^116qRAMF].

- **Physical therapy**: Hand and foot therapy, including exercises to improve joint mobility, strength, and function, are essential components of conservative management [^1111SSzN].

- **Orthotic devices**: Splints and orthotic devices can provide joint support, reduce pain, and improve function, particularly in thumb base and wrist OA.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, activity modification, and ergonomic adjustments are important to reduce joint stress and prevent progression [^111P7sF8].

---

### Interventional and surgical management

Intra-articular **corticosteroid injections** may provide temporary relief of pain and inflammation, particularly in the first MTP and CMC joints [^111P7sF8]. Surgical interventions, such as **trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI)** or **pyrocarbon disc interposition**, may be considered in advanced cases with significant functional impairment [^114jBtx4].

---

## Prognosis and progression

Mild degenerative changes may remain **stable for years**, but **progression is possible**, particularly with continued joint stress or repetitive use. Progression can significantly impair hand and foot function, leading to chronic pain, disability, and reduced quality of life. Regular follow-up is essential to assess progression, adjust treatment strategies, and prevent complications [^116qRAMF].

---

## Conclusion

These findings indicate **degenerative osteoarthritis** with greater distal involvement in the left finger and mild to moderate changes in the first MTP, CMC, and triscaphe joints. Management should prioritize **conservative care** (topical NSAIDs, hand/foot therapy, orthoses, and activity modification), escalating to intra-articular corticosteroids or surgery if symptoms persist. Prognosis is generally stable but may progress with age or repetitive use; regular follow-up is recommended to monitor function and adjust treatment [^1152ewor].

### Radiographic assessment of osteoarthritis [^113fg6yX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is one of the most prevalent and disabling chronic conditions affecting older adults and is a significant public health problem among adults of working age. As the bulk of the U.S. population ages, the prevalence of osteoarthritis is expected to rise. Although the incidence of osteoarthritis increases with age, the condition is not a normal part of the aging process. More severe symptoms tend to occur in the radiographically more advanced stage of the disease; however, there may be considerable discrepancy between symptoms and the radiographic stage.

Roentgenograms of involved joints may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of osteoarthritis, assessing the severity of the disease, reassuring the patient, and excluding other pathological conditions. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based primarily on the history and physical examination. Radiographic findings, including asymmetric joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, subluxation, and distribution patterns of osteoarthritic changes, can be helpful when the diagnosis is in question.

Data extraction was performed by the first author using a purpose-designed Excel (Microsoft) spreadsheet. Extracted data comprised CPG characteristics, such as title and country of publication, methodology, and guideline topic target users. From each CPG, extracted recommendations were ranked as either "should do", "could do", "do not do", or "uncertain". These recommendation ratings were consistent with language used in the CPGs and definitions from a previous musculoskeletal systematic review of CPGs. Language among the CPGs varied, although recommendations were ranked according to the same criteria using either the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine standards, or PEDro scores. Extracted data and recommendation rankings were checked by two authors, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion among the three reviewers while consulting the original citation.

- **Recommendation classification, definition, and examples**:

	- A narrative summary was drafted by the first author and then reviewed and refined by two authors. The summary detailed how many CPGs reported on an intervention, what the recommendations involved, and how consistent or inconsistent recommendations were across CPGs regarding OA interventions.

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 50 mg and 75 mg NUCYNTA tablets given every 4 to 6 hours during waking hours for 10 days in patients aged 18 to 80 years, experiencing moderate to severe pain from end-stage degenerative joint disease of the hip or knee, defined as a 3-day mean pain score of ≥ 5 on an 11-point pain intensity scale, ranging from 0 to 10. Pain scores were assessed twice daily and evaluated the pain experienced by the patient over the previous 12 hours. Patients were allowed to continue non-opioid analgesic therapy for which they had been on a stable regimen before screening throughout the study. Eighty-three percent (83%) of patients in the tapentadol treatment groups and the placebo group took such analgesia during the study. The 75 mg treatment group was dosed at 50 mg for the first day of the study, followed by 75 mg for the remaining nine days. Patients requiring rescue analgesics other than study medication were discontinued for lack of efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing the sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) versus placebo over the first five days of treatment. NUCYNTA tablets 50 mg and 75 mg provided improvement in pain compared with placebo based on the 5-Day SPID.

For various degrees of improvement from baseline to the Day 5 endpoint, the study's results illustrate the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figures are cumulative, such that every patient achieving a 50% reduction in pain is included in the evaluation.

### Lisfranc injury: Imaging findings for this important but often-missed diagnosis [^1178jWAs]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The Lisfranc injury is a significant topic in radiology, orthopedic surgery, and emergency medicine literature, primarily due to the subtleties of the radiographic findings and the potentially dire consequences of missed diagnoses. This article aims to help readers understand the anatomy of the tarsometatarsal joint, identify a systematic approach for its evaluation, and demonstrate how a multimodality approach can be used in both straightforward and more complex cases.

Specifically, the utility of lateral and weight-bearing radiographs, as well as computed tomography and magnetic resonance, will be addressed. The dorsoplantar radiograph is often the first radiological examination performed after the initial history and physical examination. An understanding of the anatomy of the normal Lisfranc joint and subtle findings in the abnormal joint is essential for making an accurate diagnosis. Lateral and weight-bearing radiographs can be very useful in evaluating for subtle dislocation and minimizing the effects of overlapping structures at the tarsometatarsal joint.

Computed tomography is particularly helpful in the delineation of anatomy and identification of small fractures. The strength of magnetic resonance lies in its ability to show isolated ligamentous injury and bone marrow edema. By the end of the article, the reader should be able to describe the normal anatomy of the tarsometatarsal joint, identify findings of Lisfranc injury on all three modalities, and understand the specific indications for the use of each modality.

### Is osteoarthritis one disease or a collection of many [^1177KYRa]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted and heterogeneous syndrome that may be amenable to tailored treatment. There has been an increasing focus within the OA research community on the identification of meaningful OA phenotypes with potential implications for prognosis and treatment. Experimental and clinical data combined with sophisticated statistical approaches have been used to characterize and define phenotypes from the symptomatic and structural perspectives. An improved understanding of the existing phenotypes based on underlying disease mechanisms may shed light on the distinct entities that make up the disease. This narrative review provides an updated summary of the most recent advances in this field as well as limitations from previous approaches that can be addressed in future studies.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2014: Imaging [^113PBCQ4]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

This narrative review covers original publications related to imaging in osteoarthritis (OA) published in English between April 2013 and March 2014. In vitro data, animal studies, and studies with fewer than 20 observations were not included.

To extract relevant studies, an extensive PubMed database search was performed using the query terms "osteoarthritis" in combination with "MRI", "imaging", "radiography", "ultrasound", "computed tomography", and "nuclear medicine". Publications were sorted according to relevance based on their potential impact on the OA research community, with the overarching goal of providing a balanced overview covering all aspects of imaging. The focus was on publications in high-impact, special interest journals. The literature is presented in a methodological fashion covering radiography, ultrasound, and compositional and morphologic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from an anatomic perspective including bone, muscle, meniscus, and synovitis.

Imaging research in OA last year was characterized by a strong focus on MRI-based studies addressing epidemiological and methodological aspects of the disease. Ultrastructural tissue assessment, specifically of cartilage and meniscus using compositional MRI, is evolving further. Additional subsets of the large publicly available Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) MRI dataset are currently being analyzed, with muscle analyses becoming increasingly prominent in the community. Bone parameters were evaluated using varying technology.

### Results of pyrocarbon disc interposition compared to trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition [^114jBtx4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal (CMC-1) joint is a degenerative disease most commonly affecting postmenopausal women. Surgical intervention is indicated in cases of advanced disease progression involving symptomatic patients who experience impairment in range of motion (ROM), strength, or pain. Despite extensive research comparing numerous operative strategies over the past decades, no method has been proven to be superior regarding the reduction of pain or improvement in physical function or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).

Trapeziectomy is usually performed, with or without a tendonplasty.

- **An additional ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition plasty (LRTI)**: This is performed to enhance stability and prevent proximal migration and subsequent grinding of the first metacarpal on the proximal hemitrapezium. However, it has been shown that an autologous tendon graft hardly maintains the height of the trapezial space, and postoperative outcomes are variable in terms of strength and ROM.

In patients with radiologic Eaton-Glickel stage II or III, a distal hemitrapeziectomy instead of a total trapeziectomy can be performed, saving the scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal (STT) joint. It is postulated that with the interposition of the pyrocarbon disc (PyroDisk; Integra LifeSciences Corporation), the shortcomings of the autologous tendon graft can be overcome. This implant is a biarticular convex disc made of pyrocarbon, designed to resurface the damaged CMC-1 joint after hemitrapeziectomy. Interposition of the pyrocarbon disc can preserve thumb height because of minimal resection.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2015: Imaging [^1115iwVC]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

This narrative review covers original publications related to imaging in osteoarthritis (OA) published in English between April 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015. Novel lessons relating to imaging are described.

An extensive PubMed database search was performed based on, but not limited to, the terms "OA" in combination with "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "imaging", "radiography", "ultrasound", "computed tomography (CT)", and "nuclear medicine" to extract relevant studies. In vitro data and animal studies were excluded. This review focuses on new developments and observations based on the aforementioned imaging modalities, as well as a 'whole-organ' approach by presenting findings from different tissues (bone, meniscus, synovium, muscle, and fat) and joints (hip, lumbar spine, and hand).

Over the past year, studies using imaging have made a major contribution to the understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. Significant work has continued, particularly at the knee, with MRI now being increasingly used to assess structural endpoints in clinical trials. This offers the exciting opportunity to explore potential disease-modifying OA therapies. There has been a clear interest in the role of bone in the pathogenesis of OA. There is now a growing body of literature examining the pathogenesis of OA at the hip, lumbar spine, and hand. The future of imaging in OA offers the exciting potential to better understand the disease process across all joints and develop more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions.

### Rates of change and sensitivity to change in cartilage morphology in healthy knees and in knees with mild, moderate, and end-stage radiographic osteoarthritis: Results from 831 participants from the osteoarthritis initiative [^112vcYtn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

To study the longitudinal rate of and sensitivity to change of knee cartilage thickness across defined stages of radiographic osteoarthritis (OA), specifically healthy knees and knees with end-stage radiographic OA, one knee of 831 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants was examined. The study included 112 healthy knees, without radiographic OA or risk factors for knee OA, and 719 radiographic OA knees categorized by calculated Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grades: 310 at grade 2, 300 at grade 3, and 109 at grade 4.

Subregional change in thickness was assessed after segmentation of weight-bearing femorotibial cartilage at baseline and after one year, using coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regional and ordered values (OVs) of change were compared by baseline radiographic OA status.

- **Results**: Healthy knees displayed small changes in plates and subregions (± 0.7%; standardized response mean [SRM] ± 0.15), with OVs being symmetrically distributed close to zero. In calculated K/L grade 2 knees, the changes in cartilage thickness were small (< 1%; minimal SRM -0.22) and not significantly different from healthy knees. Knees with calculated K/L grade 3 showed substantial loss of cartilage thickness (up to -2.5%; minimal SRM -0.35), with OV1 changes being significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those in healthy knees. Calculated K/L grade 4 knees displayed the largest rate of loss across radiographic OA grades (up to -3.9%; minimal SRM -0.51), with OV1 changes also significantly (P < 0.05) greater than in healthy knees.

MRI-based cartilage thickness showed high rates of loss in knees with advanced stages of radiographic OA.

### Osteoarthritis year 2012 in review: Imaging [^116f4QqD]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

This article reviews original publications related to imaging in osteoarthritis (OA), published in English from September 2011 through March 2012. In vitro data and animal studies are not covered.

- **Methods**: An extensive PubMed database search was conducted using the terms "osteoarthritis" in combination with "MRI", "imaging", "radiography", "ultrasound", "computed tomography", and "nuclear medicine". Publications were sorted based on their potential impact on the OA research community, with the overall goal of providing a balanced overview of all aspects of imaging. The focus was on publications in high-impact, special-interest journals. The literature is presented by topics covering radiography, morphologic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compositional and high-field MRI, quantitative MRI, ultrasound, other joints, and systematic reviews. Original research presented as a podium or poster presentation at the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2012 is not included.

- **Results and conclusions**: For the search terms "MRI" and "osteoarthritis", there was a decrease of 38.1% in overall publications over the six months following September 2011 compared to the previous six months. A 56.9% decrease was noted for the terms "radiography" and "osteoarthritis". The six months since the last OARSI conference were characterized by several MRI-based studies focusing on epidemiologic and methodologic aspects of the disease. Other modalities, such as radiography or ultrasound, received much less attention.

### Harmonising data collection from osteoarthritis studies to enable stratification: Recommendations on core data collection from an Arthritis Research UK clinical studies group [^114FshhU]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

While the evidence has suggested a number of factors that are not associated with structural and/or symptomatic progression, this does not preclude their inclusion within a study. For example, while injury is known to be an important risk factor for the onset of osteoarthritis (OA), evidence suggests that there is no relationship between knee injury and structural progression. However, analyses of association with progression are limited by the use of multiple mechanisms of assessment, and standardization of individual tools or assessments used may reveal further elements associated with symptom or structural progression for inclusion.

Furthermore, the assessment of association of injury with OA progression did not consider factors such as measurement of ongoing joint instability or accurate subanalysis of the type of injury, which may mediate the effect of any such association.

Further measures that may be considered include patient-reported measures such as quality of life, serum and urine biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers, including ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although the latter were not examined within any of the reviews examined herein, with efforts to develop disease-modifying OA drugs, including agents targeted at specific OA pathologies such as synovitis and bone marrow lesions, such data may prove highly valuable in determining patient phenotypes for individual therapies.

Selection of additional components should remain at the discretion of the investigator and reflect appropriateness to the study in question as well as resource issues and patient burden.

### Lumbar spine radiographic features and demographic, clinical, and radiographic knee, hip, and hand osteoarthritis [^116A9qsF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of lumbar spine individual radiographic features (IRFs) such as disc space narrowing (DSN), osteophytes (OST), and facet joint osteoarthritis (FOA). The study also aimed to describe the frequencies of demographic, clinical, and radiographic knee, hip, and hand osteoarthritis (OA) across lumbar spine IRFs and identify factors associated with lumbar spine IRFs.

The methods employed involved a cross-sectional study of 840 participants enrolled in the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (2003–2004). Sample-based prevalence estimates were generated for each lumbar spine IRF, and the associations between lumbar spine IRFs and demographic, clinical, and peripheral joint OA were determined using logistic regression models.

The results showed that sample-based prevalence estimates were similar for DSN (57.6%) and FOA (57.9%) but higher for OST (88.1%), with significant differences across race and sex. Frequencies of hand and knee OA increased across IRFs, whereas this effect was absent for hip OA. African Americans exhibited lower odds of FOA (adjusted odds ratio [OR(adj)] 0.45 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.32–0.62]), while no racial association was found with DSN and OST. Low back symptoms were associated with DSN (OR(adj) 1.37 [95% CI 1.04–1.80]), but not with OST or FOA. Knee OA was associated with OST (OR(adj) 1.62 [95% CI 1.16–2.27]) and FOA (OR(adj) 1.69 [95% CI 1.15–2.49]), but not with DSN. Hand OA was associated with FOA (OR(adj) 1.67 [95% CI 1.20–2.28]), but not with DSN or OST. No associations were found with hip OA.

These findings underscore the importance of analyzing lumbar spine IRFs in relation to demographic and clinical characteristics to better understand their association with OA at different joint sites.

### ACR appropriateness criteria osteoporosis and bone mineral density [^111mHFqo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Osteoporosis poses a significant public health risk, with 50% of women and 20% of men over 50 years of age experiencing fractures, and a mortality rate of 20% within the first year. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary diagnostic method for screening women over 65 years of age and men over 70 years of age for osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women under 65 years of age with additional fracture risk factors, DXA is recommended.

Some patients with bone mineral density above the treatment threshold may qualify for treatment based on vertebral body fractures detected through a vertebral fracture assessment scan, a lateral spine equivalent generated from a commercial DXA machine. Quantitative CT is beneficial for patients with advanced degenerative bony changes in their spines. Emerging technologies such as the trabecular bone score offer a new role for qualitative bone assessment in clinical practice.

It is crucial for both radiologists and referring providers to consider osteoporosis in their patients to reduce the significant morbidity, mortality, and costs to the healthcare system. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria comprises evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to rate guidance.

### What you should know about osteoarthritis rehabilitation: A bibliometric analysis of the 50 most-cited articles [^1111SSzN]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that commonly occurs in middle-aged and elderly individuals and can cause joint pain, deformities, and dysfunction. Importantly, no effective treatment exists to prevent its progression. Although surgical interventions, such as arthroplasty, offer effective treatment for osteoarthritis, surgical risks and patient acceptance must be considered by clinical staff. Osteoarthritis management should be individualized, with clinicians identifying and managing risk factors to improve joint metabolism and biomechanical states, thereby relieving joint pain and delaying surgical interventions. Currently, rehabilitation is the primary strategy for slowing the progression of osteoarthritis, encompassing lifestyle adjustments, physiotherapy, family exercise, and other comprehensive rehabilitation treatments.

Bibliometrics involves the quantitative research and analysis of literature through statistical methods. It evaluates the impact of researchers, institutions, and countries on specific fields based on the number and frequency of citations of publications. Various published studies have significantly contributed to field development, as is evident from the most-cited papers. Highly cited papers provide important insights into understanding topics.

### What comes first? Multitissue involvement leading to radiographic osteoarthritis: Magnetic resonance imaging-based trajectory analysis over four years in the osteoarthritis initiative [^116t5hCV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

To assess whether the presence of structural osteoarthritis (OA) features over as many as four years prior to incident radiographic OA increases the risk of radiographic OA in a nested, case-control design, we studied 355 knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort that developed radiographic OA before the 48-month visit. They were matched one-to-one by sex, age, and contralateral knee radiographic status with a control knee.

Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were read for bone marrow lesions (BMLs), cartilage damage, meniscal damage (including tears and extrusion), Hoffa synovitis, and effusion synovitis. Conditional logistic regression was applied to assess the risk of radiographic OA with regard to the presence of BMLs (score ≥ 2), cartilage lesions (score ≥ 1.1), meniscal damage (any) and extrusion of ≥ 3 mm ± (score ≥ 2), and Hoffa and effusion synovitis (any). Time points were defined as incident radiographic OA visit (P0), one year prior to the detection of radiographic OA (P -1), two years prior to the detection of radiographic OA (P -2), etc.

The results indicated the presence of Hoffa synovitis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.18–2.64]), effusion synovitis (HR 1.81 [95% CI 1.18–2.78]), and medial meniscal damage (HR 1.83 [95% CI 1.17–2.89]) at P -2 predicted radiographic OA incidence. At P -1, all features but meniscal extrusion predicted radiographic OA, with the highest odds for medial BMLs (HR 6.50 [95% CI 2.27–18.62]) and effusion synovitis (HR 2.50 [95% CI 1.76–3.54]). The findings at P -3 and P -4 did not reach statistical significance.

### Proximal row carpectomy versus scaphoid excision and intercarpal arthrodesis: Intraoperative assessment and procedure selection [^112z8Lk7]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the relative frequency of degenerative changes in the radiolunate and capitolunate joints in osteoarthritis of the wrist as seen by direct visualization, and to highlight the disparity between findings on preoperative radiographs and direct visualization.

- **Methods**: We reviewed 18 consecutive patients who underwent either a proximal row carpectomy (PRC) or a scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis (SEFCA) for symptomatic degenerative arthritis of the wrist. In each case, the articular surfaces of the radiolunate and capitolunate joints were inspected intraoperatively. Based on the relative degree of degenerative changes, either a PRC or an SEFCA was performed. We compared preoperative radiographs and the predicted procedure based on them with intraoperative findings and the procedure actually performed.

- **Results**: Of 18 wrists, 15 had more severe degenerative changes on the proximal articular surface of the lunate than on the capitate head and underwent a PRC. The remaining 3 had more severe changes on the capitate head than on the proximal surface of the lunate and underwent an SEFCA. In contrast, preoperative radiographs in 13 of the 18 cases revealed degenerative changes at the capitolunate joint and minimal or no changes at the radiolunate joint. An SEFCA was the predicted procedure in all 13, but was performed in only 3. The remaining 10 underwent a PRC.

- **Conclusions**: Preoperative radiographs did not correlate well with intraoperative findings in the assessment of degenerative changes at the radiolunate and capitolunate joints.

### Osteoarthritis year 2010 in review: Imaging [^1119PiSL]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is no longer viewed as a passive, degenerative disorder, but rather as an active disease process driven primarily by mechanical factors. OA should also be conceptualized as a disease of a whole joint organ and, therefore, imaging of OA requires techniques that enable us to visualize the whole joint organ. Although clinical decision-making based on imaging findings remains controversial, the importance of imaging-derived data in OA research cannot be overemphasized.

Since mid-2009, numerous publications reporting on imaging-oriented studies on OA have been published. These include magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of numerous features of the whole joint, such as synovitis, subchondral bone, meniscus, cartilage, and cyst-like lesions. Active research is also ongoing using conventional radiography with a focus on measurements of joint space width and alignment of the knee joint. Ultrasound is emerging as a useful imaging technique, particularly in the field of hand OA research.

As the importance of imaging-derived data increases, all potential authors are advised that they should seek opinions from expert musculoskeletal radiologists to ascertain the application of correct imaging techniques, especially the MR pulse sequences and image interpretation. The peer-review process of OA imaging in any journal, therefore, should involve musculoskeletal radiologists experienced in OA research to ensure the publication of papers with scientifically sound contents.

### The relationship between clinical characteristics, radiographic osteoarthritis and 3D bone area: data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^1148EHJ9]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, radiographic measures derived from a single radiographic projection are only weakly associated with OA-attributable bone area measured in 3D. This may reflect the additional 3D MRI structural information unaccounted for by these 2D radiographic measures. We also confirmed the substantive allometric relationship of bone area with body size. Future analyses of bone area as a measure of structural progression should adjust for OA-attributable bone area.

### Structural correlates of pain in joints with osteoarthritis [^113KCvMV]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To describe the insights on the epidemiology of pain-structure association and the ramifications of these studies for clinical trials.

- **Design**: Narrative review summarizing the pertinent literature in this area, summarizing some of the methodological challenges inherent, and proposing some research initiatives to further understanding of this complex science.

- **Results**: The predominant symptom in most patients presenting with osteoarthritis (OA) is pain. Over recent years, a number of imaging-based studies have narrowed the discord between structural findings on imaging and symptoms. The interpretation of pain in OA is still enigmatic and difficult to deal with for both clinicians and scientists.

- **Conclusions**: We would envisage that over the next few years, many of the pressing questions pertaining to research into the structure-pain relationship will continue to be addressed. With this, we can expect clinically appropriate therapeutic advances.

### What is the utility of biomarkers for assessing the pathophysiology of hip osteoarthritis? A systematic review [^114wWLGP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Innovations in biologics offer great promise in the treatment of patients with orthopaedic conditions and in advancing our ability to monitor underlying disease pathophysiology. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of hip osteoarthritis (OA) has improved significantly in the last decade. Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and hip dysplasia are increasingly recognized and treated as forms of prearthritic hip disease; however, the inability of radiographic and MR imaging to identify patients before the onset of irreversible articular cartilage injury limits their use for early diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. Molecular biomarkers, as objectively measurable indicators of the pathophysiology of hip OA, have the potential to improve diagnosis, disease staging, and prognosis of hip OA and prearthritic hip disease. Although research into molecular biomarkers of hip OA has been conducted, investigations in prearthritic hip disease have only recently begun.

- **Questions/purposes**: The purpose of our review was to assess the use of molecular biomarkers in the pathophysiology of hip OA, including (1) diagnosis; (2) disease staging; and (3) prognosis. We additionally aimed to summarize the available literature investigating the use of biomarkers in (4) prearthritic hip disease, including FAI and hip dysplasia.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of molecular biomarkers associated with hip OA or prearthritic hip disease by searching four major electronic databases for the keywords "hip", "osteoarthritis", "biomarker", and all synonyms.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2018: Biomarkers (biochemical markers) [^115HC79Y]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of this narrative review is to summarize important findings from biochemical marker studies relevant to osteoarthritis (OA) in the context of new discoveries and clinical and scientific need.

We conducted a systematic search of electronic medical databases, including Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, between March 1, 2017, and March 31, 2018. The search was restricted to human studies, English language, and full-text available publications, while reviews were excluded. Only papers describing protein-based biomarkers measured in human body fluids (blood, urine, and synovial fluid) were included. Of the 992 papers, 86 were reviewed here, with inclusion primarily based on relevance to OA biochemical markers.

This review highlights a selection of studies based on their quality and perceived importance to the field. These studies mainly include those that evaluate the prognostic value of biomarkers for OA progression (i.e. biomarkers reflecting change in the composition of joint tissues and biomarkers of inflammation), help in the assessment of intervention efficacy, and are innovative and uncover new candidate biomarkers or use new approaches in biomarker discovery.

Key findings and implications for possible clinical utility of biochemical markers are summarized and discussed. Given the paucity of robust biomarkers within the field and the heterogeneity of the condition, enormous work is needed for the development and validation of novel and clinically applicable biomarkers to reduce the impact of this highly prevalent and debilitating condition.

### Imaging of the disease process [^117U7hwJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Until recently, imaging evaluation of osteoarthritis (OA) has relied primarily on conventional radiography. However, using radiography in clinical practice or clinical research has been fraught with difficulty. Techniques for reproducibly acquiring serial radiographs of joints have improved considerably over the past several years. The greatest promise for advancing knowledge about OA and its treatment lies in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its unique ability to examine the joint as a whole organ. In contrast to conventional radiography, MRI can directly visualize the articular cartilage, synovium, menisci, and other intra-articular structures important to the functional integrity of joints.

There have been considerable advances in MRI of articular cartilage in particular over the past several years. However, much of this has come from small cross-sectional studies, and published longitudinal studies remain quite scant. The following discussion reviews the status of imaging in OA and points to where changes might be anticipated in the future.

### Non-invasive imaging of cartilage in early osteoarthritis [^116ykYTH]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) has traditionally focused on joint replacement for end-stage disease. An increasing number of surgical and pharmaceutical strategies for disease prevention have now been proposed. However, these require the ability to identify OA at a stage when it is potentially reversible and to detect small changes in cartilage structure and function to evaluate treatment efficacy within an acceptable timeframe. This has not been possible using conventional imaging techniques, but recent advances in musculoskeletal imaging have been significant.

In this review, we discuss the role of different imaging modalities in diagnosing the earliest changes of OA. The increasing number of MRI sequences that are able to non-invasively detect biochemical changes in cartilage that precede structural damage may offer a great advance in diagnosing and treating this debilitating condition.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management [^1152ewor]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

While osteoarthritis (OA) is predominantly diagnosed based on clinical criteria, imaging may aid in differential diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. Plain radiographs are traditionally the first choice of imaging modality. However, MRI and ultrasound (US) also play a valuable role in assessing multiple pathological features of OA, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages.

Modern imaging modalities provide the capability to detect a wide range of osseous and soft tissue OA-related structural damage, including cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, and effusion. However, this additional information has not yet positively influenced the clinical decision-making and management process. Imaging is recommended if there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes to determine whether they relate to disease severity or an additional diagnosis.

In the development of specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities in aiding OA diagnosis, disease progression, and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in finding targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

### Sexual dimorphism in articular tissue anatomy - key to understanding sex differences in osteoarthritis [^112obdbh]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2024). High credibility.

The prevalence and incidence of osteoarthritis (OA) vary between women and men. It remains unclear whether these differences are due to sex-specific systemic factors, such as hormones, or differences in pre-morbid joint anatomy. While recognizing that classifications of sex cannot be reduced to female/male, this review focuses on the sexual dimorphism of articular morphotypes due to the lack of literature on non-binary individuals.

- **Methods**: The study included a PubMed search using relevant terms and gathered input from experts to select articles based on relevance, interest, originality, and scientific quality; no strict bibliometric measures were used. The focus was on clinical studies, primarily with imaging data available for the knee joint.

- **Results**: The review of specific literature on articular morphotypes covers: radiographic joint space width (JSW), meniscus, ligaments, articular cartilage morphology, articular cartilage composition and deformation, and articular tissue response to treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Clear sex-specific differences were observed in JSW, meniscus damage, ligament size, and cartilage morphometry, including volume, thickness, and surface areas, though not in cartilage composition. Measures of ligaments and cartilage were found to be smaller in women even after accounting for confounding factors. These findings suggest that female knee joints may be structurally more vulnerable and at greater risk of OA.

### Population trends in the incidence and initial management of osteoarthritis: Age-period-cohort analysis of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 1992–2013 [^1118Ayku]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Several algorithms have been used in previous studies, predominantly from Canada and the United States, to define OA cases in electronic health record and administrative databases. In line with a Swedish report, we chose case definitions requiring a single record of a relevant code within the primary care electronic health record within a calendar year of interest. Less restrictive definitions such as these have been used in previous studies of OA incidence in Canada, the Netherlands, and Spain, and of OA consultation prevalence in UK primary care and have generally higher sensitivity but lower specificity than more restrictive algorithms requiring multiple records.

Using established Read code lists, we defined cases of OA in two ways:

- **Maximizing sensitivity**: To capture the greatest number of new consulting cases of OA, cases were defined as having either at least one consultation with a recorded diagnosis of OA or, in adults aged over 45 years, at least one consultation with a recorded peripheral joint pain symptom code affecting the knee, hip, and hand/wrist likely to reflect OA (clinical OA).

- **Narrower definition**: Cases of OA were defined more tightly as having at least one consultation with a recorded diagnosis of OA (OA). We excluded cases with a record of a systemic inflammatory disease, spondyloarthropathy, or crystal disease in the previous 3 years or the following 1 year, or a record of another specific non-OA diagnosis (soft-tissue disorders, other bone/cartilage diseases) at the same joint in the 6 months prior.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^1166Xc5x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion was characterized in two single-dose trials, one involving subjects with alcoholic liver disease and another with subjects having mild-to-severe cirrhosis.

The first trial demonstrated that the half-life of hydroxybupropion was significantly longer in eight subjects with alcoholic liver disease compared to eight healthy volunteers (32 ± 14 hours versus 21 ± 5 hours, respectively). Although not statistically significant, the area under the curve (AUCs) for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be greater (by 53% to 57%) in volunteers with alcoholic liver disease. The differences in half-life for bupropion and the other metabolites in the two groups were minimal.

The second trial demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites in nine subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis compared with eight healthy volunteers. However, more variability was observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters for bupropion (AUC, Cmax, and Tmax) and its active metabolites (t½) in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis. In subjects with severe hepatic cirrhosis, significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites were identified.

### Enbrel [^116EtvYa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA study. Radiographs of hands and wrists were obtained at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 24. A modified Total Sharp Score (TSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the modified TSS used for RA), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Some radiographic features specific to PsA (e.g. pencil-and-cup deformity, joint space widening, gross osteolysis, and ankylosis) were included in the scoring system, while others (e.g. phalangeal tuft resorption, juxta-articular and shaft periostitis) were not.

Most patients showed little or no change in the modified TSS during this 24-month study, with a median change of 0 in both patients who initially received Enbrel or placebo. More placebo-treated patients experienced larger magnitudes of radiographic worsening (increased TSS) compared to those receiving Enbrel during the controlled period of the study. At 12 months, in an exploratory analysis, 12% (12 of 104) of placebo patients, compared to none of the 101 Enbrel-treated patients, had increases of 3 points or more in TSS. Inhibition of radiographic progression was maintained in patients who continued on Enbrel during the second year. Of the patients with 1-year and 2-year x-rays, 3% (2 of 71) had increases of 3 points or more in TSS at both 1 and 2 years.

- **Physical function response**: In the PsA study, physical function and disability were assessed using the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. Patients treated with 25 mg of Enbrel twice weekly showed

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2019: Imaging [^115twJNk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Low credibility.

To provide a narrative review of original articles on osteoarthritis (OA) imaging published between April 1, 2018, and March 30, 2019, all original research articles on OA imaging published in English during this period were identified using a PubMed database search. The search terms included "osteoarthritis" or "OA" in combination with:

- **Radiography and x-rays**: "radiography", "x-rays"
- **Magnetic resonance imaging**: "magnetic resonance imaging", "MRI"
- **Ultrasound**: "ultrasound", "US"
- **Computed tomography and related technologies**: "computed tomography", "CT", "dual energy x-ray absorptiometry", "DXA", "DEXA"
- **Nuclear medicine and scans**: "nuclear medicine", "scintigraphy"
- **Tomography techniques**: "single-photon emission computed tomography", "SPECT", "positron emission tomography", "PET", "PET-CT", "PET-MRI"

Articles were reviewed to determine relevance based on two main criteria: the study involved human subjects with OA or risk factors for OA, and the study involved imaging to evaluate OA disease status or OA treatment response. Relevant articles were ranked according to scientific merit, with the best publications selected for inclusion in the narrative report.

The PubMed search revealed a total of 1,257 articles, of which 256 (20.4%) were considered relevant to OA imaging. Among these, 226 (87.1%) articles involved the knee joint, while 195 (76.2%) articles involved the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The proportion of published studies involving MRI was higher than in previous years. Additionally, an increasing number of articles focused on imaging subjects with joint injury and on the application of deep learning in OA imaging.

### What are the prognostic factors for radiographic progression of knee osteoarthritis? A meta-analysis [^116oTgGD]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

The review by Belo et al. included a literature search performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE for all available observational studies up to December 2003. We extended this search in MEDLINE and EMBASE from December 2003 to February 2013. The keywords used were: knee, osteoarthritis (or arthritis, or arthrosis, or degenerative joint disease), progression (or prognosis, or precipitate, or predictive), and case-control (or cohort, or longitudinal, or follow-up).

Articles were reviewed for inclusion independently by two authors. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 85% or more of participants in the analyses for osteoarthritis (OA) progression had radiographic evidence of knee OA at baseline; the study investigated determinants associated with radiographic knee OA progression; radiographic progression was the outcome measure; the study had a case-control or cohort design with a minimum 1-year follow-up; the full text of the article was available; the study was in English, Dutch, German, or French.

Studies observing the incidence of knee OA were excluded. A detailed description of our search strategy is available online. All articles were reviewed for inclusion independently by two authors. Studies that used MRI features to define OA progression were excluded, although studies determining MRI features as prognostic factors were included.

- **Methodologic quality**: The same methodologic quality assessment criteria as in the original research were applied.

### Finger joint pain in relation to radiographic osteoarthritis and joint location — a study of middle-aged female dentists and teachers [^111ZufZm]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of radiographic finger joint osteoarthritis (ROA), hand laterality (right/left), and anatomical location within the hand with finger joint pain.

Radiographs of both hands from 295 female dentists and 248 female teachers were examined for the presence of osteoarthritis in each finger joint, using grades: 0 = no OA, 1 = doubtful OA, 2 = mild OA, 3 = moderate OA, 4 = severe OA. Information on the occurrence of pain in each finger joint during the past 30 days and hand laterality was obtained by questionnaire.

Compared with subjects with no ROA, the prevalence ratio (PR) of finger joint pain was 1.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61–2.34] among those with mild ROA and 5.34 (4.51–6.54) among those with at least moderate ROA, based on a multivariate log-binomial regression model. Pain was slightly more common in the right hand than in the left hand (1.27; 1.15–1.40). Compared with the little finger, more pain occurred in the thumb (2.67; 2.25–3.16), the index finger (1.76; 1.50–2.07), and the middle finger (1.47; 1.24–1.74). Furthermore, pain was more common in the proximal interphalangeal (1.77; 1.56–2.00) and distal interphalangeal (1.51; 1.29–1.76) joints than in the metacarpophalangeal joints. The strength of the association between ROA and finger joint pain increased with the severity of pain.

Our findings suggest that ROA, anatomic localization within the hand, and hand laterality have independent effects on finger joint pain.

### Is a "false-positive" clinical diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis just the early diagnosis of pre-radiographic disease [^111rX63p]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

In routine practice, the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis (OA) relies on the combination of conventional risk factors and the presence of cardinal signs and symptoms. However, their role in early diagnosis has received little attention compared with biomarker research.

- **Methods**: Using data from 122 adults aged ≥ 50 years with knee pain but no definite radiographic OA, we tested whether the clinical diagnostic probability of OA, based on risk factors, signs, and symptoms, was associated with the subsequent incidence of radiographic OA three years later.

- **Results**: The clinical diagnostic probability performed only modestly in discriminating incident radiographic knee OA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.49–0.70).

- **Conclusion**: Improving the measurement of conventional markers and using study designs that test the ability of new biomarkers to add to or replace conventional markers are priorities for research in the early diagnosis of OA.

### Systematic review of the concurrent and predictive validity of MRI biomarkers in OA [^112qnxaK]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

To summarize literature on the concurrent and predictive validity of MRI-based measures of osteoarthritis (OA) structural change, an online literature search was conducted using the OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Cochrane databases for articles published up to April 2009. A total of 1,338 abstracts were initially screened for relevance by two reviewers. From these, 243 articles were selected for data extraction for this analysis on validity, as well as for separate reviews on discriminant validity and diagnostic performance. Among these, 142 manuscripts contained data relevant to concurrent validity, and 61 manuscripts were used for the predictive validity review. Data on criterion (concurrent and predictive) validity were extracted from both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies for all synovial joint tissues in relation to MRI measurement in OA.

- **Concurrent validity**: The concurrent validity of MRI in OA has been examined in comparison to symptoms, radiography, histology/pathology, arthroscopy, CT, and alignment. The relationship of bone marrow lesions, synovitis, and effusion to pain was moderate to strong. However, there was a weak or no relationship of cartilage morphology or meniscal tears to pain. The relationship between cartilage morphology and radiographic OA, as well as radiographic joint space, was inconsistent. A higher frequency of meniscal tears, synovitis, and other features was observed in individuals with radiographic OA. The relation of cartilage to other constructs, including histology and arthroscopy, was stronger.

- **Predictive validity**: The predictive validity of MRI in OA has been examined; however, the sentence appears to be truncated and cannot be completed accurately.

### Lost bones: Differential diagnosis of acro-osteolysis seen by the pediatric rheumatologist [^114MrapZ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Acro-osteolysis is a radiographic finding which refers to bone resorption of the distal phalanges. It is associated with various conditions, and its presence should prompt the clinician to search for the underlying etiology. The aim of this review is to discuss disorders with which acro-osteolysis is associated and their distinguishing features, with a focus on the pediatric population.

- **Methods**: A targeted literature review was performed using the term "acro-osteolysis" in combination with other key terms. The primary search results were supplemented using reference citations. Articles published prior to the year 2000 were included if they described additional associations not encountered in the more recent literature.

- **Results**: Genetic disorders, particularly primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and skeletal dysplasias, and rheumatic diseases, particularly psoriatic arthritis and systemic sclerosis, are the most frequently encountered conditions associated with acro-osteolysis in children. Hyperparathyroidism, neuropathy, local trauma and thermal injury, and spinal dysraphism should also be included in the differential diagnosis.

- **Conclusion**: Although acro-osteolysis is uncommon, its presence should prompt the clinician to consider a differential diagnosis based on clinical and radiographic features.

### Beleodaq [^111eD9D9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Belinostat's pharmacokinetics in specific populations show varied effects based on hepatic and renal impairment:

- **Hepatic impairment**: Belinostat steady state clearance decreased and AUC increased relative to liver dysfunction severity. Cmax, half-life, and apparent volume of distribution remained unchanged. Mean belinostat clearance saw an 18% reduction in mild impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 x ULN), a 24% reduction in moderate impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST value), and a 33% reduction in severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST value). Increased belinostat exposure correlated with worsening liver function, but no clear relationship was observed between exposure and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first therapy cycle.

- **Renal impairment**: In patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to < 90 ml/min), belinostat Cmax increased by 1.7-fold, AUC0-∞ by 1.3-fold, while CLtot remained unchanged. In moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 < 60 ml/min), both Cmax and AUC0-∞ rose by 1.7-fold, and CLtot decreased by 26%. The impact of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) on belinostat pharmacokinetics is currently unknown.

- **Drug interaction studies**:
	- **UGT1A1 inhibitors**: Co-administration with atazanavir (a UGT1A1 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of belinostat t1/2 by 1.5-fold, AUC0-inf by 1.4-fold, and a decrease of Cmax by 33%, with renal excretion increasing 2.5-fold. There was minimal change in steady state clearance. There was also minimal change observed in belinostat glucuronide Cmax and AUC0–24, but a 48% decrease in belinostat glucuronide excretion.

### Facet joint syndrome: From diagnosis to interventional management [^115zFmDT]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Two classifications of facet joint (FJ) degeneration are recommended for clinical use. Radiographically, Pathria's classification categorizes FJ arthropathy as follows:

- **Grade 1**: Facets with joint space narrowing.
- **Grade 2**: Facets with narrowing plus sclerosis or hypertrophy.
- **Grade 3**: Facets with severe degenerative disease, including narrowing, sclerosis, and osteophytes.

Standard radiographs (Meyerding or Taillard classification) are also used to evaluate motion-related abnormalities in flexion or extension. They assess instability in cases of spondylolisthesis through dynamic studies. In the setting of degenerative spondylolisthesis, a weight-bearing lateral flexion-extension radiograph is most effective for grading and may be needed in addition to MRI and CT imaging. Anteroposterior translation of more than a few millimeters is indicative of lumbar spine instability in the sagittal plane, potentially requiring surgical arthrodesis in the appropriate clinical setting.

In addition to Pathria's classification, Weishaupt's grading scheme, based on the agreement between MRI and CT imaging, has been proposed. Facets are graded from 0 to 3 depending on the degree of joint space narrowing, hypertrophy, sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. The authors recommend against the routine use of CT imaging if an adequate MRI scan is available. Fujiwara et al. is credited with developing the standard MRI-based classification system for lumbar FJ osteoarthritis.

### Colchicine twice a day for hand osteoarthritis (COLOR): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^1121kUcy]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The study, COLOR (hand osteoarthritis), was published by Anna Døssing and colleagues in 2023 in The Lancet Rheumatology. This study focuses on hand osteoarthritis. The trial investigated the role of colchicine in adults with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis. It was a single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 100 patients, including 69 females and 31 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis and finger pain of at least 40 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS).

- **Exclusion criteria**: Other known medical diseases affecting joints, known cutaneous deposition diseases, known blood dyscrasias and coagulation disorders, and known malignancies.

- **Interventions**
- **Colchicine group**: 50 patients received an oral dose of 0.5 mg of colchicine twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks.
- **Placebo group**: 50 patients received a matching placebo tablet BID for 12 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in the reduction of finger pain at week 12 (13.9 mm vs. 13.5 mm; absolute difference 0.4 mm, 95% confidence interval -6.7 to 7.6).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events was observed.

In conclusion, in adult patients with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis and finger pain of at least 40 mm on a 100 mm VAS, colchicine was not superior to placebo in reducing finger pain.

### Remicade [^111W9yQr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Radiographic response - Structural damage in both hands and feet was assessed radiographically by the change from baseline in the van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score, modified by the addition of hand DIP joints. The total modified vdH-S score is a composite measure of structural damage that evaluates the number and size of joint erosions and the degree of joint space narrowing (JSN) in the hands and feet. By Week 24, Remicade-treated patients showed less radiographic progression than those receiving a placebo, with a mean change of -0.70 versus 0.82 [P < 0.001]. Erosion scores and JSN scores were also lower in the Remicade group, with changes of -0.56 versus 0.51 and -0.14 versus 0.31, respectively. The Remicade group exhibited continued inhibition of structural damage at Week 54, with most patients showing little or no change in the vdH-S score over the 12-month study period (median change of 0 for both Remicade and placebo recipients). Notably, 12% of the placebo group experienced clear radiographic progression compared to just 3% in the Remicade group.

Physical function - Physical function was assessed using the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. Remicade-treated patients exhibited significant improvements in physical function, as indicated by a median percent improvement in HAQ-DI score from baseline to Weeks 14 and 24 of 43%, compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients. During the 24-week placebo-controlled phase of the trial, 54% of Remicade-treated patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2016: Imaging [^1151wnAq]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2017). Low credibility.

The narrative review covers original research related to imaging in osteoarthritis (OA) in humans, published in English between April 1st, 2015, and March 31st, 2016, in peer-reviewed journals available in Medline via PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).

- **Methods**: Relevant studies in humans, subjectively decided by the authors, contributing significantly to the OA imaging field, were selected from an extensive Medline search using the terms "Osteoarthritis" in combination with "MRI", "Imaging", "Radiography", "X-rays", "Ultrasound", "Computed tomography", "Nuclear medicine", "PET-CT", "PET-MRI", "Scintigraphy", and "SPECT". Publications were sorted according to their relevance to the OA imaging research community, with an emphasis on high-impact special interest journals using the software for systematic reviews (www.covidence.org).

- **Results**: An overview of newly published studies, compared to studies reported in previous years, is presented, followed by a review of selected imaging studies of primarily knee, hip, and hand OA, focusing on (1) results for detection of OA and OA-related pathology, (2) studies dealing with treatments, and (3) studies focusing on the prognosis of disease progression or joint replacement. A record high number of 1420 articles were published, featuring new technologies and tools for improved morphological and pathophysiological understanding of OA-related changes in joints. Also, imaging data were presented for monitoring treatment effect and prognosis of OA progression, primarily using established radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.

### Camurati-Engelmann disease: unique variant featuring a novel mutation in TGFβ1 encoding transforming growth factor beta 1 and a missense change in TNFSF11 encoding RANK ligand [^115rEe46]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Radiographic skeletal survey of the mother in 2007 showed findings that were in all ways similar to the son's but generally less severe. The overall pattern of osteosclerosis and bone expansion was present, although with better tubulation of the long bones, less prominent trabecular thickening, and less significant vertebral body change. The skull was unremarkable, with no osteosclerosis and a normal medullary space. The short tubular bones of the feet were involved, but there was less immature periostitis over the long tubular bones, although the mature periosteal reaction was again seen to extend to the epiphysis. Like the son, the mother had changes of moderate, bilateral hip osteoarthritis and early lumbar degenerative disk disease. There was mild sacroiliac joint osteoarthritis but no indication of spondyloarthritis. MRI of the lumbar spine from 2004 did not clarify the bone abnormality but documented normal marrow, with no indication of a marrow infiltrative disease.

### Osteoarthritis: an update with relevance for clinical practice [^111P7sF8]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis is rising because of the aging population and the epidemic of obesity. Pain and loss of function are the main clinical features that lead to treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches. Clinicians recognize that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is established late in the disease process, maybe too late to expect much help from disease-modifying drugs. Despite efforts over the past decades to develop markers of disease, imaging procedures and biochemical marker analyses need to be improved and possibly extended with more specific and sensitive methods to reliably describe disease processes, to diagnose the disease at an early stage, to classify patients according to their prognosis, and to follow the course of disease and treatment effectiveness. In the coming years, a better definition of osteoarthritis is expected by delineating different phenotypes of the disease. Treatment targeted more specifically at these phenotypes might lead to improved outcomes.

### The role of radiography in diagnosing, monitoring and prognosing juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^116nVkzo]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The role of conventional radiography in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is reviewed. Its importance has shifted due to the increasing use of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and the introduction of biological drugs. Conventional radiography is not pivotal in diagnosing JIA; diagnosis largely relies on history, clinical examination, and laboratory findings. However, its main role lies in detecting and monitoring growth disorders, chronic structural and morphological changes of the affected joints and bones, and aiding in the differential diagnosis of conditions that mimic JIA.

Radiographic changes in the joints are influenced by the child's age, arthritis type and duration, and specific joints affected. There are no standard protocols for arthritis monitoring; most imaging indications are determined on a case-by-case basis. The presence of degenerative joint changes is considered to be a poor prognostic factor, yet studies precisely defining the predictive value of radiographic changes are lacking. Despite these limitations, conventional radiography remains an important imaging modality for narrowing differential diagnoses and evaluating growth disorders and the progression of destructive joint changes.

### Raloxifene hydrochloride [^116xpzWL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the reduction in the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing this condition [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The effect on the reduction in the incidence of breast cancer was demonstrated in a study involving postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer, with a planned duration of five years and a median follow-up of 4.3 years [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Notably, 27% of the participants received the drug for the full five years. The long-term effects and the recommended length of treatment remain unknown.

High risk of breast cancer is characterized by at least one breast biopsy indicating lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia, one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, or a five-year predicted risk of breast cancer ≥ 1.66% based on the modified Gail model. Factors included in the modified Gail model are as follows: age, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, age at menarche, nulliparity, or age at first live birth. Healthcare professionals can acquire a Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool by contacting 1–800–545–5979. It is important to note that no single clinical finding or test result can quantify the risk of breast cancer with certainty.

An individual assessment of the benefits and risks should inform the decision regarding therapy with raloxifene hydrochloride tablets after evaluating the risk of developing breast cancer.

### Lost bones: Differential diagnosis of acro-osteolysis seen by the pediatric rheumatologist [^11631idD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Acro-osteolysis is a radiographic finding which refers to bone resorption of the distal phalanges. It is associated with various conditions, and its presence should prompt the clinician to search for the underlying etiology. This review aims to discuss disorders with which acro-osteolysis is associated and their distinguishing features, focusing on the pediatric population.

- **Methods**: A targeted literature review was performed using the term "acro-osteolysis" in combination with other key terms. The primary search results were supplemented using reference citations. Articles published prior to the year 2000 were included if they described additional associations not encountered in the more recent literature.

- **Results**: Genetic disorders (particularly primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and skeletal dysplasias) and rheumatic diseases (particularly psoriatic arthritis and systemic sclerosis) are the most frequently encountered conditions associated with acro-osteolysis in children. Hyperparathyroidism, neuropathy, local trauma and thermal injury, and spinal dysraphism should also be included in the differential diagnosis.

- **Conclusion**: Although acro-osteolysis is uncommon, its presence should prompt the clinician to consider a differential diagnosis based on clinical and radiographic features.

### Ethnic disparities in clozapine prescription for service-users with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: A systematic review [^1132drR1]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The search strategy was developed by initially conducting a scoping search of articles related to ethnic disparities in clozapine prescription. Titles and abstracts of these articles were reviewed to generate keywords related to two primary concepts: 'clozapine' and 'ethnicity'. Synonyms associated with these concepts were further researched and generated.

To capture culturally sensitive language used to describe ethnic groups across various countries, ethnicity-related keywords were developed by researching government-recognized ethnicity terminology from official government websites across five countries: Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics), Canada (Statistics Canada), New Zealand (Statistics New Zealand), the UK (UK Government), and the United States (United States Census Bureau).

Both clozapine and ethnicity-related keywords were employed to build a universal free-text search using Boolean operators and truncators across all databases. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) searches were performed in each database alongside the free-text search to capture relevant terminology not already included in the free-text search (full search strategy available in online supplementary material).

The following six electronic databases were searched: CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Embase, APA PsycINFO, and Open Grey. Searches for each database were executed on 13 December 2020. Additionally, the reference lists of included studies were examined for further eligible studies. No time-period or language filters were applied during database searching.

Ethnicity is a multi-faceted social construct.

### Unexplained fractures: Child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^11148DSN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched the Medline and EMBASE computerized literature databases from January 1950 to June 2009. Articles were identified using an electronic search of keyword terms and their respective combinations. The search was guided by our institution's research librarian on August 22, 2009. A total of 104 unique references were identified with this search. Reference lists from the articles retrieved were further scrutinized as well to identify any additional studies of interest. All studies from the mentioned searches were then reviewed.

Studies were included in this systematic review if they matched the following criteria: (1) they were in English; (2) they had a Level I, II, III, or IV study design by "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery" criteria; (3) they involved a minimum of 10 patients with bony injury; (4) both patients with child abuse or a condition that results in a bone disease with a propensity for fracture with minimal trauma were present in the study or patients were included who were diagnosed with child abuse that subsequent investigation revealed to be bone disease; and (5) the patients were younger than 18 years old, or older patients could not be distinguished from younger ones in the body of the text or tables. We excluded review articles, case reports, or studies where the inclusion criteria were not explicit.

Two authors performed the initial search, and then three authors independently reviewed the 104 references and selected the appropriate studies based on these criteria.
