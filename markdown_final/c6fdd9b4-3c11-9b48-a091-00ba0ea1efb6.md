## Question

if someone has three second degree relatives with a history of colon cancer, should they get a colonoscopy as well for screening purposes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether someone with three second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer should undergo colonoscopy screening and, if so, how to structure the timing and interval. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how major guidelines classify risk when only second-degree relatives are affected. Then, I should verify whether the number of second-degree relatives changes the recommendation. Next, I will consider any nuances or exceptions that might apply. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation with age and interval guidance and note any caveats about documentation and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the risk category. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2021 guideline explicitly states that individuals with one or more second-degree relatives with CRC should be screened according to average-risk recommendations, not high-risk protocols, which means no early colonoscopy solely on the basis of second-degree relatives [^e1e6c277] [^d8308908]. The Canadian Banff consensus similarly recommends average-risk screening for those with only second-degree relatives affected, again emphasizing that this does not meet thresholds for intensified colonoscopy-based surveillance [^bba3a7aa].

> Wait, let me verify whether the number of second-degree relatives changes this. I initially wondered if three second-degree relatives might cumulatively approximate first-degree risk, but hold on, I should verify that against the guidelines. The ACG does not provide a quantitative escalation for multiple second-degree relatives; it treats any number of second-degree relatives without first-degree involvement as average risk, so three second-degree relatives still do not convert the patient to high-risk status or mandate earlier colonoscopy [^e1e6c277] [^d8308908]. Observational data show that second-degree relatives have a modestly increased relative risk compared with the general population, but this elevation is not sufficient to trigger intensified colonoscopy screening in the absence of first-degree relatives or hereditary syndromes [^794a717e] [^44e7bd76].

> I need to check the practical screening approach. For average-risk adults, current recommendations are to initiate screening at age 45–50 with colonoscopy every 10 years or an equivalent noninvasive test, with the exact modality and interval tailored to patient preference and local practice patterns. Importantly, this applies even when multiple second-degree relatives are affected, absent other high-risk features [^21493198] [^acc44f11]. I should confirm that this aligns with NCCN and USPSTF positions, which also anchor risk stratification to first-degree relatives and hereditary syndromes rather than second-degree counts alone [^acc44f11] [^21493198].

> But wait, what if there are red flags for hereditary syndromes or early-onset disease in the family tree? I should double-check for features that would prompt genetic evaluation and intensified screening, such as multiple relatives across generations, early ages at diagnosis, or extracolonic Lynch-associated cancers. In those scenarios, referral for genetic counseling and syndrome-specific surveillance may be warranted even when the index case lacks a first-degree affected relative, so I need to ensure a careful pedigree review before concluding average risk [^73d40558] [^376fbc90] [^8e87eedd].

> Next, I should review documentation and counseling. I need to ensure we capture who exactly is affected, ages at diagnosis, and any known polyp details, because misclassification of relatives or missing pathology can lead to inappropriate screening intensity. Poor recall of polyp details is common and can undermine risk-based recommendations, so clarifying family history is essential before finalizing the plan [^e5be023c] [^376fbc90].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. With three second-degree relatives with CRC and no first-degree relatives or hereditary syndrome features, the patient is considered average risk and should start routine CRC screening at age 45–50 using colonoscopy every 10 years or an equivalent noninvasive option, with no indication for earlier colonoscopy solely on the basis of second-degree relatives. If any first-degree relatives are affected or if there are features suggestive of a hereditary syndrome, then intensified colonoscopy starting earlier would be appropriate [^e1e6c277] [^21493198] [^0b00cef9].

---

For someone with three second-degree relatives with colon cancer, **colonoscopy is not automatically indicated** for screening. Current guidelines classify this as **average risk** because second-degree relatives confer only a modest increase in risk [^e1e6c277] [^44e7bd76]. Routine screening should begin at age 45–50 with colonoscopy every 10 years, or with stool-based tests as acceptable alternatives [^21493198] [^3eac615a]. Colonoscopy is only intensified if there are additional risk factors, such as a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma, or if there is a concerning family pattern suggesting a hereditary syndrome [^e1e6c277] [^73d40558]. If the family history is unclear or there are red flags, consider genetic counseling, but three second-degree relatives alone do not mandate earlier or more frequent colonoscopy [^376fbc90].

---

## Risk assessment based on family history

Family history is a **key risk factor** for colorectal cancer (CRC), with risk rising as the number of affected relatives and their closeness increase [^ed2800ff]. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) confer the highest risk, whereas second-degree relatives (grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews) confer a smaller increase [^44e7bd76].

- **First-degree relatives (FDRs)**: 1 FDR with CRC increases risk ~1.7–2.3-fold; ≥ 2 FDRs or 1 FDR diagnosed < 60 years confers higher risk and warrants earlier, more frequent colonoscopy [^ed2800ff] [^e1e6c277].
- **Second-degree relatives (SDRs)**: 1 or more SDRs with CRC confers a modest risk increase (~1.3–1.5-fold), insufficient to mandate intensified screening on its own [^794a717e] [^44e7bd76].

Thus, **three SDRs with CRC alone do not meet criteria** for high-risk screening.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Major societies provide clear guidance on screening by family history:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for sdrs with crc** |
|-|-|
| ACG 2021 | Screen as average risk; no earlier or more frequent colonoscopy solely for SDRs [^e1e6c277] [^d8308908] |
| USPSTF 2021 | Average-risk screening starting at 45–50; SDRs do not change this [^21493198] |
| NCCN 2024 | SDRs alone do not warrant intensified screening; use average-risk protocols [^acc44f11] |

---

## Recommended screening strategy

Given three SDRs with CRC and no other risk factors, **follow average-risk screening**:

- **Start at age 45–50**: Begin screening at 45 or 50, depending on the guideline and patient preference [^21493198] [^013dc9fa].
- **Colonoscopy every 10 years**: Preferred modality; if declined, stool-based tests (FIT, sDNA-FIT) are acceptable alternatives [^21493198] [^013dc9fa].
- **No earlier initiation**: Do not start before 45 solely due to SDRs [^e1e6c277].

---

## Circumstances warranting intensified screening

Intensified screening is appropriate when **additional risk factors** are present:

- **First-degree relative**: 1 FDR with CRC or advanced adenoma, especially if diagnosed < 60 years, or ≥ 2 FDRs at any age [^e1e6c277] [^40f1a56a].
- **Hereditary syndromes**: Suspected or confirmed Lynch syndrome, FAP, or other hereditary CRC syndromes [^73d40558] [^6d1fc039].
- **Concerning family pattern**: Multiple relatives across generations or early-onset CRC suggesting familial CRC syndrome X [^0f7edddb].

In these scenarios, **start colonoscopy at 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative**, and shorten intervals to every 3–5 years based on findings and family pattern [^e1e6c277] [^40f1a56a].

---

## Role of genetic counseling

If the family pattern is concerning for a hereditary syndrome — such as multiple relatives with CRC, early-onset cases, or extracolonic cancers — **consider genetic counseling** and possible testing [^376fbc90]. However, three SDRs alone, without other red flags, **do not meet criteria** for routine genetic evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Three second-degree relatives with colon cancer **do not mandate intensified colonoscopy screening**. The patient should follow average-risk screening: start at 45–50 with colonoscopy every 10 years, or with stool-based tests if preferred. Intensify only if additional risk factors are present or if genetic counseling suggests a hereditary syndrome.

### Clinical practice guideline on screening for colorectal cancer in individuals with a family history of nonhereditary colorectal cancer or adenoma: the Canadian association of gastroenterology Banff consensus [^bba3a7aa]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

A family history (FH) of colorectal cancer (CRC) increases the risk of developing CRC. These consensus recommendations developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association, aim to provide guidance on screening these high-risk individuals.

Methods

Multiple parallel systematic review streams, informed by 10 literature searches, assembled evidence on 5 principal questions around the effect of an FH of CRC or adenomas on the risk of CRC, the age to initiate screening, and the optimal tests and testing intervals. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to develop the recommendations.

Results

Based on the evidence, the Consensus Group was able to strongly recommend CRC screening for all individuals with an FH of CRC or documented adenoma. However, because most of the evidence was very-low quality, the majority of the remaining statements were conditional ("we suggest"). Colonoscopy is suggested (recommended in individuals with ≥ 2 first-degree relatives [FDRs]), with fecal immunochemical test as an alternative. The elevated risk associated with an FH of ≥ 1 FDRs with CRC or documented advanced adenoma suggests initiating screening at a younger age (eg, 40–50 years or 10 years younger than age of diagnosis of FDR). In addition, a shorter interval of every 5 years between screening tests was suggested for individuals with ≥ 2 FDRs, and every 5–10 years for those with FH of 1 FDR with CRC or documented advanced adenoma compared to average-risk individuals. Choosing screening parameters for an individual patient should consider the age of the affected FDR and local resources. It is suggested that individuals with an FH of ≥ 1 second-degree relatives only, or of nonadvanced adenoma or polyp of unknown histology, be screened according to average-risk guidelines.

Conclusions

The increased risk of CRC associated with an FH of CRC or advanced adenoma warrants more intense screening for CRC. Well-designed prospective studies are needed in order to make definitive evidence-based recommendations about the age to commence screening and appropriate interval between screening tests.

NCCN Colon cancer — risk assessment and family history screening emphasize that approximately 20% of colon cancer cases are associated with familial clustering, and first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal adenomas or invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) are at increased risk for CRC; genetic susceptibility to CRC includes well-defined inherited syndromes such as Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis CRC [HNPCC]) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is recommended that all patients with colon cancer be queried regarding their family history and considered for risk assessment, and results from a randomized controlled trial suggest that most individuals without a personal history of CRC and with one first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed before age 50 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC diagnosed at any age can safely be screened with colonoscopy every 6 years.

### Hereditary nonpolyposis… [^e6c62102]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

First-degree relatives of persons with HNPCC should undergo screening colonoscopy every one to two years starting at 25 years of age or five years younger than the first cancer diagnosis in the family, whichever comes first. 6 Surveillance should continue until 75 years of age. 6 Some families with a history of HNPCC are at increased risk of developing gastric cancer. In such families, biennial upper endoscopy should start at 50 years of age or five years younger than the age of the youngest affected relative with gastric cancer, whichever is earlier, and should continue until 75 years of age. Adenomatous Polyposis Syndromes FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS Familial adenomatous polyposis is defined as having 100 or more synchronous advanced adenomas inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

6 First-degree relatives of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis in whom a mutation has not been found should undergo colonoscopy, 4 and upper endoscopy for gastric cancer and proximal small bowel tumors starting at 20 to 25 years of age. 5 Additional screening may include annual thyroid examination on physical examination and possibly ultrasonography to screen for malignancy and upper endoscopy for gastric cancer and proximal small bowel tumors starting at 20 to 25 years of age. 5 This applies to all adenomatous polyposis syndromes. 4 Extracolonic cancer screening includes magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas every one to two years beginning at 30 to 35 years of age; annual mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging beginning at 25 years of age in women; annual pelvic examination and Papanicolaou smear beginning at 18 to 20 years of age in women; and annual testicular examination beginning at 10 years of age in males.

4, 6. 15 Surgery is indicated when CRC is diagnosed or the number of polyps makes endoscopic control unfeasible. 15 Following resection, endoscopic surveillance of any residual colon and rectum should be performed every six to 12 months. 16 It is recommended that screening colonoscopy be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with sessile serrated adenomatous polyposis beginning at 40 years of age or 10 years younger than the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative. Colonoscopy should be repeated at five-year intervals or more frequently if polyps are found. 15.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk individuals, family history, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain CRC screening in patients with ≥ 1 first-degree relatives with CRC or adenomatous polyps, starting at 40 years of age or 10 years before the age of the youngest relative at the time of their diagnosis.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^40f1a56a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

MSTF recommendations for CRC screening — family history and age-based guidance — specify that persons with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or a documented advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative aged < 60 years or 2 first-degree relatives at any age are recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative, or at age 40, whichever is earlier. For persons with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥ 60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma, average-risk screening options can be offered beginning at age 40 years. The incidence of CRC is rising in persons under age 50, and patients under age 50 with bleeding symptoms consistent with a colorectal source should be aggressively evaluated and treated. We suggest that screening begin at age 45 in African Americans. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when patients who are up to date with screening and have had negative screening tests, particularly colonoscopy, reach age 75 years or when life expectancy is < 10 years, and persons without prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85 years depending on comorbid conditions and life expectancy.

### Evidenced-based screening strategies for a positive family history [^503fd029]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The most commonly recognized high-risk group for colorectal cancer (CRC) is individuals with a positive family history. It is generally recognized that those with a first-degree relative (FDR) with CRC are at a 2-fold or higher risk of CRC or advanced neoplasia. FDRs of patients with advanced adenomas have a similarly increased risk. Accordingly, all major US guidelines recommend starting CRC screening by age 40 in these groups. Barriers to screening this group include patient lack of knowledge on family and polyp history, provider limitations in collecting family history, and insufficient application of guidelines.

### Effects of family history on relative and absolute risks for colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed2800ff]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Guidelines recommend that individuals with familial colorectal cancer undergo colonoscopy surveillance instead of average-risk screening. However, these recommendations vary widely. To substantiate appropriate surveillance strategies, precise and valid evidence-based risk estimates are needed for individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane from inception to July 2018 for case-control and cohort studies investigating the effect of family history on CRC risk. We calculated summary estimates of pooled relative risks (RRs) using a random-effects model. Life tables were created to convert RR estimates into absolute risk estimates.

Results

We screened 4417 articles and identified 42 eligible case-control and 20 cohort studies. In case-control studies, the RR for CRC in patients with 1 first-degree relative (FDR with CRC) was 1.92 (95% CI, 1.53–2.41) and 1.37 (95% CI, 0.76–2.46) for cohort studies. For individuals with 2 or more FDRs with CRC, the RR was 2.81 in case-control studies (95% CI, 1.73–4.55) and 2.40 in cohort studies (95% CI, 1.76–3.28). For individuals having a FDR diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50 years, the RR for CRC in their FDRs was 3.57 in case-control studies (95% CI, 1.07–11.85) and 3.26 in cohort studies (95% CI, 2.82–3.77). The cumulative absolute risks for CRC at 85 years in Western Europe were 4.8% for persons with 1 FDR with CRC (95% CI, 2.7%-8.3%), 8.2% for individuals with 2 or more FDRs (95% CI, 6.1%-10.9%), and 11% for persons with a FDR diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50 years (95% CI, 9.5%-12.4%).

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that the RR of CRC among FDRs is lower than previously expected, especially based on cohort studies. Risk estimates are affected by the number of relatives with CRC and their age at diagnosis. Intensified colonoscopy surveillance strategies could be considered for high-risk groups.

### Narrative review: screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a first-degree relative with colonic neoplasia [^25d553f3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients and providers are aware that colorectal cancer (CRC) "runs in families". A patient with 1 first-degree relative with CRC has approximately twice the personal risk for CRC as a similar person without this family history. Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the United States. When providers neglect to collect information on family history, they may fail to appropriately tailor recommendations for screening for CRC for many patients. This review considers the existing data and summarizes an evidence-based approach to the common clinical problem of how and when to implement screening for CRC in a patient with a family history of colonic neoplasia. The authors discuss the varying risks for CRC given the patient's age, health habits, and personal and family histories. In the context of a clinical case that focuses on the effect of a single affected first-degree relative, the authors weigh the risks and benefits of various screening alternatives and briefly address chemoprevention, genetic testing, and future directions in screening for CRC.

### Are colorectal cancer screening recommendations for first-degree relatives of patients with adenomas too aggressive? [^922fbb43]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Consensus guidelines of the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with an adenoma before age 60 should be screened every 5 years with colonoscopy starting at age 40. This is the identical recommendation for those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) before age 60. There is good evidence that first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with CRC before age 60 are at substantially increased risk for developing cancer at a young age. However, it is unclear whether an individual with a first-degree relative with an adenoma diagnosed before age 60 is at increased risk of CRC. Because not all adenomas portend the same cancer risk in the individual who has the adenoma, they would not be expected to portend the same risk in their first-degree relatives. Because of these uncertainties, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend more aggressive screening of first-degree relatives of individuals with an adenoma. The adenoma detection rate for individuals 50 to 59 years old without a first-degree relative with CRC is sufficiently high (approximately 25%-30%) that almost half the population would be high risk on the basis of one first-degree relative having an adenoma. Given the weakness of evidence supporting the guidelines, suboptimal levels of screening in the general population, and lack of resources to comply with the recommendation, first-degree relatives of individuals with adenomas should be screened as average-risk persons until more compelling data are available to justify more aggressive screening.

### Randomized comparison of surveillance intervals in familial colorectal cancer [^4dd0419d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Colonoscopic surveillance is recommended for individuals with familial colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the appropriate screening interval has not yet been determined. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare a 3-year with a 6-year screening interval.

Patients and Methods

Individuals between ages 45 and 65 years with one first-degree relative with CRC age < 50 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC were selected. Patients with zero to two adenomas at baseline were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group A (colonoscopy at 6 years) or group B (colonoscopy at 3 and 6 years). The primary outcome measure was advanced adenomatous polyps (AAPs). Risk factors studied included sex, age, type of family history, and baseline endoscopic findings.

Results

A total of 528 patients were randomly assigned (group A, n = 262; group B, n = 266). Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the proportion of patients with AAPs at the first follow-up examination at 6 years in group A (6.9%) versus 3 years in group B (3.5%). Also, the proportion of patients with AAPs at the final follow-up examination at 6 years in group A (6.9%) versus 6 years in group B (3.4%) was not significantly different. Only AAPs at baseline was a significant predictor for the presence of AAPs at first follow-up. After correction for the difference in AAPs at baseline, differences between the groups in the rate of AAPs at first follow-up and at the final examination were statistically significant.

Conclusion

In view of the relatively low rate of AAPs at 6 years and the absence of CRC in group A, we consider a 6-year surveillance interval appropriate. A surveillance interval of 3 years might be considered in patients with AAPs and patients with ≥ three adenomas.

### Family history and the natural history of colorectal cancer: systematic review [^50588fff]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a known risk factor for CRC and encompasses both genetic and shared environmental risks.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to estimate the impact of family history on the natural history of CRC and adherence to screening.

Results

We found high heterogeneity in family-history definitions, the most common definition being one or more first-degree relatives. The prevalence of family history may be lower than the commonly cited 10%, and confirms evidence for increasing levels of risk associated with increasing family-history burden. There is evidence for higher prevalence of adenomas and of multiple adenomas in people with family history of CRC but no evidence for differential adenoma location or adenoma progression by family history. Limited data regarding the natural history of CRC by family history suggest a differential age or stage at cancer diagnosis and mixed evidence with respect to tumor location. Adherence to recommended colonoscopy screening was higher in people with a family history of CRC.

Conclusion

Stratification based on polygenic and/or multifactorial risk assessment may mature to the point of displacing family history-based approaches, but for the foreseeable future, family history may remain a valuable clinical tool for identifying individuals at increased risk for CRC.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (risk stratification), AGA 2023 guidelines recommend to classify individuals with a first-degree relative (a parent, sibling, or child) diagnosed with CRC, particularly before the age of 50 years, as being at increased risk for CRC.

### Prevalence of family history of colorectal cancer in the general population [^d7ff502d]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Robust estimates of the prevalence of a family history of colorectal cancer in the general population are essential to inform planning of provision for colonoscopic surveillance and for clinical genetics services. However, there is a paucity of high-quality data.

Methods

Computerized record linkage was used to assess systematically the family history of 160 cancer-free community subjects and thereby provide prevalence data that are independent of participant recall. The data set comprised 2664 first- and second-degree relatives of study subjects, with 148 068 years at risk.

Results

Of people in the 30–70 years age range, 9.4 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 5.8 to 14.9) per cent had a first-degree relative affected by colorectal cancer, and 28.8 (95 per cent c.i. 22.3 to 36.2) per cent had an affected first- or second-degree relative. Between 0 and 3.1 per cent of study subjects merited colonic surveillance, depending on the stringency of the guidelines used.

Conclusion

An appreciable proportion of the general population has a relative affected by colorectal cancer, sufficient to merit screening under certain criteria. In the absence of good-quality evidence supporting colonoscopic surveillance in groups at moderate risk, these data directly inform the planning of services for people with a family history of colorectal cancer. However, the clinical risk and financial implications of screening should be taken into account.

MSTF recommendations for high-risk family histories not associated with polyp syndromes — For Family Colon Cancer Syndrome X, colonoscopy every 3–5 years beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative. For colorectal cancer or an advanced adenoma in two first-degree relatives at any age or in a single first-degree relative at age < 60 years, colonoscopy every 5 years beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier; for those with a single first-degree relative with colorectal cancer in whom no significant neoplasia appears by age 60 years, physicians can offer expanding the interval between colonoscopies. For a single first-degree relative diagnosed at age ≥ 60 years, begin screening at age 40 years; tests and intervals are as per the average-risk screening recommendations.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk [^0f4a6c0b]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer include those with a personal or family history of advanced adenomas or colorectal cancer, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, or genetic polyposis syndromes. In general, these persons should undergo more frequent or earlier testing than individuals at average risk. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma diagnosed before 60 years of age or two first-degree relatives diagnosed at any age should be advised to start screening colonoscopy at 40 years of age or 10 years younger than the earliest diagnosis in their family, whichever comes first. In individuals with ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease with colonic involvement, colonoscopy should begin eight to 10 years after the onset of symptoms and be repeated every one to three years. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer should begin colonoscopy at 25 years of age and repeat colonoscopy every one to two years. In persons with a family history of adenomatous polyposis syndromes, screening should begin at 10 years of age or in a person's mid-20s, depending on the syndrome; repeat colonoscopy is typically required every one to two years. Screening colonoscopy should begin at eight years of age in individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. If results are normal, colonoscopy can be repeated at 18 years of age and then every three years. Persons with sessile serrated adenomatous polyposis should begin annual colonoscopy as soon as the diagnosis is established.

Family history of CRC and polyps — screening initiation and intervals: We recommend that screening in most average-risk persons be initiated at age 50 years. We continue to recommend that persons with a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative diagnosed at < 60 years undergo colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years or 10 years before the age the relative was diagnosed, whichever comes first, and patients with a positive family history who decline colonoscopy should be offered fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening. For families meeting criteria for family colon cancer syndrome X, persons should undergo colonoscopy at least every 3 to 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative. When first-degree relatives have documented advanced serrated lesions (SSPs ≥ 10 mm in size, or an SSP with cytologic dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size), we recommend that screening for first-degree relatives of persons with advanced serrated lesions should be similar to the screening of first-degree relatives of persons with advanced conventional adenomas.

### Colonoscopy in asymptomatic individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer [^dcc46547]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This study was performed to evaluate the use of total colonoscopy as the optimal screening test in asymptomatic individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

Colonoscopy was performed in 249 asymptomatic individuals who had one or two first-degree relatives (FDRs) with CRC; individuals with three or more FDRs with CRC were excluded.

Results

Eighty-six colonic lesions were found in 51 individuals (51 of 249; 20.5%). Among these 51 subjects, 27 had neoplastic polyps (n = 38) and 29 had metaplastic polyps (n = 44). Although no invasive cancer was detected, in 14 individuals the lesions had a high malignancy potential because of their size and histopathology. We did not confirm a statistically significant difference in the incidence of neoplastic polyps according to the number of affected FDRs. Finally, the presence of metaplastic polyps was a very strong indication for the concomitant presence of metaplastic polyps (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Total colonoscopy is the optimal screening procedure for the examination of asymptomatic individuals with a family history of CRC.

### Comparison of compliance for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance by colonoscopy based on risk [^2ae0531e]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare colonoscopy screening/surveillance rates by level of risk for colorectal cancer based on age, personal history of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer, or family history of colorectal cancer.

Methods

Participants were aged 30–90 years, were seen within 5 years at Intermountain Healthcare, and had family history in the Utah Population Database. Colonoscopy rates were measured for those with/without risk factors.

Results

Among those aged 60–69 years, 48.4% had colonoscopy in the last 10 years, with rates declining after age 70 years. Percentages of those having had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years generally increased by risk level from 38.5% in those with a familial relative risk < 1.0 to 47.6% in those with a familial relative risk > 3.0. Compared with those with no family history, the odds ratio for being screened according to guidelines was higher for those with one first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer ≥ 60 years or two affected second-degree relatives (1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.46–1.61) than those with one affected first-degree relative diagnosed < 60 years or ≥ 2 affected first-degree relatives (1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.14–1.37).

Conclusions

Compliance with colonoscopy guidelines was higher for those with familial risk but did not correspond with the degree of risk.

### A scoring system for the strength of a family history of colorectal cancer [^db45d5bf]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Family history of colorectal cancer is associated with an increased risk for the disease, although there are many combinations of family history that are hard to correlate with risk status. A scoring system for family history of colorectal cancer was designed to make risk more readily quantifiable.

Methods

A colonoscopy database was used to test the following points system: each first-degree relative with colorectal cancer = 3 points; each second-degree relative with colorectal cancer = 1 point. Families with one or more first-degree relative affected under 50 years of age = an extra 3 points. Families with one or more second-degree relative affected under 50 years of age = an extra 1 point. Families with multiple relatives on the same side of the family = an extra 3 points (first-degree relatives), 1 point (second-degree relatives), or 2 points (first-degree and second-degree relatives). Points were added and categories defined as follows: low risk, 1 to 4 points; medium risk, 5 to 7 points; high risk, 8 to 10 points; very high risk, > 10 points. A control group of average-risk patients having screening colonoscopy was used. Categories were compared in number of adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, and cancers.

Results

The records of 992 patients were used to test the system. Mean adenomas per patient per group were 0.4 for controls, 1.0 for low risk, 1.0 for medium risk, 1.7 for high risk, and 1.7 for very high risk. Cancers per group were 2 of 196 for controls, 8 of 513 for low risk, 3 of 171 for medium risk, 3 of 84 for high risk, and 1 of 28 for very high risk. The score categories were combined to produce revised risk levels of low (score 1 to 7) and high (> 7). Average adenomas per patient in the revised categories were 0.4 (control), 1.0 (low risk), and 1.7 (high risk). The odds ratio of having one to two adenomas was 1.73 (1.19–2.50, 95% confidence limits) in the low-risk group and 2.39 (1.41–4.01) in the high-risk group. Odds ratios for having three or more adenomas were 5.70 (2.44–13.32) in the low-risk group and 10.35 (3.97–26.97) in the high-risk group.

Conclusion

In the two-category system proposed here of quantifying familial risk of colorectal cancer, patients having less than 8 points were at low risk and those with 8 or more were at high risk. Surveillance and chemoprevention protocols can be designed through use of these risk categories. A scoring system for family history of colorectal cancer can make risk assessment easier and facilitate both collaborative studies and patient triage into appropriate screening programs.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^7fbc1635]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Family history of adenomas — We no longer recommend that persons with a family history of adenomas in a first-degree relative undergo early screening, unless there is clear documentation of an advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative. In most cases the patient has no information regarding whether the family member's adenoma was advanced, and in this case we recommend that it be assumed the adenomas or polyps were not advanced. If a colonoscopy and/or pathology report(s) is available for a family member that documents an advanced adenoma or there is a report of a polyp requiring surgical resection, an advanced adenoma in a family member is considered established. First-degree relatives with advanced adenomas are recommended to be weighted the same as first-degree relatives with CRC (Table 5), and the yield of colonoscopic screening in first-degree relatives of persons with advanced adenomas is substantially increased.

U.S. Multi-Society Task Force family-history screening recommendations — We suggest that persons with 1 first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (CRC) or a documented advanced adenoma diagnosed at < 60 years or with 2 first-degree relatives with CRC and/or documented advanced adenomas undergo colonoscopy every 5 years beginning 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest first-degree relative was diagnosed or age 40, whichever is earlier (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that persons with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC or a documented advanced adenoma at age ≥ 60 years begin screening at age 40; the options for screening and the recommended intervals are the same as those for average-risk persons (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). We suggest that persons with 1 or more first-degree relatives with a documented advanced serrated lesion (SSP or traditional serrated adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size or an SSP with cytologic dysplasia) should be screened according to above recommendations for persons with a family history of a documented advanced adenoma (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). We recommend that persons with 1 or more first-degree relatives with CRC or documented advanced adenomas, for whom we recommend colonoscopy, should be offered annual FIT if they decline colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Cost effectiveness of age-specific screening intervals for people with family histories of colorectal cancer [^299ee339]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) decreases with age among individuals with a family history of CRC. However, no screening recommendations specify less frequent screening with increasing age. We aimed to determine whether such a refinement would be cost effective.

Methods

We determined the relative risk for CRC for individuals based on age and number of affected first-degree relatives (FDRs) using data from publications. For each number of affected FDRs, we used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model to estimate costs and effects of colonoscopy screening strategies with different age ranges and intervals. Screening was then optimized sequentially, starting with the youngest age group, and allowing the interval of screening to change at certain ages. Strategies with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio below $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year were considered cost effective.

Results

For people with 1 affected FDR (92% of those with a family history), screening every 3 years beginning at an age of 40 years is most cost effective. If no adenomas are found, the screening interval can gradually be extended to 5 and 7 years, at ages 45 and 55 years, respectively. From a cost-effectiveness perspective, individuals with more affected FDRs should start screening earlier and at shorter intervals. However, frequency can be reduced if no abnormalities are found.

Conclusions

Using a microsimulation model, we found that for individuals with a family history of CRC, it is cost effective to gradually increase the screening interval if several subsequent screening colonoscopies have negative results and no new cases of CRC are found in family members.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^a2092e7d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Rectal Cancer — risk assessment and hereditary syndromes: Approximately 20% of cases of CRC are associated with familial clustering, and first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal adenomas or invasive CRC are at increased risk for CRC; genetic susceptibility includes Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with CRC be queried regarding their family history and considered for risk assessment, as detailed in the NCCN Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening. Results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggest that most individuals without a personal history of CRC and with one first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed before age 50 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC diagnosed at any age can safely be screened with colonoscopy every 6 years. An international consortium recently reported a molecular classification defining four different subtypes; however, this classification is not yet recommended in clinical practice. Lynch syndrome is the most common form of genetically determined CRC predisposition, accounting for 2% to 4% of all CRC cases.

### Screening participation for people at increased risk of colorectal cancer due to family history: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^47edc30a]. Familial Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of observational studies to identify and summarise the level of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation for people at increased risk due to family history of the disease. Medline, Cinhal, Embase and PsychInfo databases were comprehensively searched between January 1995 and May 2012 to identify relevant articles. To be included, studies had to report on screening for people who had at least one first-degree relative with CRC and no previous personal diagnosis of the disease. Pooled screening participation levels were calculated for each screening modality. Seventeen studies, accounting for a total of 13,269 subjects with a family history of CRC met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies, including a total of 6,901 subjects had a pooled faecal occult blood testing screening participation (at least once) of 25% (95% CI 12–38). Five studies including a total of 5,091 subjects had a pooled sigmoidoscopy-based screening participation (at least once) of 16% (95% CI 7–27). Seven studies including a total of 9,965 subjects had pooled participation colonoscopy-based screening (at least once) of 40% (95% CI 26–54). There was a significant level of screening heterogeneity between studies. This review identified a substantial underuse of CRC screening for people at increased risk of developing the disease. It highlights the potential opportunity that exists for increasing screening participation among this segment of the population and the need to adjust the current CRC screening policies towards that objective.

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^44e7bd76]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by degree of familial relation — closer relation confers higher risk, and patterns vary with first- vs second-degree relatives. The closer the familial relation between a person and an affected relative with CRC, the higher the risk for that person. The most common CRC family history scenario is 1 first-degree relative (FDR) with CRC (> 90%). In a large colonoscopy study, CRC risk with an affected parent vs affected sibling was similar: adjusted OR (AOR) 0.90 (95% CI 0.34–2.35), advanced colorectal neoplasia AOR 1.07 (95% CI 0.75–1.52), and colorectal adenoma AOR 0.96 (95% CI 0.76–1.19). For second-degree relatives (SDRs), relative risks (RRs) with SDR alone ranged from 1.05 (95% CI 0.92–1.11) to 1.48 (1.11–1.93) as the number of SDRs increased, whereas concomitant 1 FDR plus ≥ 1 SDR increased risk from 2.12 (95% CI 1.90–2.35) to 3.57 (95% CI 2.20–4.93).

### Prevention of colorectal cancer by colonoscopic surveillance in individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer: 16 year, prospective, follow-up study [^d024fd90]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine to what extent individuals with various family histories of colorectal cancer (from one to three or more affected first degree relatives) benefit from colonoscopic surveillance.

Design

Prospective, observational study of high risk families, followed up over 16 years.

Setting

Tertiary referral family cancer clinic in London.

Participants

1678 individuals from families registered with the clinic. Individuals were classified according to the strength of their family history: hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (if they fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria), and one, two, or three affected first degree relatives (moderate risk).

Interventions

Colonoscopy was initially offered at five year intervals or three year intervals if an adenoma was detected.

Main Outcome Measures

The incidence of adenomas with high risk pathological features or cancer. This was analysed by age, the extent of the family history, and findings on previous colonoscopies. The cohort was flagged for cancer and death. Incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality during over 15,000 person years of follow-up were compared with those expected in the absence of surveillance.

Results

High risk adenomas and cancer were most common in families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (on initial colonoscopy 5.7% and 0.9%, respectively). In the families with moderate risk, these findings were particularly uncommon under age 45 (1.1% and 0%) and on follow-up colonoscopy if advanced neoplasia was absent initially (1.7% and 0.1%). The incidence of colorectal cancer was substantially lower-80% in families with moderate risk (P = 0.00004), and 43% in families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (P = 0.06)-than the expected incidence in the absence of surveillance when the family history was taken into account.

Conclusions

Colonoscopic surveillance reduces the risk of colorectal cancer in people with a strong family history. This study confirms that members of families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer require surveillance with short intervals. Individuals with a lesser family history may not require surveillance under age 45, and if advanced neoplasia is absent on initial colonoscopy, surveillance intervals may be lengthened. This would reduce the demand for colonoscopic surveillance.

### Screening colonoscopy use among individuals at higher colorectal cancer risk [^eb314815]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To describe screening colonoscopy use in those with a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Background

Colonoscopy is an effective means of screening for CRC and is preferred for individuals at higher risk. We therefore derived population-based estimates of colonoscopy use and analyzed how individual characteristics and family history correlate with colonoscopy.

Study

Individuals between the ages of 41 and 75 years who responded to the Cancer Control Module of the 2000 National Health Interview Study were analyzed. Screening colonoscopy was defined as having a colonoscopy for screening purposes within the last 10 years. Screening colonoscopy was the dependent variable and family history was the independent variable in a logistic regression model that included self-described sociodemographic characteristics.

Results

Of the 13,160 individuals in the analysis, 6.8% had a family history of CRC, corresponding to approximately 5.5 million individuals in the United States. Those with a family history were significantly more likely to report screening colonoscopy (27.8%) than those without a family history (7.7%; P < 0.001). In those with a family history, screening colonoscopy significantly correlated with tobacco use, education, and age. There was no trend for increased screening colonoscopy with having multiple family members or a young family member with CRC.

Conclusions

Over 5.5 million people in the US have a family history of CRC, and only 1 in 4 report having had a screening colonoscopy by the year 2000. Improving knowledge about CRC and addressing other barriers to screening in this group will be important components of improving screening colonoscopy utilization.

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: expert review [^3eac615a]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

Since the early 2000s, there has been a rapid decline in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, due in large part to screening and removal of precancerous polyps. Despite these improvements, CRC remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with approximately 53,000 deaths projected in 2023. The aim of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review was to describe how individuals should be risk-stratified for CRC screening and post-polypectomy surveillance and to highlight opportunities for future research to fill gaps in the existing literature.

Methods

This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: All individuals with a first-degree relative (defined as a parent, sibling, or child) who was diagnosed with CRC, particularly before the age of 50 years, should be considered at increased risk for CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: All individuals without a personal history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary CRC syndromes, other CRC predisposing conditions, or a family history of CRC should be considered at average risk for CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Individuals at average risk for CRC should initiate screening at age 45 years and individuals at increased risk for CRC due to having a first-degree relative with CRC should initiate screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40 years, whichever is earlier. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Risk stratification for initiation of CRC screening should be based on an individual's age, a known or suspected predisposing hereditary CRC syndrome, and/or a family history of CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: The decision to continue CRC screening in individuals older than 75 years should be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, screening history, and comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Screening options for individuals at average risk for CRC should include colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, flexible sigmoidoscopy plus fecal immunochemical test, multitarget stool DNA fecal immunochemical test, and computed tomography colonography, based on availability and individual preference. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Colonoscopy should be the screening strategy used for individuals at increased CRC risk. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The decision to continue post-polypectomy surveillance for individuals older than 75 years should be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, and comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Risk-stratification tools for CRC screening and post-polypectomy surveillance that emerge from research should be examined for real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in diverse populations (eg, by race, ethnicity, sex, and other sociodemographic factors associated with disparities in CRC outcomes) before widespread implementation.

Individuals with first degree relatives affected with colorectal cancer (CRC) at a young age, or more than one relative affected but who do not fulfil the Amsterdam criteria for a diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), are believed to be at an increased risk of CRC. However, there is a paucity of prospective data on the potential benefit of colonoscopic surveillance in such groups categorised by empiric family history criteria. We report a prospective study of 448 individuals seeking counselling about their perceived family history of CRC.

Patients and Methods

Following pedigree tracing, verification, and risk assignment by genetic counsellors, colonoscopy was undertaken for those at a moderate or high risk (HNPCC). Those classified as low risk were reassured and discharged without surveillance. Here we report our findings at the prevalence screen in the 176 patients of the 448 assessed who underwent colonoscopy.

Results

Fifty three individuals had a family history that met Amsterdam criteria (median age 43 years) and 123 individuals were classed as moderate risk (median age 43 years). No cancers were detected at colonoscopy in any group. Four individuals (8% (95% confidence limits (CL) 0.4–15%)) in the high risk group had an adenoma detected at a median age of 46 years and all four were less than 50 years of age. Five (4% (95% CL 0.6–8%)) of the moderate risk individuals had an adenoma at a median age of 54 years, two of whom were less than 50 years of age.

Conclusions

These findings indicate that the prevalence of significant neoplasia in groups defined by family history is low, particularly in younger age groups. These prospective data call into question the value of colonoscopy before the age of 50 years in moderate risk individuals.

### Selection of germline genetic testing panels in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline [^376fbc90]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Family history collection — All patients should have a family history taken and recorded, and patients should be asked to provide the following as part of this family history; only information about biologic relatives is pertinent: whether any cancers are present in first-degree biological relatives and second-degree biological relatives, details for each cancer including type of primary cancer(s), age at cancer diagnosis, and whether multiple cancers or one type were involved, whether any relative has had germline genetic testing and the results, and the patient's ethnicity; the gender assigned at birth of biological relatives is important, and where possible information on third-degree relatives, consanguinity, and personal and family history of colon polyps can help inform genetic testing and counseling, especially with interpretation of results.

### Early initiation of colorectal cancer screening in individuals with affected first-degree relatives [^5e707fc7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Several guidelines recommend initiating colorectal cancer screening at age 40 for individuals with affected first-degree relatives, yet little evidence exists describing how often these individuals receive screening procedures.

Objectives

To determine the proportion of individuals in whom early initiation of colorectal cancer screening might be indicated and whether screening disparities exist.

Design

Population-based Supplemental Cancer Control Module to the 2000 National Health Interview Survey.

Participants

Respondents, 5,564, aged 40 to 49 years were included within the analysis.

Measurements

Patient self-report of sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or fecal occult blood test.

Results

Overall, 279 respondents (5.4%: 95% C. I., 4.7, 6.2) reported having a first-degree relative affected with colorectal cancer. For individuals with a positive family history, 67 whites (27.9%: 95% C. I., 21.1, 34.5) and 3 African American (9.3%: 95% C. I., 1.7, 37.9) had undergone an endoscopic procedure within the previous 10 years (P-value = .03). After adjusting for age, family history, gender, educational level, insurance status, and usual source of care, whites were more likely to be current with early initiation endoscopic screening recommendations than African Americans (OR = 1.38: 95% C. I., 1.01, 1.87). Having an affected first-degree relative with colorectal cancer appeared to have a stronger impact on endoscopic screening for whites (OR = 3.21: 95% C. I., 2.31, 4.46) than for African Americans (OR = 1.05: 95% C. I., 0.15, 7.21).

Conclusions

White participants with a family history are more likely to have endoscopic procedures beginning before age 50 than African Americans.

### Familial risk of colorectal cancer in subjects attending an organised screening programme [^1fc6bda5]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background

First degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients are at increased risk for the same disease.

Aims

To evaluate the prevalence of familial risk and its association with the occurrence of pathological significant lesions in subjects with positive faecal occult blood testing leading to colonoscopy.

Methods

Faecal occult blood testing is offered biennially to subjects aged 50–70. Subjects with a positive faecal test are invited to undergo colonoscopy. Familial history for colorectal cancer in subjects undergoing colonoscopy was routinely recorded.

Results

From 1995 to 2009, 4833 screenees with positive faecal occult blood test undergoing colonoscopy were enrolled. Twelve percent reported a positive first degree family history. Multivariate analysis evidenced that the probability of detecting pathological significant lesions was statistically associated with age, gender, type of test, repeated or first screening, and having at least 1 first degree relative with colorectal cancer.

Conclusions

Subjects attending colonoscopy reporting a positive first degree family history are at increased risk for pathologically significant lesions.

### Evaluating the effects of a risk-adapted screening program for familial colorectal cancer in individuals between 25 and 50 years of age: study protocol for the prospective population-based intervention study FARKOR [^a1cd64e2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The FARKOR screening process

Participants will be invited by participating physicians to participate in a short standardized interview regarding their family history, which is based on a simplified version of the Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria, and to sign a written informed consent form. Based on this short interview consisting of five simple questions concerning the diagnosis of CRC in first- and second-degree relatives, participants are either classified as potential risk carrier if they indicate having at least one first- or second-degree relative with CRC or as risk free. In a shared decision-making, potential risk carriers and their physicians discuss the risks and benefits of possible CRC screening options, which consist of an iFOBT, a screening colonoscopy, or deferring further CRC screening measures to a later point in life. Patients with a positive iFOBT result will undergo diagnostic workup by colonoscopy and both diagnostic and screening colonoscopies are accompanied by a comprehensive documentation of both macroscopic and histologic findings and of potential complications. In case of pathologic findings, patients will receive treatment according to the established guidelines. Additionally, potential risk carriers will be encouraged to undergo an in-depth interview regarding their family history of CRC in which detailed information concerning age, incidence and mortality of CRC in all first- and second-degree relatives is ascertained.

The full FARKOR process is shown in Fig. 1 and consists of the following steps: (1) informed consent, (2) short questionnaire on family history of CRC, (3) shared decision making, (4) offer to complete an in-depth questionnaire on family history of CRC, and (5) further screening measures (iFOBT, colonoscopy, deferral and timing of future screening procedures). All steps in this screening process are accompanied by an internet-based documentation which will be completed by the physicians participating in the program.

Fig. 1
FARKOR screening process

Additionally to this FARKOR screening process, all participants (with and without family history of CRC) will be invited to complete an online lifestyle questionnaire based on an instrument previously developed for the RAPS study (Risiko-adaptierte Präventions-Strategien für Darmkrebs). It consists of questions on pre-existing conditions, participation in prevention programs, lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, nutrition, exercise, drug use…) as well as anthropometric and sociodemographic information (including age, sex, height, weight, and educational level).

### Participation in screening colonoscopy in first-degree relatives from patients with colorectal cancer [^174f8555]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend screening colonoscopy in first-degree relatives of patients with colon cancer. The aim of this state-wide study was to investigate the compliance for colonoscopic in first-degree relatives, who were younger than 60 years of age.

Methods

A total of 602 patients were identified from the tumor registry of the public health insurance of Lower Saxony. A questionnaire was sent to these patients, which included a number of different questions regarding their knowledge about the risk of colon cancer for their family members, as well as their participation in screening colonoscopy.

Results

Data from 442 patients and their first-degree relatives (1005 siblings and 354 parents) were available; 178 parents had undergone screening colonoscopy and 344 siblings. Interestingly, the percentage of siblings who underwent screening colonoscopy was significantly higher (27%) among those siblings where the index patients were aware of the increased risk for the first-degree relatives, in contrast to the siblings of the index patients who were not aware of this risk (20%).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that only a minority of first-degree relatives undergo screening colonoscopy and that informing patients about the potential risk for their relatives will increase participation in screening colonoscopy in first-degree relatives of the patients.

### Colonoscopy for screening and follow up of patients with a family history of colorectal cancer [^cb96801f]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the minimum family history of colorectal cancer (CRC), which justifies colonoscopy and to establish whether further colonic assessment is necessary after a negative screening colonoscopy.

Method

A retrospective review of every colonoscopy undertaken for family screening at the Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospitals, Reading between October 1996 and July 2004.

Results

Four hundred and thirty-two patients (261 women) with an average age of 48 years (range 14–84) were screened. Three cancers in patients over the age of 60 years and 49 adenomas were found in 37 patients. Twenty three of 281 (8%) patients with a 'low-risk' family history (one in 12 or less lifetime risk of developing CRC) had either a cancer or an adenoma. Eighteen of 151 (12%) patients with a 'high-risk' family history (one in 10 or greater) had a similar positive colonoscopy. Thirteen of 15 patients who had an adenoma aged under 45 years had a high-risk family history. Seventy-three patients subsequently underwent two or more follow-up colonoscopies. There were 22 adenomatous polyps found in 12 patients (16%) at the first screening, nine adenomas in seven patients in the second colonoscopy and four adenomas found in four patients in all subsequent colonoscopies.

Conclusion

Patients with a low-risk family history have a similar adenoma pick-up to that of the general population. These patients need not be screened below the age of 50 unless symptomatic. Follow up of low-risk family history (FH) patients with a negative screening colonoscopy is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Position statement of the international society for gastrointestinal hereditary tumours (InSiGHT) onI1307K and cancer risk [^40d9a094]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the available data, screening by colonoscopy at the age of 45–50 years, repeating it every 5 years (and not every 10 years as recommended for average risk population), may be considered in AJ I1307K heterozygotes, with or without family history. Based on the scarce data on I1307K homozygotes, which do not support more aggressive cancer phenotypes and/or earlier ages at cancer onset, the same recommendations as for heterozygotes should be considered.

We recommend predictive testing for FDRs. Predictive testing may be considered for second-degree relatives when the FDR does not undergo testing. When genetic testing is not available, surveillance recommendations for individuals with an FDR with CRC may be advised in FDR of I1307K carriers.

How to deal with CRC risk in I1307K heterozygotes in non-AJs and non-Jewish population?

Available data suggest that APC I1307K is not a risk factor for CRC in non-AJs. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the I1307K allele confers increased risk of CRC in non-Jewish individuals.

In these settings (non-AJ Jews and non-Jewish individuals), we consider sufficient to recommend carriers to be enrolled in their respective national screening programmes, taking into consideration that the start age is set at 45 or 50 years in most countries. If earlier and/or enhanced surveillance is considered, patients should be informed that they may not be at increased risk and therefore that earlier colonoscopy may not provide any benefit. Accordingly, we do not recommend predictive testing for FDRs. In the presence of family history of CRC, current recommendations for individuals with an FDR with CRC may be advised.

### Colorectal cancer screening [^b4852c51]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade we have seen dramatic advances in colon cancer screening. Reduction in mortality in average risk screening for colorectal cancer has now been shown in multiple trials. Efforts to increase public awareness and compliance with evidence-based screening guidelines are underway. Recent guidelines have incorporated family history, as it has been identified as a common risk factor. The genes responsible for the inherited syndromes of colon cancer have been identified and genetic testing is available. Currently, screening the average risk population over the age of 50 would reduce mortality from colon cancer by 50%. Future advances will likely include improved screening tests, and the development of familial genetic testing.

### Colonic adenoma risk in familial colorectal cancer – a study of six extended kindreds [^fa398cce]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from adenomatous polyps, but the effects of CRC family history on adenoma risk are not well known. This issue is clinically relevant since several medical societies currently recommend earlier and more rigorous colorectal screening for individuals with a strong family history of CRC.

Methods

Colonoscopies were performed in 236 first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of 40 index CRC cases from six large kindreds selected from a large population database. The kindreds were selected for significantly greater risk of CRCs compared with the overall population. Known hereditary colon cancer syndromes were clinically and genetically excluded.

Results

Thirty-seven percent of relatives were found to have adenomas on colonoscopy. The average age of diagnosis for colon cancer was 63 yr and advanced adenomas 56 yr. Independent predictors of adenomatous polyps in the relatives were advancing age (P < 0.0001), male gender (P < 0.001), and greater degree of relation to CRC cases (P < 0.01). There was no significant predilection of colorectal tumors for the right or left colon. A higher degree of relationship to CRC cases was a significant predictor of having simple and advanced adenomas, but not hyperplastic polyps after adjustment for age and gender.

Conclusions

These data support the current recommendations for colonoscopy starting before the age of 50 yr in individuals with a strong family history of CRC.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^683f704e]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance — interval fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) before scheduled surveillance is not advised after an adequate baseline colonoscopy. If the patient has an adequate baseline colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be based on the current guidelines, and patients should not have interval fecal blood testing if colonoscopy is planned. The task force recommends that interval fecal testing not be performed within the first 5 years after colonoscopy; there is currently insufficient evidence to support this practice, and the likelihood of false-positive test results is high, which would result in unnecessary early colonoscopies. If a fecal blood test is performed in the first 5 years after colonoscopy, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, and the clinician's judgment to repeat colonoscopy could consider the prior colonoscopy findings, completeness of examination and bowel preparation, and family history.

### Polygenic risk score is a predictor of adenomatous polyps at screening colonoscopy [^f19baa8d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

National guidelines recommend that, in the absence of known risk factors, patients considered to be average risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC) should begin screening at age 50 years. The recommendation for CRC screening with colonoscopy is based on a meaningful reduction in incidence and mortality from CRC offered by timely screening. The combined gastroenterology society guidelines recognize risk factors including a family history of CRC (single first-degree relative with CRC or advanced adenoma diagnosed at age < 60 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC or advanced adenomas), personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, and/or a personal or family history of a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. For patients with any of the above risk factors, colonoscopy is initiated at an earlier age and/or with more frequent follow up exams than those patients at average risk for CRC. While CRC incidence has declined steadily over the past two decades in the population aged 50 years and older, limited demographic-based risk factors currently in use inadequately predict heightened CRC risk regardless of age.

Moving our screening from population-based risk to individual risk requires the incorporation of genetic predisposition. ﻿Many CRC risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified and confirmed from genome-wide association studies. Although the effect of individual SNPs is modest, there is a stronger cumulative effect. SNP-based Genetic Risk Score (GRS), an odds ratio (OR)-weighted and population-standardized polygenic risk score derived from well-established CRC risk–associated SNPs, has been consistently associated with CRC risk. In brief, it is calculated by multiplying the per-allele OR for each SNP and normalizing the risk by the mean risk expected in the population. Such an approach has been successfully implemented for other malignancies in predicting risk for breast cancer, prostate cancer, CRC and other cancers. Few studies to date have tested the association between GRS and screening-detected adenomatous polyps. As the detection of adenomatous polyps is the primary purpose of screening colonoscopy, the aim of this study is to test the association of GRS with risk of adenomatous polyps in a study population undergoing screening colonoscopy. We hypothesize that, for patients who underwent screening colonoscopy at our institution and were diagnosed with advanced adenomas and non-advanced adenomas, CRC-risk associated SNPs can be used to construct a GRS to more accurately identify an individual's risk for developing adenomatous polyps than current screening recommendations.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in colonoscopic examination of individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer [^904be1bf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Guidelines recommend that persons with a high-risk family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) undergo colonoscopy examinations every 5 years, starting when they are 40 years old. We investigated factors associated with colonoscopy screening of individuals with a family history of CRC, focusing on race and ethnicity.

Methods

In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey on persons 40–80 years old with a first-degree relative (mother, father, sibling, or child) with CRC who had visited a physician within the past 5 years. Our study included an unweighted and population-weighted sample of 2539 and 870,214 individuals with a family history of CRC, respectively. We performed a survey-weighted logistic regression analysis to adjust for relevant demographic and socioeconomic variables and used estimates to calculate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colonoscopy examination within the past 5 years.

Results

In the weighted sample, 60.0% of subjects received a colonoscopy within the past 5 years. A physician recommendation for CRC screening increased the odds that an individual would undergo colonoscopy examination (relative risk, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.61–2.24). Latinos were 31% less likely to receive colonoscopies than whites (95% CI, 7%-55%). Among individuals 40–49 years old, blacks were 71% less likely to have had a colonoscopy than whites (95% CI, 13%-96%).

Conclusion

On the basis of an analysis of data from the California Health Interview Survey, less than two-thirds of individuals with a family history of CRC reported receiving guideline-recommended colonoscopy examinations within the past 5 years. We observed racial and ethnic disparities in colonoscopy screening of this high-risk group; Latinos and blacks were less likely to have had a colonoscopy than whites.

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^ea429d40]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of adenomas and sessile serrated lesions and detection of early-stage CRC. The purpose of this article is to update the 2009 American College of Gastroenterology CRC screening guidelines. The guideline is framed around several key questions. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to include studies through October 2020. The inclusion criteria were studies of any design with men and women age 40 years and older. Detailed recommendations for CRC screening in average-risk individuals and those with a family history of CRC are discussed. We also provide recommendations on the role of aspirin for chemoprevention, quality indicators for colonoscopy, approaches to organized CRC screening and improving adherence to CRC screening. CRC screening must be optimized to allow effective and sustained reduction of CRC incidence and mortality. This can be accomplished by achieving high rates of adherence, quality monitoring and improvement, following evidence-based guidelines, and removing barriers through the spectrum of care from noninvasive screening tests to screening and diagnostic colonoscopy. The development of cost-effective, highly accurate, noninvasive modalities associated with improved overall adherence to the screening process is also a desirable goal.

### Colonoscopic findings in first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer: a population-based screening program [^3d7bb199]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A screening colonoscopy is recommended in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer patients; few prospective, controlled studies have evaluated colorectal findings in a population-based screening program.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of colorectal neoplasia (adenomas and adenocarcinomas) in this increased-risk population, to compare it with that of average-risk individuals, and to identify features that might allow risk stratification for neoplasia among FDRs.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Population-based screening program in Trentino, Italy.

Patients

FDRs of colorectal cancer patients between 45 and 75 years of age with no history of hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes or inflammatory bowel disease.

Controls

Average-risk individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy.

Intervention

Screening colonoscopy.

Results

Neoplasia was found in 33.4% of 1252 FDRs and in 30.3% of 765 controls; advanced neoplasia was found in 11.3% of FDRs and in 6.3% of controls. Odds ratios (ORs) from the multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, cecal intubation rates, and colon cleansing showed an increased risk of advanced neoplasia (OR 2.41; 95% CI, 1.69–3.43; P < .0001) in FDRs. Age older than 56 years (OR 1.83; 95% CI, 1.15–2.99; P = 0.013) and male sex (OR 2.17; 95% CI, 1.39–3.10; P < .001) are independent predictors of advanced neoplasia.

Limitations

Italian subjects living in the same geographic area; of 4301 FDRs, 2521 were excluded.

Conclusions

The increased risk of advanced neoplasia supports the current recommendation for colonoscopic screening in this group; age and sex may assist in risk stratification of these individuals.

### High uptake of colonoscopy in first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer in a healthcare region: a population-based, prospective study [^1fb51f79]. Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

A screening program in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (index patients) was started in Trentino, Italy, to analyze factors that influence uptake of CRC screening among invited FDRs (first objective) and to describe colorectal findings among those undergoing colonoscopy (secondary objective).

Patients and Methods

FDRs aged between 45 and 75 years were invited; exclusion criteria were: colonoscopy or barium enema in the preceding 5 years, a history of familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and severe comorbidities. FDRs who were eligible but were not invited for screening because consent was not obtained from the index patients were considered as the control group. FDRs were invited by the education campaign targeted at the population at risk (both study and control groups); in the study group, interventions targeting individuals at risk (letters, phone calls, face-to-face counseling) were implemented.

Results

Starting from 626 new index cases of diagnosed CRC, 725 FDRs were invited to counseling; 77.6% of these attended for colonoscopy in the study group vs. 8% in the control group (P < 0.0001). Predictors of colonoscopy uptake were FDR age above 60 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.50, 95%CI 1.72–3.62], complex family history (simple family history: one CRC at age above 60 years; complex family history: one CRC at age below 60 or two or more CRC; OR 1.54; 95%CI 1.04–2.33) and living in a rural area (OR 1.64, 95%CI 1.12–2.44). Of the 560 FDRs in the study group, 186 (33.8%) had adenomas, and 48 (8.8%) had advanced adenomas or cancer.

Conclusions

Interventions that target FDRs of patients with CRC, especially those younger than 60 years, with a complex family history of CRC and who live in a rural area, may improve uptake of CRC screening via colonoscopy.

### First-degree relatives of patients with advanced colorectal adenomas have an increased prevalence of colorectal cancer [^1df74952]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The risk of colorectal cancer in relatives of patients with adenomatous colonic polyps is not well defined. This study assessed whether finding colonic neoplasia during screening colonoscopy was related to the family history of colorectal cancer among the participants' parents and siblings.

Methods

Self-reported family history of colorectal cancer was recorded for all participants in a screening colonoscopy study. The size and location of all polyps were recorded before their removal and histologic examination. Participants were grouped according to the most advanced lesion detected.

Results

Three thousand one hundred twenty-one patients underwent complete colonoscopic examination. Subjects with adenomas were more likely to have a family history of colorectal cancer than were subjects without polyps (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.70). The finding of a small (< 1 cm) tubular adenoma as the most advanced lesion was associated with only a modest increase in the OR of colorectal cancer in family members (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.99–1.61), but the presence of an advanced adenoma was associated with a higher OR (OR, 1.62;5% CI, 1.16–2.26). Younger age of adenoma diagnosis was not related to a higher prevalence of a family history of colorectal cancer.

Conclusions

Relatives patients with advanced colorectal adenomas have an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Individuals with advanced colorectal adenomas should be counseled about the increased risk of colorectal cancer among their relatives.

### CT colonographic screening of patients with a family history of colorectal cancer: comparison with adults at average risk and implications for guidelines [^2bc16c9e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to compare rates of lesion detection at CT colonographic (CTC) screening of adults without symptoms who had and who did not have a family history of colorectal cancer according to American Cancer Society guidelines and to consider the clinical implications.

Materials and Methods

Over 134 months, consecutively registered CTC cohorts of adults without symptoms who had (n = 156; 88 [56.4%] women; 68 [43.6%] men; mean age, 56.3 years) and who did not have (n = 8857; 4757 [53.7%] women; 4100 [46.3%] men; mean age, 56.6 years) an American Cancer Society-defined family history of colorectal cancer (first-degree relative with diagnosis before age 60 years or two first-degree relatives with diagnosis at any age) were compared for relevant colorectal findings.

Results

For the family history versus no family history cohorts, the frequency of all nondiminutive polyps (≥ 6 mm) reported at CTC was 23.7% versus 15.5% (p = 0.007); small polyps (6–9 mm), 13.5% versus 9.1% (p = 0.068); and large polyps (≥ 10 mm), 10.2% versus 6.5% (p = 0.068). The rate of referral for colonoscopy was greater for the family history cohort (16.0% vs 10.5%; p = 0.035). However, the frequencies of proven advanced adenoma (4.5% vs 3.2%; p = 0.357), nonadvanced adenoma (5.1% vs 2.6%; p = 0.070), and cancer (0.0% vs 0.4%; p = 0.999) were not significantly increased. The difference in positive rates between the two cohorts (11.5% vs 4.3%; p < 0.001) was primarily due to nonneoplastic findings of no colorectal cancer relevance, such as small hyperplastic polyps, diverticular disease, and false-positive CTC findings.

Conclusion

Although the overall CTC-positive and colonoscopy referral rates were higher in the family history cohort, the clinically relevant frequencies of advanced neoplasia and cancer were not sufficiently increased to preclude CTC screening. These findings support the use of CTC as a front-line screening option in adults with a family history of colorectal cancer.

### Incidence and recurrence rates of colorectal adenomas in first-degree asymptomatic relatives of patients with colon cancer [^ea706b3d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Subjects with one first-degree relative affected with colorectal cancer are considered to be at increased risk of colorectal adenomas. We compared the recurrence and incidence rates of colorectal adenomas among subjects with one first-degree relative with colorectal cancer and those without family history.

Methods

A series of consecutive asymptomatic subjects successfully underwent a colonoscopy, were found to have either normal results or at least one adenoma, provided a detailed family history, and were offered a second colonoscopy 3 yr later; 190 out of 436 subjects accepted, 134/172 with one or more adenomas and 56/264 with no abnormalities at the initial examination. A first-degree family history was reported by 43/134 and 26/56, respectively.

Results

By multivariate analysis, the presence of adenomas at follow-up examination was significantly associated with a positive family history of colorectal cancer in both subgroups, those with a previously resected adenoma (odds ratio = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.04–4.79) and those without (odds ratio = 8.95, CI = 1.29–62.22).

Conclusion

A history of one first-degree relative with colorectal cancer is associated with a significant increase in 3-yr cumulative incidence and recurrence rates of adenomas.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^21493198]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force colorectal cancer screening — population targeted comprises asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; and no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis).

### Addition of an online, validated family history questionnaire to the Dutch FIT-based screening programme did not improve its diagnostic yield [^8bd843fd]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer in the Netherlands.CRC predominantly originates from adenomas. As the progression of adenomas to cancer takes 10–15 years, there is a long window of opportunity for intervention. Colonoscopy enables detection and treatment of adenomas and early cancer, reducing both CRC-related incidence and mortality.

Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is a screening method that selects individuals at high risk of having advanced adenomas or CRC, the combination referred to as advanced neoplasia (AN). Screening participants with a positive FIT are subsequently invited for colonoscopy. FIT has a low burden, facilitating participation in FIT-based screening. In the Netherlands, the participation rate is around 72%. Yet, since the sensitivity of FIT is not perfect, not all individuals with AN are detected in one screening round. Depending on the faecal haemoglobin concentration cut-off level and brand, pooled sensitivity was 79% for CRC and 6–56% for AN.

To increase the detection rate of AN in FIT-based screening, FIT could be combined with risk factors for AN. Studies have reported that a false-negative FIT result was more often observed in participants with a family history of CRC than in those without. In this context, a positive family history is defined by the diagnosis of a hereditary CRC syndrome, such as Lynch syndrome, and/or the so-called "familial CRC syndrome", defined by the number and age of relatives with CRC but which does not yet have a known genetic basis. Of all the CRC cases, 15–30% seem to have such a familial risk and 2–5% are related to a hereditary CRC syndrome.

International guidelines recommend individuals with a positive CRC family history to undergo regular colonoscopy surveillance instead of participating in FIT-based screening programmes. Colonoscopy surveillance has shown to reduce CRC-related mortality for individuals with Lynch syndrome by 72% and up to 81% for those with a familial CRC syndrome. However, colonoscopy uptake in individuals with a positive family history for CRC varies widely (12–51%). Furthermore, only 12–33% of CRC patients and their relatives who qualify for referral to a clinical geneticist are actually referred. Contrary to the guideline recommendations, many individuals with a hereditary or familial CRC syndrome do not receive periodic colonoscopy surveillance. Instead, they will be invited for screening whenever an organised population-based screening programme is in place.

### How is the increased risk of colorectal cancer in first-degree relatives of patients communicated? [^6e3865a5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Compared with the general population, first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have a two-fold to four-fold higher risk of developing CRC. Little data is available regarding communication between doctors and CRC patients about risk to FDRs. We aimed to evaluate CRC patients' knowledge of FDRs' increased CRC risk, and FDRs' knowledge of this risk and adherence to CRC screening.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective, single-center, population-based observational study, patients aged 18–80 years who underwent surgery for CRC between January 2005 and May 2010 were asked to complete a questionnaire. A questionnaire sent to the patients' FDRs (siblings and children) asked whether they had been advised to undergo any CRC screening examination, whether they had done so, and if so, when initiated and by whom. Main outcome measurements were: CRC patients' and their FDRs' information status regarding the FDRs' increased CRC risk and screening status.

Results

Of 343 index patients (390 contacted, 47 deceased/moved), 134 replied to the survey (39.1% response rate). Among index patients, 82.1% (110/134) were informed about FDRs' increased CRC risk. This information was provided mainly by gastroenterologists and general practitioners (65.7 and 28.4%, respectively). Among FDRs, 85.1% (143/168) were informed about their increased CRC risk, but 69% did not undergo a screening colonoscopy. Among the FDRs more than 50 years of age, 40.8% did not undergo a screening colonoscopy.

Conclusion

In Switzerland, CRC patients and their FDRs are well informed about FDRs' increased CRC risk. However, the majority of FDRs do not undergo the recommended CRC screening.

### Colonoscopic screening of first-degree relatives of patients with large adenomas: increased risk of colorectal tumors [^c79052b7]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The risk of developing colorectal neoplasia is not well established among family members of individuals with large adenomas, and screening strategies remain under debate in this population. This study aimed at quantifying the risk of colorectal adenomas and cancers using colonoscopic screening in first-degree relatives of patients with large adenomas.

Methods

This case-control study was performed in 18 endoscopic units of French nonuniversity hospitals. A colonoscopy was offered to first-degree relatives of 306 index cases with adenomas ≥ 10 mm if they were alive, aged 40–75 years, and could be contacted by the index case. Among them, 168 were examined and matched for age, sex, and geographical area with 2 controls (n = 307). Controls were randomly selected from 1362 consecutive patients aged 40–75 years having undergone a colonoscopy for minor symptoms.

Results

The prevalence of large adenomas and cancers was 8.4% and 4.2%, in relatives and controls, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) associated with a history of large adenomas in relatives were 2.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–5.09) for cancers or large adenomas, 1.21 (95% CI, 0.68–2.15) for small adenomas, and 1.56 (95% CI, 0.96–2.53) for all colorectal neoplasia. The risk of large adenomas and cancers was higher in relatives of index cases younger than 60 years (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 0.92–15.87) and when the index case had large distal adenomas (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.27–7.73).

Conclusions

First-degree relatives of patients with large adenomas are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancers or large adenomas. This result has implications for screening in this high-risk population.

### Colonoscopic surveillance of patients with a family history of colon cancer and a history of normal colonoscopy: is a five-year interval between colonoscopies appropriate? [^f7ff2225]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients with a family history of colon cancer are advised to undergo surveillance colonoscopy 5 years after a normal screening colonoscopy. No prospective study has evaluated the prevalence of adenomas found at surveillance colonoscopy in these patients. The aims of this trial were (1) to determine the percentage of these patients with adenomas; (2) to determine the percentage of these patients with advanced adenomas (i.e., villous adenomas, adenomas ≥ 10 mm, adenomas with high grade dysplasia); and (3) to assess risk factors for adenomas in these patients.

Methods

Consecutive patients with a family history of colorectal cancer and a normal screening colonoscopy 5 years earlier were offered a surveillance colonoscopy. Patients also completed a questionnaire about potential risk factors for adenomas. Multiple logistic regression analysis assessed associations between risk factors and adenomas.

Results

One hundred patients completed the trial. The male/female ratio was 54/46, the mean age was 56.2 ± 8.8 years, and 91% were white. Eight percent (8 of 100) of patients had advanced adenomas at surveillance colonoscopy, and 33% (33 of 100) had adenomas. Among patients with adenomas, 39% (13 of 33) had no adenomas in the left side of the colon (i.e., distal to the splenic flexure). Among patients with advanced adenomas, 25% (2 of 8) had no adenomas in the left side of the colon. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant negative association between adenomas and NSAID use (odds ratio, 0.26 [95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.79]), and male gender had a positive association with adenomas (odds ratio, 2.79 [95% confidence interval, 1.01–7.74]).

Conclusions

These data support a 5-year interval between screening and surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a family history of colorectal cancer and a normal screening colonoscopy.

Registry data from other populations also suggest a benefit in selected moderate familial risk populations undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. These studies also confirm an association of AAs at the index procedure with advanced neoplasia in subsequent surveillance procedures (GRADE online supplementary tables 1-GRADE table 1). In a Swedish moderate familial risk cohortthe risk of future AAs was associated with the prevalence of advanced lesions at the screening colonoscopy (multivariate analysis OR 5.22, 9% CI 2.3 to 9.94). It is of interest that adenomas and advanced lesions were not associated with the same risk factors: family history was predictive of advanced adenomas but not adenomas at the index screening colonoscopy.

The FACTS (Familial CRC Surveillance) randomised controlled trial compared intervals of surveillance in familial CRC. Individuals aged between 45 and 65 years with moderate familial CRC risk, where LS had been largely excluded, were randomly assigned to either a colonoscopy at 6 years or a colonoscopy at 3 and 6 years. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the proportion of patients with AAs (the primary outcome measure) at the first follow-up examination at 6 years (6.9%) versus 3 years (3.5%). The presence of AAs at the index colonoscopy was the only significant predictor for the presence of AAs at first follow-up (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 16.87). Thus a 6 yearly interval was non-inferior to a 3 yearly surveillance interval, with the exception being that an AA at index colonoscopy predicts further advanced neoplasia at 3 years.

Surveillance for colorectal neoplasia in those with a high familial risk of CRC

​ We suggest that in high-risk families (a cluster of 3× FDRs with CRC across > 1 generation) a 5 yearly colonoscopy should be performed from the age of 40 years until the age of 75

​(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

​Consensus reached: 86% agreement.

Families who fulfil Amsterdam criteria but who do not have evidence of dMMR do not share the same cancer incidence as families with LS (ie, hereditary MMR deficiency). Relatives in such families were found to have a lower incidence of CRC than those in families with LS, and incidence was not increased for other cancers. These families should not be described or counselled as having LS. To facilitate distinguishing these entities, the designation of "familial CRC type X" was suggested by Lindor et al to describe this type of familial aggregation of CRC.

### Poor patient knowledge regarding family history of colon polyps: implications for the feasibility of stratified screening recommendations [^e5be023c]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In 2008, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) modified its colorectal screening guidelines regarding patients with family histories of colorectal polyps, specifically highlighting the importance of obtaining detailed history that includes the number, type, and size of adenomas found in a patient's relative. This information is then used to guide screening recommendations for these patients.

Objective

To assess the proportion of patients undergoing screening colonscopy for a family history of polyps who have knowledge of their family members' colonoscopy findings.

Design

Retrospective, single-center cohort pilot study.

Setting

Tertiary care medical center.

Patients

Patients who presented for screening colonoscopy between 2008 and 2010 with an indication of family history of polyps.

Interventions

Obtain detailed history regarding patient's family history of polyps, including which family member, age of family member at diagnosis, size, type and number of polyps found.

Main Outcome Measurements

Knowledge of family history.

Results

Seventy-three patients were included in the study. Their knowledge of their family histories of polyps showed the following: 23.2% (17/73; 95% CI, 14%-35%) did not know which family member had polyps, 42.5% (31/73; 95% CI, 31%-55%) did not know the age at diagnosis, 71.2% (52/73; 95% CI, 59%-81%) did not know the polyp type, 90.4% (66/73; 95% CI, 81%-96%) did not know the number of polyps found, and 97.3% (71/73; 95% CI, 90%-100%) did not know the polyp size.

Limitations

Retrospective study at a single tertiary referral center.

Conclusions

Patients' knowledge regarding the details of their family histories of polyp data appears often unknown or incomplete. Thus, at present, it may not appear feasible or practical to incorporate this level of information in colon cancer screening guidelines.

### Delphi initiative for early-onset colorectal cancer (DIRECt) international management guidelines [^2d456df2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

R.1: Comment.

Family history of cancer should include all cancer diagnoses to identify hereditary syndromes (implicated in 13% of eoCRC), as well as to quantify risk for non-syndromic familial CRC. About 28% of patients with eoCRC have a family history of CRC, which is not significantly different compared with the loCRC population. Individuals with a family history of CRC should undergo more intensive surveillance than the general population, starting at an earlier age. However, definitions of who should undergo more intensive surveillance vary widely by country. There is a consensus that having at least 2 first-degree relatives with CRC and/or at least 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC before the age of 50–60 years are associated with a significant increase in risk for CRC. In these situations, screening colonoscopy starting at 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative) is usually recommended. A recent study showed that up to 16% of eoCRC could be preventedif colonoscopy was performed at the age recommended by guidelines based on family history.–

Validated risk assessment tools can facilitate family history taking and identification of patients who would benefit from germline genetic testing, such as the Colon Cancer Risk Assessment Tool and the PREMM 5, The PREMM 5 tool can be used to determine the likelihood of a pathogenic variant (PV)/likely pathogenic variant (LPV) in a Lynch syndrome (LS) gene. However, it is recommended that all patients with eoCRC should undergo multigene germline panel testing, regardless of the results of risk assessment tools (see G.1).

The systematic review found 6 studies evaluating the prevalence of a family history of CRC among individuals with eoCRC, 3 of whom had LE 2b, and they all concluded that there was a strong predisposition for having a family history of CRC among younger patients. Five studies evaluated the clinical outcomes of taking family histories, with 2 studies having LE 1a, and they all concluded that a family history of CRC increases the risk of eoCRC.

### Increased risk of colorectal neoplasia among family members of patients with colorectal cancer: a population-based study in Utah [^794a717e]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently develops in multiple members of the same families, but more data are needed to prepare effective screening guidelines. We quantified the risk of CRC and adenomas in first-degree relatives (FDRs) and second-degree relatives and first cousins of individuals with CRC, and stratified risk based on age at cancer diagnosis.

Methods

We performed a case-control study of Utah residents, 50–80 years old, who underwent colonoscopy from 1995 through 2009. Index cases (exposed to colonoscopy) were colonoscopy patients with a CRC diagnosis. Age- and sex-matched individuals, unexposed to colonoscopy (controls) were selected to form the comparison groups for determining risk in relatives. Colonoscopy results were linked to cancer and pedigree information from the Utah Population Database to investigate familial aggregation of colorectal neoplasia using Cox regression analysis.

Results

Of 126,936 patients who underwent a colonoscopy, 3804 were diagnosed with CRC and defined the index cases. FDRs had an increased risk of CRC (hazard rate ratio [HRR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59–2.03), as did second-degree relatives (HRR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19–1.47) and first cousins (HRR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07–1.25), compared with relatives of controls. This risk was greater for FDRs when index patients developed CRC at younger than age 60 years (HRR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.70–2.63), compared with older than age 60 years (HRR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.58–1.99). The risk of adenomas (HRR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.66–2.00) and adenomas with villous histology (HRR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.96–3.01) also were increased in FDRs. Three percent of CRCs in FDRs would have been missed if the current guidelines, which stratify screening recommendations by the age of the proband, were strictly followed.

Conclusions

FDRs, second-degree relatives, and first cousins of patients who undergo colonoscopy and are found to have CRC have a significant increase in the risk of colorectal neoplasia. These data should be considered when establishing CRC screening guidelines for individuals and families.

### Faecal immunochemical test accuracy in patients referred for surveillance colonoscopy: a multi-centre cohort study [^d7f2e878]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population and study design

All consecutive patients scheduled for elective colonoscopy from June 2006 to October 2009 at one of the five participating hospitals, were invited to participate in the original study. Details of study design and of most materials and methods relevant for this study have been published previously. In addition to the original study protocol in which subjects were asked to provide one FIT, we extended the protocol by asking for a second FIT sample before colonoscopy in the final 15 months of inclusion (June 2008 to October 2009). For the present study, all asymptomatic patients with a personal history of adenomas/CRC or asymptomatic individuals with a family history of CRC who underwent complete colonoscopy and who performed at least one FIT were analyzed retrospectively. In all centres, local Medical Ethics Review Board approval was obtained prior to the start of the study.

All eligible individuals were asked to provide one or two FITs on stool from one or two bowel movements prior to colonoscopy. Exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Study flow diagram.

All medical files were assessed to evaluate the time interval since prior colonoscopy, previous presence of advanced neoplasia, cumulative number, size and histology of polyps detected at previous colonoscopies, and a self-reported two-generation family history of CRC. A significant family history of CRC was defined as one first-degree relative with CRC diagnosis under the age of 60 years or with more than one first-degree relative with CRC of any age. A non-significant family history was defined as one first-degree relative older than 60 years with a CRC diagnosis or second-degree relatives with a CRC diagnosis.

### Effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing the risk of death from right and left colon cancer: a large community-based study [^14390aa1]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This was a nested case–control study conducted in a large, racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse historical cohort of members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and Southern California (KPSC) healthcare systems. We used electronic and medical record-based clinical information linked to data from tumour and vital status registries to identify screening-eligible people in the underlying population and evaluate patients' clinical histories over a period of up to 10 years. Details of the study design have been described previously. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at KPNC, KPSC and the University of Pennsylvania.

Study subjects

We included health plan members who were 55–90 years old between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2012 and had ≥ 5 years of enrolment prior to their reference date, which was the diagnosis date for each patient who died of colorectal cancer that was used to ascertain patient eligibility and exposure status (figure 1). In KPSC, cases were accrued in the 2011 and 2012 calendar years because this site was added later in the study. Because our interest was in people at average-risk for colorectal cancer, we excluded those with IBD; colorectal cancer in ≥ 1 first-degree relatives before age 50, or ≥ 2 first-degree or second-degree relatives at any age; or familial colorectal cancer syndromes. We also excluded those who had GI cancer or colectomy before the reference date.

### Longer interval between first colonoscopy with negative findings for colorectal cancer and repeat colonoscopy [^db221fd6]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

For individuals without a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC), colonoscopy screening every 10 years is recommended to reduce CRC incidence and mortality. However, debate exists about whether and for how long this 10-year interval could be safely expanded.

Objective

To assess how many years after a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC a second colonoscopy can be performed.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study leveraged Swedish nationwide register-based data to examine CRC diagnoses and CRC-specific mortality among individuals without a family history of CRC. The exposed group included individuals who had a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC at age 45 to 69 years between 1990 and 2016. The control group included individuals matched by sex, birth year, and baseline age (ie, the age of their matched exposed individual when the exposed individual's first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC was performed). Individuals in the control group either did not have a colonoscopy during the follow-up or underwent colonoscopy that resulted in a CRC diagnosis. Up to 18 controls were matched with each exposed individual. Individuals were followed up from 1990 to 2018, and data were analyzed from November 2022 to November 2023.

Exposure

A first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC, defined as a first colonoscopy without a diagnosis of colorectal polyp, adenoma, carcinoma in situ, or CRC before or within 6 months after screening.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were CRC diagnosis and CRC-specific death. The 10-year standardized incidence ratio and standardized mortality ratio were calculated to compare risks of CRC and CRC-specific death in the exposed and control groups based on different follow-up screening intervals.

Results

The sample included 110 074 individuals (65 147 females [59.2%]) in the exposed group and 1 981 332 (1 172 646 females [59.2%]) in the control group. The median (IQR) age for individuals in both groups was 59 (52–64) years. During up to 29 years of follow-up of individuals with a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC, 484 incident CRCs and 112 CRC-specific deaths occurred. After a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC, the risks of CRC and CRC-specific death in the exposed group were significantly lower than those in their matched controls for 15 years. At 15 years after a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC, the 10-year standardized incidence ratio was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54–0.94) and the 10-year standardized mortality ratio was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29–0.94). In other words, the 10-year cumulative risk of CRC in year 15 in the exposed group was 72% that of the 10-year cumulative risk of CRC in the control group. Extending the colonoscopy screening interval from 10 to 15 years in individuals with a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC could miss the early detection of only 2 CRC cases and the prevention of 1 CRC-specific death per 1000 individuals, while potentially avoiding 1000 colonoscopies.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that for the population without a family history of CRC, the 10-year interval between colonoscopy screenings for individuals with a first colonoscopy with findings negative for CRC could potentially be extended to 15 years. A longer interval between colonoscopy screenings could be beneficial in avoiding unnecessary invasive examinations.

### Colon cancer screening and the end of life: is age just a number? [^229d954e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Age is the strongest risk factor for colorectal cancer. Although there is updated guidance for the age at which to start screening, there is little guidance for individuals or their medical teams on how to decide when to stop. Current recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other societies focus primarily on age. For patients older than 85 years, guidelines discourage screening because the harms largely outweigh benefits. Although at a population level, the overall benefit of screening in older individuals decreases, one must individualize the recommendation based on comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and gender-not solely base it on age. Patient and caregiver preferences must also be thoroughly explored.
