## Question

Spherocytosis inherited

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the inheritance of hereditary spherocytosis, including how to think about genetics, phenotype, diagnostic pitfalls, and counseling implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and epidemiology to anchor pretest probability. Then, I should verify the molecular basis and the major genes involved. Next, I will examine inheritance patterns and reconcile apparent discrepancies across sources. After that, I need to review genotype–phenotype correlations and their clinical implications. Then, I should consider diagnostic challenges and the role of genetic testing, especially in neonates and atypical cases. Finally, I will synthesize counseling and management considerations, including splenectomy and family screening, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline prevalence so I don't jump to conclusions. Hereditary spherocytosis is a congenital hemolytic anemia due to defects in red cell membrane proteins that cause loss of membrane surface area, reduced deformability, splenic sequestration, and hemolysis; prevalence is commonly cited around 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 in populations of Northern European ancestry, though estimates vary by region and ascertainment method, and it is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia in those populations [^111JJubt] [^111aYFFi] [^113LQ4oq].

> I need to check the molecular basis next. The principal proteins implicated are ankyrin-1 (ANK1), band 3 (SLC4A1), β-spectrin (SPTB), α-spectrin (SPTA1), and band 4.2 (EPB42). Defects in these proteins disrupt vertical membrane–cytoskeleton interactions, leading to membrane instability and spherocyte formation, with ANK1 and SPTB being the most frequently mutated in many cohorts, though relative frequencies vary by ancestry and ascertainment [^111JJubt] [^116cuM8J] [^117JzSyP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about inheritance without reconciling sources. Most classic summaries describe autosomal dominant transmission in roughly 70–75% of cases, with the remaining cases due to autosomal recessive inheritance or de novo mutations; however, some contemporary cohorts emphasize that a substantial minority lack a family history, reflecting recessive or de novo events, and a few reports frame non-dominant patterns as comprising about 25%, so I should present both perspectives and note that both can be correct depending on the cohort and ascertainment strategy [^113LQ4oq] [^111aYFFi] [^116xoD1m].

> Wait, let me verify the genotype–phenotype correlations because this affects counseling and management. Children with SLC4A1-associated HS tend to have the mildest phenotype with higher hemoglobin, lower reticulocyte counts, and rarely require childhood splenectomy, whereas autosomal recessive SPTA1-related HS often presents with severe hemolysis and early splenectomy; ANK1 and SPTB variants generally show intermediate severity, though within-gene variant type or location does not consistently predict severity, underscoring variable expressivity and the need for individualized assessment [^116cuM8J].

> I should double-check diagnostic challenges, especially in early infancy, because this is where missteps occur. In neonates and young infants, spherocytes may be absent or minimal on smear, splenomegaly is often not yet present, and osmotic fragility can be non-diagnostic; in such settings, a high index of suspicion plus genetic testing can be decisive, and the neonatal HS ratio (MCHC divided by MCV) can be a useful screening tool when available, though it is not universally available or validated across platforms [^114a1f2N] [^116kANqA] [^113EovH6].

> Let me consider the role of genetic testing more broadly so I don't overstate any single assay. Next-generation sequencing panels covering ANK1, SPTB, SPTA1, SLC4A1, and EPB42 improve diagnostic yield and are particularly helpful when the family history is negative, when neonatal morphology is atypical, or when transfusion confounds traditional tests; real-world programs report HS as the most common presumed diagnosis among hereditary hemolytic anemias identified by such panels, supporting their clinical utility when standard testing is inconclusive [^111H77xK] [^117RHi2p].

> But wait, what if the smear shows spherocytes — does that confirm HS? I need to ensure I exclude acquired causes of spherocytosis before labeling a case as hereditary. Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, transfusion reactions, and certain toxins or burns can produce spherocytes; a negative direct antiglobulin test and supportive family history strengthen the case for HS, but I should confirm with EMA binding or osmotic fragility when available and proceed to targeted genetic testing if the phenotype remains unexplained or if counseling is needed [^116gFRHJ] [^115DmKz2] [^113vRLZK].

> Next, I should review counseling and management implications, especially splenectomy. Historically, splenectomy is curative for hemolysis in HS, but contemporary guidance emphasizes delaying surgery until at least age 6 when feasible and balancing long-term risks such as overwhelming postsplenectomy infection and thrombosis; patients with mild disease often require no specific therapy beyond folate supplementation during hemolytic stress, while those with moderate to severe anemia or symptomatic splenomegaly may benefit from splenectomy after careful counseling and vaccination planning [^111JJubt] [^114T4r7Z] [^113vRLZK].

> I will now examine family screening and prenatal considerations, but I should confirm the scope. Once a pathogenic variant is identified in a proband, cascade testing of first-degree relatives is appropriate, and in severe phenotypes such as recessive SPTA1-related HS, prenatal diagnosis and coordinated perinatal management including fetal blood sampling and intrauterine transfusion may be lifesaving; conversely, in mild SLC4A1-associated disease, reassurance and anticipatory guidance may suffice [^112P1QaG] [^116cuM8J].

> Let me reconsider any lingering inconsistencies in inheritance percentages so I don't misstate them. While many summaries cite 70–75% autosomal dominant and 25% non-dominant or de novo, some cohorts show a higher proportion without a family history, reflecting ascertainment differences and population structure. I should therefore present both figures and emphasize that a negative family history does not exclude HS and should prompt genetic evaluation when clinical suspicion is high [^113LQ4oq] [^111aYFFi] [^116xoD1m].

> In summary, hereditary spherocytosis is a genetically heterogeneous red cell membranopathy with most cases due to ANK1 or SPTB variants and a majority following autosomal dominant transmission, yet a meaningful minority arise from recessive or de novo mutations. Phenotype spans mild, compensated hemolysis to severe transfusion-dependent anemia, with SLC4A1 variants tending to be mild and SPTA1 recessive cases often severe, and modern genetic testing resolves many diagnostic dilemmas, enabling accurate counseling and tailored management including judicious use of splenectomy and family cascade screening [^111JJubt] [^116cuM8J] [^117RHi2p].

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is inherited primarily as an **autosomal dominant** disorder [^111JJubt], with about 75% of patients having an affected parent and 50% risk to offspring [^111aYFFi]. Roughly 25% arise from **autosomal recessive** or de novo mutations, often with more severe phenotypes [^116cuM8J]. HS is caused by mutations in ANK1, SPTB, SPTA1, SLC4A1, or EPB42 [^111aYFFi], which disrupt the RBC membrane and cause spherocytes, hemolysis, and splenomegaly [^111JJubt]. Genetic counseling is essential for family planning and for identifying at-risk relatives [^111aYFFi].

---

## Genetic basis and inheritance patterns

HS is a **genetically heterogeneous disorder** caused by mutations in genes encoding RBC membrane proteins [^116xoD1m]:

| **Gene** | **Protein** | **Inheritance pattern** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ANK1 | Ankyrin-1 | Autosomal dominant | ~50% |
| SPTB | β-spectrin | Autosomal dominant | ~20% |
| SPTA1 | α-spectrin | Autosomal recessive (severe) | ~5% |
| SLC4A1 | Band 3 | Autosomal dominant (mild) | ~15% |
| EPB42 | Protein 4.2 | Autosomal recessive | ~10% |

---

Approximately **75% of HS cases are autosomal dominant**, typically with a 50% risk to offspring when one parent is affected [^111aYFFi]. About **25% are autosomal recessive or de novo**, often causing more severe disease and frequently lacking a family history [^116cuM8J].

---

## Clinical manifestations and severity

HS shows marked **clinical heterogeneity**, ranging from asymptomatic to severe transfusion-dependent anemia [^111JJubt]. Common features include:

- Anemia (mild to severe)
- Jaundice (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia)
- Splenomegaly
- Gallstones (cholelithiasis)
- Hemolytic crises (aplastic, hyperhemolytic, megaloblastic)

Severity correlates with the underlying mutation and degree of membrane protein deficiency; **SPTA1 mutations** often cause severe, transfusion-dependent anemia [^116cuM8J].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on clinical features, family history, and laboratory testing:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Normocytic or mildly macrocytic anemia, elevated MCHC, reticulocytosis [^113LQ4oq].
- **Peripheral smear**: Spherocytes, polychromasia [^113LQ4oq].
- **Osmotic fragility test**: Increased fragility [^1127bYd7].
- **EMA binding test**: Reduced membrane protein band 3 [^notfound].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies causative mutations, especially in atypical or severe cases [^111H77xK].

---

## Genetic counseling and family planning

Genetic counseling is essential for affected individuals and families to explain inheritance, assess recurrence risk, and discuss reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis. Carrier detection and **prenatal testing** are available for families with known mutations [^114sLq5i] [^1164zpXf].

---

## Management and treatment

Management is tailored to disease severity:

- **Supportive care**: Folic acid supplementation, monitoring for complications [^114T4r7Z].
- **Splenectomy**: Reserved for severe cases due to infection risk; partial splenectomy may be considered [^114T4r7Z].
- **Vaccinations**: Pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines pre-splenectomy [^notfound].
- **Transfusions**: For severe anemia or hemolytic crises [^111JJubt].

---

## Complications

HS can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Gallstones**: From chronic hemolysis and bilirubin deposition [^111JJubt].
- **Splenomegaly**: From increased RBC destruction [^111JJubt].
- **Hemolytic crises**: Aplastic, hyperhemolytic, or megaloblastic [^111JJubt].
- **Iron overload**: Especially after repeated transfusions or splenectomy [^notfound].

---

## Geographic and ethnic distribution

HS occurs worldwide, with higher prevalence in people of Northern European ancestry [^113LQ4oq]. It is less common in Asian and African populations, though cases are reported globally [^111aYFFi].

---

Hereditary spherocytosis is inherited primarily as an **autosomal dominant** disorder, with autosomal recessive and de novo cases accounting for a significant minority. Genetic counseling and testing are critical for accurate diagnosis, family planning, and management.

Disorders of the erythrocyte membrane, including hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis, comprise an important group of inherited hemolytic anemias. These syndromes are characterized by marked clinical and laboratory heterogeneity. Recent molecular studies have revealed that there is also significant genetic heterogeneity in these disorders. This is particularly true for the spherocytosis syndromes where each kindred has a private mutation in one of the spherocytosis genes. Treatment with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Splenectomy via a laparoscopic approach has become the surgical method of choice. Growing recognition and understanding of the long-term risks and complications of splenectomy, including cardiovascular disease, thrombotic disorders, and pulmonary hypertension, and the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a concern for infection in overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, have led to reevaluation of the role of splenectomy. Recent management guidelines acknowledge these important considerations when entertaining splenectomy and recommend detailed discussion between health care providers, patient, and family.

### Primaquine phosphate [^116ysrQR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemolytic Anemia

Hemolytic reactions (moderate to severe) may occur in individuals with G6PD deficiency and in individuals with a family or personal history of favism. Areas of high prevalence of G6PD deficiency are Africa, Southern Europe, Mediterranean region, Middle East, South-East Asia, and Oceania. People from these regions have a greater tendency to develop hemolytic anemia due to a congenital deficiency of erythrocytic G6PD while receiving primaquine and related drugs.

Due to the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, G6PD testing must be performed before using primaquine. Before initiating treatment, obtain baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit. In case of severe anemia, postpone the G6PD test and decision on treatment with primaquine until recovery.

Due to the limitations of G6PD tests, physicians need to be aware of residual risk of hemolysis and adequate medical support and follow-up to manage hemolytic risk should be available. This is of particular importance in individuals with a personal or family history of hemolytic anemia.

Patients with G6PD Deficiency

Primaquine phosphate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe G6PD deficiency (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In case of mild to moderate G6PD deficiency, a decision to prescribe primaquine must be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of using primaquine. If primaquine administration is considered, baseline hematocrit and hemoglobin must be checked before treatment and close hematological monitoring (e.g., at day 3 and 8) is required. Adequate medical support to manage hemolytic risk should be available.

Patients with Unknown G6PD Status

When the G6PD status is unknown and G6PD testing is not available, a decision to prescribe primaquine must be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of using primaquine. Risk factors for G6PD deficiency or favism must be assessed. Baseline hematocrit and hemoglobin must be checked before treatment and close hematological monitoring (e.g., at day 3 and 8) is required. Adequate medical support to manage hemolytic risk should be available.

Patients without G6PD Deficiency

In G6PD normal patients it is also advisable to perform routine blood examinations (particularly blood cell counts and hemoglobin determinations) during therapy.

Risk of Hemolysis with Other Drugs

Avoid the concurrent administration of hemolytic agents in all patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions). Warn patients to discontinue the use of Primaquine phosphate Tablets promptly if signs suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur (such as darkening of the urine, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, and fatigue) and to contact their healthcare professional immediately.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^111wtzm3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In general, microcytosis results from conditions that lead to a disruption of alpha or beta-globin-chain production. Most commonly, microcytosis is the result of decreased iron availability or an underlying inherited haemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The Mentzer index is one way of quickly discerning between thalassemia and iron-deficiency, with an MCV/RBC ratio < 13 suggesting thalassemia. In our patient, the value of 11.7 in conjunction with his iron studies was consistent with thalassemia.

Decreased iron availability may be due to an absolute lack of iron stores (ie, iron deficiency), or to a functional lack of available iron. A functional iron deficiency can manifest in the setting of a chronic inflammatory state where serum hepcidin levels are elevated or in the setting of sideroblastic anaemia. In this case, the patient's other comorbidities may have precipitated some chronic inflammation, though his erythrocyte sedimentation rate of only 13 mm/hour argues against an overwhelming inflammatory state.

The exact mechanism by which red blood cells become microcytic is not well documented. The predominant theory is that red blood cells stop dividing once they reach a certain concentration of intracellular haemoglobin. As the production of haemoglobin slows down, more divisions occur before this concentration is reached, resulting in smaller cells. For this reason, microcytosis serves as a loose indicator of decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and macrocytosis an indicator of decreased DNA production.

Diagnosing the aforementioned conditions is fairly standard, with evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, a complete CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate stores, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A bone marrow biopsy is required for identification of ringed sideroblasts in clinching the diagnosis of a sideroblastic anaemia. The haemoglobin electrophoresis is useful in cases of beta-thalassemia and certain cases of alpha-thalassemia (where 3 or 4 copies of the alpha-globin gene are defective resulting in the production of HbH). Alpha-globin and/or beta-globin gene sequencing can also be undertaken, though this is most often done as part of family planning when both parents are suspected of being carriers of a silent mutation.

### Hemolytic anemia [^115DmKz2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis – 2011 update [^113vRLZK]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines on hereditary spherocytosis (HS) published in 2004 (Bolton-Maggs et al, 2004) are here replaced to reflect changes in current opinion on the surgical management, (particularly the indications for concomitant splenectomy with cholecystectomy in children with mild HS, and concomitant cholecystectomy with splenectomy in those with asymptomatic gallstones). Further potential long term hazards of splenectomy are now recognised. Advances have been made in our understanding of the biochemistry of the red cell membrane which underpins the choice of tests. Biochemical assays of membranes proteins and genetic analysis may be indicated (rarely) to diagnose atypical cases. The diagnostic value of the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test has been validated in a number of studies with understanding of its limitations.

### The diagnostic challenge of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia: two cases of' CDA type II' [^112fKK9r]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias (CDAs) are a group of rare hereditary disorders characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis and morphological abnormalities in the erythroblasts. Patients may present with jaundice or with symptoms of anaemia, gall stones or iron overload. The diagnosis can be challenging and cases have been confused with haemolytic anaemia, haemochromatosis or a haemoglobinopathy. A delayed diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment or delayed management of iron overload. We present two patients previously diagnosed as CDA type II in whom the diagnosis was revised to CDA type I and to hereditary spherocytosis. The conditions are compared and the approach to diagnosis is discussed.

### Hereditary anemia caused by multilocus inheritance of, andmutations: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^115SsJEQ]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders encompass a vast group of hemolytic anemias that differ widely in their clinical, morphologic, laboratory, and molecular features. Subtypes include (i) RBC disorders caused by altered membrane structural organization and (ii) RBC disorders caused by altered membrane transport function. The most common anemia among the first group is hereditary spherocytosis (HS), with a prevalence from 1:2000 to 1:5000 births. HS manifests clinically as hemolytic anemia with jaundice, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly, and cholelithiasis. Five genes encoding cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins are most commonly associated with HS: ankyrin-1 (ANK1, 8p11.21), erythrocytic α- and β-spectrin chains (SPTA1, 1q21; SPTB, 14q23.3), band 3 anion transport protein (SLC4A1, 17q21.31), and erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 (EPB42, 15q15-q21).2 Disorders of altered membrane transport function include a wide spectrum of hemolytic disorders in which the erythrocyte membrane cation permeability is altered, with dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) the most frequently encountered. The prevalence of DHS remains uncertain, as this disease is often misdiagnosed.DHS exhibits alterations of RBC membrane permeability to monovalent cations Na + and K +, with consequent alterations of intracellular cation, water content, and cell volume. Patients present with hemolytic anemia, typically macrocytic, with increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), high reticulocyte count, and jaundice. Blood films may show stomatocytes, usually < 10% of total erythrocytes. Splenectomy is contraindicated in patients affected by DHS due to the risk of severe thrombotic events. The two causative genes of DHS are PIEZO1 (16q24.3) for DHS type 1 (DHS1) and KCNN4 (19q13.31) for DHS type 2. DHS is also frequently associated with iron overload, which frequently leads to hepatosiderosis. Indeed, recent findings highlight a role for PIEZO1 in the regulation of iron metabolism.DHS patients can exhibit hyperferritinemia (and even life-threatening hemosiderosis) accompanied by very low values of plasma hepcidin. Overexpression and pharmacological activation of the R2456H and R2488Q PIEZO1 gain-of-function (GoF) mutants in hepatoma cell lines induced decreased expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene, HAMP.PIEZO1 involvement in iron metabolism was further confirmed in constitutive and in macrophage-specific transgenic PIEZO1 GoF mice. By 1 year of age, these mice develop severe hepatic hemosiderosis with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, accompanied by increased erythrophagocytosis, erythropoiesis, and erythroferrone expression.

### Identification of new mutations in patients with hereditary spherocytosis by next-generation sequencing [^117JzSyP]. Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear, hemolysis, splenomegaly, jaundice, and gallstones. To date, mutations in at least five genes (ANK1, EPB42, SLC4A1, SPTA1, and SPTB) have been found to be associated with different subtypes of HS. Here, we aim to investigate the presence of novel as well as known mutations in 35 Chinese patients with clinically suspected HS. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has identified 3 patients with SLC4A1, 16 patients with ANK1, and 16 patients with SPTB mutations, including 5 splicing, 12 nonsense, 9 frameshift, 7 missense, and 1 start-loss mutation, indicating that SPTB and ANK1 are the most frequently mutated genes in Chinese HS patients. Among 34 mutations identified, 21 were novel. Most of SPTB and ANK1 mutations were nonsense (8/16) and frameshift (6/16) mutations. By trio analysis of eight families we have confirmed six de novo mutations. In addition, genotype-phenotype analysis was also performed by comparing clinical manifestations among three groups of patients with SPTB, ANK1, and SLC4A1 mutations. It revealed that patients with ANK1 mutations had a significantly higher level of MCV and MCH but lower percentage of spherocytes compared with those carrying SPTB mutations. In conclusion, our results suggested that molecular diagnosis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a fast, economic, and accurate way to detect and identify pathogenic alterations of inherited diseases, highlighting the potential usage of NGS in clinical practice.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^114jZJTV]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

### Mimicry of inherited red cell disorders: the result of somatic mutations in a clonal myeloid disease [^116KhV7j]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

The hematopathologist and hematological oncologist should consider acquired syndromes described here when alterations of the genes and/or chromosome loci noted in Table 1 occur in association with a chronic myeloid neoplasm or when the red cell morphology has features that are unusual, such as a heightened frequency or dominance of ovalocytes or spherocytes.

Table 1.
Somatic mutations in chronic myeloid neoplasms leading to acquired red cell syndromes simulating germline mutations.

A clonal myeloid disease, especially a myelodysplastic syndrome, may also result in a profound disorder of erythropoiesis that leads to "red cell anarchy". The latter is defined by an exaggerated combination of anisocytosis, anisochromia and poikilocytosis. Red cell anisocytosis (elevated red cell distribution width) predicts for a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemiaand in myelodysplastic syndrome. Elevated red cell distribution width is also a risk factor for progression of age-related clonal hematopoiesis in otherwise healthy persons to acute myelogenous leukemia.

Screening justification criteria — general principles for deciding when screening is warranted emphasize that the condition should be an important health problem; management should differ by positive vs negative test; the condition should have an understood natural history with a latent or early symptomatic stage; there should be an effective treatment/prevention that improves outcomes if applied before clinical presentation; outcome improvements from management based on screening should outweigh harms of screening; there should be high- or moderate-quality evidence for sufficient test accuracy; and screening should be cost-effective, acceptable to patients, and feasible to implement.

### Clinical utility of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of hereditary haemolytic anaemias [^111H77xK]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemolytic anaemias are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders characterized by increased red cell destruction, with consequences ranging from innocuous to severe life-threatening anaemia. Diagnostic laboratories endeavour to assist clinicians reach the exact patient diagnosis by using tests principally based on morphological and biochemical techniques. However, these routine studies may be inconclusive, particularly in newborn infants and when transfusions have recently been administered. Large numbers and size of the potentially involved genes also impose a practical challenge for molecular diagnosis using routine sequencing approaches. To overcome these diagnostic shortcomings, we have utilized next-generation sequencing to provide a high-throughput, highly sensitive assay. We developed a panel interrogating 28 genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes with sequencing coverage of the coding regions, splice site junctions, deep intronic and regulatory regions. We then evaluated 19 samples, including infants with unexplained extreme hyperbilirubinaemia and patients with transfusion-dependent haemolytic anaemia. Where possible, inheritance patterns of pathogenic mutations were determined by sequencing of immediate relatives. We conclude that this next-generation sequencing panel could be a cost-effective approach to molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemolytic anaemia, especially when the family history is uninformative or when routine laboratory testing fails to identify the causative haemolytic process.

### Identification of a novel heterozygous SPTB mutation by whole genome sequencing in a Chinese patient with hereditary spherocytosis and atrial septal defect: a case report [^117EdRx5]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Similar to patients with other hemolytic anemia types, HS cases are subject to various problems such as severe splenomegaly with or without gallbladder disease. In this report, the proband showed hepatosplenomegaly. Splenectomy is a very effective treatment for reducing hemolysis, leading to significantly prolonged red cell lifespan. However, it should be performed only after careful risk-benefit assessment. The current patient was 3 years old, and it is not recommended to perform splenectomy before cardiac surgery since the immune function should be maintained. Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with ASD. Patients with concurrent ASD and HS are rare. To the best of our knowledge, only four such cases have been reported. Percutaneous transcatheter closure for ASD was performed to avoid potential risk of hemolytic anemia.

HS diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion often including a family history and confirmatory blood test. However, about 25% of patients have a negative family history, which will increase the difficulty of HS diagnosis. Confirming hereditary RBC membrane disorders at the molecular level using next-generation sequencing is important for HS diagnosis, clinical management as well as genetic counseling. WGS enables the screening of all coding regions and deep intronic variants usually causing disease. In this study, a novel SPTB mutation responsible for HS was successfully detected using WGS in a Chinese patient. These results expand the spectrum of SPTB mutations, providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in HS and confirming WGS as an effective method for identifying novel pathogenic mutations.

HBB and hemoglobinopathies

Rare variants in HBB cause the recessive hemoglobinopathy β-thalassemia major, which is quite severe and presents early in life. The statistically significant, dominant association between HBB rare variants and hemoglobinopathies and the high PPV (0.55, Table 3) found in our cohorts are driven by a mixture of some individuals who may have β-thalassemia intermedia, a less severe form of the disease that is sometimes inherited in a dominant fashion, and many individuals with β-thalassemia minor, who are generally asymptomatic but often have mild anemia.

Individuals with β-thalassemia minor are often misdiagnosed as having iron deficiency anemia. In our study, 30% of HBB LoF heterozygotes with a thalassemia diagnosis and 16% of heterozygotes without a thalassemia diagnosis had a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, driving a statistically significant association with this trait (Table S1; compared to only 6% of those without a HBB LoF variant). Furthermore, 12% of HBB LoF heterozygotes reported taking iron supplements, compared to 3% of those without HBB LoF variants. Medical records indicated hemochromatosis in 1.6% of HBB LoF heterozygotes vs. 0.4% of those without HBB LoF variants, 2.4% vs. 0.007% had hepatic fibrosis, and 2.2% vs. 0.3% had nonalcoholic cirrhosis, indicating that complications of iron overload can be a concern for HBB LoF heterozygotes. Additionally, the bloodwork available for members of these cohorts showed that 100% of the HBB LoF heterozygotes, regardless of thalassemia diagnosis status, had red blood cell (RBC) microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 μm; compared to 6% of those without LoF variants), indicating that many individuals with β-thalassemia minor may remain undiagnosed in these cohorts. For individuals with β-thalassemia intermedia, common complications include extensive iron overload in many tissues through increased intestinal absorption, as well as marked and progressive osteoporosis. Not only can the diagnosis of thalassemia be directly confirmed via blood tests, but many screenings and treatments also exist to avoid or mitigate the phenotypic complications, including bone density scans, blood tests to assess iron overload, blood transfusions, splenectomy, folic acid supplementation, and iron chelation therapies. Early detection of HBB LoF heterozygotes is useful for reproductive planning and for helping physicians tailor treatment when considering the cause of the patient's anemia. In our study, only 29% of cases with HBB LoF variants with age of diagnosis available had been diagnosed as children, indicating that genetic screening of adults for this condition may be warranted.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1156aciG]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 4

A 60-year-old woman with a history of CKD, hypertension, and fibromyalgia was referred for anemia and left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain that started during a trip to Denver, Colorado, a month ago. She recalled having intermittent pain in her legs and back every few years since childhood. As no cause had been found, fibromyalgia had been diagnosed. A few days after her trip, the LUQ pain started to improve but she had ongoing fatigue. For anemia, she had been prescribed oral iron therapy intermittently for the past 30 years. She had no family history of blood disorders.

Her hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dL; hematocrit, 24%; MCV, 75 fL; platelets, 132 × 10⁹/L; WBC, 8.6 × 10⁹/L; and reticulocyte count, 94.0 × 10⁹/L.

Peripheral smear showed target cells and dense rectangular crystals.

Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed progressive splenic atrophy with areas of heterogeneous low attenuation, likely representing evolving infarcts.

Given splenic infarcts, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed showing S, 54%; C, 44%; and A2, 2% consistent with a diagnosis of hemoglobin sickle cell disease (SCD).

Screening for SCD complications revealed a urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio of 339.8 mg/g (reference, < 30 mg albumin/1 g creatinine), eGFR of 29 mL/min per 1.73 m², and creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL (reference, 0.4–1.0 mg/dL), concerning for sickle cell nephropathy.

Her iron was 39 μg/dL; ferritin, 268 ng/mL; TIBC, 218 μg/dL; TSAT, 18%; and LDH, 402 U/L.

### Hereditary spherocytosis… [^114ZAJNy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a rare disease amenable to cure. About two in 10, 000 persons in the northern part of United States are affected by the hemolytic process, which is usually transmitted by an affected parent to half of his children. The defect, although not completely understood, is manifest in the abnormally rounded erythrocyte which the spleen traps and destroys preferentially. In most cases the increased rate of cell destruction can be compensated by expansion of the bone marrow, and splenectomy stops hemolysis, although the spherocytes remain. Hereditary spherocytosis is often unrecognized by the physician and the family. In kinships in which spherocytosis has not been recognized, more than 90% of the affected family members give no history of the condition. If one or more members of the family is known to have the disease, less than half of the remaining affected family members give a positive history. Unless the. HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS. JAMA.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management, based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs). Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories. Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^116kANqA]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) results from defects in erythrocyte membrane proteins characterized by hemolysis, anemia, jaundice, gallstones and splenomegaly. The severity depends on rate of hemolysis, degree of compensation of anemia by reticulocytosis. The clinical manifestations vary widely, ranging from nearly asymptomatic to transfusion-dependent or severe life-threatening anemia. In the neonatal period, the major clinical manifestations are jaundice and anemia. Splenomegaly and spherocytes are rarely observed. Therefore, it's difficult to diagnose in neonates. Even during the first year of life, approximately 34% affected infants are diagnosed.

Previous researches have shown that mutations in ANK1 (ankyrin 1), SPTB (spectrin, beta, erythrocytic), SPTA1 (spectrin alpha, erythrocytic 1), SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4, member 1, or band 3), and EPB42 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2) are associated with HS. The mutations of these genes lead to the normally double-concave disc-shaped red cells become spherical, fragile red cells. ANK1 located on 8p11.21, its mutations include nonsense, splicing or frameshift and affect about half of patients with HS.

In most cases, HS is usually diagnosed on the basis of a positive family history, increased osmotic fragility, hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly and spherocytes on peripheral blood smears. The neonatal HS ratio which is calculated by dividing the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) provides valuable information for the physicians. In the index infant, the ratio was > 0.36, which points towards a diagnosis of HS (97% sensitivity, 99% specificity). However, mild or atypical cases are difficult to identify because of the limitations of the classical approaches. It has been reported that approximately 10% patients of HS may be misdiagnosed due to the lack of the typical sphere-shaped erythrocytes in the peripheral blood.

In this report, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze a Chinese family with an infant with unknown causes of hemolysis, and we identified a de novo ANK1 mutation responsible for HS.

### The diagnostic dilemma of congenital unstable hemoglobinopathies [^111ejCYa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Unstable hemoglobin variants represent a rare etiology of congenital hemolytic anemia. Without a high index of suspicion, plus proper laboratory testing and interpretation, the correct diagnosis can be elusive. We report on five children who were initially thought to have other congenital disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia, before β-globin gene sequencing led to the definitive diagnosis. Recognizing the variable clinical presentation and laboratory data reported will aid clinicians in diagnosis of unstable hemoglobins variants in children with atypical forms of hemolytic anemia, particularly those with low pulse oximetry values or whose hemoglobin electrophoresis suggest β-thalassemia trait.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

### Use of capillary blood to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis [^1127bYd7]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

We studied 31 children with hemolytic anemia, or with positive family history for hereditary spherocytosis (HS), to assess the reliability of capillary blood samples for the diagnosis. HS was diagnosed in 20 patients. Cryohemolysis (CH) was positive in 94% and eosin-5'-maleimide flow cytometry in 90% of them, whereas flow cytometric osmotic fragility was positive in 94%. Capillary blood sampling showed to be useful for the diagnosis. Simultaneous use of these three tests allows confirming diagnosis in 100% of patients. The use of very small blood volumes (300µl) allows an earlier diagnosis in neonates and small infants.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### A neonate with coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice with spherocytes but normal erythrocyte indices: a rare case of autosomal-recessive hereditary spherocytosis due to α-spectrin deficiency [^113EovH6]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in a newborn infant is generally made on the basis of a positive family history, spherocytes on blood film and Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice of variable severity with an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). In general, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) quantification of erythrocyte membrane proteins is not needed to make the clinical diagnosis of HS. However, we observed that a neonate with no family history of HS, but with abundant spherocytosis on repeated blood films, Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice and normal MCHC and MCV measurements, where SDS-PAGE revealed alpha-spectrin deficiency, a rare autosomal-recessive variety of HS that generally has a severe clinical phenotype.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Diagnosis and clinical relevance of co-inheritance of haemoglobin D-punjab / β +-thalassemia traits in an immigrant Afghan family [^1164zpXf]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

In many countries with high carrier rates, nationwide screening programmes for the hemoglobinopathies have been established. In 2014, a pan-European expert consensus recommended newborn screening in Europe to target only sickle cell disease, that is, Hb S. In previously non-endemic countries with high rates of multi-ethnic immigration antenatal screening programmes may be absent. In these countries, primary care professionals can play an important role in the identification of individuals and families at risk by detailed family medical history taking and by offering screening and genetic counselling. A high index of suspicion is required to differentiate between thalassemias and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), especially when microcytic anaemia is accompanied by normal iron studies. Many mathematical indices have been used to discriminate thalassemia trait from IDA (eg, Mentzer's index that suggests mean corpuscular volume/red blood cell < 13 for thalassemia and > 14 for IDA). A meta-analysis found that although these indices lack diagnostic accuracy to confirm thalassemia, they are valuable for the identification of subjects in whom further diagnostic testing is indicated, especially when combined with other factors, such as age, ethnicity or family history. In resource limited countries with high prevalence of thalassemias, red cell osmotic fragility testing is used for population screening. For the NESTROFT test we used, Singh et al reported 97.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity for the detection of β-thalassemia trait. As stated above, modern laboratories use red cell morphology and automated high-throughput methods for the routine diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies.

Molecular diagnosis of hereditary Hb disorders is only mandatory for antenatal diagnosis. It can further be employed for confirmation, prognosis or treatment of putative haemoglobinopathies that may harm the patient or his/her offspring, or as was done in this case series, for a phenotype–genotype correlation.

### Molecular heterogeneity of pyruvate kinase deficiency [^1179xSfJ]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency

The diagnostic workup for PK deficiency is based on the patient's personal and family medical history and clinical examination, and on several laboratory investigations, including the spectrophotometric assay of red blood cell PK activity. Molecular analysis of the PKLR gene is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, and overcomes the limitations of the enzymatic test, which may give false positive results in the case of heterozygous carriers, or false negative results in the case of recent transfusion, or an increased number of reticulocytes. Therefore, recently published guidelines and recommendations conclude that enzyme analyses and DNA studies are complementary techniques for diagnosing PK deficiency.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, the PKLR gene is usually included in panels designed for diagnosing hereditary hemolytic anemias, allowing detection of an increasing number of cases, thus reducing misdiagnosis, and highlighting the extreme phenotypic variability of PK deficiency(Table 1).

### Identification of a novel heterozygous SPTB mutation by whole genome sequencing in a Chinese patient with hereditary spherocytosis and atrial septal defect: a case report [^116xoD1m]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorder characterized by an abnormal increase of spherocytes in peripheral blood. HS occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and its prevalence in China is about 1.27–1.49 per 100,000 individuals. The HS clinical spectrum ranges broadly from a nearly asymptomatic disease to life-threatening anemia, serious splenomegaly, and/or severe hyperbilirubinemia, even in the same family. About 70% of HS cases are associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, although non-dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance have been described.

HS is mostly characterized by sphere-shaped erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear resulting from qualitative and/or quantitative abnormalities of RBC membrane proteins, which are basically caused by mutations in the corresponding genes. Current evidence indicates that mutations in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1; about 50%), spectrin-β, erythrocytic (SPTB; approximately 20%), solute carrier family 4, member 1 (SLC4A 1; about 15%), erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 (EPB42; 10%) and spectrin-ɑ, erythrocytic 1 (SPTA1; 5%) are associated with membrane defects in HS.

Although SPTB mutations mostly cause HS, only few HS families with such mutations have been reported in the Chinese population. Here, we identified a novel SPTB frameshift mutation responsible for HS in a Chinese family by whole genome sequencing (WGS).

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency: 2015 status report [^114frM4K]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Table 1
Framework for Diagnostic Testing for Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency

Patients with PKD have a variable laboratory phenotype ranging from mild anemia to transfusion dependent hemolysis. In a prior report of 61 patients, the median pre‐splenectomy hemoglobin was 9.8 g/dl with a range of 2.2‐14.4 g/dl 23. The reticulocyte count is increased but is not necessarily proportional to the severity of hemolysis. Moreover, since reticulocytes are preferentially sequestered in the spleen, splenectomy paradoxically causes a rise in both hemoglobin and reticulocytes 2, 24. Indirect bilirubin is typically increased and usually persists after splenectomy 23. Red cell morphology can be variable, including the presence of echinocytes, but may also be normal (Fig. 2). Zanella et al. have previously described a framework for categorizing patients by clinical severity (Table 2).

Figure 2
Blood smear findings in a transfusion dependent patient with pyruvate kinase deficiency before splenectomy (Figure 2 A) and after splenectomy when no longer requiring red cell transfusions (Figure 2 B). The red cell findings before splenectomy are mild, whereas, after splenectomy, polychromasia is more prominent and the characteristic echinocytes are more pronounced. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at.]

Table 2
Categorization of Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Severity by Laboratory Findings and Transfusion Patterns

Although multiple reports describe a genotype‐phenotype relationship, the clinical manifestations of PKD vary depending on many other factors including the patient's genetic background, presence of other red cell abnormalities, and differences in splenic function 23, 25. These findings are most readily noted in the variability among members of the same family with identical genotypes.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis [^114T4r7Z]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defects and mode of inheritance. It is relatively common in Caucasian populations; most affected individuals have mild or only moderate haemolysis. There is usually a family history, and a typical clinical and laboratory picture so that the diagnosis is often easily made without additional laboratory tests. Atypical cases may require measurement of erythrocyte membrane proteins to clarify the nature of the membrane disorder and in the absence of a family history, occasionally molecular genetic analysis will help to determine whether inheritance is recessive or non-dominant. It is particularly important to rule out stomatocytosis where splenectomy is contraindicated because of the thrombotic risk. Mild HS can be managed without folate supplements and does not require splenectomy. Moderately and severely affected individuals are likely to benefit from splenectomy, which should be performed after the age of 6 years and with appropriate counselling about the infection risk. In all cases careful dialogue between doctor, patient and the family is essential. Laparoscopic surgery, when performed by experienced surgeons, can result in a shorter hospital stay and less pain.

### Challenging diagnosis of spherocytosis in early infancy [^114a1f2N]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This case report describes an infant who presented to the emergency department with rhinorrhoea and severe mucocutaneous pallor. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anaemia with reticulocytosis and a peripheral blood smear suggestive of peripheral red blood cell (RBC) destruction, although without the presence of spherocytes. Despite the absence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, the clinical evaluation, including family history, led to the consideration of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). The diagnosis was confirmed through genetic testing, revealing a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the ANK1 gene, associated with HS. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of HS, particularly in the early infancy, and highlights the importance of genetic panels in cases of unexplained haemolytic anaemia.

TABLE 1
Genetic diagnostic outcomes in patients who underwent NGS testing.

FIGURE 1
Distribution of genetic diagnoses, a excluding GS, among diagnosed patients (A) and distribution of presumed clinical diagnoses, b excluding GS, among diagnosed patients (B). a A genetic diagnosis was classified by the identification of (1) homozygous/hemizygous P/LP variants; or (2) two P/LP variants (without successive confirmation of the variants being on opposite chromosome [in‐trans]) for autosomal/X‐linked recessive conditions; or (3) heterozygous P/LP variants for autosomal dominant conditions. b Individuals were given a presumed clinical diagnosis of the condition if they had a genetic diagnosis in the respective genes appropriate for diagnosis, as per the genotype/phenotype correlation. AK1, adenylate kinase 1 deficiency; CDA, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia; DBA, Diamond–Blackfan anaemia; G6PD, glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; GS, Gilbert's syndrome; HE, hereditary elliptocytosis; HPP, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis; HS, hereditary spherocytosis; PK, pyruvate kinase; P/LP, pathogenic/likely pathogenic; SA, sideroblastic anaemia.

While a comprehensive assessment of the clinical utility of NGS testing was limited due to insufficient clinical data, which hindered the ability to correlate genetic findings with clinical presentations, presumed clinical diagnoses were evaluated based on known gene–disease associations (Table S1). Special consideration for inferring genotype–phenotype correlation was applied for patients with molecular findings in the SPTA1 and SPTB genes (Appendix S4).

The most common presumed clinical diagnoses were hereditary spherocytosis (51.3%), G6PD deficiency (17.1%) and pyruvate kinase deficiency (9.0%). Together, these conditions accounted for 77.4% of all presumed clinical diagnoses (Figure 1B). A presumed clinical diagnosis of GS was identified in 14.4% of those tested (see Appendix S3 for further details).

### Hereditary spherocytosis… [^116d6th3]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Hereditary spherocytosis is the most common red cell membrane disorder. Morphologically, spherocytes are rounded red cells that have lost the ability to change shape. Chronic hemolysis is the hallmark of HS. In most individuals, the condition is mild and requires no specific therapy. In severe cases, it results in severe anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. Splenectomy sometimes is recommended as therapy for severe cases and can result in amelioration of the disease. Patients who have undergone splenectomy are at increased risk for infections with encapsulated bacteria. Appropriate counseling and management of fever are essential to minimize the risk of sepsis in postsplenectomy patients. HS was described initially in 1871. It is found in increased numbers among persons of northern European descent. The incidence of HS is estimated to be 1 in 5, 000 in the United States. Most cases are inherited in. Comments

Recommendation strength — strong recommendation is defined within this guideline as a strong recommendation ("the guideline panel recommends… ") and is interpreted across stakeholders as follows. For patients, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not. For clinicians, most individuals should follow the recommended course of action and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. For policy makers, the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. For researchers, the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation, and on occasion a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence and further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations.

### New challenges in evaluating anemia in older persons in the era of molecular testing [^1173kyTL]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in older persons, and often remains unexplained despite a thorough clinical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory testing, including marrow aspiration, biopsy, and karyotyping. The advent of molecular genetic testing panels in hematology clinical practice has complicated the evaluation of older patients with unexplained anemia. While the presence of a somatic mutation provides evidence of clonal hematopoiesis and may support a diagnosis of a hematologic neoplasm such as one of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), with rare exceptions, individual mutations are not strongly associated with one specific diagnosis, nor are they by themselves diagnostic of neoplasia. A clonal mutation in a patient with cytopenias and a nondiagnostic bone marrow may indicate a syndrome with a similar natural history to MDS, but at present there are no clear criteria to distinguish cytopenias coincidentally seen in association with an unrelated clonal mutation from cytopenias that are directly caused by that mutation. Ongoing and planned analyses will help define when mutation patterns alone can identify a disorder equivalent to a morphologically defined myeloid neoplasm such as MDS, further clarifying the etiology and natural history of unexplained anemia in the elderly.

### Hereditary spherocytosis [^111JJubt]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a common inherited disorder that is characterised by anaemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. It is reported worldwide and is the most common inherited anaemia in individuals of northern European ancestry. Clinical severity is variable with most patients having a well-compensated haemolytic anaemia. Some individuals are asymptomatic, whereas others have severe haemolytic anaemia requiring erythrocyte transfusion. The primary lesion in hereditary spherocytosis is loss of membrane surface area, leading to reduced deformability due to defects in the membrane proteins ankyrin, band 3, beta spectrin, alpha spectrin, or protein 4.2. Many isolated mutations have been identified in the genes encoding these membrane proteins; common hereditary spherocytosis-associated mutations have not been identified. Abnormal spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen and this is the main cause of haemolysis in this disorder. Common complications are cholelithiasis, haemolytic episodes, and aplastic crises. Splenectomy is curative but should be undertaken only after careful assessment of the risks and benefits.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation in children with hereditary spherocytosis [^116cuM8J]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited haemolytic anaemia attributed to disturbances in five different red cell membrane proteins. We performed a retrospective study of 166 children with HS and describe the clinical phenotype according to the genotype. In 160/166 (97%) children with HS a disease-causing mutation was identified. Pathogenic variants in ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1 and SPTA1 were found in 49%, 33%, 13% and 5% of patients. Children with SLC4A1-HS had the mildest phenotype, showing the highest haemoglobin (P < 0.001), lowest reticulocyte counts (P < 0.001) and lowest unconjugated bilirubin levels (P = 0.006), and none required splenectomy in childhood (P < 0.001). Conversely, children with autosomal recessive SPTA1-HS had the most severe clinical phenotype, with almost all patients undergoing splenectomy in early childhood. Patients with ANK1 and SPTB variants showed a similar clinical phenotype. Within each gene, variant type or location did not predict disease severity or likelihood of splenectomy. Among patients with a genetic diagnosis, 47 (29%) underwent splenectomy (23 partial; 24 total) while 57 (36%) underwent cholecystectomy. Total splenectomy led to greater improvements in haemoglobin (P = 0.02). Select use of genetic testing (especially in patients without a family history) may help predict clinical phenotype in childhood and guide family counselling.

### Red cell membrane disorders: structure meets function [^114Qx2xX]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The mature red blood cell (RBC) lacks a nucleus and organelles characteristic of most cells, but it is elegantly structured to perform the essential function of delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from all other cells while enduring the shear stress imposed by navigating small vessels and sinusoids. Over the past several decades, the efforts of biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, and hematologists have provided an appreciation of the complexity of RBC membrane structure, while studies of the RBC membrane disorders have offered valuable insights into structure-function relationships. Within the last decade, advances in genetic testing and its increased availability have made it possible to substantially build upon this foundational knowledge. Although disorders of the RBC membrane due to altered structural organization or altered transport function are heterogeneous, they often present with common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid emergence of complications or inappropriate interventions. We propose an algorithm for laboratory evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia with a focus on RBC membrane disorders. Here, we review the genotypic and phenotypic variability of the RBC membrane disorders in order to raise the index of suspicion and highlight the need for correct and timely diagnosis.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^116yj2mL]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). High credibility.

ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely — pediatric hematology recommendations identify 5 hematologic tests and treatments that health care providers and patients should question, including: (1) avoid routine preoperative hemostatic testing in an otherwise healthy child with no previous personal or family history of bleeding; (2) avoid platelet transfusion in asymptomatic children with a platelet count > 10 × 10³/μL unless an invasive procedure is planned; (3) avoid thrombophilia testing in children with venous access-associated thrombosis and no positive family history; (4) avoid packed red blood cells transfusion for asymptomatic children with iron deficiency anemia and no active bleeding; and (5) avoid routine administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for prophylaxis of children with asymptomatic autoimmune neutropenia and no history of recurrent or severe infections. The Task Force stated these items should be questioned because they are not supported by evidence and/or they involve risks of medical and financial costs with low likelihood of benefit, and it recommends that health care providers carefully consider the anticipated risks and benefits of these identified tests and treatments before performing them.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^115TZhix]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

ANK1 is an important red cell membrane protein which plays a vital role in the maintenance of erythrocyte membrane integrity. ANK1 consists of three structural domains: a multiple repeats N-terminal domain, a spectrin-binding center region and a regulatory C-terminal domain. Mutations in the spectrin-binding domain and regulatory C-terminal domains result in the most severe anemia compared with those located in the other domains.

In our study, the patient had suffered from unexplained hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia since the neonatal period. At the age of 3 months, hepatosplenomegaly and spherocytes which is critical to diagnose the HS weren't observed. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was negative. It was difficult to diagnose HS which originates from mutations in the genes coding for RBC membrane components. Gene detection is the principle method for cases with no family history of HS, especially in some atypical cases. NGS is able to provide a thorough genetic analysis and identify which candidate gene is responsible for the disease. Therefore, with this patient we used an NGS panel for the analysis of 566 genes responsible for hematological disorders. The genetic tests showed a de novo ANK1 c.2693dupC (p. A899Sfs*11) frameshift mutation which was not found in the 1000G, ExAC, or HGMD databases. Moreover, this mutation was located in the spectrin-binding domain, which might cause HS. At the age of 11 months, spherocytes on a peripheral blood smear were 10% and the neonatal HS ratio was 4.38. Our report strongly suggests that in infants, it is important for the physicians to monitor the sphere-shaped erythrocytes and the neonatal HS ratio when the patients are at risk for HS. Regrettably, eosin-5′-maleimide binding assay with flow cytometry is the test of choice to diagnose HS but isn't available in our laboratory.

In conclusion, this report suggests that genetic detecting should be considered for some unexplained hemolytic diseases. Meanwhile, we identified a novel de novo ANK1 c.2693dupC (p. A899Sfs*11) heterozygous frameshift mutation in a Yi nationality patient. However, the pathogenesis of this ANK1 mutation should be explored further to improve the diagnosis and treatment of HS.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Diagnosis and management of severe-associated congenital anaemia in a family cohort affected by two founder variants [^112P1QaG]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis due to mutations in the SPTA gene is a rare cause of fetal anaemia which can present as hydrops fetalis. We present a unique family cohort demonstrating severe transfusion-dependent anaemia with prenatal onset due to two SPTA1 founder variants which were diagnosed over several years as genetic testing capabilities advanced. Each patient was managed antenatally with fetal blood sampling (FBS) and intrauterine transfusions (IUT) with varying levels of success. Out of six affected pregnancies, two resulted in fetal demise, two resulted in postnatal demise and two long-term survivors required bone marrow transplant. While FBS and IUT are key in the antenatal management, multidisciplinary care is essential given the long-term complex medical comorbidities among postnatal survivors.

Methodological considerations for screening questions — Test accuracy results informing screening questions were often lacking or, when available, had serious limitations, so the systematic review team identified other data mostly in the form of association studies, and the ASH guideline panel developed a framework to form recommendations based on association studies. The framework was informed by the GRADE diagnosis EtD framework, the World Health Organization, and the US Preventive Services Task Force, and Table 3 summarizes the framework and the criteria used to determine when screening is justified. The panel used 2 criteria for a screening test to be considered: (1) the panel must have high certainty that individuals with a positive screening test would receive different management than those with a negative test and (2) the panel must have high certainty that there is an effective treatment or management for the condition that improves outcomes if administered earlier than when the condition is clinically apparent.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin: a false sense of security [^113LQ4oq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In health, the lifespan of a mature red blood cell is approximately 120 days. The longer an erythrocyte remains in the circulation, the greater the exposure of adult HbA to glycosylation. Conditions that reduce the lifespan of red blood cells, such as haemolysis, thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia and acute or chronic blood loss, result in lower HbA1c measurements. The opposite occurs when erythrocytes have a prolonged lifespan, as seen postsplenectomy and in iron or vitamin B 12 deficiency.

HS is an inherited disorder of red blood cells resulting in membrane instability and loss of surface area. The spherical shape and reduced deformability renders cells susceptible to damage and splenic sequestration, producing a haemolytic anaemia.

HS can be seen in all ethnic groups; the frequency commonly reported to be between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 5000 persons, with a predominance in Northern Europeans. Many genetic defects have been identified, with families often displaying unique mutations. While the majority are found to be autosomal dominant (75%), the inheritance pattern varies depending on the molecular cause, and recessively inherited and de novo mutations also occur (25%). In some cases, the genetic defect is undetermined. The membrane changes in HS result from mutations in genes encoding proteins integral in maintaining the vertical links between the inner cytoskeleton and the outer lipid bilayer. The most common defects are found in ankyrin (ANK1), spectrin (SPTA1, SPTB), Band 3 (SLC4A1) and less commonly Band 4.2 (EPB42) proteins, with studies varying in the reported prevalence of these mutations.

The clinical phenotype varies from a compensated or mild haemolytic anaemia to a severe neonatal haemolysis. Patients may experience symptoms of anaemia, jaundice, splenomegaly and gallstones. One study of 300 patients found that there was no clear clinical correlation between genetic defect and disease severity, although it was noted that spectrin/ankyrin deficiency was more often diagnosed in childhood and more frequently resulted in splenectomy.

The blood picture may guide clinicians to a diagnosis of HS. Characteristic spherocytes and the presence of immature red cells are seen on peripheral blood smear. The RDW and MCHC are often increased. The Hb is low in patients where the red cell loss is greater than erythropoiesis. Unconjugated bilirubin may be elevated, although in healthy states, this is usually mild since it is effectively processed and excreted by the liver. Folate levels may be low due to increased requirements.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### The variable manifestations of disease in pyruvate kinase deficiency and their management [^114sLq5i]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

PKD should be suspected in patients with an unexplained chronic Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia following an unrevealing standard hemolytic anemia evaluation. Tests to be considered in this situation are outlined in Table 3, and our stepwise approach to the diagnosis of a patient with chronic unexplained hemolytic anemia is detailed in Figure 3. The first test to perform in cases of suspected PKD is the PK enzyme assay. While it is a useful and inexpensive screening test, PK enzyme activity assays have a number of limitations. Recent transfusion can result in falsely normal enzyme activity. PK enzyme activity is red cell age-dependent, and so cases of suspected PKD with a normal PK enzyme assay should also be evaluated further via calculation of the PK/hexokinase ratio. This ratio relates PK activity to the activity of hexo - kinase, another red cell age-dependent enzyme used as an internal standard. A decreased PK/hexokinase ratio is suspicious for PKD and should be investigated further with genetic testing. Of clinical relevance, PK enzyme activity has not been shown to correlate with disease severity.

Our consensus approach to routine screening of the patient with pyruvate kinase deficiency.

Results of massive parallel sequencing of the region encompassing nucleotide c.1529 of PKLR on genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood, buccal swab, urine, and semen from members of the family of the patient in the case described in "Complexity of enzymatic and genomic diagnosis in pyruvate kinase deficiency"

In addition, this case demonstrates the complexity of genetic diagnosis in PKD. Over 300 functional mutations in PKLR have been described. While most cases can be diagnosed with standard PKLR exon sequencing of the patient, occasionally more comprehensive analysis are necessary to confirm the diagnosis or allow for family planning in subsequent pregnancies. This includes screening for parental somatic mutations in cases in which an apparent de novo mutation is identified. In more routine cases, in which a couple is planning to conceive and one partner is a confirmed carrier of PKD (as occurs in all children of affected individuals), testing of the partner with an unconfirmed PKLR mutation status should be through sequencing rather than testing PK enzyme activity, as many carriers will have normal PK activity. An analysis of PK enzyme activity in 31 family studies (mother, father, and patient) performed by three of the authors (RvW, PB, MMP, unpublished observation) revealed eight cases in which a carrier had normal PK activity. Therefore, in this setting enzymatic testing alone to identify possible carriers is inadequate and genetic testing is advised.

### Multi-gene panel testing improves diagnosis and management of patients with hereditary anemias [^116GuM1t]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Mutations in more than 70 genes cause hereditary anemias (HA), a highly heterogeneous group of rare/low frequency disorders in which we included: hyporegenerative anemias, as congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) and Diamond-Blackfan anemia; hemolytic anemias due to erythrocyte membrane defects, as hereditary spherocytosis and stomatocytosis; hemolytic anemias due to enzymatic defects. The study describes the diagnostic workflow for HA, based on the development of two consecutive versions of a targeted-NGS panel, including 34 and 71 genes, respectively. Seventy-four probands from 62 unrelated families were investigated. Our study includes the most comprehensive gene set for these anemias and the largest cohort of patients described so far. We obtained an overall diagnostic yield of 64.9%. Despite 54.2% of cases showed conclusive diagnosis fitting well to the clinical suspicion, the multi-gene analysis modified the original clinical diagnosis in 45.8% of patients (nonmatched phenotype-genotype). Of note, 81.8% of nonmatched patients were clinically suspected to suffer from CDA. Particularly, 45.5% of the probands originally classified as CDA exhibited a conclusive diagnosis of chronic anemia due to enzymatic defects, mainly due to mutations in PKLR gene. Interestingly, we also identified a syndromic CDA patient with mild anemia and epilepsy, showing a homozygous mutation in CAD gene, recently associated to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-50 and CDA-like anemia. Finally, we described a patient showing marked iron overload due to the coinheritance of PIEZO1 and SEC23B mutations, demonstrating that the multi-gene approach is valuable not only for achieving a correct and definitive diagnosis, but also for guiding treatment.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10 9 /L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio 2:1 (rather than the normal 3:1 ratio) with a mild left shift, that is, increased early erythroid precursors, and signs of dyserythropoiesis including binucleated erythroblasts, occasional cytoplasmic bridges, and karyorrhexis (Figure 1). Ring sideroblasts were not noted. Cytogenetic testing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry did not show evidence of malignancy or MDS. Based on these findings along with the relatively high ferritin, suboptimal reticulocytosis, and family history of macrocytic anemia with iron overload, a possible diagnosis of CDA was considered, leading to next‐generation sequencing (NGS) on a panel of genes associated with HHA/CDA (Table S1), which demonstrated a novel heterozygous variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 8 of ALAS2 (c.1066G > A, p. Val356Met) (Figure 2).

A 3-year-old Chinese girl was referred to Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University on April 20, 2017, after a diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD) and HS. ASD in this patient was incidentally detected during a physical examination 2 years ago in a local hospital. Subsequent echocardiographic data confirmed this diagnosis, and the girl was suggested to undergo regular check-up. The patient had experienced bouts of weakness and easy fatigability since birth. One month ago, she visited a local hospital for anemia. Based on laboratory findings and the osmotic fragility test, a diagnosis of HS was made. Our hospital was recommended for further treatment.

On admission, the patient's sclerae and skin were icteric, and mucosal membranes were pale. Physical examination revealed a systolic ejection murmur with splitting of the second heart sound at the left second intercostal space, and an enlarged spleen in the left subcostal region. Hematologic assessment revealed hemoglobin levels at 8.2 g/dl (normal range, 11–17 g/dl), hematocrit at 23.8% (normal range, 36–56%), RBC count at 3.15 × 10¹²/L (normal range, 3.50–5.30 × 10¹²/L), and white blood cell count at 6.52 × 10⁹/L (normal range, 4.0–10.0 × 10⁹/L). Total serum bilirubin (89.4 μM; normal range, 2.0–22.0 μM), direct bilirubin (11.8 μM; normal range, 0.0–8.0 μM), and indirect bilirubin (77.6 μM; normal range, 0.0–14.0 μM) levels were significantly increased. Liver enzyme levels were normal. RBC size showed disparity, and the presence of spherocytes (about 12%) was noted on peripheral blood smear (Fig. 1 A). Bone marrow smear analysis showed active proliferation with erythroid preponderance (myeloid cells was 39.5%, and erythroid cell was 48.5%), increase of intermediate and late erythroblast, different size of mature erythrocyte, and the presence of polychromatic and spherical erythrocytes (Fig. 1 B). RBCs showed elevated osmotic fragility. Echocardiography revealed a fossa ovalis ASD with left-to-right shunt, enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, and dilated main pulmonary artery.

### De novo variations of ANK1 gene caused hereditary spherocytosis in two Chinese children by affecting pre-mRNA splicing [^111aYFFi]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS, MIM#612641) is a hereditary genetic disease caused by abnormalities in red blood cell membrane proteins resulting from congenital haemolytic anaemia. HS is mainly characterized by anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Additional features comprise increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility and spherical red blood cell (RBC) count in peripheral blood smears. The symptomatology and clinical outcomes of HS are highly variable. Patients with mild HS might have no clinical manifestations related to anaemia due to the compensatory effect of the bone marrow, causing more erythropoiesis than destruction. Meanwhile, patients with severe HS might suffer from hemolytic crisis or even death. The major genetic mode of HS is autosomal dominant manner, accounting for approximately 75% of cases. In addition, approximately one-fourth of HS patients have no family history of the disease, and the inheritance patterns indicate that HS can be inherited as an autosomal recessive single-gene disorder or as a result of de novo mutations. To date, 5 associated genes associated with HS have been reported: ANK1, SLC4A1, SPTA1, SPTB and EPB42, encoding ankyrin protein, band-3 protein, alpha-spectrin protein, beta-spectrin protein and erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2, respectively. In summary, HS shows marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The prevalence of HS patients also exhibits a cosmopolitan distribution. Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of HS in Europe is approximately 1/2000–1/5000, whereas in China the estimated incidence is 1.39/100000. Notably, typical symptoms are not present at the same time in most patients with HS, and various factors can easily influence laboratory findings. Thus, diagnosing HS is difficult, and patients are frequently misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed. The incidence of the disease may be much higher than the clinical detection rate. Thus, obtaining a definite diagnosis is challenging, even though HS is not very rare. To the best of our knowledge, unequivocal gene sequencing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of HS. Therefore, the discovery of pathogenic gene variants detected by genetic testing and the detailed and intensive functional analysis associated with these genes might shed further light on HS pathogenesis.

In this article, online prediction tools and minigene constructs were used to further reveal the pathogenicity and characterization of novel variants detected in two Chinese families with HS, more accurately characterizing splicing variants in ANK1. This work further explains the relationship between the genotype and phenotype associated with ANK1 variants in the Chinese population and provides the basis for prenatal diagnostics and genetic counselling.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115NYrjK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a family with a red cell membrane abnormality which results in an HS phenotype and pseudohypokalaemia. Clinically, the patients were asymptomatic and peripheral blood smears demonstrated HS and biochemistry suggested mild hyperbilirubinaemia with hemolytic anaemia. The true underlying molecular cause of this condition remains obscure, but it is suggested that a SLC4A1 variant gene could contribute to the condition. The clinical implications of pseudohypokalaemia are that it can lead to inappropriate investigation or treatment.

Learning points

We report, to our knowledge for the first time, a variation of the hereditary spherocytosis phenotype with increased red blood cell MCV and pseudohypokalaemia.
Severe hypokalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
Pseudohypokalaemia can be misleading and result in incorrect interpretation and patient mismanagement.
Immediate recognition of pseudohypokalaemia and appropriate intervention can prevent misdiagnosis.
The true underlying molecular cause of this condition remains obscure, but a possibility is that the SLC4A1 missense mutation which predicts structural alterations of transmembrane domains could contribute to changes in cation permeability.

### Diagnosis and clinical relevance of co-inheritance of haemoglobin D-punjab / β +-thalassemia traits in an immigrant Afghan family [^112ZPZiA]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

The 9-year-old son (patient 6) had mild anaemia with erythrocytosis (table 1) and a blood smear showing microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells, schistocytes, target cells and spherocytes. The CZE pattern showed Hb A 3.5%, Hb A2 4.7%, Hb F < 0.5% and Hb D 91.8% (figure 1B). The high amount of the Hb D variant with a low fraction of Hb A in absence of a history of red blood cell transfusions suggested compound heterozygosity for Hb D/β+-thalassemia.

The father (patient 1) was not anaemic, but a marked erythrocytosis, microcytosis and hypochromasia with normal serum ferritin levels (82 µg/L), a high amount of Hb A2 4.3% and absence of a Hb variant suggested a β-thalassemia trait (figure 1C). The other members of the family, that is, patients 3, 5, 8, 9 had a haemogram within the reference range and a normal profile at CZE, while patients 4 and 7 had a phenotype compatible with a heterozygosity for Hb D-Punjab and a beta-thalassemia trait, respectively. Patient 6 had a phenotype compatible with a compound heterozygosity for Hb D/β+-thalassemia.

We evaluated the red cell osmotic fragility for the family members of whom fresh EDTA was available (figure 2), using the 'naked eye single tube red cell osmotic fragility test' (NESTROFT), a low cost screening test for β-thalassemia trait. Briefly, this test is based on the reduced osmotic fragility of red cells in β-thalassemia, that results in persistent turbidity 20 min after suspending 20 µL of fresh EDTA blood into a tube containing 4 mL of a 0.36% hypotonic saline solution. The tube is then held against a white paper with a thin black line. If the line is not visible or blurred, the test is considered positive, that is, reduced osmotic fragility. If the line is clearly visible through the contents of the tubes, the test is negative. Reduced osmotic fragility was detected in patients 1, 6 and 7.

### Infantile pyknocytosis revisited: possible familial trend in a study of 9 patients [^111MAiT4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Infantile pyknocytosis (IP) is an uncommon cause of transient neonatal hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia occurring in approximately 10% of cases of unexplained neonatal hemolytic anemia.

Objective —

To study cases of IP with focus on long-term follow-up, perinatal events, and family history.

Design —

Cases were prospectively identified during review of peripheral blood smears for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia during an 11-year period. Clinical and laboratory parameters, follow-up data, and family history were recorded.

Results —

Nine cases of IP were identified from the morphologic recognition of pyknocytes and clinical and laboratory evidence of hemolysis, and included 6 males and 3 females. Age at diagnosis ranged from 1 to 18 days (median, 4 days), and gestational age at birth ranged from 29 to 38 weeks (median, 35 weeks). Hemoglobin nadir ranged from 4.9 to 8.1 g/dL (median, 6 g/dL), and maximum total bilirubin concentration ranged from 7.7 to 27.5 mg/dL (median, 22.0 mg/dL). All 9 patients required phototherapy and transfusions. Hemolysis spontaneously resolved without recurrence in all cases, with time to resolution ranging from 13 to 70 days (median, 33 days) and median follow-up of 7 years (range, 1–11 years). Six patients (67%) had a sibling with neonatal jaundice as well. A similar proportion had significant perinatal events.

Conclusions —

IP is associated with spontaneous resolution without long-term complications. The underlying etiology is unknown. Perinatal events may expose red blood cells to an overwhelming oxidative stress. Strong family history suggests familial predisposition causing transient red blood cell defect, making them more susceptible to hemolysis.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^111GgRy5]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 4

When older adults are evaluated for anemia, certain features such as systemic symptoms and severe anemia may suggest more significant underlying causes such as hereditary red cell disorders. In a prospective study evaluating causes of unexplained anemia in a cohort of predominantly (69%) African American older adults aged ≥ 65 years, 4.6% had thalassemia trait, and 2.2% had a hemolytic condition. In clinical practice, patients can present at any age with uncommon causes of anemia such as undiagnosed SCD, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A thorough medical and family history, review of symptoms, and peripheral blood smear will help determine whether additional workup for inherited or acquired red cell disorders is indicated.

Membranopathies such as hereditary spherocytosis may go undiagnosed until older age if they cause infrequent or no major hemolytic episodes.

In patients with MCV of < 80 fL and no iron deficiency, a diagnosis of thalassemia is highly likely. β-globin disorders can be confirmed with hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. The presence and type of α-globin mutation can be confirmed with α-globin gene sequencing. Typically, no treatment is required for thalassemia trait.

SCD is the most common severe inherited blood disorder in the United States. SCD is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene that leads to vaso-occlusion, thus causing complications such as strokes, renal disease, cardiopulmonary complications, and accelerated functional decline. There are several variants of SCD with hemoglobin SS being the most common. Individuals with hemoglobin-SC or sickle-β + –thalassemia variants are more likely to go undiagnosed for decades because they have fewer complications early in life, have a relatively higher hemoglobin level (usually 10–12 g/dL), and have a longer life expectancy compared with individuals with hemoglobin SS.

Older adults with SCD may develop progressive anemia due to both SCD and age-associated changes such as CKD, stem cell exhaustion due to a lifetime of hemolysis, and increased RBC turnover. Hematologic malignancies are also more common in individuals with SCD compared with the general population, and clonal hematopoiesis may also be more common in adults with SCD, occurring at an earlier age.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^113K9VQf]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this report, we described a Chinese family with a patient affected by HS. A de novo mutation (exon 25: c.2693dupC:p. A899Sfs*11) causing an amino acid change in exon 25 of ANK1 was found through next-generation sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing to verify the relationship between the ANK1 mutation and HS.

HS is an inherited disorder characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped blood cells. Approximately two-thirds of cases are autosomal dominant (AD), and the remaining cases represent autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance or de novo mutations in some sporadic cases. Cases of HS are sporadic in China. However, in some countries and continents, many HS patients have no family history.

ANK1 mutations are responsible for the majority of cases of HS. A heterozygous ANK1 IVS3–2A > C mutation that may lead to exon 4 skipping of the ANK1 gene and cause HS was recently identified in a 7-year-old girl. A patient with HS who was diagnosed clinically with only 10% spherical-shaped erythrocytes in the peripheral blood was identified to have a novel de novo ANK1 c.4276C > T (p.R1426*) nonsense mutation, while neither of his parents or his young brother carried this mutation. A 6-year-old girl who was clinically diagnosed with HS carried a de novo nonsense ANK1 mutation (c.796G > T, p. Glu266X), a single-nucleotide change from G to T, which caused a substitution from glutamic acid to a premature stop at codon 266.

### Abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane [^111yZ35c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussion between health care providers, patient, and family. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. However, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

### Evaluation and management of heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents: the role of the hematologist [^112Rf3rg]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is frequently reported by adolescents. The role of the hematologist is threefold in evaluating such patients: (1) perform a clinical and laboratory evaluation for an underlying bleeding disorder on the basis of the degree of clinical suspicion, (2) identify and manage any concomitant iron deficiency, and (3) provide input to the referring provider regarding the management of HMB, particularly for patients with identified hemostatic defects. Several clues in the menstrual history should raise suspicion for an underlying bleeding disorder, such as menses lasting > 7 days, menstrual flow which soaks > 5 sanitary products per day or requires product change during the night, passage of large blood clots, or failure to respond to conventional therapies. A detailed personal and family history of other bleeding symptoms should also be obtained. Iron deficiency with and without anemia is commonly found in young women with HMB. Therefore, it is important to obtain measures of hemoglobin and ferritin levels when evaluating these patients. Iron supplementation is often a key component of management in the adolescent with heavy menses and is still needed in those who have received packed red cell transfusions as a result of severe anemia. Strategies for decreasing menstrual blood flow are similar for adults and adolescents with heavy menses, with combined hormonal contraceptives recommended as first-line therapy. However, there are adolescent-specific considerations for many of these agents, and they must be incorporated into shared decision-making when selecting the most appropriate treatment.

### Real-world insights from a cohort of approximately 2000 individuals who were analysed using a freely available next-generation sequencing anaemia screening programme [^111WUkxf]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current diagnostic techniques for hereditary haemolytic anaemias (HHAs) are diverse, including red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte counts, osmotic fragility and eosin‐maleimide binding tests or measurement of RBC enzyme activity. However, some methods are technically complex/unavailable to non‐specialist centres, making definitive diagnoses difficult. Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) may provide a platform to diagnose a range of HHAs and overlapping clinical entities through extensive, simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease‐causing genes. Inaccurate diagnosis of HHAs can have serious implications, highlighting the potential clinical utility of NGS in supplementing routine diagnostic techniques.

A real‐world diagnostic programme for patients with a suspected HHA disease or carrier status, excluding haemoglobinopathies, has been available since 2018 (ARUP Laboratories® 2018–2020, AnemiaID®/Revvity, Inc.® 2020–present) to provide a diagnosis using an NGS panel of HHA‐associated genes. Here, we describe genetic testing results from this real‐world programme to evaluate the clinical utility of NGS in supporting the diagnosis of suspected HHAs. In total, this programme evaluated 2003 individuals between 3 December 2020 and 23 February 2023.

Clinical indication for testing varied among patients, ranging from unexplained/unspecified anaemia or hyperbilirubinaemia to specific diagnoses indicated by prior clinical testing. It also included patients with a family history of haemolytic anaemia. Individuals were referred for testing based on clinicians' judgement, and the submission of prior clinical workup results was non‐mandatory. Overall, 47.6% of the patient cohort were adults (≥ 18 years) and 52.0% were female.

The programme employed an exome sequencing‐based virtual gene panel, analysing 51 genes (Table S1). Details of sample preparation and sequencing can be found in Appendix S1. Most specimens tested were whole blood (54.4%) or saliva (45.2%). Variants were classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines (see Appendix S2 for further details).

### Biliary obstruction in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis: a clinical review of 16 cases [^112kfXUk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia are rare symptoms of HS. Our study challenges the conventional assumption that anemia severity correlates with gallstone-related complications. Notably, 50% of the patients belongs to non-severe group, their mean age is younger than the severe group. This finding aligns with Han, suggesting that biliary complications may arise independently of anemia severity. Hyperbilirubinemia, in this scenario, is driven by three mechanisms: biliary obstruction, liver cell damage and recurrent hemolysis. In early-stage mild-type HS patients, liver cell damage may play a dominate role, as evidenced by the higher liver enzyme levels observed in our non-severe group (Group A). This finding suggests that symptomatic biliary complication can occur in mild-type HS regardless of age, highlighting the importance of regular biliary scan for both mild-type and severe-type HS patients.

The rarity of biliary obstruction in HS also leads to delayed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. In our study, eight patients were neither diagnosed nor suspected of having HS on admission, as they exhibited mild to no anemia. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that obstructive jaundice increases red cell membrane lipid, makes it to a less spheroidal shape and permits it to better transform in splenic circulation, thereby ameliorating hemolytic anemia. Therefore, caution is required when unexplained anemia appears after the resolution of biliary obstruction, particularly in the presence of splenomegaly, as observed in our eight patients. A positive family history of HS further supports the diagnosis, making it more straightforward.

Several genes encoding red cell membrane proteins and cytoskeleton have been reported previously in HS, with specific mutations identified as causative factors. Although studies showed that specific variants within these genes are not correlated with anemia severity or predictive of early splenectomy, patients with the same genotype tend to share similar clinical phenotype. A previous example is the co-occurrence of Gilbert syndrome (caused by UGT1 A1 gene mutations) with HS, which increases the risk of gallstone formation fivefold and predisposes patients to early onset cholelithiasis. In our study, 58.3% (7/12) of patients harbored pathogenic SPTB gene mutations, which is consistent with reports from other similar studies. Moreover, SPTB variants are relatively uncommon in east-Asian HS population. The high prevalence of SPTB gene mutations in our cohort suggests a potential association with biliary obstruction, however, further research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms.

### Fetal anaemia from red blood cell membrane defect and co-inherited haemoglobin constant spring [^117N1FXf]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The case presented here is an example of hereditary red blood cell membrane defect with a co-inherited haemoglobin Constant Spring. This case is of an anaemic fetus that presented with isolated ascites at 18 weeks of gestation. Fetal blood analysis revealed abnormal shaped red blood cells. The same pattern of red blood cell morphology was also seen on paternal peripheral blood smear. Intrauterine blood transfusions were given twice to correct fetal anaemia. The fetus showed a good response to the transfusions and was delivered at term with mild anaemia and did not need blood transfusion after birth. This report describes a natural course of red blood cell membrane defect with co-inherited haemoglobin Constant Spring, indicating that the course of disease was more severe during fetal life. Intrauterine transfusion supported the transition of the fetus through the critical period in utero to a healthier life after birth.
