Pediatric SBO

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage pediatric small bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and the bedside assessment that flags strangulation. Then, I should verify the initial imaging choice and escalation pathways. Next, I will consider pediatric-specific etiologies and risk factors that alter pretest probabilities. After that, I need to decide on operative versus nonoperative management and timing thresholds. Then, I will review contrast protocols and whether they add value in children. I should also plan operative approaches, postoperative risk mitigation, and special scenarios like virgin abdomen, pseudo-obstruction, and transplant-related obstruction. Finally, I will double-check the strength of evidence and note where pediatric data remain limited or controversial.

> Let me first confirm the bedside triage priorities, because missing strangulation changes outcomes dramatically. I need to check for peritonitis, fever, hypotension, persistent continuous pain, and tachycardia, recognizing that these features increase the likelihood of ischemia and mandate urgent exploration; in children, a composite score including intractable continuous pain, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and abdominal distension plus ultrasound or CT evidence of ascites or wall thickening strongly suggests strangulation, and EAST recommends timely surgery when peritonitis or clinical deterioration is present [^113buYHx] [^112zPWLr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Even when I suspect strangulation, I should rapidly resuscitate with isotonic fluids and place a nasogastric tube if there is emesis or distension while I obtain imaging and surgical consultation, because early resuscitation improves perfusion and outcomes and aligns with emergency medicine and surgical guidance on SBO management in the ED and perioperative settings [^111jwYqH] [^116PT8rb].

> Next, I should review initial imaging, and I need to ensure I choose a modality that balances diagnostic yield, speed, and radiation risk in children. Ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for SBO and can be performed at the bedside, so I will start with ultrasound if expertise and time permit, reserving CT for equivocal cases, complex pathology, or when I must urgently define a transition point or detect ischemia; WSES and EAST endorse CT as the diagnostic modality of choice when the etiology is uncertain or complications are suspected, but in pediatrics I should still prefer ultrasound when feasible and escalate to CT with IV contrast if the diagnosis remains unclear or the patient deteriorates [^1122ie8C] [^114oJRNW] [^113Ewzaq].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance I am citing for ultrasound and CT in children, because pediatric data can differ from adult meta-analyses. The 2018 meta-analysis reports ultrasound sensitivity around 92% and specificity around 97% in mixed populations, while pediatric-focused CT series show approximately 87–92% sensitivity for SBO and variable ability to identify the cause and level; in younger children, test characteristics can diverge, so I should be cautious and correlate with clinical evolution and serial exams if ultrasound is initially nondiagnostic [^1122ie8C] [^111vpoZ2] [^114ViCbD].

> I will now examine the role of plain radiographs, and I should confirm that they remain a low-yield screening test. Abdominal X-ray can show dilated loops and air-fluid levels but has limited sensitivity and cannot exclude obstruction; it may help quickly rule in obvious obstruction or free air, but negative films do not obviate the need for ultrasound or CT when clinical suspicion persists, so I should not rely on X-ray alone to make decisions [^116QJvaG] [^111jwYqH].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific etiologies that shift the differential and management. In infants and young children, intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction and ultrasound is first-line for diagnosis and reduction. In children with prior abdominal surgery, adhesions predominate, but I should remember that adhesions can also cause obstruction in virgin abdomens, and certain neonatal conditions such as gastroschisis, NEC, and intestinal atresia carry higher long-term SBO risk, while post-transplant patients may have unusual causes like diaphragmatic hernia or PTLD. Post-appendectomy staples can rarely cause early SBO and warrant early operative consideration if suspected [^114R6BKK] [^113NZbQj] [^115qvKxn] [^1134kyGT] [^116ReP2c].

> Now, I need to decide on operative versus nonoperative management, and I should double-check timing thresholds. Nonoperative management is appropriate for stable patients without peritonitis, ischemia, or complete obstruction, with close monitoring for deterioration; however, delay beyond 48 hours increases the risk of bowel resection, especially in infants, so if there is no improvement within 24–48 hours or any deterioration, I should proceed to surgery rather than prolong observation [^1138bjgk] [^116RmJrj] [^111KSrKT].

> But wait, what about the role of water-soluble contrast protocols in children? Do they reduce surgery and length of stay as in adults. Adult data and guidelines support contrast for both prognostic and potential therapeutic benefit, but pediatric-specific prospective data show no reduction in surgery or length of stay with enteral contrast protocols in ASBO, so I should not overpromise families about contrast hastening resolution; I may still use contrast selectively for prognostication, but I need to ensure adequate hydration and aspiration precautions to mitigate aspiration and osmotic fluid shifts, and I should acknowledge that ongoing randomized work may refine this practice [^1121qykZ] [^111GPdXD].

> Next, I should review operative strategy, and I need to ensure I balance feasibility and safety. Laparoscopy is reasonable for simple adhesive disease in experienced hands, with a meaningful conversion rate expected. Early exploration is warranted when strangulation is suspected or when nonoperative therapy fails, and I should remember that delayed surgery beyond 48 hours increases resection risk in children, so I should avoid unnecessary delays once the decision to operate is made [^116nHuvB] [^116RmJrj] [^111KSrKT].

> I will now examine postoperative risk mitigation, and I should confirm that adhesion prevention is particularly important in children given their lifetime risk. Minimally invasive techniques and adhesion barriers can reduce adhesion formation and potentially ASBO recurrence; although pediatric randomized data are limited, observational pediatric cohorts suggest benefit with hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose barriers, and WSES highlights pediatric patients as a group with high lifetime risk who may benefit most from prevention strategies [^116oBmgG] [^115qbTxD].

> Let me consider special scenarios that alter the usual algorithm. In a virgin abdomen, I should not assume all cases require surgery. Adhesions account for a substantial fraction even without prior operations, and nonoperative management can succeed when safe, so I should individualize based on imaging and clinical course. In chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, I must avoid unnecessary resections and coordinate multidisciplinary care, reserving decompressive stomas and considering transplant referral for life-threatening TPN complications. After pediatric liver transplantation, I should maintain a high index for diaphragmatic hernia or PTLD as causes of obstruction and favor early operative therapy when these are suspected [^111U77pC] [^116T2NwT] [^111m1i4X] [^1134kyGT].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and where pediatric data remain sparse. Much of the high-credibility guidance is extrapolated from adult literature or pediatric retrospective series; randomized pediatric data are limited, especially for contrast protocols and timing of surgery, and multicenter pediatric trials are underway to address these gaps, so I should communicate uncertainty to families and document shared decision-making when evidence is weak [^1121qykZ] [^1134TigB] [^116nHuvB].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: triage for strangulation with immediate resuscitation and surgical consultation, use ultrasound first in children when feasible with CT reserved for complex or deteriorating cases, tailor decisions to pediatric etiologies and risk factors, favor nonoperative care only in truly stable patients with a low threshold to operate by 24–48 hours if no improvement, avoid overpromising on contrast benefit in pediatrics, and prioritize adhesion prevention postoperatively, all while acknowledging where pediatric evidence remains limited and evolving [^111jwYqH] [^113Ewzaq] [^1138bjgk] [^1121qykZ] [^116oBmgG].

Pediatric small bowel obstruction (SBO) is most often due to **adhesions, intussusception, hernias, or volvulus** [^1142F3Hk], with adhesions the leading cause after prior abdominal surgery [^112QB3NV]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus imaging** [^112EdT5A]; ultrasound is first-line in children [^1142F3Hk] because it is radiation-free and accurate [^1122ie8C], while CT is reserved for equivocal cases or suspected complications [^114ViCbD] [^111kdrKV]. Initial management is **nonoperative** [^1138bjgk] with NGT decompression, IV fluids, and close monitoring, but surgery is indicated for peritonitis, strangulation, or failure to improve within 24–48 hours [^111GPdXD]. Early recognition and intervention reduce morbidity and recurrence; laparoscopy is preferred when feasible, and adhesion-prevention strategies should be considered in high-risk children [^116RmJrj] [^116nHuvB].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Pediatric SBO has **distinct etiologies** and risk factors compared with adults:

| **Etiology** | **Frequency** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Adhesions | Most common after abdominal surgery | Prior abdominal surgery, especially neonatal surgery [^115z1yP7] [^111KSrKT] |
| Intussusception | Most common cause in infants | Age 6 months to 2 years, male predominance [^notfound] |
| Hernias (inguinal, umbilical, internal) | Common in children | Congenital defects, chronic cough, constipation [^notfound] |
| Volvulus | Less common but high risk | Congenital malrotation, midgut anomalies [^notfound] |
| Meckel's diverticulum | Uncommon | Congenital anomaly [^notfound] |
| Bezoars, foreign bodies | Rare | Pica, psychiatric disorders, prior surgery [^notfound] |
| Neoplasms | Rare | Tumors (lymphoma, neuroblastoma) [^1134kyGT] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include **colicky abdominal pain, vomiting (often bilious), abdominal distension, and obstipation** [^115hiSvL]. Younger children may present with lethargy, irritability, and feeding difficulties [^notfound]. Red flags for **strangulation** include continuous pain, fever, tachycardia, peritonitis, and systemic instability [^112zPWLr].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line in children; high sensitivity/specificity, radiation-free, and can identify transition points, dilated loops, and peristalsis [^1122ie8C] [^111GPdXD].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Use when US is inconclusive or complications are suspected; identifies cause, level, and complications (strangulation, perforation) [^114ViCbD] [^111kdrKV].
- **Plain radiographs**: Limited utility; may show dilated loops/air-fluid levels but cannot exclude obstruction [^111jwYqH] [^116QJvaG].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation includes a **CBC** to assess for leukocytosis suggesting strangulation or infection [^116NkUua], and a **basic metabolic panel** to evaluate electrolyte disturbances and dehydration.

---

## Management strategies

### Nonoperative management

Indications include partial obstruction, **no peritonitis**, and **no signs of strangulation** [^1138bjgk]. Key interventions include nasogastric decompression, intravenous fluids, and serial examinations with close monitoring; **water-soluble contrast** may be used, although pediatric evidence is limited [^1121qykZ].

---

### Operative management

Indications include complete obstruction, **peritonitis**, **strangulation**, or failure of nonoperative management within 24–48 hours [^112zPWLr]. Preferred approaches include **laparoscopic adhesiolysis** when feasible, with open surgery reserved for complex cases or hemodynamic instability; bowel resection is performed for nonviable segments.

---

## Complications

Potential complications include **bowel ischemia/necrosis** requiring resection [^116NkUua], **perforation with peritonitis** [^113V7zqS], and **recurrent obstruction** due to adhesions or incomplete treatment [^114UfqVk]. Nutritional deficits may occur with prolonged obstruction or repeated surgeries [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Nonoperative management succeeds in 70–85% of cases, while operative management carries higher morbidity due to complications [^112QB3NV]. Recurrence is common, particularly with adhesions; **adhesion-prevention strategies** are recommended in high-risk children [^116oBmgG].

---

## Preventive measures

Adhesion-prevention strategies include **minimally invasive surgery** and adhesion barriers, with **early mobilization** and nutritional optimization postoperatively [^116nHuvB] [^114umHjt].

---

Pediatric SBO requires a **structured approach**: ultrasound-first imaging, initial nonoperative care, and timely surgery for complications or nonresponse. Early recognition and intervention, with laparoscopy when feasible, improve outcomes and reduce recurrence [^116RmJrj].

### Small bowel stenosis: a manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease in children? [^1141QQwx]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Digestive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent complication after bone marrow transplantation, but small bowel obstruction is an extremely rare event. We present herein the first pediatric series of 4 cases of small bowel obstruction after bone marrow transplantation with detailed gross, histological data and their genetic status of the NOD2 gene. All patients had a history of severe acute GVHD treated by immunosuppressive agents and/or infliximab (in 3 cases). Acute or progressively worsening abdominal pain accompanied by small bowel occlusion occurred 5–16 months after graft, and computed tomographic scan revealed multiple small intestinal stenoses. Failure of intensive medical treatment led to surgical resection of affected loops. Stigmata of acute (apoptosis of crypts and satellitosis) and chronic GVHD features (submucosal fibrosis and serosae sclerolipomatosis), as well as extensive ulcerations, were observed in all ileal specimens. NOD2 mutation was found in only 1 patient. The follow-up showed successful outcome after surgery.

### A rare cause of small intestinal obstruction in children: a case report of calcifying fibrous tumor [^114xjbs1]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Small intestinal CFT is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in children, with diagnosis relying on recognition of its characteristic triad: bowel wall thickening, calcifications, and an obstructive transition zone. High-frequency abdominal ultrasound, as a radiation-free initial imaging tool, plays a valuable role in identifying these pathognomonic features, aiding timely preoperative assessment in pediatric patients. This case underscores the need to include CFT in the differential diagnosis of chronic pediatric intestinal obstruction when the aforementioned triad is observed. Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these findings.

### Adult small bowel obstruction [^116QJvaG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a clinical condition that is often initially diagnosed and managed in the emergency department (ED). The high rates of potential complications that are associated with an SBO make it essential for the emergency physician (EP) to make a timely and accurate diagnosis.

Objectives

The primary objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the history, physical examination, and imaging modalities associated with the diagnosis of SBO. The secondary objectives were to identify the prevalence of SBO in prospective ED-based studies of adult abdominal pain and to apply Pauker and Kassirer's threshold approach to clinical decision-making to the diagnosis and management of SBO.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, major emergency medicine (EM) textbooks, and the bibliographies of selected articles were scanned for studies that assessed one or more components of the history, physical examination, or diagnostic imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of SBO. The selected articles underwent a quality assessment by two of the authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Data used to compile sensitivities and specificities were obtained from these studies and a meta-analysis was performed on those that examined the same historical component, physical examination technique, or diagnostic test. Separate information on the prevalence and management of SBO was used in conjunction with the meta-analysis findings of computed tomography (CT) to determine the test and treatment threshold.

Results

The prevalence of SBO in the ED was determined to be approximately 2% of all patients who present with abdominal pain. Having a previous history of abdominal surgery, constipation, abnormal bowel sounds, and/or abdominal distention on examination were the best history and physical examination predictors of SBO. X-ray was determined to be the least useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of SBO, with a pooled positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 2.52). On the other hand, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were both quite accurate in diagnosing SBO with +LRs of 3.6 (5- to 10-mm slices, 95% CI = 2.3 to 5.4) and 6.77 (95% CI = 2.13 to 21.55), respectively. Although limited to only a select number of studies, the use of ultrasound (US) was determined to be superior to all other imaging modalities, with a +LR of 14.1 (95% CI = 3.57 to 55.66) and a negative likelihood ratio (-LR) of 0.13 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.20) for formal scans and a +LR of 9.55 (95% CI = 2.16 to 42.21) and a -LR of 0.04 (95% CI = 0.01 to 0.13) for beside scans. Using the CT results of the meta-analysis for the 5- to 10-mm slice subgroup as well as information on intravenous (IV) contrast reactions and nasogastric (NG) intubation management, the pretest probability threshold for further testing was determined to be 1.5%, and the pretest probability threshold for beginning treatment was determined to be 20.7%.

Conclusions

The potentially useful aspects of the history and physical examination were limited to a history of abdominal surgery, constipation, and the clinical examination findings of abnormal bowel sounds and abdominal distention. CT, MRI, and US are all adequate imaging modalities to make the diagnosis of SBO. Bedside US, which can be performed by EPs, had very good diagnostic accuracy and has the potential to play a larger role in the ED diagnosis of SBO. More ED-focused research into this area will be necessary to bring about this change.

### Surgical treatment of intestinal complications of graft versus host disease in the pediatric population: case series and review of literature [^116rJenH]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Intestinal complications of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) include hemorrhage and perforation in the short-term, and stricture with bowel obstruction in the long-term. As medical management of severe aGVHD has improved, more patients are surviving even advanced stages of intestinal aGVHD. This review summarizes the available pediatric literature on surgical treatment of complications of intestinal GVHD.

Methods

A systematic review was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Scopus databases. Any publication that addressed surgical treatment of acute and chronic intestinal GVHD in the pediatric population was reviewed in detail. Furthermore, we included information on 5 additional patients from the institutions of this review's authors, which had not been previously published.

Results

We identified 8 studies, comprising 13 patients. Surgical interventions were undertaken for a variety of intestinal GVHD complications, including small bowel obstruction owing to stricture (n = 8), enterocutaneous fistulae (n = 2), gastrointestinal hemorrhage/perforation (n = 1 each), and esophageal stricture (n = 1). Among eight patients with bowel obstruction as an indication, pathology revealed ulceration with fibrosis in all but one; 3 had signs of persistent GVHD. Surgical mortality was reported in 4 patients (31%) at an average of 6weeks postoperatively. The median overall follow-up time was 20 months (IQR, 2–21).

Conclusions

Although intestinal aGVHD management is almost exclusively medical, a small subset of patients develops complications of intestinal GVHD that require surgical intervention. With expanding indications for stem cell transplantation as well as improved survival after previously fatal bouts of intestinal aGVHD, it is likely that surgical intervention will become more common in these complicated patients.

### Unusual ultrasound appearance of small bowel intussusception and secondary bowel obstruction in a child with Peutz-Jegher's syndrome [^113fCqa8]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Small bowel intussusception (SBI) in pediatric patients resolves spontaneously in the majority of cases. Pathologic small bowel intussusception with a lead point is rare in children. Ultrasound (US) is the preferred initial imaging study for the diagnosis of intussusception. We report a case of long-segment SBI and secondary bowel obstruction caused by a large hamartomatous polyp. This case emphasizes unique, atypical ultrasound findings that may be encountered in small bowel intussusception, with correlative radiographic, CT (computed tomography) and intra-operative findings. Increased awareness of these atypical imaging features can lead to early diagnosis and decrease the risk of potential complications including mesenteric venous thrombosis, bowel ischemia and necrosis.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^114UfqVk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Epidemiology

The risk of SBO is highest following colorectal, oncologic gynecological, or pediatric surgery. One in ten patients develops at least one episode of SBO within 3 years after colectomy. Reoperations for ASBO occur in between 4.2 and 12.6% of patients after pediatric surgery patients, and 3.2% of colorectal patients. Recurrence of ASBO is also frequent; 12% of non-operatively treated patients are readmitted within 1 year, rising to 20% after 5 years. The risk of recurrence is slightly lower after operative treatment: 8% after 1 year and 16% after 5 years.

Classification of adhesions

The most frequently used classification of adhesions in general surgery is the adhesion score according to Zühlke et al. (Table 3). The score is based on the tenacity and some morphologic aspects of the adhesions. The merits of this score are that it is easy to use and classifications are self-explanatory to most surgeons and gynecologists. The major drawback to the score is that it does not measure the extent of adhesions and that tenacity of adhesions can vary between different parts of the abdomen. The most used grading system in gynecological surgery is the American Fertility Society (AFS) score. The score is designed for grading adhesions in the small pelvis. Adhesions are scored for extent and severity at four sites: right ovary, right tube, left ovary, and left tube. The scores for the right and left side are summed, and the final AFS score is the score for the side with the lowest summed score while discarding the score for the other side. Thus, a patient with an AFS score of 0 can still have adhesions. Further critiques for this score include a relatively low inter-observer reproducibility. A modified AFS has therefore gained popularity in more recent studies.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^115hiSvL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Early postoperative small bowel obstruction after appendectomy because of staples in pediatric patients [^116ReP2c]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO) is an important complication of laparoscopic appendectomy in children, resulting in readmission and potential for intestinal loss. We reviewed our experience with early postoperative SBO.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing an appendectomy with subsequent SBO from 2014 to 2018. Patients were excluded if a concurrent gastrointestinal procedure was done during the appendectomy, or if they had previous abdominal surgery.

Results

Of 793 appendectomies performed at our institution during the study period, only six patients met the inclusion criteria for our chart review (7.6 SBO per 1000 appendectomies), ranging in age from 4 to 19 y. Four patients had uncomplicated appendicitis, and all underwent laparoscopic appendectomy within 24 h. Five were discharged postoperatively, with one patient remaining hospitalized for persistent ileus. Median time to representation with SBO was 7 d (range, 2–37). Three patients had indications for urgent exploration and underwent re-exploration shortly after presentation. Three patients underwent initial nonoperative management, but subsequently, all patients failed to progress and required operative exploration. Staples were found to be the culprit lesion in four of six patients, all of which notably initially presented with uncomplicated appendicitis, with two patients found to have ischemic bowel at the time of exploration.

Conclusions

Although rare, pediatric patients with SBO soon after laparoscopic appendectomy should be considered for early operative management, especially if the appendicitis was uncomplicated. When staples are used for appendectomy, stray staples should not be left as they can serve as a nidus for obstruction.

### Strangulated small bowel obstruction in children [^113buYHx]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosing intestinal strangulation as a complication of small bowel obstruction (SBO) remains a considerable challenge in children. We evaluated the clinicoradiological parameters for predicting the presence of a strangulated intestine.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 69 pediatric patients who underwent operation for acute SBO. Regression analysis was used to identify the parameters for predicting strangulated SBO.

Results

Of the 69 patients with SBO, 27 patients had intestinal strangulation and were awarded one point each towards the overall clinical score: intractable continuous abdominal pain, tachycardia, white blood cell count > 13,600/mm³, and abdominal distention. Patients with a clinical score ≥ 2 combined with the presence of ascites in ultrasound (US) results or with wall thickness and reduced wall contrast enhancement in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans showed strong evidence for intestinal strangulation.

Conclusion

The combination of two or more clinical parameters, including intractable continuous abdominal pain, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and abdominal distention with the presence of ascites in US or wall thickness and reduced wall contrast enhancement in, is useful for the identification of strangulated SBO.

### Small bowel obstruction in the emergency department: MDCT features of common and uncommon causes [^113me3nM]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a common condition encountered by the radiologist in the emergency department. Though intestinal adhesions and obstructed hernias are the most common causes of acute small bowel obstruction, a variety of uncommon and rare conditions can cause acute and subacute bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the workup of bowel obstruction by identifying the cause, level, and degree of bowel obstruction. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the multi-detector computed tomography features of common and uncommon causes of acute and subacute small bowel obstruction.

### Computed tomography of small bowel obstruction [^114sUnNp]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) is a powerful tool for the assessment of patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO). CT can provide important information about the cause and site of obstruction and the presence of a closed-loop obstruction or ischemia. Under investigation is the ability of CT to accurately identify patients without clear indications for urgent surgery who may benefit from earlier intervention. This article reviews the appropriate CT technique for assessment of SBO, common causes for obstruction, imaging findings in SBO, and the significance of those findings for determining whether a patient is likely to require surgical management for SBO.

### Utilization of ultrasound for the evaluation of small bowel obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122ie8C]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). While computed tomography (CT) is frequently utilized to confirm the diagnosis, this modality is expensive, exposes patients to radiation, may lead to time delays, and is not universally available. This study aimed to determine the test characteristics of ultrasound for the diagnosis of SBO.

Methods

PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were assessed for prospective trials evaluating the accuracy of ultrasound for the detection of SBO. Data were double extracted into a predefined worksheet and quality analysis was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool.

Results

This systematic review identified 11 studies comprising 1178 total patients. Overall, ultrasound was found to be 92.4% sensitive (95% CI 89.0% to 94.7%) and 96.6% specific (95% CI 88.4% to 99.1%) with a positive likelihood ratio of 27.5 (95% CI 7.7 to 98.4) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.08 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.11).

Discussion

The existing literature suggests that ultrasound is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of SBO with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of CT. Ultrasound may save time and radiation exposure, while also allowing for serial examinations of patients to assess for resolution of the SBO. It may be particularly valuable in settings with limited or no access to CT. Future studies should include more studies in the Emergency Department setting, comparison of probe choices, and inclusion of more pediatric patients.

### Small bowel obstruction: a practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^116ks8Ue]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with SBO is to immediately identify strangulation and need for urgent operative intervention, concurrent with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites resolution of partial obstructions, shortening time to removal of nasogastric tube liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital. Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot over emphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic LOA.

### Small bowel obstruction caused by vas deferens: a first documented report [^114nmC8s]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is one of the most common causes for an acute surgical admission. Most of the time SBO is a result of common causes such as postoperative adhesions. However, rare and unusual causes of SBO do exist which can be challenging for surgeons. We report a first documented case of SBO caused by a remnant of the vas deferens in a 24-year-old patient with a history of gastroschisis and left orchidectomy. Clinical presentation, investigations, imaging and management of this case are described. To summarise, clinicians should keep an open mind in dealing with patients with intestinal obstruction due to the rare and atypical causes.

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^112nJBpB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common cause of surgical admission and is associated with significant morbidity, healthcare cost, and resource utilization. Adhesions are the most common aetiology in high-income settings, whereas malignancy and hernia are more globally represented. Despite diagnostic, therapeutic, and technical advances, patients continue to face delayed symptom resolution, high complication rates, and frequent recurrence of obstruction.

Evidence-informed expert consensus guidelines aim to reduce practice variability, enhance treatment effectiveness, and improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines offer recommendations encompassing diagnosis, non-operative management (NOM), surgery, and postoperative care for patients with adhesive SBO. See Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of key recommendations from the WSES Bologna guidelines (2017 update) for the management of adhesive SBO

Resource limitations, regional healthcare delivery differences, and competing clinical priorities may hinder guideline adoption. While deviations from guideline-based care may contribute to population-level outcome disparities, the causes and effects of non-compliance for an individual patient remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, evaluating concordance with guideline-informed care helps shape future guideline development to detail new knowledge, highlight evidence-to-practice gaps, identify implementation barriers, and refine deployment strategies that improve adoption and utilization.

Prospective, multicentre, time-bound observational studies, termed snapshot audits, are well suited to assess guideline adherence in heterogeneous real-world environments, identifying specific evidence-to-practice gaps and barriers to implementation. This study, SnapSBO, examines whether and how full or partial guideline compliance influences patient outcomes, including complications and hospital length of stay (LOS).

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (surgical management), ESPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering intestinal transplantation (either isolated small bowel or multi-visceral) in patients with pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction presenting with life-threatening TPN‐associated complications (such as intestinal failure-associated liver disease, central venous catheter‐related thrombosis, recurrent episodes of central line sepsis, loss of central line access) and/or poor QoL with a high risk of morbidity and mortality (frequent pseudo‐obstructive episodes necessitating repeated hospitalizations, difficult fluid electrolyte imbalance due to excessive fluid shifts). Arrange early discussion with the transplant center combined with a multidisciplinary approach to decide about the optimal timing of assessment for intestinal transplantation in patients with pediatric intestinal pseudo‐obstruction where intestinal transplantation is a likely possibility.

### Utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction in children [^114ViCbD]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

CT is often used in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction in children.

Objective

To determine sensitivity of CT in delineating presence, site and cause of small-bowel obstruction in children.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the CT scans of 47 children with surgically proven small-bowel obstruction. We noted any findings of obstruction and the site and cause of obstruction. Presence, absence or equivocal findings of bowel obstruction on abdominal radiographs performed prior to CT were also noted. We reviewed patient charts for clinical details and surgical findings, including bowel resection. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test to determine which CT findings might predict bowel resection.

Results

CT correctly diagnosed small-bowel obstruction in 43/47 (91.5%) cases. CT correctly indicated site of obstruction in 37/47 (78.7%) cases and cause of obstruction in 32/47 (68.1%) cases. Small-bowel feces sign was significantly associated with bowel resection at surgery (P = 0.0091). No other CT finding was predictive of bowel resection. Out of 41 children who had abdominal radiographs before CT, 29 (70.7%) showed unequivocal obstruction, six (14.6%) showed equivocal findings and six (14.6%) were unremarkable.

Conclusion

CT is highly sensitive in diagnosing small-bowel obstruction in children and is helpful in determining the presence of small-bowel obstruction in many clinically suspected cases with equivocal or normal plain radiographs. CT also helps to determine the site and cause of the obstruction with good sensitivity.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^114umHjt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The conclusions and recommendations of this guideline have been summarized in Table 5. ASBO is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. Surgeons should be aware that the adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures or disease. Part of the adhesion formation can be prevented by application of minimal invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Most cases of ASBO can be treated non-operatively. If operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach might be beneficial for simple cases. However, there is a considerable risk for conversion to an open laparotomy and care needs to be taken not to make bowel injury.

### Clinical features vs CT findings to estimate need for surgery in small bowel obstruction [^1143fJZT]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients hospitalized with small bowel obstruction (SBO) fail nonoperative treatment. Rapidly identifying patients requiring urgent surgical intervention is critical. Currently, computed tomography (CT) is the criterion standard for diagnosing SBO management. However, practice variation exists due to a lack of definitive operative radiographic findings for SBO. We compared the ability of clinical features alone with that of clinical features combined with CT findings to estimate the need for surgical SBO management.

### Unusual causes of small bowel obstruction: a review of the literature and revisited cross-sectional imaging checklist [^113Ww9Go]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with features of small bowel obstruction need urgent evaluation to avoid complications such as bowel gangrene, perforation, or peritonitis. Imaging is necessary in most cases of suspected bowel obstruction, to take an appropriate decision, for apt patient management. Among the common causes of small bowel obstruction, adhesions, external herniae, malignancies, and Crohn's disease top the chart. Imaging helps in determining the presence of obstruction, the severity of obstruction, transition point, cause of obstruction, and associated complications such as strangulation, bowel gangrene, and peritonitis. This review is based on the cases with unusual causes of bowel obstruction encountered during our routine practice and also on the extensive literature search through the standard textbooks and electronic databases. Through this review we want our readers to have sound knowledge of the imaging characteristics of the uncommon yet important causes of bowel obstruction. We have also revisited and structured a checklist to simplify the approach while reporting a suspected case of small bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction and in determining the cause and associated complications. Apart from the common causes of small bowel obstruction, we should also be aware of the uncommon causes of small bowel obstruction and their imaging characteristics to make an accurate diagnosis and for apt patient management.

### A rare cause of small intestinal obstruction in children: a case report of calcifying fibrous tumor [^111oi9SM]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The pathogenic mechanisms underlying CFT remain incompletely elucidated. Current theories posit CFT to be a reactive fibrosing process triggered by chronic inflammation or tissue injury, though validation requires larger cohort studies. Within the gastrointestinal tract, mucosal microtrauma due to mechanical food passage is proposed as a potential contributor. This pediatric case illustrates the clinical relevance: protracted abdominal distension (spanning 2 months) suggests chronic luminal content stasis potentially exacerbating localized tissue damage. Notably, this mechanistic pathway currently lacks direct molecular evidence establishing causal relationships.

Chorti et al.'s systematic review (n = 157) reported a mean age of 33.58 years (range: 5 weeks–84 years). Pediatric cases constituted 8.3% (13/157), with fewer than 5 primary small intestinal CFTs. Bimodal age peaks occurred predominantly at 0–4, 25–29, and 30–34 years, with female predominance (male-to-female ratio: 1:1.27). This case — a 3-year-old girl with jejunal involvement aligns with pediatric epidemiological patterns.

CFT typically exhibits occult growth with nonspecific manifestations. Asymptomatic cases are often incidental findings; symptomatic patients may present with: digestive complaints (e.g. abdominal pain, anorexia) or systemic symptoms (e.g. fatigue, weight loss). Severe complications include obstruction, intussusception, or volvulus. The clinical heterogeneity of CFT is underscored by contrasting reports: Kim et al. documented mesenteric CFT masked by traumatic bowel perforation, exemplifying diagnostic challenges; conversely, Sotiriou et al. established small intestinal CFT as a validated rare etiology for intussusception, highlighting its potential to mimic common abdominal emergencies.

Notably, CFT may demonstrate relatively distinctive imaging features on ultrasonography, including well-defined hypoechoic masses with internal calcifications and posterior acoustic shadowing — these findings that align with established pediatric mesenteric CFT characteristics. In this pediatric case, high-frequency ultrasound identified focal jejunal wall thickening (6 mm) with discrete calcifications, and dynamically visualized the transition zone between dilated and collapsed bowel segments, providing direct evidence of mechanical obstruction via real-time peristaltic arrest documentation.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^111U77pC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and healthcare costs. The majority of SBOs are caused by adhesions that result from previous surgeries. Bowel obstruction, however, also occurs in patients without previous operation or known pathology, a so called virgin abdomen. It is unknown if small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) can be managed according to the same principles as other cases of small bowel obstruction. The aim of this position paper is to evaluate the available evidence on etiology and management of small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen.

Methods

This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. Clinical topics covered in this review include epidemiology and etiology of SBO-VA, diagnosis and imaging, initial assessment, the role of surgical management in SBO-VA, and the role of non-operative management in SBO-VA.

Results

Our scoping search revealed seven original studies reporting original patient data related to SBO-VA. All the included studies are retrospective cohorts, with populations ranging between 44 and 103 patients with SBO-VA. Adhesions were found to be the cause of the obstruction in approximately half of the reported cases of SBO-VA. A relatively high number of cases of SBO-VA were managed surgically with studies reporting 39–83%. However, in cases where a trial of non-operative management was started, this was generally successful.

Conclusion

The data available suggest that etiology and treatment results for patients with SBO-VA are largely comparable to the results in patients with SBO after previous abdominal surgery. We therefore propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and adhesive small bowel obstruction.

### Ct evaluation of small bowel obstruction [^111zkDty]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Although small bowel obstruction is a common occurrence, it is essential that this clinical condition be treated properly, that the site, level, and cause of obstruction be determined accurately, and that a tentative prognosis be formulated prior to surgery. The diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is based on a comprehensive approach that includes clinical background, patient history, and results of physical examination and laboratory tests. A variety of radiologic procedures are available to aid in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. Recent studies have demonstrated the superiority of CT in revealing the site, level, and cause of obstruction and in demonstrating threatening signs of bowel inviability. CT has proved useful in characterizing small bowel obstruction from extrinsic causes (adhesions, closed loop, strangulation, hernia, extrinsic masses), intrinsic causes (adenocarcinoma, Crohn disease, tuberculosis, radiation enteropathy, intramural hemorrhage, intussusception), intraluminal causes (eg, bezoars), or intestinal malrotation. Conventional radiography was the modality of choice for many years and should remain the initial imaging method in patients with suspected small bowel obstruction. However, the unique capabilities of CT in this setting make this modality an important additional diagnostic tool when specific disease management issues must be addressed.

### Attitudes affecting decision-making for use of radiologic enteral contrast in the management of pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction: a survey study of pediatric surgeons [^116mUCrw]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric surgeons are often asked to treat clinical problems for which little high-quality data exist. For adults with adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO), water soluble contrast-based protocols are used to guide management. Little is known about their utility in children. We aimed to better understand key factors in clinical decision-making processes and integration of adult based data in pediatric surgeon's approach to ASBO.

Methods

We administered a web-based survey to practicing pediatric surgeons at institutions comprising the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium.

Results

The response rate was 69% (78/113). Over half of respondents reported using contrast protocols to guide ASBO management either routinely or occasionally (n = 47, 60%). Common themes regarding the incorporation of adult-based data into clinical practice included the need to adapt protocols for pediatric patients, the dearth of pediatric specific data, and the quality of the published adult evidence.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that pediatric surgeons use contrast-based protocols for the management of ASBO despite the paucity of pediatric specific data. Furthermore, our survey data help us understand how pediatric surgeons incorporate adult based evidence into their practice.

### Utility of enteral contrast protocols in pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction: a prospective multicenter observational study [^1121qykZ]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the utility of enteral contrast-based protocols in the diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) for children.

Background

Enteral contrast-based protocols for adults with ASBO are associated with a decreased need for surgery and shorter hospitalization. Pediatric-specific data are limited.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational study between October 2020 and December 2022 at 9 children's hospitals that are members of the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium. Inclusion criteria were children aged 1 to 20 years diagnosed with ASBO who underwent a trial of nonoperative management at hospital admission. Comparisons were made between those children who received an enteral contrast challenge and those who did not. The primary outcome was the need for surgery.

Results

We enrolled 136 children (71% male; median age: 12 years); 84 (62%) received an enteral contrast challenge. There was no difference in the rate of operative intervention between the no-contrast (34.6%) and contrast groups (36.9%; P = 0.93). Eighty-seven (64%) were successfully managed nonoperatively with no difference in median length of stay (P = 0.10) or rate of unplanned readmission (P = 0.14). Among the 49 children who required an operation, there was no significant difference in the time from admission to surgery or rate of small bowel resection based on prior contrast administration.

Conclusions

The addition of enteral contrast-based protocols for the management of pediatric ASBO does not decrease the likelihood of surgery or shorten hospitalization. Larger randomized studies may be needed to further define the role of radiologic contrast in the management of ASBO in children.

### Changing the paradigm for managing pediatric nonadhesive small bowel obstructions-should we operate? [^112ten3T]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Growing evidence supports the success of nonoperative management (NOM) for pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction (A-SBO). However, there is concern that patients with nonadhesive SBO (NA-SBO) will have repeat episodes of SBO if not treated with surgery upfront. We examined whether NOM of NA-SBO at initial presentation was associated with increased risk of recurrent SBO.

Methods

A single-center observational study was performed using Current Procedural Terminology/International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and chart review. NA-SBO was defined as SBO in a patient with no history of SBOs, prior abdominal surgeries, or congenital gastrointestinal abnormalities known to cause SBO. We excluded patients with incarcerated hernias and tumors. The independent variable was surgical treatment at initial SBO admission and primary outcome was SBO recurrence within 1 y.

Results

Our cohort included 97 patients, with 30 patients (31%) undergoing surgery at initial NA-SBO admission. There was no difference in rates of recurrent SBO within 1 y when comparing the operative versus nonoperative management groups (6.7% versus 8.9%, P = 0.70). Among patients who recurred, there was no difference in need for surgical intervention (2/6 versus 0/2, P = 0.34). None of the operations for recurrence were urgent or emergent. Patients managed nonoperatively had a shorter median length of stay (2 versus 7 d, P < 0.001) and did not have significantly more emergency room visits (10.4% versus 6.7%, P = 0.55).

Conclusions

NOM of NA-SBO was not associated with increased rates of SBO recurrence, and NOM did not lead to increased morbidity. Surgeons should consider NOM in stable pediatric patients who present with NA-SBO.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^114PNkuv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as well as searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if they found any relevant reports missing.

Critical appraisal

Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford (Table 1). Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group has developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence (Table 2).

Table 1
Classification of evidence per article

Table 2
Grading of the conclusions and recommendations according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendation

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according to the level of evidence from strong ("there is strong evidence for", level A) to weak ("we cannot be confident", level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recommendations (level I) or weak recommendation or suggestions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all involved for comment and approval after which internal consensus was reached between the members of the working group. Amendments were made based upon these comments, leading to the final version of this updated guideline.

The therapeutic role of Gastrografin for treating small-bowel obstruction in children

The role of the water-soluble contrast, Gastrografin, in treating pediatric adhesive small-bowel obstruction has not been elucidated. This is a prospective nonrandomized cluster trial led by the Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre, that involves 9 CanCORPS centers. The primary objective of this study is to determine if administering Gastrografin as part of a standard nonsurgical management protocol will reduce the rate of surgical intervention for small-bowel obstruction in pediatric patients. Patient recruitment into the trial was significantly delayed by the COVID pandemic, but the trial is now starting to recruit patients.

To date, a total of 13 study proposals have been submitted for consideration. In addition to the studies already discussed in the text, another 3 studies have been approved.

1 National validation of a risk stratification system for resource utilization and outcomes of pediatric perforated appendicitis.

### Variability in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction in children [^1111ZCrm]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This study assessed inter-hospital variability in operative-vs-nonoperative management of pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO).

Methods

A multi-institutional retrospective study was performed examining patients 1–21 years-of-age presenting with ASBO from 2010 to 2019 utilizing the Pediatric Health Information System. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was performed assessing inter-hospital variability in operative-vs-nonoperative management of ASBO.

Results

Among 6410 pediatric ASBO admissions identified at 46 hospitals, 3,239 (50.5%) underwent surgery during that admission. The hospital-specific rate of surgery ranged from 35.3% (95%CI: 28.5–42.6%) to 74.7% (66.3–81.6%) in the unadjusted model (p < 0.001), and from 35.1% (26.3–45.1%) to 73.9% (66.7–79.9%) in the adjusted model (p < 0.001). Factors associated with operative management for ASBO included admission to a surgical service (OR 2.8 [95%CI: 2.4–3.2], p < 0.001), congenital intestinal and/or rotational anomaly (OR 2.5 [2.1–3.1], p < 0.001), diagnostic workup including advanced abdominal imaging (OR 1.7 [1.5–1.9], p < 0.001), non-emergent admission status (OR 1.5 [1.3–1.8], p < 0.001), and increasing number of complex chronic comorbidities (OR 1.3 [1.2–1.4], p < 0.001). Factors associated with nonoperative management for ASBO included increased hospital-specific annual ASBO volume (OR 0.98 [95%CI: 0.97–0.99], p = 0.002), older age (OR 0.97 [0.96–0.98], p < 0.001), public insurance (OR 0.87 [0.78–0.96], p = 0.008), and presence of coinciding non-intestinal congenital anomalies, neurologic/neuromuscular disease, and/or medical technology dependence (OR 0.57 [95%CI: 0.47–0.68], p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Rates of surgical intervention for ASBO vary significantly across tertiary children's hospitals in the United States. The variability was independent of patient and hospital characteristics and is likely due to practice variation.

### A systematic review of outcomes reported in small bowel obstruction research [^117G2eah]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a condition which is commonly treated by general surgeons. The evidence base for treatment of this condition is limited in part by variable reporting of outcomes in the literature. The aim of this study was to identify commonly used outcomes in research on SBO.

Methods

This review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017065538). Searches were performed of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify prospective cohort or randomized trials reporting outcomes of interventions in SBO. Studies addressing diagnostics, pediatric populations, and SBO due to malignancy were excluded. Studies were screened for inclusion. Study and outcome characteristics were extracted into a -predesigned pro forma and mapped onto the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) framework.

Results

A total of 1222 studies were screened for eligibility, 74 full text articles retrieved, and 51 studies included for synthesis. A total of 50 different outcomes were used. Duration of hospital stay was the most frequently reported outcome (n = 21 studies). Resolution of SBO was reported in 12 studies but only defined in eight studies which used six different definitions. Patient-reported outcomes were reported in only four studies.

Conclusions

There is a high degree of variation in the outcomes reported in SBO research. There is a clear need for a core outcome set. Development of a patient-reported outcome measure for this condition should also be explored.

### Adhesive small bowel obstruction following abdominal surgery in young children (≤ 3 years): a retrospective analysis of incidence and risk factors using multivariate cox regression [^115qvKxn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adhesions following abdominal surgery can cause small bowel obstruction (SBO) necessitating surgery. Whilst some studies have addressed SBO in children, the incidence of SBO, the diseases that are of increased risk as well as risk factors in young children remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to determine; (1) the general incidence of SBO in young children, (2) which diseases entail highest incidence of SBO and (3) risk factors for SBO in young children.

Study Design

Young children (≤ 3 years of age) who underwent abdominal surgery in our tertiary referral centre between 1998–2018 were retrospectively included. Both general incidence and incidence per disease of SBO were determined. Independent risk factors for SBO were identified using cox-regression.

Results

The incidence of SBO was 5% (N = 88/1931) in our cohort. Five of the SBOs developed following laparoscopic treatment. Patients treated for gastroschisis (17%, N = 9/53), necrotizing enterocolitis (8%, N = 15/188) and intestinal atresia (7%, N = 13/177) were at high risk of experiencing SBO. Diaphragmatic hernia (28%, N = 7/25) and meconium ileus (28%, N = 7/25) also showed high SBO proportions. Having a history of stoma (HR:3.2, 95%-CI:2.0–5.2), undergoing emergency surgery (HR:2.2, 95%-CI:1.3–3.7) and postoperative infections (HR:1.9, 95%-CI:1.2–3.1) were general risk factors for the development of SBO.

Conclusion

The incidence of SBO in young children seems higher than what has previously been reported in older children, which is why they should be studied separately. The incidence of SBO differs between diseases. Having a history of a stoma, emergency surgery and postoperative infections were independent risk factors for SBO development. Although less at risk, SBOs do develop after laparoscopies, which is why they should be included in more long-term follow-up studies.

### Laparoscopic treatment of intussusception in children: a systematic review [^116Gkmzv]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intussusception is one of the most common causes of small bowel obstruction in children. In the event of failed radiological reduction, laparotomy remains the treatment of choice. There is still no agreement in pediatric surgery about safety and effectiveness of the use of minimally invasive surgery in this common pediatric condition. By reviewing available data we aimed to establish whether laparoscopy should be the primary technique in the surgical reduction of intussusception.

Methods

A systematic review of all publications on the laparoscopic treatment of pediatric intussusception from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed. The following variables were analyzed: age, laparoscopic success rate, reason for conversion, enterotomy rate, operative time, complications, and length of stay (LOS).

Results

Ten retrospective studies treating 276 cases of laparoscopically reduced intussusception were identified. A total of 80 conversions corresponded to a 71.0% laparoscopic success rate. Only one case of intraoperative iatrogenic intestinal perforation was reported (0.4%). Postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (2.9%), and adhesive small bowel obstruction was reported in 1 case (0.4%). Recurrence rate after laparoscopy was 3.6%. Three of 10 papers compared results between laparoscopic and open reduction of intussusception showing a shorter mean LOS in the former group (4.0 vs. 7.1 days, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Laparoscopy is safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric intussusception. Tertiary centers with adequate minimally invasive skills should establish laparoscopy as the primary surgical technique in the treatment of this condition.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^116jkG6X]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Our institution does not require ethical permission for secondary research using primary literature. The research is reported according to the Preferred Reporting terms for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA).

Target condition, search strategy, and study selection

We wrote a protocol and then developed and piloted a search string to identify imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables (including existing models) potentially predictive of SBO resolution without operative management (Online supplementary material 1). We used terms to identify studies of bowel obstruction/ileus. We included terms to identify prognostic research. We limited to adults and excluded narrative reviews, editorials, letters, etc. We searched the US National Library of Medicine PUBMED journal citation database from 2001 to 2021 inclusive. This search was supplemented by a subsequent review of references cited by included studies. The search was performed in September 2021 by two radiologists (VE, DB), one of whom had > 10 years of experience in systematic review design, data extraction, and analysis.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

We included studies investigating imaging variables potentially predictive of SBO resolution without the need for operative management (or, depending on how the research was framed, factors that predicted surgical intervention). We excluded studies limited to colonic obstruction; solely paediatric studies; studies solely of malignant obstruction; studies limited to early post-operative obstruction (a separate entity with different aetiology); studies limited to inflammatory bowel disease or chronic functional obstruction. We did not specifically set out to exclude studies that did not include intravenous contrast for CT scanning because we anticipated that the large majority would administer contrast, and contrast only influences one potential predictor variable, mucosal enhancement. We also anticipated that any representative consecutive series would include some patients in whom IV contrast is contraindicated but from whom other potential predictors could be extracted. We excluded studies reporting less than five patients in either operative or conservative groups, since these are underpowered.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of small bowel obstruction: evidence-based recommendations [^111jwYqH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a commonly diagnosed disease in the emergency department (ED). Recent literature has evaluated the ED investigation and management of SBO.

Objective

This review evaluates the ED investigation and management of adult SBO based on the current literature.

Discussion

SBO is most commonly due to occlusion of the small intestine, resulting in fluid and gas accumulation. This may progress to mucosal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A variety of etiologies are present, but in adults, adhesions are the most common cause. Several classification systems are present. However, the most important distinction is complete vs. partial and complicated vs. simple obstruction, as complete complicated SBO more commonly requires surgical intervention. History and physical examination can vary, but the most reliable findings include prior abdominal surgery, history of constipation, abdominal distension, and abnormal bowel sounds. Signs of strangulation include fever, hypotension, diffuse abdominal pain, peritonitis, and several others. Diagnosis typically requires imaging, and though plain radiographs are often ordered, they cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography and ultrasound are reliable diagnostic methods. Management includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and determining need for operative vs. nonoperative therapy. Nasogastric tube is useful for patients with significant distension and vomiting by removing contents proximal to the site of obstruction. Surgery is needed for strangulation and those that fail nonoperative therapy. Surgical service evaluation and admission are recommended.

Conclusion

SBO is a common reason for admission from the ED. Knowledge of recent literature can optimize diagnosis and management.

### Posttraumatic small bowel obstruction in children [^111gT4Hb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of intestinal injuries in children after blunt abdominal trauma can be difficult and delayed. Most children who suffer blunt abdominal trauma are managed nonoperatively, making the diagnosis of intestinal injuries more difficult. We sought to gain information about children who develop intestinal obstruction after blunt abdominal trauma by reviewing our experience.

Methods

Review of records from a pediatric tertiary care center over an 11.5-year period revealed 5 patients who developed small bowel obstruction after blunt trauma to the abdomen. The details of these patients were studied.

Results

All patients were previously managed nonoperatively for blunt abdominal trauma. Intestinal obstruction developed 2 weeks to 1 year (median, 21 days) after the trauma. Abdominal x-ray, computerized tomography scan, or barium meal studies were used to establish the diagnosis. The pathology was either a stricture, an old perforation, or adhesions causing the intestinal obstruction. Laparotomy with resection and anastomosis was curative.

Conclusions

Posttraumatic small bowel obstruction is a clinical entity that needs to be watched for in all patients managed nonoperatively for blunt abdominal trauma.

### Small bowel obstruction [^113V7zqS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on small bowel obstruction:

- **Definition**: SBO is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms related to mechanical blockage of the small bowel.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common etiologies include adhesions (65%), hernias (10%), neoplasms (5%), and Crohn's disease (5%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of SBO is approximately 100 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The distension of small bowel segments that are proximal to the obstruction may lead to clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bacterial translocation can result in bacteremia. Progressive, untreated obstruction may lead to bowel ischemia and perforation, with secondary fecal peritonitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with SBO due to postoperative adhesions, in-hospital mortality is estimated at 4.7%. In patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for SBO, 1-month mortality is estimated at 7.2%.

### Paediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction is associated with a substantial economic burden and high frequency of postoperative complications [^115z1yP7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal adhesions can lead to adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). The incidence of ASBO is higher in paediatric surgery than in adult surgery. However, ASBO related complications, economic burden and clear management guidelines in the treatment of ASBO are lacking. The aims of this study were to investigate underlying diagnoses, treatments, complications and costs in paediatric ASBO.

Method

An observational retrospective study in children 0–15 years, hospitalised for ASBO during 2000–2020. Data were extracted from the medical records. Complications were classified based on Clavien Dindo Classification of Surgical Complications. Descriptive statistics were presented as median, continuous variables and categorical variables summarised with frequencies. Time to ASBO was presented as a Kaplan-Meier estimate.

Results

In total, 101 patients with 137 episodes of ASBO were included whereof 58.4% underwent first (index) surgery during the neonatal period. Median follow-up was 11.3 (0.6–19) years and median time to the first ASBO was 3.76 months (95%CI 2.23–12.02). The most common diagnoses at index surgery were necrotising enterocolitis, duodenal obstruction and primary ASBO. In 86.6% of the patients, first ASBO did not resolve with conservative treatment and a laparotomy was needed. Postoperative complications were found in 52%. Median cost for one episode of acute ASBO was 36 236 USD (1629–236 159).

Conclusion

Neonatal surgery was the dominating cause of ASBO and surgical intervention the most common treatment with a high frequency of postoperative complications and significant healthcare costs. Future studies are needed to develop safe management guidelines for the treatment of paediatric ASBO.

### Postoperative complications of colectomy and J-pouch with ileostomy versus without ileostomy in children with inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113h8qau]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review included 23 studies (658 patients), among which 7 studies quantified complications of interest between the J-pouch/IPAA with ileostomy procedure versus without. Results from the meta-analysis demonstrated that there is no difference in postoperative complications, specifically anastomotic leaks, when comparing pediatric patients with J-pouch with ileostomy versus patients with J-pouch without ileostomy. Avoiding a diverting ileostomy in select patients could be a safe alternative because there is no evidence of a protective benefit against leaks when using a diverting ileostomy. The majority of studies had small sample sizes, with CIs overlapping one, which reduces statistical confidence in the findings. In the adult literature, anastomotic leak rates range from 5% to 19%, and there seems to be a trend towards decreased clinically detectable leak rates in the diverted versus undiverted group. This finding does not align with previous literature reporting higher incidence of anastomotic leakage in the undiverted than diverted populations.

No statistical difference was found in small bowel obstruction in diverted versus undiverted pediatric patients, which contrasts with prior literature. Although the target populations differ, one study of a clinical sample of adults showed significantly higher odds of small bowel obstruction in diverted patients (OR 5.05 (1.35 to 18.92)) than undiverted patients after adjusting for steroid use, age, length of follow-up, prior subtotal colectomy and primary preoperative diagnosis. Moreover, restorative proctocolectomy requires extensive bowel manipulation and pelvis dissection, and manipulating the small bowel for ileostomy might increase the incidence of clinically distinguished small bowel obstruction. Additionally, small bowel obstruction resulting from an abscess is a prevalent complication after proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis.

### Adhesive small bowel obstruction in children and adolescents: operative utilization and factors associated with bowel loss [^111KSrKT]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) develops in ~5% of children and adolescents after major abdominal surgery. The aims of this study were to: 1) describe the current use of operative management in children and adolescents with ASBO and 2) investigate the association between operative delay and the rate of small bowel resection.

Study Design

All patients 2 to 20 years of age admitted with ASBO in the 2003 and 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) were identified. Rates of operative intervention were described, and factors associated with small bowel resection were analyzed in a logistic regression model.

Results

Of 2,089 patients admitted with ASBO, 1,786 (85.5%) underwent operative intervention with lysis of adhesions (LOA; n = 1,493; 83.6%) or small bowel resection (SBR; n = 293; 16.4%). Factors associated with the use of operative intervention in univariate analysis included younger age (p < 0.001), race (p = 0.034), and management at a children's hospital (p < 0.001). The time from admission until operation (mean ± SD) was significantly longer in patients who underwent SBR (2.1 ± 2.6 days) compared with LOA (1.5 ± 2.0 days; p < 0.001). Compared with patients who underwent surgery within the first day after admission, the adjusted odds of SBR were similar on the second day after admission (odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 2.09) but increased when surgery was performed on days 3–14 (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.34).

Conclusions

The majority of children and adolescents admitted with ASBO currently undergo operative management, and 16.4% of these patients receive small bowel resections. Operative intervention should be considered in patients who do not exhibit signs of improvement by the second day after admission to avoid potentially increasing the risk for bowel loss.

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^112EdT5A]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

Abstract

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) is an uncommon condition that can lead to upper gastrointestinal obstruction. Although SMAS is a rare diagnosis, our patient, a 13-year-old adolescent boy with no relevant medical or surgical history, had a classical presentation of the disorder. In this article, we discuss the risk factors, common presentation, and treatment options of SMAS, and why it is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of a pediatric patient presenting with bilious emesis and no other risk factors for intestinal obstruction.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^111KJDJU]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Intussusception is defined as the telescoping or invagination of one segment of the gastrointestinal tract into an adjacent segment. This condition can lead to various complications, such as bowel obstruction, ischemia, and even perforation. It is most commonly observed in children, where it is typically primary and benign, often resolving with nonoperative reduction using a water‐soluble contrast enema. In contrast, intussusception is rare in adults, accounting for approximately 5% of all cases of intussusception and accounting for approximately 1%–5% of intestinal obstructions. Pediatric intussusception is characterized by the classic triad of abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and 'red currant jelly' stool, although this triad is present in only a minority of cases. In adults, diagnosis is more challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, which can be acute or chronic and often require further diagnostic work‐up, such as imaging or endoscopy. Whereas nonoperative management represents the initial treatment strategy in pediatric intussusceptions; adult intussusceptions involve a lead point in up to 92% of patients, potentially related to a malignant tumor and therefore requiring different management. Whereas surgery is often required to determine the underlying etiology, the optimal surgical strategy remains a subject of debate. Although surgical reduction may prevent unnecessary bowel resection, it carries risks, including intraluminal seeding or venous tumor dissemination in cases of malignancy, or spillage in cases of perforation. Currently, there are no established guidelines for the surgical management of intussusception in adult patients, with most available data derived from individual institutional case series.

With advancements in technology and the widespread use of CT‐scans in both emergency and elective settings, the detection rate of incidental or small intussusceptions is increasing. This has further fueled debate concerning their treatment and the possibility of conservative management.

For these reasons, the primary objectives of this study were to conduct a systematic review of the literature on adult intussusception and secondly to propose a management algorithm to guide surgeons in their daily practice.

### Small bowel obstruction after pediatric liver transplantation: the unusual is the usual [^1134kyGT]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Intestinal obstruction is a rare but serious complication after liver transplantation. Adhesions are the most common cause of obstruction in the nontransplantation setting; however, after pediatric liver transplantation unusual causes must be considered.

Study Design

A prospectively maintained institutional database was analyzed for all reoperations for intestinal obstruction on pediatric liver allograft recipients from 1990 to 2009.

Results

During the study period, 181 pediatric patients underwent liver transplantation at the study center. The most common indication for transplantation was biliary atresia. Seven patients required reoperation for intestinal obstruction. All 7 patients had abdominal operations before transplantation and 5 of 7 received reduced-size grafts. No patients had adhesive small bowel obstruction. The cause was right-sided diaphragmatic hernia in 4 and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in 3. Diaphragmatic hernia was demonstrated by chest radiograph in 3 of 4 patients. The fourth was taken to surgery with a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a diaphragmatic hernia was found at exploration. In patients with PTLD causing obstruction, 2 presented with an obstructing mass and the third presented with intussusception. Mean time to reoperation was 29 months after liver transplantation. Patients with diaphragmatic hernia presented earlier post-transplantation than those with PTLD (4.2 ± 2.4 months versus 59.3 ± 54.6 months, respectively; p = 0.0003, Fisher's exact test). Six patients are alive at a median follow-up of 5.8 years. One patient succumbed to recurrent B-cell lymphoma.

Conclusions

Intestinal obstruction after pediatric liver transplantation is commonly related to what would conventionally be considered unusual causes. A high index of suspicion must be maintained and early operative therapy considered as obstruction because causes such as diaphragmatic hernia and PTLD are unlikely to resolve with conservative measures.

### Small bowel emergency surgery: literature's review [^116NkUua]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Mechanical small bowel obstruction

Acute mechanical obstruction of the intestine is a common surgical emergency and a major cause of admission to emergency surgery departments. Small bowel obstruction occurs when there is an obstacle to the flow of luminal contents caused by an extrinsic or intrinsic encroachment on the lumen. Adynamic ileus presents the same symptoms of mechanical obstruction but the underlying problem is disordered motility. One of the keys to management of intestinal obstruction is early diagnosis. Particularly, accurate early recognition of strangulation is crucial because this emergency causes bowel ischemia, necrosis and perforation. In neonates most common causes are atresia, midgut volvulus and meconium ileus, in infants groin hernia, intussusception and Meckel's diverticulum, whereas in young adults and adults adhesions and groin hernia. In small bowel obstruction the normal mechanisms of intestinal absorption are compromised, so an excess of fluid loss occurs. Initially vomiting, bowel wall edema and transudation into the peritoneal cavity are present, whereas in the later stages venous pressure increases with consequent bleeding into the lumen and aggravation of hypovolemia. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Main symptoms are abdominal pain, absence of flatus or stool, nausea or vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal distension if the obstruction is not in proximal jejunum. Moreover the kind of pain suggests the level of the small bowel obstruction. Proximal obstruction tend to present with more frequent cramps whereas distal obstructions cause less severe cramps with longer duration between episodes. Laboratory tests show an elevated hematocrit because of intravascular volume loss. A significant leukocytosis could indicate a strangulation or perforation. Plain X-rays of the abdomen reveal dilatation of the small bowel and air-fluid levels. CT scan, eventually with oral contrast, shows the dilatation of proximal bowel and the collapse of distal bowel. Also ultrasounds may be useful. The key of management of small bowel obstruction is the identification of intestinal strangulation, because mortality increases from 2 to 10 folds in such cases. Therefore an immediate surgical repair with an eventual bowel resection is mandatory. However, the clinical diagnosis of small bowel strangulation is extremely difficult and CT scan becomes very useful, usually on the basis of either bowel wall thickening, mesenteric edema, asymmetrical enhancement with contrast, pneumatosis, or portal venous gas. Mortality for small bowel obstruction has decreased during the past 50 to 60 years from 25% to 5%. Initial therapy aims at correction of depletion of intravascular fluids and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient should be given nothing by mouth and nasogastric tube should be inserted in patients with emesis. In patients with adhesive small intestine obstruction, water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin ®) with a follow-through study has not only a diagnostic but also a therapeutic role, because it is safe and reduces the operative rate and the time to resolution of obstruction, as well as the hospital stay. Surgical intervention is instead mandatory for patients with a complete small bowel obstruction with signs or symptoms indicative of strangulation, perforation or those patients with simple obstruction that has not resolved within 24 to 48 hours of non operative treatment. The surgical approach includes adhesiolysis and resection of non viable intestine. The extension of intestinal resection depends on the purple or black discoloration of ischemic or necrotic bowel. Viable intestine also has mesenteric arterial pulsation and normal motility. When ischemic damage is more limited, is sufficient adhesiolysis followed by a 10–15 minutes period of observation to allow for possible improvement in the gross appearance of the involved segment.

Non-contrast CT further demonstrated soft-tissue density lesions containing punctate or clustered high-density calcifications, precisely delineating anatomical relationships with adjacent mesenteric vessels. While ultrasound excels in real-time assessment of bowel dynamics, CT provided critical complementary information through:

Characterization of calcification distribution patterns;
Morphological discrimination between calcification types (e.g. irregular dystrophic calcifications versus homogeneous osteoid deposits).

Crucially, while these features are highly suggestive, definitive diagnosis of CFT requires histopathological and immunohistochemical confirmation.

Surgical resection constitutes the definitive management for CFT, with its characteristic benign biological behavior supported by established literature. The child showed no signs of recurrence during the initial 2-month follow-up period, though long-term surveillance remains essential to confirm durable remission. Continued monitoring beyond this timeframe is warranted.

This study has several limitations. First, it is a single-case report, so the clinical and imaging features described may not fully represent the spectrum of pediatric small intestinal CFT. Second, the follow-up period was only 2 months, which limits our ability to evaluate long-term recurrence risk and the durability of surgical outcomes. Future multi-center studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up are needed to better characterize the disease, validate the diagnostic value of ultrasound, and optimize management strategies.

### Trends in management of index adhesive small bowel obstruction in children [^115xcH7p]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To examine practice patterns and surgical outcomes of nonoperative versus operative management (OPM) of children presenting with an index adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO).

Methods

A California statewide health discharge database was used to identify children (< 18 y old) with an index ASBO from 2007 to 2020. The primary study outcome was evaluating initial management patterns (nonoperative versus OPM and early [≤ 3 d] versus late surgery [> 3 d]) of ASBO. Secondary outcomes were hospital characteristics, patient demographics, and postoperative complications.

Results

Of the 2297 patients identified, 1948 (85%) underwent OPM for ASBO during the index admission. Of these, 14.7% underwent early surgery within 3 d. Teaching hospitals had higher operative intervention than nonteaching centers (87.1% versus 83.7%, P = 0.034). OPM was the highest in 0–5-year-olds compared to other ages (89% versus 82%, P < 0.001). In comparison to early surgery, late surgery was associated with longer length of stay (early 7[interquartile range 5–10], late 9[interquartile range 6–17], P < 0.001), increased infectious complications (16.4% versus 9.8%, P = 0.004), and greater use of total parenteral nutrition (28.0% versus 14.3%, P = 0.001); there was no difference in bowel resection (21% versus 18%, P = 0.102) or mortality (P = 0.423).

Conclusions

Our pediatric study demonstrated a high rate of OPM for index ASBO, especially in newborns and toddlers. Although operative intervention, especially late surgery, was associated with increased length of stay, increased infectious complications, and increased total parenteral nutrition use, the rates of bowel resection and mortality did not differ by management strategy. These trends need to be further evaluated to optimize outcomes.

### Practical imaging strategies for intussusception in children [^114R6BKK]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in young children. Radiology has a key role in its diagnosis and treatment. This systematic review summarizes the currently available evidence for best practices in radiologic management of pediatric intussusception. CONCLUSION. High diagnostic accuracy and lack of ionizing radiation make ultrasound (US) the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing intussusception. For intussusception reduction, fluoroscopy-guided pneumatic enema and US-guided hydrostatic enema are equally dependable and safe techniques. The areas that warrant further research in this field include the efficacy and safety of the US-guided pneumatic enema, potential benefits of sedation and general anesthesia for the reduction procedure, and the optimal management of intussusceptions potentially involving pathologic lead points.

### Multidetector CT of bowel obstruction: value of post-processing [^115wEoH9]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The value of imaging in patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction is dependent on the ability to answer questions relevant to the clinical management of patients. Is there mechanical obstruction? Is it a small bowel obstruction (SBO) or a large bowel obstruction (LBO)? What is the transition point? What is the cause of the obstruction? What is the severity of the obstruction? The results of studies published more than 10 years ago using axial and single-slice helical CT gave rise to findings based on axial slices that enables CT to answer these different questions. With the recent advent of multislice CT, large numbers of thin sections can be generated with short image intervals, which is well suited to postprocessing. Postprocessing techniques include standard reformatting methods such as sagittal, coronal and oblique reformatting, curved reformatting, maximum and minimum-intensity projection, variable thickness viewing, and volume and surface rendering. This pictorial review illustrates the added value of postprocessing for answering different questions concerning patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction.

### Management of pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction: Do timing of surgery and age matter? [^116RmJrj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) in children is generally managed with initial observation. However, no clear guidelines exist regarding indications to operate. Our purpose was to compare outcomes of ASBO management to determine whether timing of surgery and patient age should affect management.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of children admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital for ASBO between 2011 and 2015 was performed. Data included demographics, imaging, operative findings, and clinical management, which were analyzed using χ² test, Fischer's exact test, t-test, analysis of variance, or logistic regression when appropriate.

Results

We identified 258 admissions for 202 patients. Urgent operation was performed in 12% and the rest had nonoperative management (NOM), which was successful in 54%. Patients younger than 1 y of age were more likely to require operation (odds ratio 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69–8.15; P < 0.01), and patients with prior ASBO were less likely to require operation (odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.31–0.84; P < 0.01). At presentation, fever was most common in patients who had urgent operation (22.3% versus failure of NOM 7.6% versus successful NOM 6.6%; P = 0.02), but there were no differences in leukocytosis or abdominal pain. Excluding urgent operations, bowel resection was more common when operation was delayed more than 48 h (32.6% versus 15.3%; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

In children with adhesive small bowel obstruction, NOM can be successful, but when failure is suspected, early operation before 48 h should be considered to avoid bowel loss, especially in children younger than 1 y of age.

Water-soluble contrast administration X-ray

A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction but cannot distinguish different large bowel obstruction causes.

A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for adhesive small bowel obstruction non-operative management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 h after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery with an active therapeutic role.

The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe in terms of morbidity and mortality, but adverse effects due to their use have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications are aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered when the stomach has been adequately decompressed through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that water-soluble contrast agents, because of higher osmolarity, may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction, shifting fluids into bowel lumen; in some children and elderly adults, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

The contrast medium may be administered on the dosage of 50–150 ml, either orally or via nasogastric tube, and can be given both at immediate admission and after an attempt of initial traditional conservative treatment of 48 h. The practice of giving water-soluble contrast at 48 h may reduce both the risk of aspiration pneumonia and of dehydration because the patient should have been adequately rehydrated. In this situation, the contrast material can be diluted with water.

Rare anaphylactoid reactions following the use of oral contrast media have been reported.

Caution in their administration may be warranted in patients at high risk of gastropathy.

Ultrasound

Small bowel obstruction can be diagnosed with ultrasound if there are > 2.5-cm dilated loops of the bowel that are proximal to collapsed loops of bowel and if there is decreased or absent peristalsis activity. Using ultrasound for small bowel obstruction diagnosis has 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity.

Visualization of large bowel obstruction with ultrasound is as good as computed tomography. Computed tomography is clearly superior to ultrasound in terms of the etiologic definition for both small bowel obstruction and large bowel obstruction. Ultrasound performs better than planar abdominal X-ray in large bowel obstruction.

### Small bowel obstruction: the role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted. The onus therefore rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischaemia and perforation which will prompt surgical intervention. This review will discuss the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outline its impact on patient management.

Young patients

The risk of adhesion-related complications is life-long. Although most small bowel obstructions will occur within the first 2 years after surgery, new cases continue to develop many years after the primary operation. Also, the risk of requiring a future reoperation for unrelated causes is higher in younger patients. Pediatric patients, who are at the extreme of young age, have a high risk for adhesion-related complications. In a recent cohort of patients who underwent surgery at a pediatric age, the incidence of adhesive small bowel obstruction was 12.6% after a median follow-up of 14.7 years.

Young patients therefore might have the highest lifetime benefit from adhesion prevention. No trials with adhesion barriers have been performed in pediatric surgery, but a recent cohort study in pediatric patients showed a significant reduction in ASBO with the use of a hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose adhesion barrier. After a follow-up of 24 months, 2.0% of pediatric patients operated with adhesion barrier versus 4.5% of patients operated on without adhesion barrier developed ASBO.

Elderly patients

In elderly patients, quality of life considerations are extremely important in decision making. Patients with a high frailty index have a prolonged recovery after a surgical procedure and may not be able to return to their previous functional state and quality of life.

The principles of treatment for adhesive small bowel obstruction might interfere with comorbidities and medication in the elderly patients. There is a marked paucity of research on the consequences of stopping or withholding oral medications when a patient is put on nil per os for non-operative treatment of small bowel obstruction. A recent cohort showed that patients with diabetes might require earlier intervention although the level of evidence is rather low. Patients with diabetes were shown to suffer from a 7.5% incidence of acute kidney injury and 4.8% incidence of myocardial infarction if the operation was delayed more than 24 h. The incidence of these complications was significantly higher when compared to diabetic patients that were operated within 24 h and non-diabetic patients with delayed operation.

### NASPGHAN guidelines for training in pediatric gastroenterology [^112cLQaf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Short bowel syndrome and intestinal failure — trainees should understand that intestinal failure is the result of an insult to the bowel that occurs either as a result of congenital anomalies or as a result of an acquired catastrophe, and that the loss of bowel obligates nutrition support for a variable period to allow for adaptation of the intestine. Trainees in pediatric gastroenterology should understand the epidemiology and natural history of intestinal failure and recognize the complications of this syndrome, and should be aware of important factors including the length of the small intestine, the physiologic significance of loss of the ileum in terms of adaptation, the role of the colon and of the ileocecal valve, and the contribution of bowel obstruction, bloodstream infection, percentage of enteral feeding, and the composition and delivery of parenteral nutrition in the genesis and evolution of cholestasis. Trainees should be familiar with the early postsurgical consequences of the syndrome, the associated surgical and medical complications, and the long-term consequences of a short bowel, including intestinal failure, nutritional deficiencies, bloodstream infection, bacterial overgrowth, difficult vascular access, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, portal hypertension, and liver failure.

Computed tomography (CT) has become established as an ideal form of imaging in small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially with modern day multiplanar imaging that is now widely available. CT can confirm the presence of SBO; show the site, level, and cause of obstruction accurately; and detect strangulation. It is important to recognize the common and unusual causes, but also conditions that mimic SBO. This review illustrates a spectrum of causes and discusses conditions that mimic SBO and their differentiation and the limitations of CT in the assessment of suspected SBO.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^113NZbQj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, accounting for almost 50% of all emergency laparotomies with significant in-hospital morbidity and costs. Most patients with SBO have undergone previous abdominal operations (80%), with adhesions as the single most common cause (60–75%) of SBO. However, SBO also occurs in patients who had no prior abdominal surgery, referred to as a virgin abdomen.

In the past decade, a paradigm shift in the treatment of SBO in patients with previous abdominal surgery has been implemented. Today, the majority of small bowel obstructions are managed non-operatively, treatment comprising bowel decompression, water-soluble contrast agents, and fluid resuscitation. Non-operative management has been found safe and efficacious in 70% of SBOs caused by adhesions (ASBO). Many authors, however, suggest that surgical exploration is still mandatory in the case of SBO in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA), based on the assumption that SBO-VA is usually caused by other etiologies than adhesions, such as malignancy, internal hernia, and bezoars as the most prominent causes.

On the other hand, recent studies suggest a high incidence of adhesions also in patients with SBO-VA. The origin of adhesions in the virgin abdomen can be congenital, or the results of (unrecognized) abdominal inflammation in the patients' history. The observation that most SBO-VA are caused by adhesions could have important implications for treatment, signifying that guidelines on the management of ASBO might also apply to the majority of patients with SBO-VA.

The present paper aims to provide an overview of the literature on the etiology and management of SBO-VA and to generate recommendations for clinical management and future research.

### CT of small-bowel obstruction in children: sensitivity and specificity [^111vpoZ2]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVE.:The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT in the diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction in children.

Materials and Methods

The CT scans of 30 children with surgically proven small-bowel obstruction, 22 children with ileus, and 29 children who served as controls were retrospectively reviewed by two of four interpreters who were unaware of the children's final diagnoses. Causes of obstruction in the patients included 19 adhesions, six cases of volvulus, five intussusceptions, four strictures, and two cases each of internal hernia and abscess. Eight obstructions had multiple causes. The CT scans were evaluated for the presence of small-bowel obstruction using a scale with five degrees of confidence. In cases of discrepancy of more than one level of certainty, a third interpreter was consulted. Criteria for small-bowel obstruction included a discrepancy in caliber between the proximal dilated and the more distal small bowels or generalized small-bowel dilatation (> 2.5 cm) in the presence of a collapsed colon. An interpreter's rating that an obstruction was either present or probable was considered a positive finding; a rating indicating that the interpreter was not sure whether an obstruction was present or believed that an obstruction was not probable or saw normal anatomic structures was considered a negative finding for small-bowel obstruction. The cause and level of obstruction also were recorded.

Results

There were 26 true-positive (87%) and four false-negative (13%) interpretations for small-bowel obstruction. Among the interpretations of scans of patients with ileus, 68% were true-negative and 32% were false-positive interpretations for small-bowel obstruction. Among the control group, there were no false-positive readings. Sensitivity of CT was 87%, specificity was 86%, and accuracy was 86%. In the scans of children 2 years and younger, CT had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 0%. Of the patients with surgically confirmed levels of obstruction, the correct level of obstruction was described by both interpreters in 12 (86%) of 14 scans. The causes of obstruction were correctly identified in 14 (47%) of 30 scans.

Conclusion

CT is both sensitive and specific for use in diagnosing small-bowel obstruction in children, especially in children older than 2 years.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^116nHuvB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations

Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO. Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.

Discussion

This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^112QB3NV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies and in particular of surgical emergencies that require an emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction was the indication for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical procedures that account for 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare expenditures in the USA. Adhesive small bowel obstruction was the most common diagnosis for both the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, accounting for 60% of cases.

ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in 8 days of hospitalization on average and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20 and 30% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction require operative treatment. Length of hospitalization and morbidity depend on the need for surgical intervention. Average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative treatment. Associated costs in a Dutch study in 2016 were estimated at €16,305 for surgical and €2227 for non-operative treatment.

Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common condition, the prevention and treatment is often characterized by surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a large amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in publications regarding treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Therefore, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) working group on ASBO has developed evidence-based guidelines to support clinical decision making in diagnosis and management of ASBO. In the present revision of these guidelines, all recommendations were updated according to the latest evidence available from the medical literature. Further, we have introduced two new sections: prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.
