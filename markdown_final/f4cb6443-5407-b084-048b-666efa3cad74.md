## Question

Antibiotic for RSV ￼￼

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics should be used for RSV and, if so, when they are indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of RSV and whether antibiotics target the cause. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about routine antibiotic use in RSV bronchiolitis. Next, I will review the evidence base, including randomized trials and systematic reviews, to see if antibiotics improve outcomes. After that, I need to check the real-world extent of antibiotic overuse and its consequences. Finally, I will identify the narrow scenarios where antibiotics are appropriate and outline a practical, stewardship-aligned approach to decision-making and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. RSV is a viral infection of the respiratory epithelium causing airway inflammation, edema, mucus plugging, and obstruction; antibiotics do not have antiviral activity and therefore do not treat the underlying cause, so routine use is not mechanistically justified [^3b448516] [^e8ac1e5e].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The AAFP 2023 rapid evidence review explicitly recommends not using antibiotics for RSV bronchiolitis unless there is evidence of a concurrent bacterial infection, and the AAP Choosing Wisely campaign advises against antibiotics in pediatric viral respiratory illnesses including bronchiolitis. The Canadian Paediatric Society likewise recommends no antibiotics unless bacterial infection is suspected, reinforcing a consistent, high-credibility consensus against routine antibiotic use in RSV [^07106072] [^8dd53ab9] [^e861f5b9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the evidence base. Multiple randomized controlled trials and Cochrane reviews show no benefit of antibiotics for bronchiolitis in terms of symptom duration, length of stay, or readmissions, and a 2014 Cochrane review pooling 824 participants found no significant advantage of antibiotics over placebo for key outcomes. A small clarithromycin trial suggested shorter hospital stay and less readmission, but the sample was tiny and the signal has not been replicated in larger, high-quality studies, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^a604e4e9] [^c2846ebb] [^a3e419cb].

> I should double-check the magnitude of overuse and its consequences. Observational data show antibiotics are prescribed in roughly 40–60% of RSV hospitalizations despite very low rates of confirmed bacterial coinfection, and a prospective multicenter study using an expert panel found that about one-third of RSV LRTI cases received unnecessary antibiotics. Population-level analyses estimate that RSV accounts for approximately 6% of pediatric antibiotic prescriptions in the US, with macrolides disproportionately represented, underscoring substantial stewardship opportunities and risks of resistance and adverse effects [^b0e652ca] [^87b699f3] [^206b5ba3].

> But wait, what if the child is severely ill or in respiratory failure; could antibiotics help then? Let me consider the narrow exceptions. In severe disease with respiratory failure or ICU admission, the pretest probability of bacterial coinfection may be higher, and some data suggest that empiric antibiotics pending cultures can be reasonable in that context; however, even in PICU cohorts, culture-confirmed bacterial infection remains uncommon, so antibiotics should be started narrowly and stopped promptly if no bacterial source is identified. Outside of these severe presentations, routine antibiotics are not indicated [^0b9fb801] [^b2d6c961].

> I need to ensure I am precise about when antibiotics are actually indicated. Antibiotics are appropriate when there is clinical evidence of bacterial coinfection such as focal consolidation or lobar pneumonia on exam or imaging, persistent high fever with leukocytosis and clinical deterioration, purulent sputum in older children, or positive cultures from a normally sterile site; conversely, routine viral testing or chest radiography does not, by itself, justify antibiotics, and guidelines advise against routine viral testing or CXR in uncomplicated bronchiolitis, reinforcing a clinical, context-driven approach rather than test-triggered prescribing [^07106072] [^315dc5c0] [^f965890c].

> Let me think about special populations and edge cases. In immunocompromised hosts or those with complex chronic disease, the threshold to evaluate for bacterial coinfection may be lower, but even then, antibiotics should be targeted to documented or strongly suspected bacterial sources rather than used routinely for RSV alone. Likewise, in adults with RSV, delayed viral diagnosis is associated with more antibiotic use, highlighting the need for timely viral testing to support de-escalation when appropriate [^d41547f2] [^cdc40f58].

> I should confirm the practical approach. For most children with RSV bronchiolitis, management is supportive: maintain oxygenation, ensure hydration, and avoid unnecessary interventions. If antibiotics are started empirically for concern of bacterial coinfection, reassess within 24–48 hours and discontinue if there is no supportive evidence of bacterial disease. This aligns with stewardship principles and minimizes harm without compromising safety in the rare cases of true bacterial infection [^07106072] [^b3a3a7d2].

> In summary, I need to be clear: antibiotics are not indicated for routine treatment of RSV bronchiolitis because RSV is viral and antibiotics do not improve outcomes. They should be reserved for suspected or confirmed bacterial coinfection, with the strongest rationale in severe disease requiring ICU-level care, and even then, use should be time-limited and de-escalated promptly if bacterial infection is not confirmed [^07106072] [^a604e4e9] [^0b9fb801].

Antibiotics are **not indicated for RSV** because it is a viral illness and antibiotics do not affect viral replication or clinical outcomes [^e8ac1e5e]. Antibiotics should only be used if there is **clear evidence of bacterial coinfection** (e.g. pneumonia, otitis media) [^07106072] [^e861f5b9]. Routine antibiotic use in RSV is discouraged by major guidelines due to lack of benefit and risks of adverse effects and resistance [^8dd53ab9] [^a604e4e9]. Supportive care — oxygen, hydration, and monitoring — is the standard of care [^b3a3a7d2] [^aed4e6d4].

---

## Pathophysiology of RSV and rationale against antibiotic use

RSV is a **viral pathogen** that infects the respiratory epithelium, causing inflammation, mucus production, and airway obstruction [^3b448516]. Antibiotics target bacterial cell walls or protein synthesis and have **no effect on viral replication** or RSV disease progression [^e8ac1e5e]. Thus, antibiotics do not shorten illness duration, reduce severity, or prevent complications in RSV [^a604e4e9].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding antibiotic use in RSV

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews have evaluated antibiotics in RSV and consistently show **no clinical benefit**:

- **Cochrane review (2014)**: Seven RCTs (824 participants) found no significant benefit of antibiotics vs placebo in length of hospital stay, duration of oxygen therapy, or readmission rates [^a604e4e9].
- **Azithromycin trial (2020)**: In children with RSV respiratory failure, azithromycin did not reduce nasal MMP-9 (a marker of inflammation) and showed no clinical benefit, though a signal for fewer ventilation days was observed in a subgroup [^bc34ec0e].
- **Clarithromycin trial (2007)**: A small study suggested reduced readmissions, but the sample was tiny and results have not been replicated; thus, it is not practice-changing [^a3e419cb].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of unnecessary antibiotic use

Unnecessary antibiotics in RSV carry **meaningful risks**:

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and rare severe reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) [^notfound].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Overuse drives resistance, a major public health threat [^ce72ee40].
- **Microbiome disruption**: Alters gut flora, increasing risks of C. difficile and other infections [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major pediatric guidelines align in recommending **against routine antibiotics** in RSV:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) | Do not use antibiotics in pediatric viral respiratory illnesses, including RSV bronchiolitis, unless bacterial coinfection is suspected [^8dd53ab9] [^07106072] |
| Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) | Do not use antibiotics in children with bronchiolitis unless bacterial infection is suspected [^e861f5b9] |
| American Family Physician (AAFP) | Do not use antibiotics for RSV bronchiolitis unless bacterial coinfection is evident [^07106072] |

---

## Situations where antibiotics may be indicated

Antibiotics are appropriate only when there is **clear evidence of bacterial coinfection**, such as:

- **Bacterial pneumonia**: Focal consolidation on exam or imaging with clinical deterioration [^notfound].
- **Acute otitis media**: Bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane with effusion and symptoms [^notfound].
- **Sepsis-like presentation**: Persistent high fever, leukocytosis, and clinical instability suggesting bacterial infection [^notfound].

---

## Alternative and supportive treatments for RSV

Supportive care remains the cornerstone of RSV management:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^aed4e6d4].
- **Hydration**: Oral or IV fluids as needed [^b3a3a7d2].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent assessment of respiratory status and hydration [^b3a3a7d2].
- **Hospitalization**: For severe respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or inability to maintain hydration [^0ecfbe5f].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antibiotics are **not indicated for RSV** in the absence of bacterial coinfection. They do not improve outcomes and carry risks of adverse effects and resistance. Clinicians should adhere to guidelines, reserve antibiotics for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infections, and prioritize supportive care.

### Lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus: current management and new therapeutics [^e8ac1e5e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age. Evidence-based management guidelines suggest that there is no effective treatment for RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and that supportive care, ie, hydration and oxygenation, remains the cornerstone of clinical management. However, RSV treatments in development in the past decade include 10 vaccines and 11 therapeutic agents in active clinical trials. Maternal vaccination is particularly relevant because the most severe disease occurs within the first 6 months of life, when children are unlikely to benefit from active immunisation. We must optimise the implementation of novel RSV therapeutics by understanding the target populations, showing safety, and striving for acceptable pricing in the context of this worldwide health problem. In this Review, we outline the limitations of RSV LRTI management, the drugs in development, and the remaining challenges related to study design, regulatory approval, and implementation.

### Respiratory syncytial virus infection in children [^1564ad09]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections in children. In the North- ern Hemisphere, the peak infection season is November through April. By two years of age, most children will have had an RSV infection. Bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection, is often caused by RSV. An RSV infection is diagnosed based on patient history and physical examination. Children typically present with cough, coryza, and wheezing. Laboratory testing and chest radiography are not necessary to make the diagnosis. Serious concur- rent bacterial infections are rare. Treatment of an RSV infection is supportive, with particular attention to maintaining hydration and oxygenation. Children younger than 60 days and those with severe symptoms may require hospitalization. Neither antibiotics nor corticosteroids are helpful for bronchiolitis. A bronchodilator trial is appropriate for children with wheezing, but should not be continued unless there is a prompt favorable response. Frequent hand washing and contact isolation may prevent the spread of RSV infections. Children younger than two years at high risk of severe illness, including those born before 35 weeks of gestation and those with chronic lung or cardiac problems, may be candidates for palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV infection during the peak infection season. Most children recover uneventfully with supportive care.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prevention and therapy: past, present, and future [^08dab072]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common respiratory pathogen in infants and young children worldwide. More than 50 years after its discovery, and despite relentless attempts to identify pharmacological therapies to improve the clinical course and outcomes of this disease, the most effective therapy remains supportive care. Although the quest for a safe and effective vaccine remains unsuccessful, pediatricians practicing during the past decade have been able to protect at least the more vulnerable patients with safe and effective passive prophylaxis. This review summarizes the history, microbiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of this infection in order to provide the reader with the background information necessary to fully appreciate the many challenges presented by the clinical management of young children with bronchiolitis. The last part of this article attempts an evidence-based review of the pharmacologic strategies currently available and those being evaluated, intentionally omitting highly experimental approaches not yet tested in clinical trials and, therefore, not likely to become available in the foreseeable future.

### RSV immunization guidance for infants and young children… [^4ae5ea3a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- To prevent severe RSV disease in infants, either maternal RSV vaccination or infant immunization with a long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody is recommended. Most infants will not need both maternal vaccination and infant RSV antibodies.
- Administration of infant RSV antibody is recommended during October through March in most of the U. S. The optimal timing for infant RSV antibody administration is shortly before the RSV season begins, or within a baby's first week of life if born October through March.
- Infant RSV antibodies are highly effective in preventing RSV-associated hospitalization.
- Side effects are usually mild, such as pain, redness, or swelling where the injection was given, and resolve quickly. Hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon but have been reported with similar antibody products.

Overview Nirsevimab and clesrovimab are monoclonal antibodies that prevent severe RSV disease and are recommended for infants. Nirsevimab is also recommended for some young children. Monoclonal antibodies are not vaccines. They do not activate the immune system. Rather, the antibodies themselves protect against disease. Healthcare providers should discuss both the RSV maternal vaccine and infant RSV antibodies with parents and consider patient preferences when deciding which product is best for their patient's family. For infants eligible for RSV antibody with prolonged hospitalizations shortly before or during the RSV season, providers may consider administering RSV antibody during the hospitalization to prevent healthcare-associated RSV disease. This decision should be based on clinical judgment weighing the potential risks and benefits.

Effectiveness Nirsevimab Early real-world data show that nirsevimab was at least 70% effective in preventing babies from being hospitalized with RSV. In clinical studies among infants who were born during or entering their first RSV season, efficacy was evaluated through 150 days after injection. Pooled efficacy from Phase II and III clinical trials in preventing medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 79. 0% and efficacy in preventing RSV-associated LRTI with hospitalization was
80. 6%. Clesrovimab In clinical studies among infants who were born during or entering their first RSV season, efficacy for preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTI was 60. 4%, and efficacy for preventing RSV-associated LRTI with hospitalization was
90. 9% through 150 days after injection.

### Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis: drugs, antibiotics [^db9070d0]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

RSV bronchiolitis is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission and for visits to emergency departments for children, and at least half of affected infants will have subsequent episodes of respiratory illness. Despite this, there are wide variations in management. Initial assessment of respiratory status should include a measure of oxygenation and oxygen should be given when there is clinical evidence of respiratory distress even before full assessment is completed. Fluid and nutritional status should also be assessed early and decisions made about use of intravenous fluids, nasogastric feeding, or maintenance of frequent feeds orally. Given the lack of evidence on all drug therapies for bronchiolitis, clinicians should carefully evaluate treatments for their ability to reduce symptoms, decrease length of hospital stay and reduce sequelae. Furthermore, clinicians should monitor antibiotic use carefully and develop a strategy to change current physician practice.

### Treatment of respiratory syncytial virus: antiviral therapies [^8e47425e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants with bronchiolitis is complicated because of the multifactorial nature of this infection. The signs and symptoms of RSV result from a combination of direct viral cytopathic effects, host inflammatory responses that lead to airway obstruction and bronchoconstriction. It is logical that therapies targeting just one of these processes might be minimally effective, at best. Thus an important goal is to identify patients at risk and intervene to prevent disease, whenever possible. Once disease has been identified, the clinician must decide whether antiviral therapy is appropriate. Familiarity with typical viral load dynamics during the course of a lower respiratory tract infection can assist in the therapeutic decision process. For example in a patient who has had airway obstruction and other respiratory symptoms for > 3 days, viral load has already peaked. Clearly this pattern has important implications for antiviral therapies. Preventive strategies include educating parents and family about hand washing, cleaning environmental surfaces, isolating infants and children with infection and avoiding crowded places such as busy day-care centers. High risk patients, who meet the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for RSV prophylaxis, may be candidates for passive prophylaxis.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics [^3e6e538a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and young children worldwide and can cause LRTI in elderly and immunocompromised patients; it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in these target populations. No effective licensed therapies are generally available, but existing and emerging point-of-care diagnostics and investigational RSV-specific antiviral inhibitors offer promise of progress. In industrialized countries, RSV receives little publicity and is not widely recognized by the general public. There is a common, mistaken belief among drug developers that RSV is a disease primarily of preterm infants and that the disease is fundamentally different in term infants and older children. Furthermore, the adult market is assumed to be small. This underlines 2 of the fundamental obstacles that have constrained antiviral product development: perception of disease severity and clinical end points. This report summarizes outputs from 2 meetings addressing the challenges in developing RSV therapeutics.

### Where are we with RSV prophylaxis? [^ab7fbf20]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a predictable, seasonal disease with significant morbidity and mortality in children below 24months. Prophylaxis, which decreases hospitalisation in those most vulnerable to the disease, has been available since 1998. Pharmacological prophylaxis is however, expensive and requires good infrastructure to deliver. It is out of reach for many patients in low-income and middle-income countries where mortality is highest. This article looks at the pathophysiology and risk factors for RSV. It also outlines what agents are currently available for prophylaxis and prevention.

### Antibiotic overuse in children with respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection [^b0e652ca]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) during the first year of life. Antibiotic treatment is recommended in cases suspected of bacterial coinfection. The aim of this prospective study was to estimate the incidence of bacterial coinfections and the amount of antibiotic overuse in children infected with RSV using expert panel diagnosis.

Methods

Children 1 month of age and over with LRTI or fever without source were prospectively recruited in hospitals in the Netherlands and Israel. Children with confirmed RSV infection by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on nasal swabs were evaluated by an expert panel as reference standard diagnosis. Three experienced pediatricians distinguished bacterial coinfection from simple viral infection using all available clinical information, including all microbiologic evaluations and a 28-day follow-up evaluation.

Results

A total of 188 children (24% of all 784 recruited patients) were positive for RSV. From these, 92 (49%) were treated with antibiotics. All 27 children (29%) with bacterial coinfection were treated with antibiotics. Fifty-seven patients (62%) were treated with antibiotics without a diagnosis of bacterial coinfection. In 8 of the 92 (9%), the expert panel could not distinguish simple viral infection from bacterial coinfection.

Conclusion

This is the first prospective international multicenter RSV study using an expert panel as reference standard to identify children with and without bacterial coinfection. All cases of bacterial coinfections are treated, whereas as many as one-third of all children with RSV LRTI are treated unnecessarily with antibiotics.

### New options in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus disease [^b83f1807]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants, immunocompromised patients and the elderly. Despite the high disease burden, an effective vaccine or specific therapy are lacking which is largely due to our limited understanding of the immune response to RSV and how it relates to clinical disease severity. Current treatment for RSV remains largely supportive and RSV-specific options for prophylaxis and/or treatment are limited to palivizumab and ribavirin. There are a number of promising compounds currently under development, including new monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. These newer antivirals have the potential to impact both the prevention and treatment of RSV disease in the main target populations.

### Antibiotics for bronchiolitis in children [^c2846ebb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a serious, potentially life-threatening respiratory illness commonly affecting babies. It is often caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Antibiotics are not recommended for bronchiolitis unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia or respiratory failure. Nevertheless, they are used at rates of 34% to 99% in uncomplicated cases.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics for bronchiolitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, issue 4), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2010), EMBASE (1990 to December 2010) and Current Contents (2001 to December 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics to placebo in children under two years diagnosed with bronchiolitis, using clinical criteria (including respiratory distress preceded by coryzal symptoms with or without fever). Primary clinical outcomes included time to resolution of signs or symptoms (pulmonary markers included respiratory distress, wheeze, crepitations, oxygen saturation and fever). Secondary outcomes included hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, re-admissions, complications or adverse events and radiological findings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently analysed the search results.

Main Results

Five studies (543 participants) met our inclusion criteria. One study randomised 52 children to either ampicillin or placebo and found no significant difference between the two groups for length of illness. A small study (21 children) with higher risk of potential bias randomised children with proven RSV infection to clarithromycin or placebo and found clarithromycin may reduce hospital re-admission (8% antibiotics versus 44% placebo; Fishers exact; P = 0.081). The two studies (267 children) providing adequate data for length of hospital stay showed no difference between antibiotics and control (pooled mean difference 0.34; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.38). Two studies randomised children to intravenous ampicillin, oral erythromycin and control and found no difference for most symptom measures. None of the trials reported deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found minimal evidence to support the use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis. Research to identify a possible small subgroup of patients who have complications from bronchiolitis such as respiratory failure and who may benefit from antibiotics is justified.

### Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in children [^1ada4984]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease.

### Antibiotics for bronchiolitis in children [^6cfdd620]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a serious, potentially life-threatening respiratory illness commonly affecting young babies. It is most often caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds (especially tachypnoea and wheezing in a child less than two years of age). Antibiotics are not recommended for bronchiolitis unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia. Despite this, they are used at rates of 34 to 99% in uncomplicated cases.

Objectives

To evaluate the use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Groups' specialised register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to August Week 2, 2006); EMBASE (1990 to March 2006); and Current Contents (2001 to September 2006).

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: single or double blind randomised controlled trials comparing antibiotics to placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis.

Types Of Participants

children under the age of two years diagnosed with bronchiolitis using clinical criteria (including respiratory distress preceded by coryzal symptoms with or without fever). Types of interventions: oral, intravenous, intramuscular or inhaled antibiotics versus placebo. Types of outcome measures: primary clinical outcomes: time for the resolution of symptoms/signs (pulmonary markers: respiratory distress; wheeze; crepitations; oxygen saturation; and fever).

Secondary Outcomes

hospital admissions; time to discharge from hospital; re-admissions; complications/adverse events developed; and radiological findings.

Data Collection and Analysis

All data were analysed using Review Manager software, version 4.2.7.

Main Results

One study met our inclusion criteria. It randomised children presenting clinically with bronchiolitis to either ampicillin or placebo. The main outcome measure was duration of illness and death. There was no significant difference between the two groups for length of illness and there were no deaths in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence to support the use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis. This results needs to be treated with caution given only one RCT justified inclusion. It is unlikely that simple RCTs of antibiotics against placebo for bronchiolitis will be undertaken in future. Research to identify a possible small subgroup of patients presenting with bronchiolitis-like symptoms who may benefit from antibiotics may be justified. Otherwise, research may be better focussed on determining the reasons for clinicians to use antibiotics so readily for bronchiolitis, and ways of reducing their anxiety, and therefore their use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis.

### Antibiotics for persistent cough or wheeze following acute bronchiolitis in children [^48c17649]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a common acute respiratory infectious condition, with a high prevalence worldwide. It is a clinically diagnosed syndrome, manifested by tachypnoea (rapid breathing), with crackles or wheeze in young children. In the acute phase of bronchiolitis (< 14 days), antibiotics have only been recommended when a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Although bronchiolitis is usually a self-limiting condition, a number of children have persistent respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheezing in post-acute bronchiolitis, and they present or re-present to secondary care.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of antibiotics compared to a control (no treatment or placebo) for persistent respiratory symptoms (within six months), following acute bronchiolitis.

Search Methods

The following databases were searched, The Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched all databases from their inception to the present, and did not impose restriction on language of publication. The search was performed in October 2012.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with controls (placebo or no treatment) given in the post-acute phase of bronchiolitis (> 14 days) for children younger than two years of age diagnosed with bronchiolitis were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies against pre-defined criteria; and selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. Several subgroup analyses were planned and this included when antibiotics commenced (early commencement classified as preventing; later commencement as treatment for post-bronchiolitis symptoms).

Main Results

A single study met the inclusion criteria but had a high attrition rate. Thirty infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-confirmed bronchiolitis were randomised to receive either a daily dose of oral clarithromycin 15 mg/kg or placebo for three weeks. Using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, there was no significant difference between groups for the proportion of children who had persistent symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.02) or re-hospitalisation within six months (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.29). There were no treatment studies of later commencement of antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to inform whether antibiotics should be used to treat or prevent persistent respiratory symptoms in the post-acute bronchiolitis phase. Future RCTs that evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics to reduce persistent respiratory symptoms are required, especially in areas where both acute and post-bronchiolitis morbidity is high such as in Indigenous communities in the US, New Zealand and Australia.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics [^5269017c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

RSV infections are a leading cause of acute and chronic disease in children and adults. Compared with those for HIV and hepatitis C virus, industry explorations of therapies for RSV infections have been limited. Several potent and selective antiviral compounds have been identified but generally have yet to pass through phase II trials to show antiviral evidence in humans. Development may have been slowed by a range of mistaken assumptions and dogma, for example, about the size and fragmentation of the potential market, the presumed difficulty of diagnosis, and the unfortunate previous belief that antivirals will not work because RSV disease is driven by delayed host inflammatory processes. The complexity of the route to market and the lack of a pathfinder are also potential obstacles. On the other hand, the absence of an existing RSV antiviral therapy and the large unmet medical need provides opportunity and the freedom to establish new pathways of evaluation and study.

### Antibiotics for bronchiolitis in children under two years of age [^a604e4e9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a serious, potentially life-threatening respiratory illness commonly affecting babies. It is often caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Antibiotics are not recommended for bronchiolitis unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia or respiratory failure. Nevertheless, they are often used.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics for bronchiolitis in children under two years of age compared to placebo or other interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 6), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2014), EMBASE (1990 to June 2014) and Current Contents (2001 to June 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics to placebo in children under two years diagnosed with bronchiolitis, using clinical criteria (including respiratory distress preceded by coryzal symptoms with or without fever). Primary clinical outcomes included time to resolution of signs or symptoms (pulmonary markers included respiratory distress, wheeze, crepitations, oxygen saturation and fever). Secondary outcomes included hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, readmissions, complications or adverse events and radiological findings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently analysed the search results.

Main Results

We included seven studies with a total of 824 participants. The results of these seven included studies were often heterogeneous, which generally precluded meta-analysis, except for deaths, length of supplemental oxygen use and length of hospital admission. In this update, we included two new studies (281 participants), both comparing azithromycin with placebo. They found no significant difference for length of hospital stay, duration of oxygen requirement and readmission. These results were similar to an older study (52 participants) that demonstrated no significant difference comparing ampicillin and placebo for length of illness. One small study (21 participants) with higher risk of bias randomised children with proven RSV infection to clarithromycin or placebo and found a trend towards a reduction in hospital readmission with clarithromycin. The three studies providing adequate data for days of supplementary oxygen showed no difference between antibiotics and placebo (pooled mean difference (MD) (days) -0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.33). The three studies providing adequate data for length of hospital stay, similarly showed no difference between antibiotics (azithromycin) and placebo (pooled MD (days) -0.58; 95% CI -1.18 to 0.02). Two studies randomised children to intravenous ampicillin, oral erythromycin and control and found no difference for most symptom measures. There were no deaths reported in any of the arms of the seven included studies. No other adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This review did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis, although research may be justified to identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. Further research may be better focused on determining the reasons that clinicians use antibiotics so readily for bronchiolitis, how to reduce their use and how to reduce clinician anxiety about not using antibiotics.

### Respiratory syncytial virus infection: clinical features, management, and prophylaxis [^f36a9f09]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects almost all children by two years of age, resulting in a large number of hospital admissions in infants. Reactive airway disease is more common after RSV infection, even in previously healthy children. Management of the acute infection is supportive, but preliminary evidence suggests surfactant administration to ventilated infants may be of benefit. Whether ribavirin or corticosteroids reduce respiratory morbidity after RSV infection remains controversial. Immunoprophylaxis reduces RSV admissions, Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is a more cost-effective prophylaxis than RSV immune globulin. Nevertheless, the cost of prophylaxis, unless only given to very high-risk infants, exceeds savings made in reducing admissions.

### Pediatric antibiotic use associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in the United States, 2008–2018 [^a88ce6d2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention of RSV and influenza infections through immunizations is an important adjunct to traditional antibiotic stewardship interventions. In the United States, AOM is a leading cause of pediatric antibiotic use where almost one-third of AOM-associated prescriptions are guideline nonconcordant. In our study, RSV and influenza were associated with 10% and 4% of antibiotic prescriptions linked with AOM, respectively. Additionally, antibiotic treatment of conditions for which antibiotics are not indicated is common, although decreases have been noted. We estimated that RSV and influenza were associated with approximately 13 and 11 antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 person-years for which antibiotics are not guideline recommended. Stewardship interventions targeting ARI-associated prescribing have demonstrated improvements in guideline-concordant care but require ongoing investment. We also found that macrolides represented the antibiotic class for which RSV and influenza were associated with the greatest shares of prescriptions (8% and 4%). Reduction of such prescribing is important, as macrolides are frequently prescribed to children for ARIs for which antibiotics are not recommended.

### Bronchiolitis therapies and misadventures [^8d71b6a1]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis, which is most commonly caused by an infection with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can lead to respiratory difficulties in young children which may require hospitalization. Despite years of research and medical trials, the mainstay of bronchiolitis treatment remains supportive only. This review provides an overview of the history of different treatments for bronchiolitis, including those that failed, as well as new therapies that are under study. Future studies for the treatment of bronchiolitis should consider different age-groups, important subgroups (i.e., those with a prior history of wheezing, those with a family history of asthma and those with non-RSV viral etiologies) whose response to treatment may differ from that of the composite group.

### Pharmacologic advances in the treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus [^967897fd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Currently, only 2 drugs have been approved for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in high-risk children. Ribavirin is approved for treatment of severe RSV disease; however, its effectiveness in improving outcomes is questionable. During the past 40 years, many obstacles have delayed the development of safe and effective vaccines and treatment regimens. This article reviews these obstacles and presents the novel development strategies used to overcome many of them. Also discussed are promising new antiviral treatment candidates and their associated mechanism of action, the significant advances made in vaccine development, and exciting, new studies directed at improving outcomes through pharmacologic manipulation of the host response to RSV disease.

### Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: rapid evidence review [^aed4e6d4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis. RSV is spread through respiratory droplets, and the number of cases varies with season. For most patients, standard precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, surface cleaning, avoiding contact with sick individuals) are recommended. However, prophylaxis with palivizumab may be considered for infants at high risk. Initial symptoms occur after an incubation period of four to six days and include rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, and fever. Signs of lower respiratory tract involvement may follow and include cough, tachypnea, retractions, difficulty feeding, and accessory muscle use. Diagnosis is typically clinical; routine use of radiography or viral testing is not recommended. Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 90%. Hydration and nutrition should be maintained by nasogastric or intravenous routes, if needed. Therapies such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulized hypertonic saline, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy are not recommended. Although most episodes of RSV bronchiolitis are self-limited, some children have an increased risk of asthma later in life.

### Respiratory syncytial virus infection among adults during influenza season: a frequently overlooked diagnosis [^6671e1d8]. Journal of Medical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our objective is to assess the characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in adult patients and to establish differences with influenza viruses. Fifty-four patients diagnosed with RSV and 198 with influenza were prospectively included. Compared with influenza, empirical antimicrobial therapy was more frequent in patients diagnosed with RSV, whereas antibiotic withdrawal at the time of diagnosis confirmation was lower (OR, 0.12; CI, 95% 0.01–0.90; P = 0.040). RSV-positive patients were more likely to need hospital readmission (OR, 3.00; CI, 95% 0.98–9.09; P = 0.053). The role of RSV infection in adults is often overlooked, leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and a probable increase in nosocomial RSV transmission.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics [^f16b9cf8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Two meetings, one sponsored by the Wellcome Trust in 2012 and the other by the Global Virology Foundation in 2013, assembled academic, public health and pharmaceutical industry experts to assess the challenges and opportunities for developing antivirals for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. The practicalities of clinical trials and establishing reliable outcome measures in different target groups were discussed in the context of the regulatory pathways that could accelerate the translation of promising compounds into licensed agents. RSV drug development is hampered by the perceptions of a relatively small and fragmented market that may discourage major pharmaceutical company investment. Conversely, the public health need is far too large for RSV to be designated an orphan or neglected disease. Recent advances in understanding RSV epidemiology, improved point-of-care diagnostics, and identification of candidate antiviral drugs argue that the major obstacles to drug development can and will be overcome. Further progress will depend on studies of disease pathogenesis and knowledge provided from controlled clinical trials of these new therapeutic agents. The use of combinations of inhibitors that have different mechanisms of action may be necessary to increase antiviral potency and reduce the risk of resistance emergence.

### Azithromycin to prevent recurrent wheeze following severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis [^e96b4aa4]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Early-life severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a risk factor for childhood asthma. Because azithromycin may attenuate airway inflammation during RSV bronchiolitis, we evaluated whether it would reduce the occurrence of post-RSV recurrent wheeze.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 200 otherwise healthy 1- to 18-month-old children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis in this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and randomly assigned them to receive oral azithromycin (10 mg/kg daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg/kg daily for 7 days) or placebo. Randomization was stratified by recent open-label antibiotic use. The primary outcome was the occurrence of recurrent wheeze, defined as a third episode of post-RSV wheeze over the following 2 to 4 years.

Results

As an indication of the biologic activity of azithromycin, nasal wash interleukin-8 levels, at day 14 after randomization, were lower among azithromycin-treated participants (P < 0.01). Despite evidence of biologic activity, azithromycin did not reduce the risk of post-RSV recurrent wheeze (47% in the azithromycin group vs. 36% in the placebo group; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 2.29; P = 0.11). Azithromycin also did not modify the risk of recurrent wheeze among participants already receiving other antibiotic treatment at the time of enrollment (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.43 to 2.07). There was a potential signal among antibiotic-naïve participants who received azithromycin to have an increased risk of recurrent wheeze (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.1).

Conclusions

Azithromycin therapy for 14 days during acute severe RSV bronchiolitis did not reduce recurrent wheeze occurrence over the following 2 to 4 years. Our data suggest no benefit of azithromycin administration with the goal of preventing recurrent wheeze in later life.

### Immunoglobulin treatment for hospitalised infants and young children with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^e83326a9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Millions of children are hospitalised due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection every year. Treatment is supportive, and current therapies (e.g. inhaled bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulised hypertonic saline, and corticosteroids) are ineffective or have limited effect. Respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin is sometimes used prophylactically to prevent hospital admission from RSV-related illness. It may be considered for the treatment of established severe RSV infection or for treatment in an immunocompromised host, although it is not licenced for this purpose. It is unclear whether immunoglobulins improve outcomes when used as a treatment for established RSV infection in infants and young children admitted to hospital. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of immunoglobulins for the treatment of RSV-proven lower respiratory tract infections in children aged up to three years, admitted to hospital. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science (from inception to 6 November 2018) with no restrictions. We searched two trial registries for ongoing trials (to 30 March 2018) and checked the reference lists of reviews and included articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing immunoglobulins with placebo in hospitalised infants and children aged up to three years with laboratory-diagnosed RSV lower respiratory tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed evidence quality using GRADE.

Main Results

We included seven trials involving 486 infants and children aged up to three years. The immunoglobulin preparations used in these trials included anti-RSV immunoglobulin and the monoclonal antibody preparations palivizumab and motavizumab. We assessed the primary outcomes of mortality, length of hospital stay, and adverse events as providing low- or very low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision. All trials were conducted at sites in high-income countries (USA, Chile, New Zealand, Australia), with two studies including a site in a middle-income country (Panama). Five of the seven studies were "supported" or "sponsored" by the trial drug manufacturers. We found no evidence of a difference between immunoglobulins and placebo for mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 5.27; 3 trials; 196 children; 4 deaths; 2 deaths amongst 98 children receiving immunoglobulins, and 2 deaths amongst 98 children receiving placebo. One additional death occurred in a fourth trial, however, the study group of the child was not known and the data were not included in the analysis; very low-certainty evidence), and length of hospitalisation (mean difference -0.70, 95% CI -1.83 to 0.42; 5 trials; 324 children; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between immunoglobulins and placebo in adverse events of any severity or seriousness (reported in five trials) or serious adverse events (four trials) (RR for any severity 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.78; 340 children; low-certainty evidence, and for serious adverse events 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.79; 238 children; low-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a significant difference between immunoglobulins and placebo for any of our secondary outcomes. We identified one ongoing trial.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence of a difference between immunoglobulins and placebo for any review outcomes. We assessed the evidence for the effects of immunoglobulins when used as a treatment for RSV lower respiratory tract infection in hospitalised infants and young children as of low or very low certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision. We are uncertain of the effects of immunoglobulins on these outcomes, and the true effect may be substantially different from the effects reported in this review. All trials were conducted in high-income countries, and data from populations in which the rate of death from RSV infection is higher are lacking.

### Pediatric antibiotic use associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in the United States, 2008–2018 [^c2595e2b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Reducing outpatient antibiotic use is a cornerstone of strategies to prevent antimicrobial resistance. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are leading causes of pediatric outpatient antibiotic use: from 2014 to 2015, ARIs accounted for 62% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions for children from doctors' offices and emergency departments. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are common causes of ARI. Although frequently noted as etiologies in lower respiratory tract infections, RSV and influenza cause other ARIs (eg, acute otitis media [AOM], pharyngitis), independently and via synergistic interactions with other pathogens. RSV and influenza infections may lead to antibiotic use due to diagnostic uncertainty in outpatient-managed ARIs, inappropriate prescribing, and treatment for concomitant bacterial infections.

Despite contributions of RSV and influenza in ARIs, evidence quantifying their role in outpatient antibiotic prescribing to US children remains limited. Vaccination against influenza has been found to reduce antibiotic use in randomized and observational studies. In addition, maternal RSV vaccination reduced antibiotic use among infants over the first 3 months of life in a randomized trial of an RSV vaccine candidate. However, identifying the proportion of all pediatric antibiotic use attributable to these pathogens poses challenges, in part due to sparse diagnostic testing in outpatient settings, nonspecific respiratory manifestations, and diagnostic coding practices. Time series analyses leveraging distinct seasonal pathogen circulation patterns provide a basis for quantifying antibiotic utilization associated with these infections. For instance, a time series study of Scottish children found that RSV and influenza were associated with 6.9% and 2.4%, respectively, of all antibiotic prescriptions among children aged < 5 years. Using similar methods, a study of children enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2010 to 2018 found that 1.4% to 2.7% of antibiotic prescriptions were associated with influenza. Yet, the generalizability of these findings to the broader US pediatric population is limited given variation in prescribing patterns across health care systems and geography.

Understanding RSV and influenza contributions to antibiotic use may guide prescribing practices and inform assessments of vaccination impacts on antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance. We therefore aimed to estimate the proportions and incidence of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions associated with RSV and influenza infections in a large sample of commercially insured children in the United States from 2008 to 2018.

Globally, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for more than 3.6 million hospitalizations and 100,000 deaths every year. Since 2023, three immunizations have been approved for clinical use, each targeting a different patient population. These newly available RSV immunizations are poised to prevent hospitalizations, reduce costs for healthcare systems, and save lives. This review will discuss the evidence behind these immunization strategies and examine their potential to blunt the global impact from RSV.

Table 2.
Model-Estimated Proportion of Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions Associated With RSV Infection by Age Group and Linked Diagnoses Among Children Aged 0–17 Years, 2008–2018

Incidence rates of RSV-associated antibiotic prescriptions among children were 72.6 (95% CI, 59.7–85.9) and 62.7 (51.2–74.6) per 1000 person-years for all causes and ARIs, respectively (Table 3). Children aged 0 to 2 years experienced the highest incidence of RSV-associated antibiotic prescriptions, with 157.1 (102.6–211.2) prescriptions per 1000 person-years. By syndrome, the highest incidence of RSV-associated antibiotic prescriptions was linked with AOM diagnoses (28.4 per 1000 person-years; 23.4–34.0). We estimated that 49.3 (39.7–59.6) RSV-associated antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 person-years were linked to ≥ 1 ARI diagnosis for which antibiotics may be indicated, while 12.6 (9.8–15.9) were linked only with ARI diagnoses for which antibiotics were not guideline recommended.

### Systematic review of the biology and medical management of respiratory syncytial virus infection [^3b448516]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus, the leading cause of serious upper and lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children, accounts for 125,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths annually in the United States. It also may predispose to development of asthma later in life. Annual epidemics occur from November to April, and virtually all infants are infected by age 2. Immunity is not durable; hence, reinfection occurs throughout life, although subsequent infections are nearly always mild. Certain populations (eg, premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised individuals) are at risk for severe morbidity and have higher risk of mortality. Infection is spread to the nose and eyes by large droplets and direct contact with secretions, and fomites may remain infectious for up to 12 hours. Nosocomial infection is common. The virus infects airway ciliated epithelial cells, spreading by the formation of syncytia. Cellular debris and inflammation cause airway obstruction, hyperinflation, localized atelectasis, wheezing, and impaired gas exchange. Both humoral and cellular immune response are critical to ending the acute infection, but wheezing and reactive airways may persist for as long as 5–10 years after acute infection. No cure exists for respiratory syncytial virus infection, but commonly employed palliative treatments include oxygen, inhaled beta(2) agonists, racemic epinephrine, dornase alfa, systemic and inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled ribavirin, and nasopharyngeal suctioning. Infants suffering severe lower airways disease may require mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic measures include rigorous infection control and administration of polyclonal (RSV-IGIV [respiratory syncytial virus - immunoglobulin intravenous]) and monoclonal (palivizumab) antibodies. The cost of the prophylactic antibody treatment is high; it is cost-effective for only the highest risk patients. Development of a vaccine remains far in the future. Application of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines is making both out-patient and in-patient therapy as effective and economical as possible.

### NSAIDs for early management of acute respiratory infections [^c9e7ff86]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) have a significant morbidity and mortality burden worldwide and represent a global health concern. Throughout the world, more than 50% of ARTIs are caused by viruses, including, but not limited to, human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Bacterial and viral ARTIs are often clinically indistinguishable and, even though the majority are of viral cause, they are by far the most common reason for prescribing an antibiotic in primary care. In outpatient practice, these infections are mostly self-limiting and do not require antimicrobial therapy, but rather symptomatic treatment, keeping in mind that the symptoms are caused by a local and systemic inflammatory response. In recent years, the experience with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has strongly underlined the importance of etiological diagnosis of infections and suggested that a prompt control of inflammation with antiinflammatories may limit viral infections and prevent complications. Nowadays, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory infections is made more accessible thanks to the availability of specific diagnostic kits that allow the identification of different viruses and the discrimination between bacterial and viral etiology, simplifying the choice of the most appropriate therapy. Even though symptoms typically last less than 10 days, they may be troublesome and therefore treatment should be timely.

The host reaction plays a major role in the pathogenesis of viral ARTI symptoms and the similarities in their clinical presentation suggest a common inflammatory and immune response pattern to different etiologic agents. Once again, the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to increase and consolidate our notions about the pathophysiology of respiratory infections. The primary concept is that every infection induces an inflammatory response. Therefore, switching off the inflammation at the very first symptoms could be a winning strategy in the management of ARTIs.

In this article, we discuss the rationale for an early approach to viral ARTIs with NSAIDs as the most appropriate to switch off the inflammatory cascade resulting from the infection before the inflammatory process becomes complicated; this could help to limit the development of clinical complications and the excessive and inappropriate use of other classes of drugs, including antibiotics, when there is no specific indication to use them, with their major impact on the growing issue of resistance. We review here the pathophysiology of ARTIs, the subsequent development of a local and systemic inflammatory process, the main NSAIDs and their characteristics, and discuss their potential role in the early treatment of ARTIs.

### Empiric antibiotics are justified for infants with respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection presenting with respiratory failure: a prospective study and evidence review [^0b9fb801]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although some studies indicate a low risk of serious bacterial infection in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), these studies focused on patients who did not progress to respiratory failure. We hypothesized the composite diagnosis of concomitant bacterial pneumonia (CBP) is common in lower risk infants with RSV who present in respiratory failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of CBP in low-risk infants mechanically ventilated for RSV respiratory failure and to compare the results with other studies searched for in MEDLINE.

Design

Prospective, descriptive study, and literature review. Two MEDLINE searches were done using the terms 1) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia, and 2) RSV, pneumonia, and antibiotics.

Setting

Tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the Northeast United States.

Patients

We prospectively enrolled 23 infants admitted to our PICU with RSV infection and respiratory failure over a 27-month period.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

All infants were intubated on arrival or soon thereafter; 22 had diagnostic tracheal aspiration performed, and 20 had blood cultures obtained shortly after admission. All had white blood cell count, temperature measured, and chest radiograph. Only one had antibiotics before culture. The length of mechanical ventilation, PICU course, and hospital stay were recorded. The primary outcome variable was the composite diagnosis of CBP as determined by the following criteria: 1) isolation of pathogenic bacteria from a tracheal aspirate, 2) blood culture, 3) chest radiograph, 4) temperature abnormality, and 5) peripheral white blood cell count. In our study, 7 infants met four criteria (probable pneumonia); 6 met three criteria (possible pneumonia); and 10 infants met less than three criteria. By tracheal aspirate criteria alone, 9 of 23 (39%) had probable pneumonia and 9 of 23 had possible pneumonia by previously published criteria. The mean length of mechanical ventilation for 7 infants who met four criteria was 10 ± 2.7 (sem) days; for 6 infants who met three criteria, 10.5 ± 2.1 days; and for infants who met less than three criteria 7.4 ± 0.9 days. The mean PICU stay was 14.3 ± 3.6 days for infants who met four criteria; 14.3 ± 3.0 days for infants who met three criteria; and 9.9 ± 1.4 days for infants who met less than three criteria. The mean hospital stay was 16.3 ± 3.4 for infants who met four criteria; 18.7 ± 2.8 days for infants who met three criteria; and 24.8 ± 9.6 days for infants who met less than three criteria. These differences were not statistically significant. A MEDLINE search was performed using the terms 1) RSV and pneumonia, and 2) RSV, pneumonia, and antibiotics.

Conclusions

While the small size of this study does not permit definitive conclusions, these data, in combination with other data from the literature, suggest that composite evidence of bacterial pneumonia in otherwise low-risk infants with RSV presenting with respiratory failure is 20% or higher and the use of empirical antibiotics for 24 to 48 hrs pending culture results may be justified and could be used until CBP is excluded.

### Antibiotic overuse in a contemporary cohort of children hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2: a retrospective cohort study [^331aaf2c]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Children hospitalized with viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are often prescribed antibiotics due to concern for bacterial co-infection, although most do not have concurrent bacterial infections. This unnecessary antibiotic treatment can lead to bacterial resistance and adverse events. The extent of antibiotic overuse in hospitalized children with community-onset viral LRTIs has not been described in recent years. To identify antibiotic stewardship opportunities in this population, we quantified the extent of antibiotic overtreatment and determined predictors of antibiotic use among children hospitalized with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective study evaluating antibiotic use and culture-confirmed bacterial co-infection among children and adolescents hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or COVID-19 between April 2020 and May 2023. Predictors of antibiotic treatment were determined using logistic regression.

Results

We included 1,718 patients (influenza: 188; RSV: 1,022; COVID-19: 535). Patients with RSV were younger and more likely to be in intensive care. While only 8% of patients had culture-confirmed bacterial co-infection, the proportion receiving antibiotics was high and varied by virus (influenza: 60.6%, RSV:41.2%, COVID-19: 48.6%, p < 0.001). Independent predictors for receipt of > 3 days of antibiotics were elevated inflammatory markers, comorbidities, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, influenza infection, and a concurrent non-respiratory infection.

Conclusions

In children hospitalized with community-onset viral LRTIs, antibiotic treatment is substantially higher than the burden of culture-confirmed bacterial infection, especially for influenza, suggesting antibiotic overuse and antibiotic stewardship opportunities.

### The prognosis in children with pneumonia of respiratory syncytial virus Co-detection with airway dominant flora [^9b5edb1b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Most cases of community-acquired pneumonia in children are caused by virus infection and therefore do not require antibiotic treatment. However, early use of etiology testing in hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia is recommended in certain cases. For children with typical bacterial pneumonia, early bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility tests can guide the selection of more effective antibiotics. When viral pneumonia progresses, early etiology testing can identify whether clinical symptoms and radiological findings suggest a secondary bacterial infection, supporting rational antibiotic use. In severe cases, where airway inflammation alters the bacterial flora, such testing is also essential for detecting secondary bacterial infections and selecting appropriate antibiotics. Overall, the insights gained from these findings could lead to changes in clinical practice for more effective management of community-acquired pneumonia. However, our study has several limitations. First, selection bias may exist as the study was conducted in a single tertiary-care teaching hospital, suggesting caution when extrapolating our findings across different hospitals and regions. Second, despite the relatively large sample size, the retrospective nature of the study and several missing parameters may limit the statistical power for some critical factors. Finally, although we used PSM to mitigate biases inherent in observational studies, achieving a perfect 1:1 match is challenging due to inherent population differences. Prospective, multicenter clinical trials are needed to address these uncertainties.

### Delayed diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infections in hospitalized adults: individual patient data, record review analysis and physician survey in the United States [^d41547f2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Despite the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults hospitalized with acute respiratory infections, guidelines for the diagnosis and management of RSV have not been established. This analysis evaluated the role and timeliness of RSV diagnostic testing and its potential impact on clinical outcomes.

Methods

We analyzed individual patient data from hospitalized adults with confirmed RSV infections during 2 North American RSV seasons. Participating physicians reported clinical, virologic diagnosis, and outcome variables using a standardized online case form.

Results

Across 32 US states, 132 physicians reported 379 RSV cases. Polymerase chain reaction–based diagnostics were the most common type of test ordered (94.2%) with < 5% ordered specifically to diagnose RSV. Most tests (67.6%) were ordered in hospital wards or intensive care units. Overall, 47.4%, 30.9%, and 21.7% of patients had RSV diagnosed < 12, 12‒24, and > 24 hours after hospital admission, respectively. Later diagnosis was associated with longer hospital stays (n = 145; R = +0.191; P < .05) and greater antibiotic use.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of RSV infection in hospitalized adults is often delayed, which may affect clinical management and outcomes. Our findings indicate the need to improve the diagnostic strategies in this patient population.

### Pediatric antibiotic use associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in the United States, 2008–2018 [^5b04f13d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Cohort and Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions by Prescription and Patient Characteristic, Optum Clinformatics, 2008–2018

We estimated that 6.3% (95% CI, 5.2%–7.3%) of all antibiotic prescriptions were associated with RSV (Table 2). This fraction varied by week and exceeded 10% during periods of peak RSV circulation each year (Figure 2). RSV-associated proportions were highest among young children, with 8.6% (5.6%–11.4%) and 8.4% (5.6%–11.3%) of antibiotic prescriptions associated with RSV among children aged 0 to 2 years and 3 to 5 years, respectively. Among antibiotics linked to ARI and lower respiratory tract infection diagnoses, 8.1% (6.7%–9.5%) and 12.5% (10.8%–14.2%) of prescriptions were associated with RSV. Aside from RSV-specific diagnoses, the conditions for which RSV was associated with the greatest proportion of antibiotic prescriptions were bronchiolitis (19.3%; 16.8%–21.7%), bronchitis (9.6%; 7.5%–11.7%), and pneumonia (11.7%; 10.0%–13.3%). In sensitivity analyses, models measuring RSV activity by bronchiolitis visits yielded higher RSV-associated proportion estimates than primary analyses, with 8.0% (6.8%–9.3%) of antibiotic prescriptions in children associated with RSV (Supplementary Table 6).

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^9292ad06]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Palivizumab prophylaxis — economic value and cost-effectiveness — shows wide variability across analyses and generally low value given limited clinical benefit. A recent meta-analysis identified 28 economic analyses, with estimates ranging from cost savings to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2 526 203 per quality-adjusted life year; typical cut points for concluding cost effectiveness are $50 000 to $100 000 USD per quality-adjusted life year. No mortality benefit has been shown in randomized trials, and models without a mortality benefit generally do not yield cost-effective ratios. The American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee principles emphasize benefits, harms, costs, downstream costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the minimal clinical reduction in RSV hospitalizations and parent-reported wheezing episodes associated with palivizumab prophylaxis do not justify the cost; the majority of RSV hospitalizations last 2 to 3 days. Because the high cost of palivizumab prophylaxis is associated with minimal health benefit, this intervention cannot be considered high-value health care for any group of infants. Health expenditures should not be based only on cost and benefit but rather on net benefit, and high-cost interventions may be appropriate if highly beneficial.

### Viral bronchiolitis in infants in the era of targeted therapies: what now and what's next? [^49ef3e4f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Viral bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 1 year of age. Most clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend a minimalist management approach based on supportive therapy, focusing solely on maintaining oxygenation and hydration.

Objectives

To examine the reasons behind the poor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for bronchiolitis in real-world clinical practice and to explore potential strategies to improve future management.

Methods

This narrative review discusses factors that may explain the observed gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, including recent findings from the field that help clarify this poor adherence.

Results

We highlight the discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical implementation. We also discuss the evolving landscape of bronchiolitis management, including evidence supporting novel interventions such as maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy and the use of monoclonal antibodies like nirsevimab and ziresovir, an oral RSV F protein inhibitor.

Conclusions

Understanding and addressing the causes of poor adherence to bronchiolitis guidelines is critical. Future research should aim to integrate evidence-based treatments with options for personalized adjustments. Updated guidelines should reflect emerging interventions and provide rational management pathways until robust evidence from new studies becomes available.

### Azithromycin for acute bronchiolitis and wheezing episodes in children-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^e4b1ba5a]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One-third of children suffer from wheezing during the first three years of life. Up to 26% of children present with recurrent wheeze (≥ 3 episodes) by age 6. Acute bronchiolitis causes the majority of hospital admissions in infants under 12 months in the United States and over three million hospital admissions annually worldwide, and predisposes to subsequent recurrent wheezing and asthma development. – Bronchiolitis in infants under 12 months is mainly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whereas rhinovirus (RV) prevails in older children.

Because of the strong association to viral respiratory infections, guidelines do not suggest antibiotics for wheezing, yet they are widely used. Only supportive treatment of breathing and oxygenation, fluid replacement and alleviating symptoms, usually with inhaled short acting beta-agonists for children older than 12 months are widely accepted. Previously explored pharmacological prevention of post-RSV wheezing include montelukast and corticosteroids both inhaled and systemic. The results have remained mostly negative, possibly owing to the fact that the inflammation pattern in bronchiolitis and wheezy bronchitis is predominantly non-eosinophilic. Inhaled beta-agonists do not reduce hospital admissions or length-of-stay. Novel treatment strategies are needed to attenuate and prevent the symptoms of wheezing.

### Community-based antibiotic prescribing attributable to respiratory syncytial virus and other common respiratory viruses in young children: a population-based time-series study of Scottish children [^1b01044b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, such as for viral illness, remains common in primary care. The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of community-prescribed antibiotics to children aged less than 5 years attributable to common respiratory viruses.

Methods

We fitted time-series negative binomial models to predict weekly antibiotic prescribing rates from positive viral pathogen tests for the period 1 April 2009 through 27 December 2017 using comprehensive, population-based administrative data for all children (< 5 years) living in Scotland. Multiple respiratory viral pathogens were considered, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus, and human parainfluenza (HPIV) types 1–4. We estimated the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions explained by virus circulation according to type of virus, by age group, presence of high-risk chronic conditions, and antibiotic class.

Results

We included data on 6 066 492 antibiotic prescriptions among 452 877 children. The antibiotic-prescribing rate among all Scottish children (< 5 years) was 609.7 per 1000 child-years. Our final model included RSV, influenza, HMPV, HPIV-1, and HPIV-3. An estimated 6.9% (95% confidence interval, 5.6–8.3%), 2.4% (1.7–3.1%), and 2.3% (.8–3.9%) of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, influenza, and HMPV, respectively. RSV was consistently associated with the highest proportion of prescribed antibiotics, particularly among children without chronic conditions and for amoxicillin and macrolide prescriptions.

Conclusions

Nearly 14% of antibiotics prescribed to children in this study were estimated to be attributable to common viruses for which antibiotics are not recommended. A future RSV vaccine could substantially reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing among children.

### Palivizumab in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease [^d19a510f]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Premature infants and infants with underlying lung disease are at increased risk for severe RSV infection in the first 1–2 years of life. Monthly prophylaxis with palivizumab (Synagis) during RSV season has been proven safe and effective in this population and these effects have persisted over the 4 years since the drug was approved by the US FDA in 1998. Issues remain regarding the optimal candidates for palivizumab prophylaxis and whether additional groups of high-risk individuals, for example infants with congenital heart disease or cystic fibrosis, and immunocompromised hosts, might benefit from such preventive therapy. It is possible that palivizumab in combination with antiviral or anti-inflammatory agents might also prove to be beneficial in the treatment of RSV disease. Newer monoclonal antibodies to RSV in development may offer the potential for less frequent dosing, increased efficacy and a role in treatment of RSV disease, but pending further evaluation of such products palivizumab provides significant protection for high-risk infants against a major pathogen.

### Impact of antibacterials on subsequent resistance and clinical outcomes in adult patients with viral pneumonia: an opportunity for stewardship [^ce72ee40]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Interactions between viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens have been recognized dating back to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Bacterial pneumonia is a well-recognized serious complication of influenza infections and coinfections are commonplace. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses have also been linked to bacterial coinfections in humans. Animal studies have suggested synergism between bacterial pathogens and other respiratory viruses. The relationship between viral and bacterial respiratory infections creates a difficult situation for clinicians determining the appropriate use of antimicrobials as they treat hospitalized patients with pneumonia while also trying to minimize the development and selection of resistant organisms.

Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as the primary etiology of pneumonia among patients requiring hospitalization (2.7–5% of pneumonia cases). Advanced technologies using multiplex molecular assays and PCR improve the diagnostic ability to identify viral pathogens in a timely manner and may impact the use of antibacterials in patients with no bacterial infection identified.

Several studies have investigated the impact of respiratory viral pathogen identification on antibacterial exposure. Decreased antibiotic use was observed in two pediatric studies assessing the impact of rapid viral diagnostic tests for respiratory tract infections; however, these results were not mirrored in similar adult studies. These studies all used immunofluorescent staining as the primary diagnostic technology. To our knowledge, only one study using PCR-based respiratory virus detection has been reported and found no change in antibacterial use with improved diagnoses for lower respiratory tract infections.

Broad-spectrum antibacterial exposure increases the risk of subsequent infections with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and leads to a vicious cycle of empiric broad-spectrum antibacterials to combat increasingly resistant organisms. We and others have previously shown that patients with culture-negative pneumonia frequently receive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, usually in excess of 5–6 days of therapy despite lack of evidence for a bacterial etiology of infection. It is important to recognize that these studies were performed prior to the availability of rapid viral diagnostics which may have influenced how antibiotics were used during those study periods. Use of new diagnostic technologies for respiratory virus detection could decrease unnecessary antibacterial exposures and subsequent MDRO infections. This study aimed to describe the use of continued empiric antibacterials in patients with known viral pneumonia and to determine the impact of such therapies on subsequent bacterial infections/colonization and clinical outcomes.

### Pediatric antibiotic use associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in the United States, 2008–2018 [^6c105c31]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
Model-Estimated Incidence of Antibiotic Prescriptions Associated With RSV Infection by Age Group and Diagnosis Among Children Aged 0–17 Years, 2008–2018

Overall we estimated that 3.4% (95% CI, 3.1%–3.8%) of all antibiotic prescriptions and 4.7% (4.1%–5.2%) of ARI-associated prescriptions were associated with influenza (Table 2). This estimate varied considerably across years: during periods of peak circulation, influenza-associated prescriptions were associated with > 20% of antibiotic prescribing from 2009 to 2010, 2015 to 2016, and 2017 to 2018 but < 10% of prescribing during peaks from 2008 to 2009 and 2011 to 2012 (Figure 2). Influenza was associated with a greater proportion of antibiotic prescriptions among children aged ≥ 6 years than among those aged 0 to 5 years. Aside from influenza-specific diagnoses, diagnoses for which influenza was associated with the greatest proportions of antibiotic prescriptions were bronchitis (6.2%; 5.5%–7.0%), viral URI (7.5%; 6.9%–8.2%), and physician-coded RSV (8.1%; 6.6%–9.5%). Estimates of influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions changed minimally in sensitivity analyses by using bronchiolitis to proxy RSV (Supplementary Table 7).

Influenza-associated antibiotic prescription incidence rates were 40.0 (95% CI, 35.1–45.1) and 36.2 (31.6–41.1) per 1000 person-years for all causes and for ARIs, respectively (Table 4). Rates were highest for prescriptions associated with AOM (10.5; 8.6–12.5) and pharyngitis (10.2; 8.4–12.2) and were greater at ages ≥ 6 years as compared with 0 to 5 years. We estimated that 25.8 (21.8–29.9) influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 person-years were linked to ≥ 1 ARI diagnosis for which antibiotics may be indicated, while 11.2 (9.3–13.3) were linked only with ARI diagnoses for which antibiotics were not guideline recommended.

### Antibiotic overuse in a contemporary cohort of children hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2: a retrospective cohort study [^7a6d5015]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We demonstrate in a contemporary cohort that unnecessary antibiotic use persists in hospital settings, as the antibiotic treatment burden far exceeds bacterial co-infections for children hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or COVID-19. Antibiotic stewardship programs should encourage clinicians to withhold or promptly deescalate antibiotics, particularly for children hospitalized with mild viral LRTI.

### Severe influenza / respiratory syncytial virus infections and hospital antimicrobial stewardship opportunities: impact of a 4-year surveillance including molecular diagnosis [^78af4777]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the prevalence of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults hospitalized for a respiratory infection in the winter months and to evaluate the impact of a viral diagnosis on empirical antimicrobial management (antibiotics and antivirals).

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

Acute-care university hospital.

Patients

The study included 963 adult patients hospitalized over a 4-year surveillance period.

Methods

Annual surveillance timelines were defined according to epidemiological criteria related to the circulation of RSV and influenza viruses in the general population. Patients were screened following a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) case definition at the emergency department and were enrolled for molecular assay targeting influenza/RSV viruses after oral informed consent. Epidemiological and clinical data were recorded prospectively, microbiological investigations, antimicrobial management, and outcome data were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

An influenza or RSV virus was documented in 316 of 963 patients (33%). Optimization of antimicrobial management (AM) was achieved in 162 of 265 patients (61%) with a positive viral diagnosis and no bacterial infection at admission (AM treatment not initiated, n = 111; discontinued, n = 51). In contrast, only 128 of 462 patients (28%) with negative microbiological investigations did not have AM treatment initiated (n = 116) or had such treatment discontinued (n = 12). Early, targeted antiviral treatment was prescribed in 235 of 253 patients (93%) confirmed with influenza. Epidemiological, clinical, and outcome data were similar in both groups.

Conclusion

Epidemiological surveillance associated with influenza/RSV molecular diagnosis in adults hospitalized for severe winter respiratory infections dramatically enhanced antimicrobial management.

### Consensus conference on the appropriateness of palivizumab prophylaxis in respiratory syncytial virus disease [^bc9772d4]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus infection represents a clinical burden among young children under 24 months. Palivizumab is the only drug licensed in Italy for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization caused by respiratory syncytial virus in children at high risk. However recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis are heterogeneous. Not all the published documents agree about the clinical indications of palivizumab; this could lead to different clinical practices and concerns about the appropriateness of prophylaxis. These issues and the lack of evidence about palivizumab prophylaxis efficacy in specific medical conditions brought on the idea of a consensus conference on the current recommendations for the management and prevention of bronchiolitis, in order to share useful indications. The goal was to perform a review of the evidence regarding the efficacy and the safety of palivizumab and give recommendations in order to harmonize its use. A structured and validated method to conduct the consensus process was adopted. The consensus conference recommends palivizumab prophylaxis in infants born before 29 weeks and younger than 12 months at the start of the epidemic season. According to evidence from literature and experts' opinion, palivizumab prophylaxis is not recommended in preterm infants of gestational age ≥ 29 weeks, without co-morbidity (i.e., cardiac, bronchopulmonary diseases). The experts identified some clinical rare conditions for which the decision of prophylaxis should be entrusted to the specialists. The evaluation of the appropriateness of palivizumab prophylaxis in the single patient should be documented by the specialists. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:1088–1096. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Antibiotic use in hospitalized children with respiratory viruses detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction [^e15a9721]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based methods are increasingly used to detect respiratory pathogens in children. While rapid identification of viruses has been shown to reduce antibiotic use, the impact of detecting specific viruses on antibiotic utilization has not been ascertained. This study compared antibiotic utilization among hospitalized children who tested positive for different respiratory viruses at admission.

Methods

A single-center study of hospitalized children under 21 years of age who tested positive at admission for at least 1 respiratory virus by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2015 was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of testing positive for specific viruses with the use of antibiotics for ≥ 2 days, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

The study included 1416 patients with a median age of 2.1 years (interquartile range: 0.6–6.2 years). Patients positive for influenza (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1–3.4) and human metapneumovirus (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1–3.7) were more likely to receive ≥ 2 days of treatment compared with patients positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Other variables affecting prolonged use of antibiotics included respiratory support, primary nonrespiratory diagnosis, complex comorbid conditions and admission to the intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Providers are more likely to use antibiotics in non-RSV-infected patients compared with RSV. These trends likely represent concern about bacterial superinfection and may reflect lack of familiarity with these pathogens.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^a086b75f]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis policy — COID assessment and current indications: The vast majority of RSV hospitalizations occur among healthy term infants, and prematurity is an important risk factor with those born at less than 29 weeks' gestation having high risk despite palivizumab; although some data show increased RSV hospitalizations in preterm infants born at > 29 weeks' gestation after the 2014 AAP guidance, findings were strongest in infants less than 3 months of age, inconsistent across studies, and no direct comparison exists with healthy, term, 1-month-old infants for whom prophylaxis is not currently recommended; no increase in RSV-associated mortality after the guidance change has been reported and real-world effectiveness studies do not show a major impact of palivizumab in otherwise healthy preterm infants; therefore, COID concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a change in policy for otherwise healthy preterm infants, while current evidence supports the AAP 2014 policy for infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, Down syndrome, immunocompromising conditions, anatomic pulmonary abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, and cystic fibrosis, and immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab remains an option for children at high risk per the 2014 AAP policy, with several new prevention options under evaluation that may substantially impact recommendations in the near future.

### Recommendations for the prevention of RSV disease in infants and children: policy statement [^54d9d0b3]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunization, infants and children, AAP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that high-risk criteria include the following:

- children with chronic lung disease of prematurity who required medical support, such as chronic corticosteroid therapy, diuretic therapy, or supplemental oxygen, at any time during the 6-month period before the start of the second RSV season

- children with severe immunocompromise

- children with cystic fibrosis who have either manifestations of severe lung disease, such as previous hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation in the first year of life or abnormalities on chest imaging that persist when stable, or weight-for-length < 10th percentile

- American Indian or Alaska Native children.

### Risk factors for severe disease among children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus [^9f28c921]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the current risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection given the changing epidemiologic characteristics after the COVID-19 pandemic?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 709 cases of RSV-associated acute respiratory tract infection, severe disease was more likely among children aged 2 years or older with pulmonary and neurologic, neuromuscular, or developmental conditions; children younger than 2 years with a history of prematurity; or children younger than 6 months.

Meaning

Given the identified risk groups, this study suggests there may be benefit associated with prevention strategies, such as universal prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies in infancy and for children aged 2 years or older in specific high-risk groups.

### Antibiotic overuse in a contemporary cohort of children hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2: a retrospective cohort study [^8aa44fb1]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The burden of pediatric hospitalizations for viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is substantial. In the U.S. over 22,000 children have been hospitalized with COVID-19 since 2020, 12,000–46,000 children are hospitalized with influenza each year, and up to 80,000 children < 5 years are hospitalized with RSV every year. Children hospitalized with viral LRTIs are often treated with antibiotics due to concerns for bacterial co-infection, especially bacterial pneumonia, which can be preceded by viral infection. However, the majority of children with viral LRTIs do not have concurrent bacterial infections, so this practice leads to unnecessary antibiotic treatment which, in turn, can lead to development of resistant bacteria and adverse events. Unlike in adults, the extent of antibiotic overuse in hospitalized children with community-onset viral LRTI has not been well-quantified in recent years.

Several studies have found that although there were low rates of bacterial co-infection in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, up to 75% received antibiotics. Similarly, a large multicenter study evaluating children with critical illness from COVID-19 found that 7% of children had bacterial coinfection but 63% received antibiotics. Studies of antibiotic treatment among children hospitalized with influenza or RSV before the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that 60–90% received antibiotics, but there were few evaluations of bacterial co-infection rates. Furthermore, most prior studies of viral LRTI do not quantify antibiotic use and may have overestimated bacterial co-infection burden because they interpreted any respiratory culture with bacterial growth as indicative of bacterial infection, although many positive respiratory cultures likely reflected colonization. We sought to quantify the extent of antibiotic overuse in a contemporary cohort of children hospitalized with viral LRTI, in the context of an active hospital-based antibiotic stewardship program.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of hospitalisation in early childhood and palivizumab is the only licensed intervention for prevention. Palivizumab guidelines should reflect the latest evidence, in addition to cost-effectiveness and healthcare budgetary considerations. RSV experts from Europe, Canada and Israel undertook a systematic review of the evidence over the last 5 years and developed recommendations regarding prophylaxis in industrialised countries. Almost 400 publications were reviewed. This group recommended palivizumab for: preterm infants (< 29 and ≤ 31 weeks gestational age [wGA] and ≤ 9 and ≤ 6 months of age, respectively; high-risk 32-35wGA), former preterm children ≤ 24 months with chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, children ≤ 24 months with significant congenital heart disease; and other high-risk populations, such as children ≤ 24 months with Down syndrome, pulmonary/neuromuscular disorders, immunocompromised, and cystic fibrosis. Up to 5 monthly doses should be administered over the RSV season. It is our impression that the adoption of these guidelines would help reduce the burden of RSV.

### Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children [^4af82fa5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month for five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV lower respiratory tract infection in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children.

Objectives

To assess the effects of palivizumab in preventing severe RSV infection in children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, Scopus, and two trials registers from the inception of each database to July 2024 with no language or publication status restrictions.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs in children 0 to 24 months of age of any gender, regardless of RSV infection history, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention, or standard care.

Outcomes

The critical outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all-cause mortality, and adverse events. Important outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay, and mechanical ventilation days.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

We included one new trial in this update, bringing the total number of RCTs to six studies with 3611 children. All studies were parallel RCTs assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month for up to five months, compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants, and another study administered palivizumab intranasally. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of severe RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease.

Synthesis Of Results

Systemic palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow-up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64; I² = 23%; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high-certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Intranasal palivizumab may increase hospitalisation due to RSV infection compared to placebo or no intervention at two years' follow-up (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 8.48; 1 study, 94 participants; low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision). Based on 64 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 149 (41 to 541) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow-up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate-certainty evidence due to concerns about imprecision). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow-up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.38; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 3099 participants; moderate-certainty evidence due to concerns about imprecision). Based on 78 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 84 (66 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness at two years' follow-up (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99; I² = 41%; 6 studies, 3437 participants; moderate-certainty evidence due to concerns about imprecision). Systemic palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow-up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 554 participants; low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision). Intranasal palivizumab may increase RSV infection compared to placebo or no intervention at two years' follow-up (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.08; 1 study, 94 participants; low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision). Systemic palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one-year follow-up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high-certainty evidence). Intranasal palivizumab may result in little to no difference in the mean fraction of wheezing days (mean fraction of wheezing days of 0.94, 95% CI -1.9 to 3.5; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). The risk of bias in outcomes across all studies was similar and predominantly low.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, prophylaxis with systemic palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and probably results in little to no difference in mortality. Intranasal palivizumab may increase hospitalisation due to RSV infection. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness. Systemic palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infections, whilst intranasal palivizumab may increase RSV infection. Systemic palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days, whilst intranasal palivizumab may result in little to no difference in the mean fraction of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of severe RSV infection due to comorbidities. Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab in children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low- and middle-income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.

### Bronchiolitis needs a revisit: distinguishing between virus entities and their treatments [^16a99380]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

7 TREATMENT

Substantial knowledge gaps and controversies exist in the management of acute bronchiolitis. Most guidelines recommend primarily supportive treatment, that is, oxygen, nasal suctioning, mechanical ventilation, and hydration. 67 High flow oxygen therapy using nasal cannula has shown promising results. 68 There is conflicting information across clinical guidelines about the role of nebulized hypertonic saline in acute management of bronchiolitis. Only a few current guidelines recommend bronchodilators. 2 Overall, corticosteroids (see details below), nebulized epinephrine, or antibiotics are not recommended. 2 Because of the current frustration with the existing treatment modalities (high use of bronchodilators, antibiotics, and corticosteroids) and as the majority of the previous trials have not been based on virus‐specific data, is further research required in order to direct focus to more personalized management plans in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. 69

7.1 Treatment for RSV

Palivizumab: Immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F glycoprotein, decreases the risk of hospitalization due to severe RSV illness among preterm infants (72% reduction), those with chronic lung disease (65% reduction), and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (53% reduction). 60 Interestingly, palivizumab has effectively reduced recurrent wheezing following hospitalization due to RSV, but not asthma. 70

Ribavirin: Convincing data supporting ribavirin treatment for severe RSV infection are lacking, and its toxicity remains a concern. Therefore, ribavirin is not recommended in the current U.S. guidelines. 71

New treatments: There are currently approximately 28 RSV vaccines and antibodies in preclinical development and another 17 in clinical development. 59, 60 Several new molecules have been identified for the treatment of RSV infection and are currently in (advanced) preclinical or clinical development. 72, 73

### Variability of care of infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis: a multicenter study [^b2d6c961]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Viral bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common childhood disease accounting for many hospitalizations worldwide. Some infants may clinically deteriorate, requiring admission to an intensive care unit. We aimed to describe diagnostic and therapeutic measures of bronchiolitis in Israeli pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and evaluate intercenter variability of care.

Methods

Medical records of all RSV-infected infants admitted to 5 Israeli PICUs over 4 RSV seasons were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Data on 276 infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis, admitted to the participating PICUs were analyzed. Most of the infants were males with a mean admission age of 4.7 months. Approximately half of the infants had pre-existing conditions such as prematurity, cardiac disease or chronic lung disease. Respiratory distress was the most common symptom at presentation followed by hypoxemia and fever. There was significant variation in the methods used for RSV diagnosis, medical management and respiratory support of the infants. Furthermore, utilization of inhalational therapy and transfusion of blood products differed significantly between the centers. Although a bacterial pathogen was isolated in only 13.4% of the infants, 82.6% of the cohort was treated with antibiotics.

Conclusions

Significant variation was found between the different PICUs regarding RSV bronchiolitis diagnosis, medical management and respiratory support, which may not be accounted for by the differences in baseline and clinical characteristics of the infants. Some of these differences may be explained by uneven resource allocations. This diversity and the documented routine use of medications with weak evidence of efficacy calls for national guidelines for bronchiolitis management.

### Antibiotic use in children is not influenced by the result of rapid antigen detection test for the respiratory syncytial virus [^ba9a1d1f]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is widely used in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), but its influence on antibiotic (AB) use is uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate if confirmation of RSV infection by RADT modified AB use and elucidate others factors associated with the continuation of antibiotics.

Study Design

Charts of children hospitalized with viral ARTI aged 0–35 months were reviewed. Modification of antibiotics according to RSV RADT results was compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox regression.

Results

Of children receiving antibiotics when the RSV RADT result was available, RSV RADT was positive in 144 and negative in 54. Positive RSV RADT results did not lead to modification of antibiotic use. Factors independently associated with cessation of intravenous antibiotics were age ≥ 3 months (HR 2.44 [1.41–4.21]) and absence of pneumonia (HR 1.50 [1.03–2.19]). Absence of otitis was associated with cessation of oral antibiotics (HR 9.16 [95% CI, 2.35–35.76]).

Conclusion

Confirmed presence of RSV by RADT did not influence antibiotic use in young children with ARTI. Except with pneumonia, the risk of bacterial superinfection of RSV infected children is minimal and confirmation of RSV infection should prompt treating physicians to interrupt antibiotics.

### Respiratory syncytial virus in pediatric patients admitted to a tertiary center in amman: clinical characteristics, and age-related patterns [^d6fb6325]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of pediatric cases infected with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The vulnerability of infants is underscored by the majority of cases occurring in those less than one year old. Notably, RSV affects primarily healthy, full-term children with no co-morbidities, highlighting the significant burden it imposes on this population. The study reveals a substantial mean length of stay, indicating RSV's considerable impact on healthcare resources. While a history of RSV infection may confer some level of immunity and potentially prevent severe symptoms requiring admission, a concerning finding is the high rate of antibiotic use, emphasizing the importance of judicious antibiotic usage in pediatric respiratory infection management. The study provides valuable insights into RSV infections in Jordan, emphasizing the ongoing necessity for preventive measures, widespread vaccine access, and improved strategies to address RSV's considerable impact on children globally.

### Clarithromycin in the treatment of RSV bronchiolitis: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^a3e419cb]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infancy. To date, there is no effective therapy for RSV bronchiolitis. In order to investigate the efficacy of clarithromycin in the treatment of RSV bronchiolitis, the present authors conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing clarithromycin with placebo in 21 infants with a diagnosis of RSV bronchiolitis. The infants were randomised to receive clarithromycin or placebo daily for 3 weeks. Levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-8, eotaxin, and interferon-gamma were determined in plasma, before and after treatment, using ELISA. Six months after treatment, parents were surveyed as to whether their child had experienced wheezing within the previous 6 months. Treatment with clarithromycin was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospital stay, the duration of need for supplemental oxygen and the need for beta(2)-agonist treatment. There were significant decreases in plasma IL-4, IL-8 and eotaxin levels after 3 weeks of treatment with clarithromycin. Readmission to the hospital within 6 months after discharge was significantly lower in the clarithromycin group. In conclusion, clarithromycin has statistically significant effects on the clinical and laboratory findings in respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Therefore, clarithromycin treatment may be helpful in reducing the short-term effects of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis.

### Pediatric antibiotic use associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in the United States, 2008–2018 [^87b699f3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Understanding the contributions of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza infections to pediatric antibiotic use is limited. We aimed to estimate the proportions and incidence of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions associated with RSV and influenza infections in a sample of commercially insured US children.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions dispensed to children in the Optum Clinformatics DataMart from 2008 to 2018. We used negative binomial time series models regressing weekly antibiotic prescriptions against RSV and influenza circulation measures to estimate counterfactual rates of antibiotic prescriptions in the presence and absence of RSV and influenza circulation overall and by age group, census division, and antibiotic class. We considered syndromic RSV and influenza measures (medical claims) and laboratory measures (National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System) and controlled for age, division, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction, and seasonal and secular trends.

Results

An estimated 6.3% (95% CI, 5.2%–7.3%) and 3.4% (3.1%–3.8%) of antibiotic prescriptions were associated with RSV and influenza, respectively. These estimates translate to 72.6 (59.7–85.9) RSV-associated and 40.0 (35.1–45.1) influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 children annually. RSV-associated antibiotic prescription incidence was highest among children aged ≤ 5 years while influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions were highest among children > 5 years. Macrolides were the antibiotic class for which RSV and influenza accounted for the greatest share of prescribing.

Conclusions

RSV and influenza are associated with meaningful proportions of pediatric antibiotic prescriptions. Measures to prevent RSV and influenza infections in children, including immunization, may reduce antibiotic use and aid in mitigating antibiotic resistance.

### A systematic review of European clinical practice guidelines for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis [^cd664c57]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the widespread adoption of palivizumab prophylaxis in Europe, there have been a number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) published for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children. The aim of this systematic review was to identify CPGs for the prevention of RSV infection across Europe.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search and contacted European influenza and respiratory virus networks and public health institutions, to identify national CPGs for the prevention of RSV infection. The Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) Statement checklist was applied to extract data and review the quality of reporting.

Results

A total of 20 national CPGs were identified, all published between 2000 and 2018. The greatest discrepancy between guidelines was the recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis for premature infants, with recommendations varying by gestational age. All guidelines recommended or considered the use of palivizumab in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 85% (n = 17) in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), and 60% (n = 12) in children with severe combined immunodeficiency.

Conclusions

We recommend that agencies publishing RSV prevention guidelines adopt the RIGHT reporting requirements when updating these guidelines to improve the presentation of the evidence-base for decisions.

### Azithromycin treatment vs placebo in children with respiratory syncytial virus-induced respiratory failure: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^bc34ec0e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is azithromycin (AZM) safe, and does it reduce nasal and endotracheal matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) levels in children with respiratory syncytial virus–induced respiratory failure?

Findings

In this randomized phase 2 clinical trial that included 48 children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with respiratory syncytial virus lung disease who required positive pressure ventilation, AZM was safe. No difference in nasal MMP-9 levels was observed between treatment group, but in those who required mechanical ventilation and received a high dose of AZM, endotracheal active and total MMP-9 levels were lower on day 3 of treatment.

Meaning

In this study, high doses of AZM were safe, reduced endotracheal MMP-9 levels in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and potentially improved outcomes in critically ill children with respiratory syncytial virus infections.

### Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children [^8d59de15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month during five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV LRTI in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children.

Objectives

To assess the effects of palivizumab for preventing severe RSV infection in children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trials registers to 14 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We searched Embase to October 2020, as we did not have access to this database for 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care in children 0 to 24 months of age from both genders, regardless of RSV infection history. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results. Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all-cause mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay and mechanical ventilation days.

Main Results

We included five studies with a total of 3343 participants. All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low. Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow-up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness at two years' follow-up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow-up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow-up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low- and middle-income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.

### Lung ultrasound in infants with bronchiolitis [^053ac133]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite randomized controlled trials showed no benefit from routine antibacterial therapy for children with bronchiolitis, antibiotic therapy continues to be overused in young infants with bronchiolitis because of concern for fever, young age and secondary bacterial infection. Studies have shown that a child with a clear viral syndrome, such as bronchiolitis, has a much less than 1% risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI) concluding that routine screening for SBI among hospitalized febrile infants with bronchiolitis is not justified. Several retrospective studies and four prospective studies of SBI in bronchiolitis and/or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections also confirmed this.

Therefore, general literature is much distant from the article by Biagi et al. Nevertheless, considering the LUS use in this condition, we want to share our experience in LUS in infants with bronchiolitis to further reply.

### Pneumonia in low and middle income countries: progress and challenges [^37a16ad4]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Other respiratory viruses, other than influenza virus, also contribute considerably to the burden of childhood pneumonia. Globally, an estimated 100 million cases of viral-associated pneumonia occur annually in children; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common viral pathogens identified in affluent and in LAMICs. In 2005, RSV was estimated to cause approximately 34 million episodes of ALRI in children under 5 years or 22% of all ALRI; 10% of episodes resulted in severe illness and hospitalisation and 99% of deaths occurred in LAMICs. With improved immunisation against the main bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses may become more prominent as aetiologic agents of pneumonia. Moreover, current evidence suggests severe pneumonia results from infection with multiple pathogens such as bacterial-viral, dual viral or mycobacterial-bacterial infections. Up to a third of children with pneumonia may have viral-bacterial co-infections.

Treatment

The cornerstone of effective treatment for childhood pneumonia remains appropriate antibiotics and supportive care including oxygen. Use of oxygen systems in children with hypoxic pneumonia can reduce mortality by approximately 20%. Use of the pneumonia case management strategy included in the World Health Organisation Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) programme has consistently been reported to reduce childhood mortality by approximately 20%, with even higher reductions in pneumonia specific mortality. Community based case management of childhood pneumonia may reduce pneumonia mortality by 70%. Accumulating evidence suggests that community based use of oral antibiotics for severe pneumonia may be a feasible and effective strategy for reducing mortality. Furthermore, short course antibiotic therapy (3 rather than 5 days) has been reported to be effective for pneumonia in immunocompetent children.

The reduction of Hib and pneumococcal associated pneumonia through use of conjugate (HibCV and PCV) immunisation, underscores the need to reconsider the empiric treatment of pneumonia in settings where there are strong national immunisation programmes. With high coverage of HibCV, Hib is unlikely to contribute to a sizeable portion of pneumonia. The relative ongoing role of pneumococcus as an aetiologic agent for pneumonia, however, remains to be fully elucidated and may vary depending on the prevalence of disease causing non-vaccines serotypes. The impact of PCV and HibCV on the aetiology of childhood pneumonia in LAMICs is currently being evaluated in a large multicentre study, the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^4106d4de]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of palivizumab prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first published in a policy statement in 1998. AAP recommendations have been updated periodically to reflect the most recent literature regarding children at greatest risk of severe RSV disease. Since the last update in 2014, which refined prophylaxis guidance to focus on those children at greatest risk, data have become available regarding the seasonality of RSV circulation, the incidence and risk factors associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations, and the potential effects of the implementation of prophylaxis recommendations on hospitalization rates of children with RSV infection. This technical report summarizes the literature review by the Committee on Infectious Diseases, supporting the reaffirmation of the 2014 AAP policy statement on palivizumab prophylaxis among infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for RSV infection. Review of publications since 2014 did not support a change in recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis and continues to endorse the guidance provided in the 2021 Red Book.

### Azithromycin treatment vs placebo in children with respiratory syncytial virus-induced respiratory failure: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^b87c8df6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

We found that both doses of AZM were safe. No difference was observed in nasal MMP-9 levels across all groups. Patients who received high-dose AZM had lower endotracheal MMP-9 levels and had fewer hospitalization days. This trial provides the necessary foundation to plan a larger, multicenter randomized clinical trial that will be critical in determining the clinical effectiveness of high-dose AZM among children with severe RSV lung disease.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to nirsevimab prophylaxis, CDC 2023 guidelines recommend to offer one dose of nirsevimab in all infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season (50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg and 100 mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg).

### Pediatric antibiotic use associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in the United States, 2008–2018 [^206b5ba3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the contributions of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza infections to pediatric antibiotic use is limited. We aimed to estimate the proportions and incidence of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions associated with RSV and influenza infections in a sample of commercially-insured US children.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions dispensed to children in the Optum Clinformatics™ DataMart from 2008–2018. We used negative binomial time-series models regressing weekly antibiotic prescriptions against RSV and influenza circulation measures to estimate counterfactual rates of antibiotic prescriptions in the presence and absence of RSV and influenza circulation overall, by age group, census division, and antibiotic class. We considered syndromic (medical claims) and laboratory (National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System) RSV and influenza measures and controlled for age, division, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction, and seasonal and secular trends.

Results

An estimated 6.3% (95% confidence interval 5.2–7.3%) and 3.4% (3.1–3.8%) of antibiotic prescriptions were associated with RSV and influenza, respectively. These estimates translate to 72.6 (59.7–85.9) RSV-associated and 40.0 (35.1–45.1) influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 children annually. RSV-associated antibiotic prescription incidence was highest among children aged ≤ 5 years while influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions were highest among children > 5 years. Macrolides were the antibiotic class for which RSV and influenza accounted for the greatest share of prescribing.

Conclusions

RSV and influenza are associated with meaningful proportions of pediatric antibiotic prescriptions. Measures to prevent RSV and influenza infections in children, including immunization, may reduce antibiotic use and aid in mitigating antibiotic resistance.

Outcome Definitions

Study outcomes included all-cause and cause-specific outpatient pharmacy prescription dispensing events of antibiotic agents recommended for the management of pediatric AOM, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia (Supplementary Table 1). We created time series including the following: (1) all dispensed prescriptions of such antibiotics; (2) dispensed prescriptions linked to ARIs, defined as those occurring on or within 3 days of an ARI diagnosis; and (3) dispensed prescriptions linked to specific ARI syndromes, such as pneumonia, AOM, sinusitis, pharyngitis, nonsuppurative otitis media, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, allergy, asthma, viral upper respiratory infection (URI), influenza infection, and RSV infection (Supplementary Table 2). Prescriptions could be linked with > 1 syndrome. In defining prescriptions linked to ARIs, we excluded those occurring on or within 3 days after other diagnoses for which antibiotics would likely be indicated: urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, and other bacterial infections. Additionally, in defining prescriptions linked to specific ARI syndromes for which antibiotics are not indicated (bronchiolitis, bronchitis, allergy, asthma, nonsuppurative otitis media, viral URIs, RSV, influenza), we excluded those linked to ARI syndromes for which antibiotics may be indicated (pneumonia, AOM, sinusitis, pharyngitis). We defined syndromes using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes adapted from previously published categorizations.

We stratified outcomes by antibiotic class (penicillin, extended-spectrum β-lactams, macrolides, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, fluroquinolones, and other antibiotics; Supplementary Table 3), age category (0–2, 3–5, 6–9, 10–13, and 14–17 years, inclusive), and census division.

### Antibiotic overuse in a contemporary cohort of children hospitalized with influenza, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2: a retrospective cohort study [^ea19df72]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient demographic and clinical factors differed by virus type, which may have influenced medical management and could explain why antibiotic treatment differed by virus. Differences in patient demographics and comorbidities may also have contributed to the higher mortality observed in patients infected with COVID-19 compared to those infected with influenza and RSV. Hospitalized patients with RSV were significantly younger and less likely to receive antibiotics than patients with influenza. Clinicians may have been more likely to avoid antibiotics in patients hospitalized with RSV because these children were most commonly infants with bronchiolitis and were not as acutely ill as the patients with influenza.

We determined that several variables were independent predictors for receipt of antibiotic treatment, including mechanical ventilation, being in the ICU, and having influenza, comorbidities, concurrent non-respiratory infection, or elevated inflammatory markers. Antibiotic treatment of patients with influenza may stem from widespread clinician awareness of reports of influenza-associated Gram-positive bacterial pneumonia and the associated high mortality. Mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and comorbidities are predictors of antibiotic use likely because they reflect severe illness and medical complexity, respectively, in which empiric antibiotic treatment may be warranted. Similarly, antibiotic treatment is warranted for patients with concurrent infections that may not be culture-confirmed, which in this cohort was most commonly acute otitis media. However, antibiotic de-escalation in terms of narrowing spectrum or shortening duration of therapy in such patients is still possible and should be targets of stewardship programs. High inflammatory markers are likely strongly associated with antibiotic treatment because of clinician confidence that these tests indicate bacterial infection. However, these tests, especially CRP, have low specificity and low positive predictive value (PPV) for bacterial infection and can be elevated in viral infections. Providers should be wary about prescribing antibiotics based solely on the results of inflammatory markers, without consideration of the clinical context.

### Viral infections of the lower respiratory tract: old viruses, new viruses, and the role of diagnosis [^4b7c4676]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Viral infections of the lower respiratory tract cause an enormous disease burden in children, and the role of respiratory viruses in serious lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in older adults is increasingly appreciated. Although viruses are responsible for a large proportion LRTIs, antibiotics are often prescribed. New diagnostic platforms have the potential to detect a wider range of established and newly discovered viruses with greater sensitivity. This will create additional challenges. Although it is clear that influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus are important causes of pneumonia, the role of rhinoviruses and some of the newly described viruses, including human coronaviruses and bocavirus, is harder to determine. Better diagnostic tests that establish the cause of LRTIs in children have the potential to both reduce overall antibiotic use and to improve the targeted use of antibiotics. In addition, rapid identification of viral infections can help control nosocomial transmission.

Table 4.
Model-Estimated Incidence of Antibiotic Prescriptions Associated With Influenza Virus Infection by Age Group and Diagnosis Among Children Aged 0–17 Years, 2008–2018

By class, the most frequently dispensed antibiotics were penicillins (33.4% of prescriptions), followed by macrolides (20.7%) and cephalosporins (20.4%; Table 1). RSV was associated with > 6% of penicillin, macrolide, and extended-spectrum β-lactam prescriptions (Table 5). Influenza was associated with 4.4% (95% CI, 4.2%–4.6%) of macrolide prescriptions and 3.8% (3.6%–4.0%) of penicillin prescriptions.

Table 5.
Model-Estimated Proportion of Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions Associated With RSV and Influenza Virus Infection by Antibiotic Class

RSV and influenza visit incidence rates were highest in the East South Central Division (Supplementary Table 8). Overall (Table 1) and RSV- and influenza-attributable (Supplementary Table 9) antibiotic prescriptions were concentrated among divisions in the South. There was wide variation in point estimates of the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions associated with RSV, although 95% CIs overlapped. Differences in influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions were less apparent.

Sensitivity analyses based on a linear model, modifying the antibiotic definition to include all agents and including children with pharmacy dispenses within ± 2 years of each study week, yielded results similar to those derived from primary analyses (Supplementary Tables 10–12). Including antibiotic prescriptions linked to diagnoses for which antibiotics may be indicated yielded only slight changes in the incidence of RSV- and influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions linked to bronchiolitis, bronchitis, nonsuppurative otitis media, allergy, asthma, and viral URI diagnoses (Supplementary Table 13).

5 MICROBIOME

The complex communities of microbes inhabiting all parts of the human body are collectively termed the microbiome. This immense microbial environment has the potential for stimulating the developing immune system, 31 as well as act as a disease modifier. The link between microbiome and susceptibility to bronchiolitis and subsequent asthma has been explored both regarding the airway and the gut microbiome, but the mechanisms behind the possible effects remain to be fully understood.

As it comes to the microbiome of the airways, a diverse microbiological continuity exists between upper and lower airways. 32 The dramatic development of the microbiome of the airways begins at birth and is influenced by factors such as siblings, day‐care attendance, antibiotics, and prior infections (Figure 3). 33, 34 It has been speculated whether this low biomass compartment will obtain a steady colonization pattern over time. Recent studies have suggested that certain microbial colonization patterns prevalent already in early childhood may affect the risk of bronchiolitis and precede the development of persistent wheeze or asthma. 35 Furthermore, the severity of the acute respiratory infections may be modulated by the type of microbial community in the airways independent of RSV or RV coinfection, while at the same time, both RSV and RV may increase the severity of the infection independent of the bacteria. 34 It has also been shown that antibiotic treatment during acute wheezing episodes in childhood greatly decreases the duration of the symptoms, thus pointing toward microbial effects. 36 Likewise, a study of 1005 infants demonstrated that certain airway microbiota profiles seemed to increase the severity of bronchiolitis. 37 The rate of intensive care use and the length of hospital stay during the episode of acute bronchiolitis were particularly high in infants with a Haemophilus ‐dominant profile but low in infants with a Moraxella ‐dominant profile. This, although low in statistical power, was especially apparent in children with RSV bronchiolitis but not found for RV bronchiolitis. In a small randomized trial of 40 children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, treatment with azithromycin during the acute episode seemed to alleviate the subsequent risk of long‐term respiratory morbidity. 38

INTRODUCTION

Respiratory infections are a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, and health care costs worldwide. These infections cause acute local and systemic illnesses that range in severity and have the potential to cause severe disease, especially in the young and elderly. The vast majority (90%) of these are viral in nature, although as many as 60% of patients are ineffectively treated with antibiotics for these viral infections.

The economic impact of overprescribing antibiotics is 2-fold, including the initial costly misuse of the antibiotics plus the ultimate cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections (ARI) later on. Such occurrence of ARI has been estimated to cost more than $20,000 per infected patient. The clinical impact of overprescribing antibiotics includes the increased spread of viral infections, increased bacterial drug resistance, and increased cost. Knowing whether a respiratory infection is viral or bacterial allows for more effective patient isolation and infection control.

Respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the most common cause of acute illness and physician visits in the United States. The frequency of respiratory viral infections is highest in children under 4 years of age. School-age children average 5 to 8 respiratory virus infections per year, and adults average 2 to 4 infections per year. In the United States, an estimated 200,000 people are hospitalized annually due to influenza alone, with more than 36,000, typically the elderly and immunocompromised, dying from the disease each year.

Traditional laboratory tests, such as culture, serology, and direct immunofluorescence, have been used to identify the infectious pathogens. However, the slow results from culture and the poor reliability of rapid immunoassay-based respiratory tests present challenges to clinicians and hospitals. Molecular diagnostic tests such as PCR methods offer high sensitivity, speed, and cost advantages over traditional methods, such as culture or direct immunofluorescence (DFA), and have been the focus of clinical laboratories for more than a decade. Rapid and early diagnosis of the causative pathogen in respiratory illness aids in patient diagnosis, treatment management, and the avoidance of overprescribing antibiotics.
