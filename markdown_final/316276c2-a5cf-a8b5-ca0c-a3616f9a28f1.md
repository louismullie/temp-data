## Question

Statin dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statins cause dementia or cognitive decline, and how to interpret the mixed evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of statins affecting cognition. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized controlled trial evidence. Next, I will examine observational data and why they might diverge from RCTs. After that, I need to check for any subgroup signals, including APOE ε4, sex, and timing of initiation. Finally, I will integrate safety considerations, guideline positions, and practical clinical recommendations, including what to do if a patient reports cognitive symptoms on a statin.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. Statins reduce LDL cholesterol, and cholesterol is abundant in the brain, where it supports synaptic function, so it is theoretically possible that lowering cholesterol could impair cognition. Conversely, statins may reduce amyloid-beta production and have anti-inflammatory effects, which could be neuroprotective, so the net effect is not obvious and must be resolved empirically rather than assumed from mechanism alone [^10e15e1b] [^70250c61].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence, namely randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. The Cochrane review of two large RCTs including 26,340 participants found no reduction in dementia incidence with simvastatin or pravastatin and no differences in cognitive performance, with moderate-quality evidence, which argues against a causal preventive effect of statins on dementia in late life [^155a8ae0] [^4f95ac5d]. A 2025 meta-analysis of 20 RCTs with 139,169 participants likewise found no significant reduction in incident cognitive impairment or dementia with lipid-lowering therapy overall or with statins specifically, reinforcing that RCTs do not show benefit or harm for cognition at the population level [^4b0a6acf] [^b01a728f]. Earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs similarly report no cognitive harm or benefit, which aligns with this conclusion [^42afbdc5] [^9015c188].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; observational studies often suggest protective associations, and I need to check why they diverge. Large observational cohorts and meta-analyses frequently report lower dementia risk with statin use, but these designs are vulnerable to confounding by indication, healthy-user effects, and reverse causation, especially when statin exposure is ascertained close to dementia onset or when cognitive status influences medication adherence and discontinuation patterns [^586097a4] [^c85b36ed]. Emulated target trials and other rigorous observational designs that attempt to mimic RCTs have generally found null or very small effects, which helps reconcile the discrepancy by highlighting bias in conventional observational studies [^5916d018] [^a42e6733].

> I should double-check whether any subgroup signals emerge. Some observational and genetic-stratified analyses suggest that statin initiation may be associated with lower incident Alzheimer's disease, particularly among APOE ε4 carriers, but these are observational and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive; I need to emphasize that these findings require confirmation in RCTs before changing practice [^9275c2a3] [^bc27879b]. Conversely, a large emulated trial across diverse sociodemographic groups found no significant modification of statin effects on dementia incidence by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, or income, which tempers enthusiasm for subgroup-specific benefits [^a42e6733].

> Let me consider timing and duration, because this is often cited as a potential explanation for null RCTs. Midlife dyslipidemia is associated with later dementia, and some observational data suggest that longer cumulative statin exposure or earlier initiation might confer benefit, but RCTs have not tested midlife initiation with long-term cognitive outcomes, so this remains speculative and cannot be used to recommend statins solely for dementia prevention at this time [^e56b289a] [^42a67bf8]. I should confirm that current RCTs largely enroll older adults with relatively short follow-up, which may miss delayed effects, but until trials with midlife initiation and long follow-up are completed, this remains a hypothesis rather than evidence-based guidance [^a730440d].

> Now, I need to ensure safety is addressed clearly. Multiple meta-analyses and large cohorts indicate that statins are not associated with clinically meaningful cognitive harm at the population level, and the FDA's 2012 label change noting rare reports of cognitive symptoms reflects case-level signals rather than population-level risk; nonetheless, rare idiosyncratic reports do occur, so clinicians should remain open to individual susceptibility [^42afbdc5] [^9015c188] [^398b97f8]. Very low LDL-C levels achieved with intensive therapy, including statin plus ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors, have not been linked to increased neurocognitive adverse events in trials, which reassures me about safety even with aggressive lipid lowering in appropriate patients [^8331905a].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend statins for primary prevention in adults older than 75 years, but it also notes that statins are not associated with cognitive harms in the general adult population, which supports continuing statins for cardiovascular indications without undue concern for dementia risk [^5e68118a]. The National Lipid Association advises that statins as a class are not associated with adverse cognitive effects and recommends that if a patient reports cognitive symptoms after starting a statin, clinicians should evaluate other causes, consider switching to a hydrophilic statin such as pravastatin or rosuvastatin, and only discontinue if symptoms persist after a monitored trial off therapy [^7e7eb618]. For patients with advanced dementia or very limited life expectancy, deprescribing conversations are appropriate, but observational data suggest that stopping statins may increase cardiovascular events, so decisions should be individualized and preference-sensitive [^4dd0adc3] [^ca86e8eb].

> I will now examine practical clinical steps when patients report cognitive symptoms on statins. First, I should confirm the temporal relationship and screen for alternative etiologies such as sleep apnea, depression, thyroid disease, polypharmacy, and neurodegenerative disease, because these are common and often more plausible explanations than statin toxicity [^notfound]. If the timeline is compelling, a cautious trial of statin discontinuation for about 4–6 weeks with close follow-up is reasonable, and if symptoms resolve, switching to a hydrophilic statin and retrying is a sensible strategy supported by expert guidance, even though the evidence base for this approach is largely expert opinion rather than RCT-proven [^7e7eb618]. I should document baseline cognitive function when feasible to avoid misattribution of preexisting decline to statins, and I should avoid reflexively stopping a medication with proven cardiovascular benefit unless the cognitive complaint is clearly temporally linked and persistent after other causes are excluded [^7e7eb618].

> But wait, what if the patient is concerned about dementia prevention specifically? I need to ensure I communicate clearly that current high-quality evidence does not support starting statins solely to prevent dementia, and that ongoing large trials like STAREE may clarify whether longer-term or midlife initiation changes dementia risk, so we should not overpromise benefit where it has not been demonstrated [^a730440d]. In the meantime, I should reinforce that statins remain indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction, and that any cognitive effects appear to be neutral at the population level, with rare individual exceptions that warrant individualized management rather than broad policy changes [^5e68118a] [^42afbdc5].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: statins do not cause dementia in the general population, and high-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show no reduction in incident dementia or cognitive decline with statin therapy, so statins should not be withheld for fear of cognitive harm, nor should they be initiated solely to prevent dementia. If a patient reports cognitive symptoms after starting a statin, I should evaluate other causes, consider a carefully monitored discontinuation trial, and consider switching to a hydrophilic statin if symptoms recur, while maintaining shared decision-making about the cardiovascular benefits that typically outweigh theoretical or rare cognitive risks [^155a8ae0] [^4b0a6acf] [^7e7eb618] [^5e68118a].

Statins do not cause dementia or cognitive decline in older adults [^a6a441b4] [^42afbdc5]. Large randomized trials and meta-analyses show **no increase in dementia or cognitive impairment** with statins, and observational studies suggesting benefit are likely biased [^586097a4] [^155a8ae0]. The FDA's 2012 warning about rare, reversible cognitive symptoms was based on case reports, not robust evidence, and **does not justify stopping statins** for cardiovascular prevention [^398b97f8] [^7e7eb618]. If cognitive symptoms occur, consider switching to a hydrophilic statin (e.g. pravastatin, rosuvastatin) or temporarily stopping therapy, but overall, statins are safe for cognition and should be continued when indicated [^7e7eb618] [^1926a3e0].

---

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

Multiple large RCTs and meta-analyses have evaluated statins and cognition:

- **PROSPER trial**: Pravastatin 40 mg in older adults showed no effect on cognitive function over 3.2 years [^16ce039e].
- **Heart Protection Study**: Simvastatin 40 mg over 5 years showed no difference in dementia incidence or cognitive impairment vs placebo [^155a8ae0].
- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses (including > 100,000 participants) show no significant increase in dementia or cognitive impairment with statins; pooled OR ~0.96 (95% CI 0.74–1.26) [^4b0a6acf] [^b01a728f].

---

## Evidence from observational studies

Observational studies have shown mixed results, with some suggesting a protective association, likely due to **confounding by indication** and healthy-user bias [^586097a4]. For example:

- **Rotterdam Study**: Statin use associated with lower Alzheimer risk (HR 0.57), but this design cannot establish causality [^2f15ba9f].
- **Baltimore Longitudinal Study**: Statin users had lower dementia risk, but propensity-adjusted analyses still face residual confounding [^a9fb5528].
- **Emulated target trials**: Designs that mimic RCTs generally show null effects, supporting the absence of a causal benefit [^5916d018] [^a42e6733].

---

## Biological plausibility and mechanisms

Statins may theoretically affect cognition via cholesterol reduction in the brain or pleiotropic effects (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant), but the brain is largely self-sufficient for cholesterol and statins have limited CNS penetration, making clinically meaningful cognitive effects unlikely [^89f7b568]. Rare case reports of reversible cognitive symptoms exist, but no causal mechanism has been established [^398b97f8].

---

## FDA warning and clinical implications

In 2012, the FDA added a warning about rare, reversible cognitive symptoms (memory loss, confusion) based on case reports, not RCTs. This warning does not indicate a causal link or a need to stop statins for cardiovascular prevention [^398b97f8]. Clinically, **cognitive symptoms are rare and usually resolve after stopping the statin** [^1926a3e0].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that statins are not associated with cognitive harm and should be continued for cardiovascular indications:

- **National Lipid Association**: No need for routine cognitive monitoring; if symptoms occur, consider switching to a hydrophilic statin or temporary cessation [^7e7eb618].
- **American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association**: No evidence of statin-related cognitive harm; continue statins as indicated [^notfound].
- **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force**: Insufficient evidence for or against statins in adults > 75, but no cognitive harm signal identified [^5e68118a].

---

## Practical clinical approach

If a patient reports cognitive symptoms after starting a statin:

- **Evaluate**: Rule out other causes (medications, depression, sleep apnea, thyroid disease, neurodegenerative disease).
- **Adjust**: Consider switching to a hydrophilic statin (pravastatin, rosuvastatin) or temporarily stopping therapy.
- **Monitor**: Reassess cognition after changes; symptoms often resolve if statin-related [^1926a3e0].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Statins do not cause dementia or cognitive decline in older adults [^a6a441b4]. The balance of evidence shows **no cognitive harm**, and rare, reversible symptoms can be managed with individualized adjustments. Statins should be continued for cardiovascular prevention unless there is a clear temporal association with cognitive symptoms that persist despite addressing other causes [^7e7eb618].

Firm conclusions about whether mid-life or long-term statin use has an impact on cognitive decline and dementia remain elusive. Here, our objective was to systematically review, synthesize and critique the epidemiological literature that examines the relationship between statin use and cognition, so as to assess the current state of knowledge, identify gaps in our understanding, and make recommendations for future research. We summarize the findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, grouped according to study design. We discuss the methods for each, and consider likely sources of bias, such as reverse causation and confounding. Although observational studies that considered statin use at or near the time of dementia diagnosis suggest a protective effect of statins, these findings could be attributable to reverse causation. RCTs and well-conducted observational studies of baseline statin use and subsequent cognition over several years of follow-up do not support a causal preventative effect of late-life statin use on cognitive decline or dementia. Given that much of the human research on statins and cognition in the future will be observational, careful study design and analysis will be essential.

### Statin withdrawal in people with dementia [^de482a37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are approximately 24 million people worldwide with dementia; this is likely to increase to 81 million by 2040. Dementia is a progressive condition, and usually leads to death eight to ten years after first symptoms. End-of-life care should emphasise treatments that optimise quality of life and physicians should minimise unnecessary or non-beneficial interventions. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors; they have become the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for the management of hypercholesterolaemia but their ability to provide benefit is unclear in the last weeks or months of life. Withdrawal of statins may improve quality of life in people with advanced dementia, as they will not be subjected to unnecessary polypharmacy or side effects. However, they may help to prevent further vascular events in people of advanced age who are at high risk of such events.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of statins in people with dementia on: cognitive outcomes, adverse events, behavioural and functional outcomes, mortality, quality of life, vascular morbidity, and healthcare costs.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register on 11 February 2016. We also ran additional searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Clinical. Trials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP on 11 February 2016, to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised, controlled clinical trials with either a placebo or 'no treatment' control group. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We found no studies suitable for inclusion therefore analysed no data.

Main Results

The search strategy identified 28 unique references, all of which were excluded.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to enable us to make an informed decision about statin withdrawal in dementia. Randomised controlled studies need to be conducted to assess cognitive and other effects of statins in participants with dementia, especially when the disease is advanced.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ceb97f3f]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cognitive impairment and dementia are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, an estimated 57.4 million people were living with dementia globally in 2019, with a predicted increase in prevalent cases of 166% by 2050. Identification of population-level interventions to reduce the burden of dementia is a public health priority.

Vascular cognitive impairment is a leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Accordingly, interventions that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be expected to also slow progression of vascular cognitive impairment, and there is evidence that blood pressure lowering significantly reduces the risk of dementia (relative risk reduction of 13%). Lipid lower agents (e.g. statins) are effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but have not been reported to be associated with a reduction in cognitive impairment and dementia. Findings from observational studies have been inconsistent, with some studies reporting an association of lipid-lowering therapy and reduced risk of dementia, whilst others report an increased risk, the latter studies have been used to advance a case against statin use. In addition, the association of LDL-C levels and future risk of dementia also appears complex, and may be J-shaped, with potential implications of an increased risk associated with low LDL-C levels.

Whilst prior meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating lipid-lowering therapy have not reported a significant reduction in dementia risk, the sample size of the included trials were insufficient to detect a modest treatment effect of lipid-lowering medications. Since the publication of these meta-analyses, additional RCTs have been published, including those evaluating PCSK9 inhibitors, providing an opportunity to update the evidence.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether lipid-lowering therapy, compared to control, was associated with a reduction in risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4b0a6acf]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Lipid-lowering agents are effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but their effect on cognitive impairment and dementia is uncertain. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether lipid-lowering therapy, compared to control, was associated with a reduction in risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing lipid-lowering therapy to control that reported dementia or change in cognitive scores, adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect. The primary outcome measure was incident cognitive impairment or dementia.

Results

Twenty randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion, 15 trials (n = 139 169 participants) reported dementia or cognitive impairment on follow-up (primary outcome) and nine trials (n = 32 370) reported on change in cognitive score. The mean (SD) age of trial participants was 65.4 (5.06) years in the intervention arm and 65.4 (5.03) in the control arm. Lipid-lowering therapy compared with control was not associated with a significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment (1.33% vs 1.36% over a mean trial follow-up of 34.5 months; Odds Ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.74–1.26). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 37.6%). There was no significant association amongst drug classes (Statin; OR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.67–1.21, PCSK9 inhibitor: OR 1.77; 95% CI, 0.46–6.83, Other: OR 0.85; 0.61–1.17).

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of over 100 000 participants, lipid-lowering therapy was not significantly associated with a lower risk of incident cognitive impairment or dementia. This meta-analysis provides evidence to support the safety of lipid-lowering therapy on cognitive health, however, does not provide evidence of risk reduction of incident cognitive impairment or dementia.

### Cholesterol and late-life cognitive decline [^e354a771]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2012). Low credibility.

High cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but their role in dementia and cognitive decline is less clear. This review highlights current knowledge on the role of cholesterol in late-life cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia. When measured in midlife, high cholesterol levels associate with an increased risk of late-life dementia and cognitive decline. However, when measured in late-life, high cholesterol levels show no association with cognitive function, or even show an inverse relation. Although statin treatment has been shown to associate with a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline in observational studies, randomized controlled trials show no beneficial effect of statin treatment on late-life cognitive function. Lowering cholesterol levels may impair brain function, since cholesterol is essential for synapse formation and maturation and plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction through its function as a component of the cell membrane. However, membrane cholesterol also plays a role in the formation and aggregation of amyloid-β. Factors that influence cholesterol metabolism, such as dietary intake, are shown to play a role in late-life cognitive function and the risk of dementia. In conclusion, cholesterol associates with late-life cognitive function, but the association is strongly age-dependent. There is no evidence that treatment with statins in late-life has a beneficial effect on cognitive function.

### Cholesterol, statins, and dementia: what the cardiologist should know [^f0e07a7b]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer dementia (AD) is an important clinical problem that appears to be closely tied to comorbid cardiovascular disease, making it a relevant topic for the clinical cardiologist. Determinants of cardiovascular health, especially midlife dyslipidemia, are associated with an increased risk of dementia based on molecular and epidemiologic data. Given the potential role of dyslipidemia in the development of dementia, statins have been investigated as potential therapeutic options to slow or prevent disease. This review discusses the role of dyslipidemia and other cardiovascular risk factors in the pathogenesis of AD, with a focus on the existing evidence for the use of statin medications in the treatment and prevention of AD from observational studies and randomized clinical trials. Clinical questions for the practicing cardiologist are addressed.

Statins

Seven meta-analyses investigated the association between statin use and dementia risk (Table 1). Meta-analyses included between six and 36 studies with participant numbers ranging from 13,770–9,162,509. Pooled RR estimates ranged from 0.62 (95% CI 0.43–0.81) to 0.85 (95% CI 0.80–0.89) (Table 2). Heterogeneity ranged from 31–98%. Number of critical quality components met ranged from two to seven. There was 27% of overlap of studies between meta-analyses (Supplement 4).

Wong et al. was the only meta-analysis to include an RCT investigating incidence of dementia among 20,536 participants. They found no association between simvastatin use and dementia risk (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.61–1.65) (Table 2). Meta-analyses reported high levels of bias within individual studies, and most were limited to cohort studies.

There was evidence of reduced incidence of all-cause dementia among hydrophilic statins in three meta-analyses (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63–0.82, to RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.94), though Wong et al. found no association (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70–1.63). The evidence for lipophilic statins was weaker, with 95% CIs for effect estimates in two out of four meta-analyses including the null value, and upper limits of 95% CIs in the remaining two approaching the null (Table 2).

There was a possible dose-response gradient between statin use and risk of dementia in one meta-analysis, showing that risk of dementia reduced by 20% per one year of statins use (RR: 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.87), and with increasing doses of statins (RR: 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.96). GRADE was upgraded to a moderate certainty of a reduced risk of dementia (Table 3).

### Statins for the prevention of dementia [^155a8ae0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05).

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.

### Benefits and harms of statins in people with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^28dcb9f7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

More people with dementia also fall into the category of high vascular risk, for which a statin is usually prescribed. However, these recommendations are based on studies in people without dementia. We aimed to evaluate the evidence for the long-term effectiveness and harm of statin therapy in patients with dementia.

Design

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials and observational research.

Setting

Publications from developed countries indexed in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane trial database between 2007 and 2019.

Participants

Trials including people with all types of dementia with a mean age older than 65 years.

Intervention

Treatment with a statin for 6 months or longer.

Measurements

Major adverse cardiovascular events, dementia progression, and general health at 2 years, or medication adverse events (AEs) at any time. Each article was assessed for bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa or Cochrane Collaboration tools. A narrative synthesis and pooled analyses are reported.

Results

Five articles met the inclusion criteria. They reported only on dementia of the Alzheimer's type. There was no evidence regarding cardiovascular events or general health. We made a very low confidence finding that statins reduce dementia progression based on three cohort studies of heterogeneous design. We made a very low confidence finding of no significant difference in AEs based on two randomized controlled trials of 18 months: odds ratios of any AE = 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .83–1.77), serious AE = 1.03 (95% CI = .76–1.87), and death = 1.69 (95% CI = .79–3.62).

Conclusion

Evidence was insufficient to fully evaluate the efficacy of statins in people with dementia. We found that statins may have a small benefit delaying progression in Alzheimer's dementia, although this conflicted with previous findings from shorter randomized trials. For safety, the trial data lacked power to show clinically important differences between the groups. We recommend that clinical data be leveraged for further observational studies to inform prescribing decisions. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:650–658, 2020.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^459af88c]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and objectives

Lipid-lowering agents are effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but their effect on cognitive impairment and dementia is uncertain. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether lipid-lowering therapy, compared to control, was associated with a reduction in risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing lipid-lowering therapy to control that reported dementia or change in cognitive scores, adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect. The primary outcome measure was incident cognitive impairment or dementia.

Results

Twenty randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion, 15 trials (n = 139 169 participants) reported dementia or cognitive impairment on follow-up (primary outcome) and nine trials (n = 32 370) reported on change in cognitive score. The mean (SD) age of trial participants was 65.4 (5.06) years in the intervention arm and 65.4 (5.03) in the control arm. Lipid-lowering therapy compared with control was not associated with a significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment (1.33% vs 1.36% over a mean trial follow-up of 34.5 months; Odds Ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.74–1.26). Heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 37.6%). There was no significant association amongst drug classes (Statin; OR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.67–1.21, PCSK9 inhibitor: OR 1.77; 95% CI, 0.46–6.83, Other: OR 0.85; 0.61–1.17).

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of over 100 000 participants, lipid-lowering therapy was not significantly associated with a lower risk of incident cognitive impairment or dementia. This meta-analysis provides evidence to support the safety of lipid-lowering therapy on cognitive health, however, does not provide evidence of risk reduction of incident cognitive impairment or dementia.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fac46493]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

On meta-analysis which included fifteen trials with 139 169 participants for the primary outcome analysis found no association of lipid-lowering therapy compared with control with dementia or cognitive impairment.

Our findings are consistent with prior meta-analyses of RCTs evaluating lipid-lowering therapy which have not reported a significant reduction, or increase, in dementia risk. However, our findings are more robust due to larger number of RCTs included and a four-fold increase in cumulative sample size. In the most recent Cochrane review, evaluating statin therapy, they included two trials with 26,340 participants. Our meta-analysis included 13 additional trials and 112 829 additional participants. Consequently, we add increased confidence in estimates for the association, and add to expanded outcomes by including both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia outcomes.

Unlike some other vascular risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension), the relationship of lipids with brain health is complex. For example, an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, but a lower risk of intracerebral haemorrhage, both of which are mechanism implicated in cognitive decline. There are compelling reasons to suspect a beneficial effect on vascular dementia, such as observational evidence which has demonstrated an association between elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and dementia risk, laboratory findings that cerebral AB generation is cholesterol dependent and identification of apolipoprotein E4 allele which is involved in cholesterol metabolism as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, mechanisms whereby lipid-lowering might have adverse effects on cognitive function mediated through nonvascular mechanisms have also been suggested, and in 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration released adverse event information regarding cognitive impairment. In this light, our meta-analysis provides evidence to support the safety of statin therapy on cognitive health. Whilst we do report that lipid-lowering therapy was associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia, this association was attenuated in a sensitivity analysis excluding open-label extension studies. During open label follow-up outcome ascertainment may have differed by treatment allocation, therefore this result should be interpreted with caution.

### Does statin use cause memory decline in the elderly? [^8e856a33]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Statin therapy has strong evidence supporting health benefits and mortality reduction in cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, renal disease, and genetic lipid disorders. Further, reports that statin therapy might be protective against Alzheimer's disease have subsequently been refuted in randomized trials. Low-level evidence based on case reports suggests that statins may adversely affect memory, a significant consumer concern. In this review, the published evidence on statins and memory in the elderly in randomized controlled trials and prospective observational cohort studies was examined in detail. Overall, there was moderate-strength evidence that statin therapy did not increase the risk of dementia in the elderly and low-strength evidence for no increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Further, there was moderate-strength evidence that statin therapy in the elderly did not increase the risk for mild cognitive impairment or worsen global cognitive performance in the cognitively intact or impaired. There was moderate-strength evidence for no deterioration of memory function in the elderly. On balance, there was a moderate level of evidence of neither harm nor benefit on memory; however, the published literature contains a number of deficiencies that are detailed in this review, not limited to selection biases and deficiencies of detailed testing.

### Is statin-associated cognitive impairment clinically relevant? A narrative review and clinical recommendations [^1926a3e0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the impact of statin use on cognition.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (1950-November 2011), EMBASE (1980-November 2011), and the Cochrane Library (1960-November 2011) using the search terms "cognition/drug effects", "delirium, dementia, amnestic, cognitive disorders/chemically induced", "memory disorders/chemically induced", "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors/adverse effects", and "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors". A bibliographic search on included references was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were included for analysis if they were conducted in humans and examined the impact of statin use on cognition as either a primary or secondary endpoint; case reports and case series were also included for analysis.

Data Synthesis

Reports of statin-associated cognitive impairment were found primarily in observational studies (eg, case reports/series). One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that simvastatin impaired some measures of cognition compared to placebo. Conversely, in the majority of randomized controlled trials and observational studies, statins were found to have either a neutral or beneficial effect on cognition. Preliminary data suggest that statins that are less lipophilic (ie, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) may be less likely to contribute to cognitive impairment due to limited penetration across the blood-brain barrier. These drugs would be a logical alternative in cases where cognitive impairment secondary to another statin is suspected.

Conclusions

Despite several reports of statin-associated cognitive impairment, this adverse effect remains a rare occurrence among the totality of the literature. If statin-associated cognitive impairment is suspected, a trial discontinuation can reveal a temporal relationship. Switching from lipophilic to hydrophilic statins may resolve cognitive impairment. The vascular benefits and putative cognitive benefits outweigh the risk of cognitive impairment associated with statin use; therefore, the current evidence does not support changing practice with respect to statin use, given this adverse effect.

### Statins and cognitive function: a systematic review [^42afbdc5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning regarding cognitive impairment, the relationship between statins and cognition remains unknown.

Purpose

To examine the effect of statins on cognition.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception through October 2012; FDA databases from January 1986 through March 2012.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies evaluating cognition in patients receiving statins.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted data, 1 reviewer assessed study risk of bias, and 1 reviewer checked all assessments.

Data Synthesis

Among statin users, low-quality evidence suggested no increased incidence of Alzheimer disease and no difference in cognitive performance related to procedural memory, attention, or motor speed. Moderate-quality evidence suggested no increased incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment or any change in cognitive performance related to global cognitive performance scores, executive function, declarative memory, processing speed, or visuoperception. Examination of the FDA postmarketing surveillance databases revealed a low reporting rate for cognitive-related adverse events with statins that was similar to the rates seen with other commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications.

Limitations

The absence of many well-powered RCTs for most outcomes resulted in final strengths of evidence that were low or moderate. Imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias also limited the strength of findings.

Conclusion

Larger and better-designed studies are needed to draw unequivocal conclusions about the effect of statins on cognition. Published data do not suggest an adverse effect of statins on cognition; however, the strength of available evidence is limited, particularly with regard to high-dose statins.

### Statins and vascular dementia: a review [^e29eb8dd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The impact of statin therapy on dementia has been a hot topic of debate over the last decade and still remains highly controversial. Among all causes of dementia, vascular dementia (VaD) is the one type that is more likely to benefit from statins. To date no randomized clinical trials have been published and no systematic review has investigated a possible preventive effect of statins on the VaD subtype. In the present literature review, we tried to identify all available data on the effect of statins specifically in patients with VaD, and to further discuss this possible association. Our literature search highlighted two cross-sectional studies, two prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study. Two of the studies found a significant positive effect of statin treatment on VaD, depicted by the lower incidence of VaD in statin users, while the others reported non-significant associations. The relatively small numbers of VaD patients and statin users, as well as the presence of confounders and biases, make the interpretation of results extremely difficult. Statins may exert a benefit in the prevention of all-type dementia and VaD, through several mechanisms except for hyperlipidemia reduction. A well-designed randomized clinical trial is the ideal study design to address the effect of statin therapy in VaD and to draw final conclusions.

### Remembering statins: Do statins have adverse cognitive effects? [^398b97f8]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The issue of statin-associated cognitive impairment has been a hot topic among both patients and health care providers, especially since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement regarding rare postmarketing reports of ill-defined cognitive impairment associated with statin use. This statement was based on case reports, and no objective measures of cognitive function were used. Nevertheless, many patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease have expressed concerns about possible cognitive decline and may have opted to forgo statin therapy. In this overview, the evidence leading to the statement by the FDA is reviewed. Potential mechanisms of the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction and statin therapy on cognition are discussed. Evidence from observational and prospective randomized trials is summarized, leading to the conclusion that as for now, there is no good evidence that statins cause cognitive impairment to a significant degree. Reported cases seem to be rare, and a causal relationship has not been established.

### Do statins impair cognition? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^9015c188]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding potential adverse effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on cognition, based on the Adverse Events Reporting System and a review of the medical literature. We aimed to synthesize randomized clinical trial (RCTs) evidence on the association between statin therapy and cognitive outcomes.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL through December 2012, and reviewed published systematic reviews of statin treatment. We sought RCTs that compared statin treatment versus placebo or standard care, and reported at least one cognitive outcome (frequency of adverse cognitive events or measurements using standard neuropsychological cognitive test scores). Studies reporting sufficient information to calculate effect sizes were included in meta-analyses. Standardized and unstandardized mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes for global cognition and for pre-specified cognitive domains. The main outcome was change in cognition measured by neuropsychological tests; an outcome of secondary interest was the frequency of adverse cognitive events observed during follow-up.

Results

We identified 25 RCTs (all placebo-controlled) reporting cognitive outcomes in 46,836 subjects, of which 23 RCTs reported cognitive test results in 29,012 participants. Adverse cognitive outcomes attributable to statins were rarely reported in trials involving cognitively normal or impaired subjects. Furthermore, meta-analysis of cognitive test data (14 studies; 27,643 participants) failed to show significant adverse effects of statins on all tests of cognition in either cognitively normal subjects (standardized mean difference 0.01, 95% confidence interval, CI, -0.01 to 0.03, p = 0.42) or Alzheimer's disease subjects (standardized mean difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10, p = 0.38).

Conclusions

Statin therapy was not associated with cognitive impairment in RCTs. These results raise questions regarding the continued merit of the FDA warning about potential adverse effects of statins on cognition.

### Association of familial hypercholesterolemia and statin use with risk of dementia in Norway [^4484593d]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is genetically caused high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with increased risk of dementia?

Findings

This cohort study including 3520 individuals with genetically verified familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and 69 713 age-matched and sex-matched controls found no excess risk of dementia for patients with FH vs matched controls. Furthermore, there was no association between statin use and dementia.

Meaning

These findings suggest that individuals with FH have no excess risk of dementia and that there is no association between long-term high-intensity statin use and dementia risk.

### Statins and cognitive side effects: what cardiologists need to know [^a7391749]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Statins are widely used in secondary and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. They reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, and have an excellent safety record. Recent case reports suggest a possible association between statins and adverse effects on cognition. This article reviews recent literature related to statins and cognition and provides recommendations to clinicians. Cognitive considerations should not play a role in decision making for most patients for whom statins are indicated. Future trials of statin, or any novel antilipemic agent should include systematic assessment of cognition.

### Statin therapy in the treatment of Alzheimer disease: what is the rationale? [^d5dcb32d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is manifested by cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and diffuse structural abnormalities in the brain. Its prevalence is predicted to rise 4-fold in the next 50 years. AD is characterized pathologically by deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Neuronal death and specific neurotransmitter deficits also are part of the pathologic picture. Strategies to delay symptom progression have focused on addressing the neurotransmitter deficits. Strategies to delay the onset or biologic progression of AD largely have targeted the plaques formed by the deposition of beta-amyloid. AD and cardiovascular disease share common risk factors, notably hypercholesterolemia, and occur together more often than expected by chance. Therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) is the first-line treatment option for hypercholesterolemia, and observational studies have suggested that the risk of AD is reduced in patients who receive statin therapy in midlife. This reduction in risk of AD observed with statin therapy may be due to statins reducing beta-amyloid formation and deposition or to their known anti-inflammatory effects. Two randomized double-blind statin trials in patients with AD to assess the potential for statins to slow disease progression are currently under way. If successful, statin AD primary prevention trials may be developed.

### Association between statin use and cognitive function: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and observational studies [^b84d714b]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning in 2012 regarding the association of statin use with cognitive impairment. This may deter patients and practitioners from using statins for guideline-directed indications. Large studies have not shown an increase in cognitive impairment with statin use. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched up to October 2019. We present an up-to-date systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies examining the association between statin use and cognitive status in a population aged ≥ 60 years. Twenty-four studies with 1,404,459 participants were included in the review. Twenty-one were prospective observational studies, and 3 were RCTs. All 3 RCTs, which ranged from 3.2 to 5.6 years of follow-up, showed no significant association between statin use and adverse cognitive effects (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 [0.82–1.30]) and (OR 1.0 [0.61–1.65]). The mean difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination was insignificant (0.06 [-0.04 to 0.16]) in the third RCT. The follow-up for observational studies ranged from 3 to 15 years. Ten observational studies showed reduced incidence of dementia. Seven showed no association with incident dementia. Three studies showed decline in cognition was similar, whereas one showed slower decline with statin use. There was no evidence of adverse cognitive effects, including incidence of dementia, deterioration in global cognition, or specific cognitive domains associated with statin use in individuals aged ≥ 60 years. Future studies should examine this association in studies with longer follow-up periods.

### Can statins prevent or help treat Alzheimer's disease? [^95b0b930]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence accumulating from biological and epidemiological studies suggests that high levels of serum cholesterol may promote the pathological processes that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lowering cholesterol in experimental animal models slows the expression of Alzheimer's pathology. These findings raise the possibility that treating humans with cholesterol lowering medications might reduce the risk of developing AD or help treat it. The statins (lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and others) are powerful cholesterol lowering agents of proven benefit in vascular disease. Several clinical studies comparing the occurrence of AD between users and non-users of statins suggested that risk of AD was substantially reduced among the users. However, because these studies were not randomized trials, they provided insufficient evidence to recommend statin therapy. Cochrane reviews are based on the best available information about healthcare interventions and they focus primarily on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). On the issue of prevention, two randomized trials have been carried out and neither showed any reduction in occurrence of AD in patients treated with statins compared to those given placebo. Statins cannot therefore be recommended for the prevention of AD. Regarding treatment of AD, the large RCTs which have assessed this outcome have not published their results. Initial analysis from the studies available indicate statins have no benefit on the outcome measure ADAS-Cog but have a significant beneficial effect on MMSE as an outcome. We need to await full results from the RCTs before we can be certain. In addition statins were not detrimental to cognition in either systematic review.

### Statins for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease [^64c5db10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Two recent clinical reports describe an association between statin therapy and a reduction in the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease by as much as 70%. One report is a cross-sectional analysis of discharges among three hospitals, and the other is a nested case control study drawn from ambulatory patients of general practitioners in the UK. Because neither study is a randomized trial, the association noted between statin therapy and a reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease may have occurred because other factors, unaccounted for in the studies, may be present (so called bias) and be responsible for the observed association. However, there is an expanding body of biological and epidemiological data that makes it plausible that statin therapy may retard or prevent the pathogenesis and clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease. This review was initiated in order to find other clinical evidence that might support or refute the hypothesized benefit of statin therapy.

Objectives

The purpose is to review the evidence that treatment with statins reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Search Strategy

The following data bases were searched: Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE (1966–2000/12), EMBASE (1980–2000/12), and Psych Info (1987–2000/11). Search terms included statins, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, alzheimer*, dement*, cogn*.

Selection Criteria

In order to be selected, trials needed to be randomized, doubled blinded, and of sufficient duration(probably years rather than weeks or months) to ascertain the preventive potential of statin therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were to be extracted independently by two reviewers and pooled where appropriate and possible. The pooled odds ratios (95% CI) or the average differences were to be estimated.

Main Results

There were no randomized trials found in the search.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no good evidence to recommend statins for reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. There is, however, a growing body of biological, epidemiological, and limited but non-randomized clinical evidence that lowering serum cholesterol may retard the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Mounting the clinical studies to determine the potential benefit of statin therapy should be a high priority for future research agendas.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6c56b2bf]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis of over 100 000 participants, lipid-lowering therapy was not significantly associated with a lower risk of incident cognitive impairment or dementia. This meta-analysis provides evidence to support the safety of lipid-lowering therapy on cognitive health, however, does not provide evidence of risk reduction of incident cognitive impairment or dementia.

### Statins and serum cholesterol's associations with incident dementia and mild cognitive impairment [^a9fb5528]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Statin use and serum cholesterol reduction have been proposed as preventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Methods

1604 and 1345 eligible participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were followed after age 50 for a median time of around 25 years, to examine the incidence of dementia (n = 259) and MCI (n = 138), respectively. Statin use (ever-use and time-dependent use), total cholesterol levels (TC; first visit and time-dependent), TC change trajectory from first visit and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C):TC ratio (first visit and time-dependent) were the main exposures of interest. Cox proportional hazards models were used.

Results

Participants with incident dementia had a higher first-visit TC compared with participants who remained free of dementia and MCI, while first-visit TC was higher among statin ever-users compared with never-users (age-unadjusted associations). Statin users had a two- to threefold lower risk of developing dementia (HR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92), but not MCI, when considering time-dependent 'statin use' with propensity score model adjustment. This association remained significant independently of serum cholesterol exposures. An elevated first-visit TC was associated with reduced MCI risk (upper quartile (Q(4)) vs Q(1): HR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.90). Compared with the lowest quartile (Q(1): 0.00–0.19), HDL-C:TC (time-dependent) in (Q(2): 0.19–0.24) was associated with reduced MCI risk (HR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.98). Among men only, TC decline from first visit was significantly associated with increased dementia risk (HR = 4.21; 95% CI 1.28 to 13.85).

Conclusions

Statins may have multifactorial effects on dementia but not MCI risk. Future interventions may be warranted, and research should focus on optimal serum TC, HDL-C:TC ratio and TC change trajectories.

### Statin therapy and risk of dementia in the elderly: a community-based prospective cohort study [^477d80e6]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between statin therapy and risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) in a prospective cohort study with documented statin exposure and incident dementia.

Methods

This is a prospective, cohort study of statin use and incident dementia and probable AD. A cohort of 2,356 cognitively intact persons, aged 65 and older, were randomly selected from a health maintenance organization (HMO), and were assessed biennially for dementia. Statin use was identified using the HMO pharmacy database. A proportional hazards model with statin use as a time-dependent covariate was used to assess the statin-dementia/AD association.

Results

Among 312 participants with incident dementia, 168 had probable AD. The unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with statin use were 1.33 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.85) for all-cause dementia and 0.90 (CI 0.54 to 1.51) for probable AD. Adjusted corresponding HRs were 1.19 (CI 0.82 to 1.75) and 0.82 (CI 0.46 to 1.46). A subgroup analysis of participants with at least one APOE-epsilon4 allele who entered the study before age 80 produced an adjusted HR of 0.33 (CI 0.10 to 1.04).

Conclusion

Employing time-dependent proportional hazards modeling, the authors found no significant association between statin use and incident dementia or probable AD. In contrast, when the data were analyzed, inappropriately, as a case-control study, the authors found an OR of 0.55 for probable AD, falsely indicating a protective effect of statins. Study design and analytic methods may explain the discrepancy between the current null findings and earlier findings.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a730440d]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluating cardioprotective therapies (such as lipid-lowering therapy) to prevent dementia presents more challenges than that for cardiovascular prevention. First, the association of modifiable risk factors (e.g. hypertension) with dementia is usually weaker than for CVD, due to a lower contribution of vascular disease and greater contribution of other mechanisms such as neurodegeneration. Secondly, longer durations of follow-up are required due to lower event rates, especially for clinical cohorts with mean age in 60s. Thirdly, dementia was not the primary outcome of included trials, and therefore the sample size was not estimated for dementia effect, and low event rates related to nonsystematic identification of dementia incidence in majority of trials. This may be related to duration of follow-up. A commonly cited challenge of preventative strategies targeting dementia and cognitive outcomes is that there is often a lag phase between exposure and outcome (dementia) which may exceed the duration of RCT follow-up. Ongoing efforts include the STAREE study and PREVENTABLE trial, which are evaluating atorvastatin 40 mg, compared to placebo, amongst community-dwelling older adults without CVD or dementia. The primary outcome is a composite of death, dementia and persistent disability and secondary composites including mild cognitive impairment and cardiovascular events.

We do not report on the association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia by subgroups, such as by sex, as this data were not available. Prior meta-analyses of statin and PCSK9 respectively by sex reported similar cardiovascular risk reduction in women and men. However, statin intolerance and adherence may differ by sex.

### Decreased prevalence of dementia associated with statins: a national population-based study [^c5921421]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents a progressive decline in cognitive function and loss of short-term memory with age. Several studies have shown that statin, an oral lipid-lowering drug, may reduce the risk of developing dementia. The objective of this study is to explore the association between statin and the development of dementia.

Methods

The data analyzed in this study were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The sample consisted of 123 300 patients ≥ 20 years of age, including 61 650 dementia patients with statin use and 61 650 patients without statin use who were eligible for inclusion in this study. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to measure the effects of statin use on the risk of dementia.

Results

The beneficial effect of statin on dementia was significant after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.86–0.98). The sex- and age-specific analysis of adjusted hazard ratios showed a higher beneficial effect from statin treatment in women than in men, and the effect became more significant with age.

Conclusion

Statin therapy may help prevent the development of dementia, and both hydrophilic and lipophilic statins produce similar effects. However, the preventive characters and associated mechanisms must be further explored and identified.

### Statin use is not associated with reduced cardio-and cerebrovascular hospitalizations in older adults with dementia [^ee89f32d]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are significant global health challenges and leading causes of death worldwide. Although there is substantial evidence supporting the positive effects of statins for both primary and secondary prevention of these diseases, evidence is lacking regarding the benefits in people with dementia. This study investigated the associations between statin use and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular hospitalizations in nursing home residents with and without dementia.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of nursing home residents with and without dementia using insurance claims data was conducted in Germany between January 2015 and December 2019. Propensity score-based models were used to evaluate the association of statin use with hospitalizations due to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events among nursing home residents with and without dementia. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the presence or absence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, dementia type, presence of hyperlipidemia, and newly prescribed statin use, as well as age groups, care dependency level, and sex.

Results

The final sample included data from 96162 individuals, 37262 without dementia, and 58900 with dementia. Statin use was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization due to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events among people with dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01–1.12]; P = 0.023). Moderate and high statin intensity was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (moderate: HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.07–1.23]; P < 0.001; high: HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.15–2.10]; P = 0.005) In subgroup analyses, we found an association between statin use and increased risk of hospitalization among individuals without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.12–1.52]; P < 0.001), with vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06–1.32]; P = 0.003; HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.00–1.31]; P = 0.047, respectively) as well as among newly prescribed statin users (HR, 2.71 [95% CI, 2.33–3.15]; P < 0.001). Among individuals without dementia, we found no differences (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.96–1.11]; P = 0.397) in the primary analysis and subanalyses except for the high statin intensity group (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.04–2.19]; P = 0.029) and among participants with newly prescribed statins (HR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.56–2.52]).

Conclusions

In our study, statin use was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization due to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events among people with dementia. These findings highlight the need for further research and cautious consideration of statin use in people with dementia.

### Does treating vascular risk factors prevent dementia and Alzheimer's disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^7f45d627]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence has associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) with vascular risk factors (VRFs), but whether treatment of VRFs reduces the incidence of dementia and AD is uncertain.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize available data on the impact of treatment of VRFs on dementia and AD incidence.

Methods

Pertinent studies published until 1 January 2018 were identified from PubMed. Both randomized controlled trials (RCT) and prospective studies that investigated the impact of treatment of VRFs on dementia or AD incidence were included.

Results

Eight RCTs and 52 prospective studies were identified. Antihypertensive treatment was associated with a non-significant reduced risk of dementia in RCTs (n = 5; relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–1.02) and prospective studies (n = 3; RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.01) and with reduced AD risk in prospective studies (n = 5; RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66–0.91). In prospective studies, treatment of hyperlipidemia with statins, but not nonstatin lipid-lowering agents, was associated with reduced risk of dementia (n = 17; RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.95) and AD (n = 13; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.92). The single RCT on statins and dementia incidence showed no association. Data from one RCT and six prospective studies did not support a beneficial impact of antidiabetic drugs or insulin therapy on dementia risk.

Conclusion

Current evidence indicates that antihypertensives and statins might reduce the incidence of dementia and AD. Further trials to determine the effect of VRF on AD are needed.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^8b1d4809]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

QUESTION 4
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, how should we weigh potential safety concerns versus benefits of statin therapy?

Synopsis

Adults older than 75 years are intrinsically more susceptible to iatrogenic risks from medications amidst age‐related changes in metabolism, body composition, mitochondrial energetics, and cognition. Sarcopenia, frailty, and insulin resistance are common, along with changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, many hypothesize that older adults may be more susceptible to statin‐associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cognitive decline if they use statins.

Meta‐analyses of RCTs and recent observational data from patient registries do not indicate any increase in the risk of SAMS among those above age 75 compared to younger individuals. Multiple meta‐analyses suggest that statin therapy leads to a small increase in risk of new onset T2DM. It is estimated that statin therapy is associated with one additional case of T2DM per 255 patients taking statins for 4 years, largely confined to patients with risk factors for T2DM including advanced age. Risk of new onset T2DM is greater with high‐intensity statin regimens than with the moderate‐intensity statins typically used in primary prevention among older adults. The increase in risk of new onset T2DM associated with statin therapy is outweighed by robust reductions in major cardiovascular events among individuals with T2DM.

Analyses of the impact of statin therapy on cognition have significant methodological limitations. The diagnosis of dementia or cognitive change as an endpoint is rarely measured systematically, and confounders like education level and intelligence are rarely considered. Many studies do not adequately measure longitudinal changes in cognition and types of dementia are generally not distinguished. Few studies use in vivo brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis or serological biomarkers. While there has been some literature suggesting the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin‐related cognitive effects.

### Statin initiation and dementia incidence in a large health care system from 1997 to 2020: a target trial emulation study [^54efc5f2]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High cholesterol is hypothesized to increase risk of Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease–related dementias (AD/ADRDs). Vascular pathology may play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRDs, through mechanisms such as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, particularly in midlife. Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that have been hypothesized to reduce AD/ADRD risk. AD/ADRDand lipid levelsare highly heritable and may share common genetic risk factors, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles.

Statins target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which has recently been identified by the Lancet Commissionas a target of AD/ADRD prevention: an estimated 7% of AD/ADRD cases could be avoided if the general population had well-controlled LDL-C. However, associations of statin use with long-term dementia risk estimated in previous studies have been mixed, possibly reflecting study biases such as confounding. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generally suggested no aggregate effect of statins on dementia or cognition. However, RCTs are limited by small sample size, short follow-up time, and participant characteristics differing markedly from typical clinical populations. Because statins are common medications and are often taken for decades, small effects that emerge gradually may influence the total population burden of AD/ADRD. Large observational studies with long follow-up can detect such effects. Most observational studies have suggested protective effects, of statins on cognition and dementia, although some studies report no association, or protective effects only when initiated at younger ages. Systematic reviews, noted that previous studies precluded a large short-term effect of statins on dementia and called for rigorous observational studies designed to avoid confounding and reverse causation. Few observational studies include high-quality information on both clinical covariates and sociodemographic factors. Current best practice in observational studies of pharmaceutical effects specifies target trial emulation designs, which target the effects of initiating a medication as if in an analysis of an RCT. A previous target trial emulation found no intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of statin initiation on dementia incidence in a sample of 6,373 participants with up to 10 years of follow-up, but the sample was too small to rule out important effects.

In this study, we emulate a target trialto estimate ITT effect of statin initiation on dementia incidence using electronic health records (EHRs) with linked survey and genetic covariates on a large cohort with up to 20 years of follow-up.

### Updating the evidence on the association between serum cholesterol and risk of Late-life dementia: review and meta-analysis [^80c9b692]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Gaps in the literature and commentary

The findings on high TC in midlife being associated with increased risk of late-life AD are still limited to the few studies that report relevant data from Scandinavia and the United States. The wider literature shows that level of TC in populations varies according to diet, urbanization, ethnicity, and income. What is not known is whether the association between TC and AD differs by these other factors that affect TC. This information will be critical for the development of appropriate clinical practice guidelines. In the literature reviewed, there was a notable lack of cohort data from Asian, South American, African, and Middle Eastern countries and hence we do not know if TC is a risk factor for AD in these regions. The studies were limited by the lack of information on age of exposure and the length of exposure. Also, individuals with hereditary hypercholesterolemia may have contributed to these findings and represent a special group who also have different genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease that may increase risk of AD, and studies did not report screening for such individuals.

The most recent Cochrane review of statins for the prevention of dementia showed no benefit. This is not surprising. First our results suggest that risk of high TC may be limited to AD. Second, the studies that evaluated statins as a method of reducing dementia incidence were conducted on cohorts aged 70 and older. TC has not been shown to increase risk of AD or dementia in this age-group and statin use for dementia risk reduction is therefore not indicated.

Observational studies and meta-analyses do not identify causal mechanisms but can confirm reliable associations. The effect of TC on AD risk may be via the impact of TC on arteriosclerosis or cerebrovascular disease, in addition to directly impacting on the accumulation of AD pathology. The development of an evidence-base in dementia risk reduction is essential, yet review of the rate of publication of articles on this topic demonstrates the incremental nature of knowledge accumulation. Collaborative pooling of individual datasets may allow researchers to address some of these limitations.

We conclude that high TC in midlife (> 6.5 mmol/l) may increase the risk of AD but urge cohort studies to publish their data on this topic to increase the knowledge base. Maintenance of cholesterol in the normal range among middle-aged adults should be a priority. This provides further reason to promote lifestyle changes associated with improvements in body composition and exercise.

### Prevention of stroke and dementia with statins: effects beyond lipid lowering [^933c930a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The epidemiologic association between elevated serum cholesterol and stroke risk is controversial. However, recent secondary prevention studies with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic stroke without an increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Statins probably reduce stroke by a variety of mechanisms, including modulation of precerebral atherothrombosis in the aorta and the carotid artery, thus preventing plaque disruption and artery-to-artery thromboembolism. Statins also improve endothelial homeostasis by increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, which orchestrates the paracrine antiatherosclerotic functions of the endothelium. Studies in experimental models of ischemic stroke show that statin therapy reduces brain infarct size and improves neurologic outcome by directly upregulating brain endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Putative anti-inflammatory actions of statins may also contribute to neuroprotection and stroke prevention. Although the clinical benefit of statins largely depends on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, accumulating data indicate that many of the pleiotropic effects of statins are attributable to the cellular consequences of depletion of intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (isoprenoids). These molecules play fundamental roles in cell growth, signal transduction, and mitogenesis. In addition to reducing stroke risk, emerging data suggest that statins may reduce dementia. Further studies are needed to fully address the role of statins in the prevention of stroke in patients without established vascular disease and the role of cholesterol modulation in the treatment of dementia.

### The effect of statins on dementia and cognitive decline… [^310b25fe]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do statins prevent dementia or cognitive decline. Evidence-Based Answer Statins given in later life to patients at risk of vascular disease do not prevent dementia or cognitive decline compared with placebo. Adverse effects are similar between groups.

1. 2 There is a close association between dementia and cardiovascular disease, and because statins have secondary preventive effects for cardiovascular disease, 3 it has been posited that they may also help prevent dementia. Several observational studies have reported a slight benefit for statin use in the prevention of dementia. 4–6 This Cochrane review addressed whether statins are effective for the primary prevention of dementia or cognitive decline.
2. The authors of this review examined two randomized controlled trials with 26, 340 participants 40 to 82 years of age, including 11, 610 persons 70 years or older.

1 One trial compared simvastatin with placebo over five years; the other compared pravastatin with placebo over 3. 2 years. All of the participants in both study populations had a moderate to high vascular risk. The cognitive assessments used in these two studies were heterogeneous and had different end points, including changes in performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Picture-Word Learning test, among others. There were no differences in the number of patients who developed dementia or cognitive decline between those taking statins or placebo. Although both studies evaluated cognitive decline, only the simvastatin study examined the incidence of dementia. Among the 20, 536 participants in the simvastatin study who were randomized to treatment or placebo, 31 new cases of dementia developed in each arm of the study.

Both studies were at low risk of bias, and there were no differences in the number of adverse effects leading to discontinuation. An analysis from the Agency for Health-care Research and Quality cites the availability of only low-quality, discordant evidence to link statin use and prevention of cognitive decline. 7 In its most recent clinical guideline, the American Academy of Neurology does not address statin use to prevent dementia. 8 The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org.

### Statins for the prevention of dementia [^4f95ac5d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001. At that stage there was insufficient evidence to recommend statins for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The scope of this review has been expanded to include all forms of dementia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of statins in the prevention of dementia.

Search Strategy

The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 10 October 2007 using the terms statin*, lovastatin*, pravastatin*, simvastatin*, fluvastatin*, atorvastatin* and rosuvastatin*. The CDCIG Register contains records from many healthcare databases, SIGLE, LILACS as well as many trials databases and is updated regularly.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of statins in people at risk of AD and dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted and assessed data independently and agreement was reached after discussion. Adverse effects were noted.

Main Results

Two trials were identified with 26,340 participants; HPS 2002 and PROSPER 2002. Age range was 40–82 years across the two studies, PROSPER 2002 included 5804 patients aged 70–82 years and HPS included 20,536 patients with 5806 at least 70 years old at study entry. Mean total cholesterol 5.9 mmol/l, LDL cholesterol 3.4 mmol/l at study entry with mean reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/l in simvastatin treated patients compared to placebo in HPS 2002. Mean total cholesterol 5.7 mmol/l, LDL cholesterol 3.8 mmol/l at study entry with mean reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1.02 mmol/l in pravastatin treated patients compared to placebo in PROSPER 2002. Mean follow-up 3.2 years in PROSPER, 5 years in HPS 2002. Cognition was measured at different times and with different scales so could not be combined in a meta-analysis. There was no difference in incidence of dementia in HPS 2002 (31 cases in simvastatin group, 31 cases in placebo group) nor in performance on the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status at final follow-up (23.7% simvastatin group cognitively impaired vs 24.2% in placebo group). There was no difference in cognition between groups either in relation to age at study entry or previous history of cerebrovascular disease. Cognitive function declined at the same rate in both treatment groups in PROSPER 2002, there was no significant difference between pravastatin treated and placebo groups in performance on letter digit codes, picture word learning test, Stroop and Mini Mental State Examination. There was no evidence that statins were detrimental to cognition.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence from RCTs that statins given in late life to individuals at risk of vascular disease have no effect in preventing AD or dementia. Biologically it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. Indication bias may have been a factor in these studies however and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^7e7eb618]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association (NLA) statin safety — cognition guidance states: a baseline cognitive assessment does not need to be performed prior to initiation of statin therapy (strength of recommendation: expert opinion; quality of evidence: low); statins as a class are not associated with adverse effects on cognition (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low to moderate); and in patients who report cognitive symptoms after beginning a statin, cognitive testing should be performed, other potential contributors should be ruled out, and the risk of stopping the statin should be assessed; the provider may consider stopping the statin, lowering the dose, or switching to an alternative statin, and if switched, consideration may be given to starting a statin less likely to penetrate the brain, including pravastatin or rosuvastatin (strength of recommendation: expert opinion; quality of evidence: low).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin to treat Alzheimer disease [^c1248e3c]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lowering cholesterol is associated with reduced CNS amyloid deposition and increased dietary cholesterol increases amyloid accumulation in animal studies. Epidemiologic data suggest that use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) may decrease the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) and a single-site trial suggested possible benefit in cognition with statin treatment in AD, supporting the hypothesis that statin therapy is useful in the treatment of AD.

Objective

To determine if the lipid-lowering agent simvastatin slows the progression of symptoms in AD.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin was conducted in individuals with mild to moderate AD and normal lipid levels. Participants were randomly assigned to receive simvastatin, 20 mg/day, for 6 weeks then 40 mg per day for the remainder of 18 months or identical placebo. The primary outcome was the rate of change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive portion (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcomes measured clinical global change, cognition, function, and behavior.

Results

A total of 406 individuals were randomized: 204 to simvastatin and 202 to placebo. Simvastatin lowered lipid levels but had no effect on change in ADAS-Cog score or the secondary outcome measures. There was no evidence of increased adverse events with simvastatin treatment.

Conclusion

Simvastatin had no benefit on the progression of symptoms in individuals with mild to moderate AD despite significant lowering of cholesterol.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that simvastatin 40 mg/day does not slow decline on the ADAS-Cog.

### The relationship between midlife dyslipidemia and lifetime incidence of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^e56b289a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Results from our study have widespread public health implications. Targeting dyslipidemia as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy that includes modifiable risk factors has the potential to decrease the global burden of not only dementia but also MCI. Dyslipidemia is an ideal risk factor to target due to its prevalence in the community (≈23% to 77%), established treatment modalities, existing screening guidelines in the primary care setting, and benefits that extend to other diseases, most notably cardiovascular disease. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies that investigated the effect of lipid‐lowering therapy with statins on cognitive impairment found that patients who used a statin had lower risk of all‐cause dementia and dementia subtypes, including AD and VaD. Despite these compelling observational results, a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials found that statins given to people at risk of vascular disease did not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. 48 A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that the included studies focus on intervention during later life, when risk of cognitive decline may already be established. It remains to be seen whether lipid‐lowering therapy given at midlife affords any protection from MCI and dementia later in life.

In our pooled analysis of six studies investigating the association between TC and AD, there was a trend toward greater incidence of AD in individuals with elevated midlife TC. It is worth noting that inclusion of only high‐quality studies (Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale score > 6) in our sensitivity analysis resulted in a statistically significant change to the observed relationship between TC and AD. After excluding two studies of Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale score ≤ 6, elevated midlife TC was associated with an ≈60% increased risk of incident AD. This may be explained partially by the study designs: Rönnemaa et al. applied stringent criteria to diagnose "pure Alzheimer's disease" that excluded participants with radiological evidence of VaD, which frequently co‐occurs with AD as a mixed dementia. In both studies, only male participants were enrolled, even though AD is known to disproportionately affect females. In addition, both studies adjusted for only two covariates: age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype by Notkola et al. and age and education by Rönnemaa et al.

### Use of common cardiovascular disease drugs and risk of dementia: a case-control study in Swedish national register data [^688617f6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Cardiovascular risk factors are leading modifiable risk factors for dementiaand an estimated 70% of older adults have at least one cardiovascular risk factor or disease. Evidence suggests that treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and conditions can target multiple dementia mechanistic pathways. Indeed, declining dementia incidenceseems partially attributable to improved cardiovascular treatment, from medications to public awareness to more stringent care guidelines.

Studies have primarily investigated single cardiovascular drug classes at a time. For example, evidence has shown that antihypertensive drug use is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia, although methodological issues, such as patient group definition and short follow‐up time, are limitations in previous studies. Hence, there is a need for more rigorous investigations to implement a cohesive recommendation. Meta‐analyses investigating statin use on cognitive outcomes found mixed evidence for their impact on dementia risk, showing both null and potentially protective effects, and the differences in findings may be due to indication bias or duration of treatment. A recent Mendelian randomization study showed that polymorphisms in genes coding for drug targets of statins did not associate with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk; in contrast, the analysis suggested a possible increase in AD risk associated with drug targets of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, has also shown mixed results, with a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating low‐dose aspirin in community‐dwelling older adults over a mean of 4.7 years finding no impact of treatment on the risk of dementia. While these studies seem to indicate an association between cardiovascular drug use and lower dementia risk, much of this work has been conducted in specific patient populations, which may not provide evidence for the more general population of older adults with multimorbid cardiovascular risk factors. Further, most studies have limited follow‐up time, and it is unclear whether longer exposure could provide additional benefits for cognition. Based on proposed mechanisms of action for these drug classes and the long prodromal period of dementia, we hypothesize that a longer duration of cardiovascular drug use is associated with lower dementia risk and that this will not depend on specific patient populations, benefiting even those in the general population who are multimorbid.

### Association between statin use and risk of dementia after a concussion [^0b9d4b14]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Concussions are an acute injury that may lead to chronic disability, while statin use might improve neurologic recovery.

Objective

To test whether statin use is associated with an increased or decreased risk of subsequent dementia after a concussion.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Large extended population-based double cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1993, to April 1, 2013 (enrollment), and continued until March 31, 2016 (follow-up). Dates of analysis were April 28, 2014, through March 21, 2019. Participants were older adults diagnosed as having a concussion, excluding severe cases resulting in hospitalization, individuals with a prior diagnosis of dementia or delirium, and those who died within 90 days.

Exposure

Statin prescription within 90 days after a concussion.

Main Outcome and Measure

Long-term incidence of dementia.

Results

This study identified 28 815 patients diagnosed as having a concussion (median age, 76 years; 61.3% female), of whom 7058 (24.5%) received a statin, and 21 757 (75.5%) did not receive a statin. A total of 4727 patients subsequently developed dementia over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, equal to an incidence of 1 case per 6 patients. Patients who received a statin had a 13% reduced risk of dementia compared with patients who did not receive a statin (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81–0.93; P < .001). The decreased risk of dementia associated with statin use applied to diverse patient groups, remained independent of other cardiovascular medication use, intensified over time, was distinct from the risk of subsequent depression, and was not observed in patients after an ankle sprain.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, older adults had a substantial long-term risk of dementia after a concussion, which was associated with a modest reduction among patients receiving a statin.

### Promoting successful cognitive aging: a ten-year update [^dbdac1ad]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Statins, or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are widely prescribed in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins have been shown to exhibit many other effects, including improving endothelial function, inhibiting platelet activation, and decreasing inflammation, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Statins have also been associated with decreased cerebral Aβ deposition. Accordingly, several observational studies have linked statin use to decreased incidence of all-cause dementia or decreased rate of cognitive decline. Meta-analyses of pooled data seem to support these results. However, intervention trials completed to date have not supported a link between statin use and cognitive status. For example, in the HOPE-3 study (as discussed above in the section on "Hypertension"), 2,361 older adults were randomized to receive blood-pressuring-lowering medication (candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide) or placebo and lipid-lowering medication (rosuvastatin) or placebo once daily until study completion, an average of 5.7 years later. Neither blood pressure lowering, lipid lowering, or their combination had a significant effect on cognitive decline over the 5.7-year follow-up period. Some observational studies have also found no link between statin use and risk of dementia, rate of cognitive decline, or neuroimaging biomarkers of AD. Additionally, a 2017 retrospective cohort study of 3,500 adults, ages 51 to 100, found that statins increased the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. As discussed, however, data from most studies conducted to date do not seem to support negative effects of statins on brain health. As with the other medications reviewed here, more research, including additional RCTs, is needed to further clarify the effects of statins on cognition and dementia risk. Despite the results of some epidemiological studies that suggest a correlation between statin use and reduced cognitive decline, there is currently no compelling reason to initiate treatment with a statin for the purpose of improving cognitive status or preventing decline. Likewise, there is no persuasive evidence that statin use leads to a deterioration of cognitive abilities.

Figure 3
Summary of results from random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome and estimates from Randomized Controlled Trials.

Neurologic and psychological effects

Thirteen studies with 2,762,899 participants examined the association between use of statins and incidence of any combination of the dichotomous outcomes: dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). An odds ratio of 0.70 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.83) was observed for those participants exposed to statins; but the higher quality studies showed an attenuated effect (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87) compared with the lower quality studies (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.92) (Additional file 1: Figure S1-A). Marked between-study heterogeneity as indicated by high I 2 values was observed which was not explained by stratifying by study quality. Similar association of statin use was observed when the analysis was restricted to incident Alzheimer's disease (OR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75), dementia (not Alzheimer's) (OR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88) and for incident Parkinson's disease (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95). One case control study recruited prevalent cases of Parkinson's disease and observed a stronger risk reduction (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.72). This study was excluded from the pooled analysis because it was responsible for significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 63.2% vs. I² = 51.8%).

### Simvastatin is associated with a reduced incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease [^191886af]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Dementia is one of the major public health threats that individuals face as they age. Epidemiological studies suggest that cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes are important risk factors for the development of dementia. Some studies suggest that medications used to treat these risk factors are also associated with a reduced incidence of dementia. Statins are a class of lipid-lowering agents that act by inhibiting the second enzyme in the cholesterol synthetic cascade, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Many studies have investigated whether statin treatment might be of benefit for subjects with dementia or at risk for dementia, but the conclusion remains ambiguous because of conflicting results.

Initial studies by our group and that of Jick et al suggested that statins might be beneficial as a therapy for dementia. Subsequent studies using a cross-sectional analytic method consistently observed a reduced prevalence and incidence of dementia among statin users (reviewed by Sjogren et al). However, the cross-sectional nature of these studies raises concerns based on the potential for unanticipated biases including confounding by indication. These concerns have prompted investigators to pursue other strategies to test whether statins might protect against dementia.

Two-wave epidemiological studies examined the effects of statins on incident Alzheimer's disease (AD), but failed to show a statistical benefit associated with statin use. The number of subjects on statins who developed incident AD in these two-wave studies was only in the single digits, however, which raises concerns about whether they had sufficient power to detect any putative statin effects.

Prospective incidence trials have also been examined. Cognitive arms were added onto ongoing cardiology studies of which the original goal was to test the efficacy of statins in preventing cardiovascular incidents. These studies also failed to show a reduction in incident dementia associated with statin use, but concerns can be raised about the use of an add-on design and whether the studies were sufficiently powered to detect small effects of statins on incident dementia.

Two studies were also performed to investigate whether statins might delay the progression of cognitive decline in subjects with mild to moderate AD. Both of these studies were quite promising because they showed reduced progression of measures of cognitive function, but they were limited by small cohort sizes.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116586e2]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are a number of limitations to this systematic review and meta-analysis. Firstly, the ascertainment of dementia outcomes may differ between studies, however this is unlikely to affect the relative risk. Dementia outcomes were not ascertained as an outcome of interest, rather they were reported as adverse events. Sensitivity analyses excluding open label extension studies were conducted to mitigate for ascertainment bias. Secondly, whilst dementia subtypes were reported by study investigators as adverse events there is limited data regarding the diagnostic evaluation conducted. Thirdly, the low event rates reduced power to detect differences in treatment effect. Fourthly, the duration of follow up of included studies was relatively short (mean follow-up 30.5 months). Fifthly, the mean age of included study populations were relatively young. Despite these limitations, we provide an up-to-date synthesis of available randomised control trial evidence of the association of lipid-lowering therapy with cognitive outcomes.

### Association of statin use in older people primary prevention group with risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^84c17643]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

None of the included studies reported data on other statin safety concerns in older people, including statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) or cognitive impairment except one study by Zhou et al. that reported a nonsignificant association between statins and risk of dementia (HR 1.14 [95% CI 0.94 to 1.39]). Current evidence from individual RCTs and meta-analyses reported no increased risk of SAMS with statins in older people or of cognitive impairment in the general population. As for evidence from observational studies, a meta-analysis of 25 prospective cohorts of the cognitively healthy general population found that statin use was associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia (mean age 59.3 years), mild cognitive impairment (mean age 68.4 years), and Alzheimer's disease (mean age 71.3 years) but not of vascular dementia (mean age 77.2 years). In terms of SAMS, an observational study including 4355 participants aged ≥ 75 years from the Netherlands found no difference in the prevalence of self-reported muscle symptoms in statin users compared with statin non-users (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.94 to 2.05) regardless of CVD history. Table 2 shows a comparison between results from meta-analyses of RCTs and our study or other observational studies in older people for statins used in primary prevention.

Recommendation‐specifc supportive text

There is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age, e.g. a healthy 85‐year‐old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years (and would be likely to benefit from primary prevention) while a frail, multimorbid 85‐year‐old woman may have less than 2 years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status and frailty to estimate life expectancy. If an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended. If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, the intervention is more likely to harm and generally should not be recommended. If the life expectancy is approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should be the guiding factor in decision making. An online calculator, ePrognosis, can help clinicians incorporate evidence‐based information about life expectancy for older adults into decisions about preventive therapies such as statins. For example, for an individual with advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy and the goals of therapy may shift over time from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life.
For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in decisions about statin therapy is essential for patient‐centered care. These conditions are associated with physical and functional decline, increased mortality risk, and increased risk of harm from polypharmacy. Yet, individuals with frailty, functional impairment and dementia should not automatically be denied statin therapy. Although few studies have included such patients, a retrospective cohort study of 326,981 Veterans aged 75 years and older without ASCVD at baseline found that new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, even at advanced ages (e.g. aged > 90 years) and in those with dementia. This association was evident within 2 years and remained significant in those with frailty. However, for some patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, goals of therapy may shift from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life. Practical tools to assess functional status, frailty and cognition are listed in Table 5. The presence of any of these syndromes may prompt elicitation of patient values and preferences for prevention and medication use (see Question 6, Section 2).

### Lipoprotein levels and statin treatment related to dementia and cognitive decline in individuals with type 2 diabetes: an observational analysis from the ADVANCE study [^be911eaa]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with vs without statin treatment at baseline showed a lower risk of dementia/CD, but after adjustments, this association was only seen in subgroup analyses of male but not female participants, and of participants from Established Market Economies but not from Asia or Eastern Europe. However, these associations observed in subgroup analyses were not confirmed in interaction analyses. Previous studies have raised concerns that statins could increase the risk of dementia, but randomized controlled trials of statin treatment have observed no deterioration or improvement in cognitive outcomes. However, trials were limited to at most 6 years, and studies with longer follow-up time have been called for. In a recent meta-analysis of 46 observational studies, statin use was associated with lower incident dementia equally in both women and men. In a UK biobank study, LDL cholesterol levels were associated with dementia in women but not in men, after adjustment for lipid-lowering drugs, which could implicate a benefit of statins for women rather than men. Although the use of statins and the odds of dementia/CD was lower in female vs male participants in the ADVANCE cohort, we observed no pattern in the association between statin use and incident dementia/CD in female participants, indicating that it was not due to limited statistical power. Finally, we found no treatment effect modification of statins on dementia/CD, akin to the lack of treatment effect modification of statins on cardiovascular events previously shown.

### Sociodemographic modifiers of effects of statin initiation on dementia incidence: an emulated trial design in a large health care member population with 10 + years of follow-up [^1884052d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

High cholesterol level may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), with vascular pathology being a key factor in disease progression. Such associations may occur through mechanisms involving coronary heart disease or stroke, particularly during the middle‐aged period. Therefore, statins, a class of lipid‐lowering medications commonly prescribed to older adults for reducing cholesterol level, are hypothesized to reduce the risk of ADRD by improving cardiovascular health.

Previous studies estimating the risk of dementia associated with statin use have yielded mixed results. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generally indicated no overall effect of statins on dementia or cognition. Among large observational studies with long follow‐up periods, most studies have suggested that statins may lower the risk of dementia or cognition; however, some studies have reported no association, or reported protective effects only when statins were initiated at younger ages. A previous systematic reviewfound that earlier studies ruled out significant short‐term effects of statins on dementia and called for rigorous observational studies to avoid confounding and reverse causation. Therefore, emulated trial designs, which target the effects of initiating a medication as if conducting an intent‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis in an RCT, are recommended as current best practice for observational studies on pharmaceutical effects. The study by Zimmerman et al.using an emulated trial design, found that statin initiation resulted in a less than 3% difference in the hazard of ADRD after the first year of follow‐up. These mixed findings may reflect heterogeneity in the effects of statin use across populations, leading to calls for evidence on effect modifiers using an emulated trial design.

### Statin exposure and the risk of dementia in individuals with hypercholesterolaemia [^22e395e8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to examine the association between statin exposure and dementia risk in individuals with hypercholesterolaemia using data from the NHIS-HEALS database between 2002 and 2015.

Methods

Subjects were classified into statin exposure and statin nonexposure groups according to medication possession ratio. Dementia was defined as those with primary diagnostic dementia codes such as F00-F03, G30, G31.1, G31.9 or G31.82. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adopted after stepwise adjustment for confounders to investigate the prospective association between statin exposure and dementia risk.

Results

During the follow-up period (median follow-up 11.7 years), 711 cases of dementia occurred, accounting for 11.5% of the total study population (statin exposure group, 8.2%; statin nonexposure group, 12.9%). Compared to the statin nonexposure group, fully adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for overall dementia in the statin exposure group were 0.63 (0.43–0.91) and 0.62 (0.50–0.78) in men and women, respectively. Compared to the statin nonexposure group, the HRs (95% CIs) for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia, vascular dementia and other types of dementia in the statin exposure group were 0.54 (0.32–0.91), 2.45 (0.69–8.68) and 0.59 (0.32–1.07), respectively, in men and 0.53 (0.38–0.73), 1.29 (0.42–3.96) and 0.70 (0.51–0.96), respectively, in women.

Conclusions

Hypercholesterolaemic individuals exposed to statin had a lower risk of overall dementia and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in both sexes, and a lower risk of other types of dementia in women, than subjects who were not exposed to statins.

### Association of familial hypercholesterolemia and statin use with risk of dementia in Norway [^af9c7d20]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The results of this cohort study showed no excess overall risk of any of the forms of dementia in patients with FH compared with age-matched and sex-matched controls. Significantly more patients with FH were taking statin therapy compared with controls. There was no association between cumulative DDDs of statins, including the highest statin consumption of more than 10 000 DDDs, and total dementia in FH. This result is important because it indicates that long-term use of high-intensity statins is not associated with dementia risk.

Prior studies have shown that early and prolonged statin exposure might prevent dementia, in particular vascular dementia. The role of statin treatment to prevent AD is, however, controversial. Once genetically diagnosed, patients with FH receive high-intensity statins. We have previously reported that 86% of Norwegian patients diagnosed with FH are treated with statins.

A retrospective cohort studyincluding 6182 individuals with hypercholesterolemia, of whom 1802 were taking statins and 4380 were not, with a median follow-up time 11.7 years, showed a decreased incidence of dementia in those who used statins compared with those who did not. In both sexes, statin exposure decreased dementia risk by approximately 35%. In that studythe participants had a higher mean age at baseline (66.0 years) compared with our study (51.8 years for patients with FH and 51.7 years for controls at the start of follow-up), and the results were adjusted for several possible confounders.

High levels of midlife cholesterol may be associated with AD risk. Statins seem beneficial only when uptake begins early in life. Another studysuggested that statin use may prevent AD and that the prevention may be greater in low-risk individuals. Importantly, in the current study, AD–dementia in AD was the most common form of dementia in the patients with FH, accounting for 56.5% of all cases.

### Statins are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease regardless of lipophilicity. the rotterdam study [^2f15ba9f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cross-sectional reports suggest that statin users are less likely to have Alzheimer disease (AD). Prospective studies have provided inconsistent evidence. Moreover, it is unclear whether the association differs for lipophilic statins, those that could more easily pass the blood-brain barrier and hydrophilic statins.

Objectives

To prospectively evaluate whether use of statins is associated with the risk of AD, and to determine whether associations differ for lipophilic and hydrophilic statins.

Method

6992 participants of the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study were followed, from baseline (1990–1993) until January 2005 for incident AD. Data on all filled prescriptions came from pharmacy records. For each date on which each event occurred, cholesterol-lowering drug use for the person who experienced the event and all remaining persons in the cohort was categorised as "any" or "never" use. A distinction was made between statin, lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, and non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs. Data were analysed with the Cox regression analysis, adjusting for sex, age and potential confounders.

Results

During follow-up (mean 9 years), 582 persons developed AD. Compared with never use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of AD (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.90), but non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug use was not (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.44). HRs were equal for lipophilic (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89) and hydrophilic statins (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.11).

Conclusion

In the general population, the use of statins, but not of non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, was associated with a lower risk of AD compared with never use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The protective effect was independent of the lipophilicity of statins.

### Association of statin use with dementia risk among older adults in Japan: a nested case-control study using the LIFE study [^c5bd4353]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have shown a possible association between statin use and a decreased risk of dementia, but the association has not been sufficiently established, especially in the super-aging society of Japan.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the association between statin use and the risk of dementia among Japanese participants aged ≥ 65 years old.

Methods

Data from the Longevity Improvement and Fair Evidence (LIFE) Study were utilized, including medical and long-term care (LTC) claim data from 17 municipalities between April 2014 and December 2020. A nested case-control study was conducted with one case matched to five controls based on age, sex, municipality, and year of cohort entry. We used a conditional logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

Results

This study included 57,302 cases and 283,525 controls, with 59.7% of the participants being woman. After adjusting for potential confounders, statin use was associated with a lower risk of dementia (OR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.68–0.73) and Alzheimer's disease (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.63–0.69). Compared with non-users, the ORs of dementia were as follows: 1.42 (1.34–1.50) for 1–30 total standardized daily dose (TSDD), 0.91 (0.85–0.98) for 31–90 TSDD, 0.63 (0.58–0.69) for 91–180 TSDD, and 0.33 (0.31–0.36) for > 180 TSDD in dose-analysis.

Conclusions

Statin use is associated with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease among older Japanese adults. A low cumulative statin dose is associated with an increased risk of dementia, whereas a high cumulative statin dose is a protective factor against dementia.

### An assessment by the statin cognitive safety task force: 2014 update [^cfc970ce]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

The National Lipid Association's Safety Task Force convened a consensus conference of experts to develop a position statement on cognitive function to revise and update that published originally by the Association in the 2006 assessment of statin safety by a panel of neurologists. The current expert panel was charged with addressing the specific issue of potential adverse cognitive effects attributable to statins. Search strategies recently used in systematic reviews were used to identify relevant evidence using keywords and topics via Medline searches from 1966 to December 2013. Manual searches of bibliographies were also conducted. Panel members were asked to use the evidence to formulate answers to a series of questions of relevance to the subject matter. The strength of recommendations and quality of evidence were graded using accepted contemporary definitions and procedures. Recommendations to patients, health professionals, and researchers were put forth by the panel to aid in daily clinical decision making, and in future research endeavors.

### Emulating a target trial of statin use and risk of dementia using cohort data [^5916d018]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Observational data can be used to attempt to emulate a target trial of statin use and estimate analogues of intention-to-treat and per protocol effects on dementia risk.

Methods

Using data from a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, we conceptualized a sequence of "trials" in which eligible individuals ages 55–80 years were classified as statin initiators or noninitiators for every consecutive month between 1993 and 2007 and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. We estimated 2 types of effects of statin use on dementia and a combined endpoint of dementia or death: the effect of initiation vs no initiation and the effect of sustained use vs no use. We estimated risk by statin treatment strategy over time via pooled logistic regression. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for treatment-confounder feedback in estimation of per-protocol effects.

Results

Of 233,526 eligible person-trials (6,373 individuals), there were 622 initiators and 232,904 noninitiators. Comparing statin initiation with no initiation, the 10-year risk differences (95% confidence interval) were -0.1% (-2.3% to 1.8%) for dementia and 0.3% (-2.7% to 3.3%) for dementia or death. Comparing sustained statin use vs no use, the 10-year risk differences were -2.2% (-5.2% to 1.6%) for dementia and -5.1% (-10.5% to -1.1%) for dementia or death.

Conclusions

Individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of initiators and events and potential for residual confounding.

### Statins: the role in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's neurodegeneration [^70250c61]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease commonly seen in the elderly and is characterized by progressive cognitive and physical decline. Current understanding of AD pathogenesis revolves around amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a product of the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by β- and γ-secretase, enzymes found predominantly in the cholesterol rich micro domains of the cell membrane. Several risk factors for AD are associated with cholesterol metabolism, including dyslipidaemia, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. Statins are widely prescribed for their cholesterol lowering ability and show a favorable side effect profile overall. By competitive inhibition of hydroxymethyl co-enzyme A-reductase, statins reduce the production of cholesterol and isoprenoid intermediates including geranylgeranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate. These isoprenoids modify recently translated proteins such as small GTPase molecules that are essential in numerous cell-signaling pathways, including vesicular trafficking and inflammation. In experimental models of AD, statins reduce the production of Aβ by disrupting secretase enzyme function and by reducing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that statins may reduce the incidence of AD. Consequently, statins, secondary of their anti-hypercholesterolaemic, plieotropic and anti-inflammatory effects, are being investigated for a potential therapeutic role. This review will discuss evidence for the role of statins in the treatment and prevention of AD neurodegeneration.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^afee112a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Patient-centered decision framework — life expectancy, time to benefit, and frailty considerations: If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, statin therapy generally should not be recommended, and if approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should guide decisions; in advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy and goals may shift to reducing treatment burden and maintaining quality of life. For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in statin decisions is essential, and a retrospective cohort of 326,981 Veterans aged 75 years and older without ASCVD at baseline found that new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with the association evident at ages aged > 90 years, in those with dementia, and remaining significant in those with frailty.

### Cholesterol level and statin use in Alzheimer disease… [^10e15e1b]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

During the last 2 decades, evidence has accumulated that a high cholesterol level may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease. With the global use of statins to treat hypercholesterolemia, this finding has led to the anticipation that statins could prove useful in treating or preventing AD. However, the results of work on this topic are inconsistent: some studies find beneficial effects, but other studies do not. The potential molecular mechanisms for the apparent adverse effects of cholesterol on the development of AD are then discussed. Third, we review preclinical studies of statin use and AD. Therefore, this first part of our review provides the background and rationale for investigating statins as potential therapeutic agents in patients with AD, the subject of the second part. Because statins are already in widespread use, the possibility that they might be useful for AD treatment or prevention must be rigorously confirmed or denied.

In the years since the connection between cholesterol level and AD was elucidated, many studies have investigated the potential use of statins as AD-modulating compounds. However, the results of these studies have often been inconsistent, in large part due to major differences in study design and data analysis. Although these methodological differences make it difficult to synthesize the results from various studies, we have endeavored to identify factors that could explain the observed variation in study outcomes. Furthermore, Aβ-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase from human neuroblastoma cells was abolished by application of mevastatin. 35 In hippocampal or mixed cortical neurons from rats, treatment with simvastatin or lovastatin reduced levels of both intracellular and extracellular Aβ40 and Aβ42.

33 That study also demonstrated that lovastatin and MβCD increased levels of C-terminal fragment α in primary neurons carrying the Swedish missense mutation in APP, suggesting a stimulation of α-secretase processing. Together, the results of these cell culture studies suggest that statin use can lower Aβ generation. Animal models of AD have generally yielded complementary findings. Administering simvastatin to guinea pigs for 3 weeks resulted in decreased brain and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ, an effect that was reversed by discontinuing the treatment. 33 In another study, 32 lovastatin and pravastatin sodium each decreased the amount of Aβ in the brains of transgenic mice while simultaneously increasing levels of APPsα. Transgenic mice treated with simvastatin performed better in the Morris water maze test than their untreated counterparts. 34.

### Genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and risk of dementia [^8e06752c]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

CVD and dementia are both heterogeneous diseases, caused by a multitude of genetic and environmental factors as well as interactions between them. The manner in which genetic susceptibility to CAD modified the association between CVD and dementia suggests that genetically predisposed CVD is a stronger risk factor for dementia than CVD with a low genetic risk. However, several of the SNPs in the GRS are also associated with risk factors for both CVD and dementia. Seven of the top SNPs identified for CAD reside in genes of importance for lipid levels, and four in genes important for blood pressure. Hence, it is plausible that the modifying effect of the CAD GRS on the association between CVD and dementia stems from genetic susceptibility to lipid dysregulation rather than to CVD itself.

The gene-based analyses highlighted a clear distinction between the lipid-related genes in common with CAD from those in common with AD. Pathway analyses further identified lipid metabolism and related pathways as the most important pathways, and that the relevant genes were different for CAD and AD. Cholesterol is one of the most well-established risk factors for CVD. It is also highly relevant to dementia, with the brain harboring approximately 25% of the body's cholesterol. Statins are commonly used in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD and affect disease pathology mainly through lowering circulating cholesterol levels. Several observational studies have shown statins to significantly lower the risk of AD, although randomized controlled trials found no such benefit. As the brain has its own cholesterol metabolism separated from that in the periphery by the blood–brain barrier, it is plausible that the same biological pathways influence the risk of both CVD and dementia, but through different risk genes. APOE, by far the most important genetic risk factor for AD, is the main cholesterol transporter in the brain. The ε4 risk allele increases the risk of both dementia and CVD while the ε2 allele increases the risk of CVD while having protective effect on dementia. Using a subset of the study sample included here, Eriksson et al. showed that only carriers of the ε4 allele had an increase in dementia rate after suffering from a non-stroke CVD. However, including APOE as a covariate in the models did not affect our findings and there was no evidence of an interaction between APOE and the GRS. The gene-based results identified APOE as significant for AD as well as all four lipid fractions, but not for CAD. Taken together, this is in line with previous evidence of the effect of APOE on CVD operating mainly through lipid dysregulation, while the effect on AD operates also through other mechanisms.

### Use of statins and incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia in a cohort study [^6ec2cb0c]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Evidence of a relation between use of lipid lowering drugs and cognitive outcomes is mixed. This study aimed to test the association between use of statins and incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) over 5 years of follow-up.

Methods

Data were from a population-based cohort study comprising 1,789 older Mexican Americans. All participants had cognitive and clinical evaluations performed every 12 to 15 months. Participants who fell below specified cutpoints on cognitive tests were then evaluated clinically. Dementia diagnoses were finalized by an adjudication team. A total of 1,674 participants free of dementia/CIND at baseline were included in these analyses. Statin use was verified at each participant's home by medicine cabinet inspection. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between statin use and incidence of dementia/CIND.

Results

Overall, 452 of 1,674 participants (27%) took statins at any time during the study. Over the 5-year follow-up period, 130 participants developed dementia/CIND. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for education, smoking status, presence of at least one APOE epsilon4 allele, and history of stroke or diabetes at baseline, persons who had used statins were about half as likely as those who did not use statins to develop dementia/CIND (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.34, 0.80).

Conclusion

Statin users were less likely to have incident dementia/cognitive impairment without dementia during a 5-year follow-up. These results add to the emerging evidence suggesting a protective effect of statin use on cognitive outcomes.

### Promoting successful cognitive aging: a ten-year update [^60b8c812]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperlipidemia

Hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL) has been associated with dementia risk, although evidence is less conclusive than other cardiovascular risk factors. Some epidemiological evidence has shown that high cholesterol in midlife is associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia, AD and vascular dementia, while other studies have found no link. Late-life cholesterol levels have not been linked to risk of cognitive impairment or dementia.

The precise mechanism by which cholesterol impacts dementia risk is still unclear. In a transgenic mouse model expressing human apolipoprotein B-100, hyperlipidemia has been associated with cardio- and cerebrovascular damage, vascular dysfunction, increased permeability of the BBB, and atherosclerosis. In humans, hyperlipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Additionally, Bowman and colleagues investigated the relationship between the BBB and the pathology of AD and found that dyslipidemia was prevalent in 47% of study participants with mild-to-moderate AD and 75% of those who had AD with BBB impairment, suggesting that dyslipidemia may play a role in decreasing BBB integrity. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels have also been associated with increased Aβ burden in humans.

In order to reduce cardiovascular risk, the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommend keeping total cholesterol levels below 170 mg/dL. The AHA and ACC suggest eating a heart-healthy diet, staying physically active, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight to reduce cholesterol levels. Patients with elevated cholesterol may also need to be treated with a statin. For most patients, the AHA and ACC recommend initiating statin therapy when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels exceed 70 mg/dL. Some evidence suggests that the use of statins may mitigate the risk of all-cause dementia or AD. See "Other medications that may affect cognition" for a more complete review of the current evidence on statin use and risk of dementia.

### Use of common cardiovascular disease drugs and risk of dementia: a case-control study in Swedish national register data [^40dc3457]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Higher cholesterol levels have long been associated with both AD and vascular dementia (VaD). Higher low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is especially atherogenic and associated with an increased risk of VaDbecause atherosclerotic vascular lesions are one of the etiological factors for VaD. Similarly, higher LDL‐C levels are associated with higher Aβ load in the brain, which is a pathological hallmark of AD. Additionally, higher levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol are carried in apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins, of which higher levels are associated with all forms of dementia. It may stand to reason then that LLDs would have the ability to decrease the risk of dementia. Indeed, ≥ 5 years of LLD use was associated with a moderately lower risk of dementia compared to non‐users; the combination of LLDs with hypertensives was associated with even further reduced risk. This is in contrast to a recent Mendelian randomization study that showed a null association between AD and genetic polymorphisms in drug targets for statins, while drug targets for PCSK9 inhibitors were associated with a higher risk of AD. The only large RCT in this area found that LLDs have almost no impact on dementia risk over a 5‐year period. In both instances, the timing of the exposure and length of follow‐up may have impacted the difference between these findings and those presented here.

### Therapeutic potential of statins in Alzheimer's disease [^47bc331f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence linking cholesterol metabolism with the neurofibrillary pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholesterol and its transport have been shown to be involved in the regulation of amyloid production and tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain, while also contributing to intracranial vascular disease and cerebral ischemia. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis thus inserting itself into the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous studies have examined the role of statins in the prevention of dementia and treatment of established AD. This paper describes the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD and explores how statins may influence this balance. A review of the epidemiological and clinical trials with statins in dementia and AD is also presented. While evidence from retrospective case control studies suggests a beneficial role of statins in the prevention of AD, a similar benefit has not been established in prospective cohort studies or clinical trials. The ability of statins in protecting against AD is not yet elucidated. In the near future recently completed but not yet reported randomized clinical trials will hopefully clarify the role of statins in the treatment of AD.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^89f7b568]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Cognitive function

Whether statin treatment has a possible effect on cognitive function is an important issue, especially with the pandemic of dyslipidaemia associated with diabetes and insulin resistance on the one hand, and changing demographic patterns affecting the prevalence of dementia on the other. Epidemiological studies have documented an association between high cholesterol levels and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, leading some to suggest that improved vascular function with statin treatment could be beneficial in the context of several pathologies that cause dementia. On the other hand, it has been suggested that reduction in cholesterol levels with statin therapy may be potentially detrimental for cognitive function. Yet the view that statins directly affect the brain is simplistic, given the brain-blood barrier and the fact that the brain is largely self-sufficient with respect to endogenous cholesterol synthesis.

The variable quality of data pertaining to this question is also problematic. Most clinical trials rely on patient self-report of neurological symptoms such as memory impairment, but have not incorporated rigorous objective testing for cognitive function. Furthermore, the study populations were at low risk for cognitive decline and the study duration may not have been sufficient to observe a cognitive effect. In the post-marketing setting, case reports and observational studies predominate (Table 3). Additionally, whether factors present in midlife that are known to be associated with impaired physical function in the longer-term, equally impact cognitive function is often overlooked.

Table 3
Summary of evidence evaluating possible effects of statins on cognitive function

In a review of published literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that there was no evidence that statins increase the incidence of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or decline in cognitive performance. Despite this, the labelling for statins was amended to include cognitive side effects such as memory loss and confusion, although the FDA emphasized that the cardiovascular benefits of statins outweighed these possible effects. Similar conclusions were reported in an updated review. These findings are supported by data from prospective studies. The Heart Protection Study used the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status at final follow-up to assess cognitive performance, and showed no differences between simvastatin and placebo groups for the proportion of patients classified as cognitively impaired, either overall or by baseline age subgroups. Additionally, in the Pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER) study, which assessed cognitive function at six different time points during the study using four neuropsychological performance tests, there was no difference in cognitive decline between pravastatin and placebo groups over a mean follow-up of 42 months.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b01a728f]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipid-lowering therapy and dementia or cognitive impairment

Fifteen trials reported dementia or cognitive impairment on follow-up (139 169 participants). Dementia or cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 929 participants in the intervention group and 937 participants in the control group. Lipid-lowering therapy compared with control was not associated with a significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment [1.33% vs 1.36% over a mean trial follow-up of 34.5 months; OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.74–1.26 (Figure 1)]. Heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 37.6%). There was no significant association amongst drug classes (Statin; OR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.67–1.21, PCSK9 inhibitor: OR 1.99; 95% CI, 0.61–6.44, Other: OR 1.35; 0.49–1.26). Meta-regression analysis showed no significant association of proportion of women enrolled with all cause dementia (P = 0.23) (eFigure 5).

### Pravastatin and cognitive function in the elderly. results of the PROSPER study [^16ce039e]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Observational studies have given conflicting results about the effect of statins in preventing dementia and cognitive decline. Moreover, observational studies are subject to prescription bias, making it hard to draw definite conclusions from them. Randomized controlled trials are therefore the preferred study design to investigate the association between statins and cognition. Here we present detailed cognitive outcomes from the randomized placebo-controlled PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Cognitive function was assessed repeatedly in all 5,804 PROSPER participants at six different time points during the study using four neuropsychological performance tests. After a mean follow-up period of 42 months, no difference in cognitive decline at any of the cognitive domains was found in subjects treated with pravastatin compared to placebo (all p > 0.05). Pravastatin treatment in old age did not affect cognitive decline during a 3 year follow-up period. Employing statin therapy in the elderly in an attempt to prevent cognitive decline therefore seems to be futile.

### Statin initiation and risk of incident Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline in genetically susceptible older adults [^9275c2a3]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The association of statin initiation with incident Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and cognitive decline by the APOE ε4 allele is unknown. Our objective was to examine whether the association of statin initiation with incident AD dementia and cognitive decline differs by the APOE ε4 allele.

Methods

This population-based longitudinal cohort study was conducted in 4 urban communities in Chicago, IL, United States, consisting of 4,807 participants. Statin initiation is based on the inspection of medications during home assessments. Clinical diagnosis for incident AD used the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and longitudinal measurements of global cognition consisted of episodic memory, perceptual speed, and the Mini-Mental State Examination tests.

Results

The study participants had a mean age of 72 years, consisting of 63% female individuals and 61% non-Hispanic Black individuals. During the study period, 1,470 (31%) participants reported statin initiation. In a covariate-adjusted competing risk model, statin initiation was associated with a reduced risk of incident clinical AD [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81 (95% CI 0.70–0.94)] compared with nonusers. This association was statistically significantly lower (p interaction = 0.015) among participants with the APOE ε4 allele [HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.49–0.74)] compared with those without the APOE ε4 allele [HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.82–1.12)]. The annual decline in global cognition (β = 0.021, 95% CI 0.007–0.034) and episodic memory (β = 0.020, 95% CI 0.007–0.033) was also substantially slower among participants with the APOE ε4 allele after statin initiation compared with nonusers. However, the association of statin initiation with cognitive decline was not significant among those without the APOE ε4 allele.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that statins might be associated with a lower risk of incident AD among individuals with the APOE ε4 allele. The benefits of statin therapy need further consideration in randomized clinical trials, especially among those with the APOE ε4 allele.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that among those aged 65 years or older, statin initiation was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease, especially in the presence of an APOE -e4 allele.

### Effects of simvastatin on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognition in middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease [^aa3d9c55]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Statins reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in animals and may thereby favorably alter the pathobiology of AD. It is unclear if statins modify Abeta metabolism or improve cognition in asymptomatic middle-aged adults at increased risk for AD.

Methods

In a 4-month randomized, double-blind, controlled study, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin 40 mg daily vs. placebo on CSF Abeta42 levels and cognition in 57 asymptomatic middle-aged adult children of persons with AD.

Results

Compared to placebo, individuals randomized to simvastatin for 4 months had similar changes in CSF Abeta42 (p = 0.344) and total tau levels (p = 0.226), yet greater improvements in some measures of verbal fluency (p = 0.024) and working memory (p = 0.015). APOE4 genotype, gender, and vascular risk factors were associated with CSF biomarker levels, but did not modify treatment effects.

Conclusion

In asymptomatic middle-aged adults at increased risk for AD, simvastatin use improved selected measures of cognitive function without significantly changing CSF Abeta42 or total tau levels. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of higher dose and/or longer duration statin therapy on not only Abeta metabolism, but also other preclinical processes related to the development of AD.

### Lipoprotein levels and statin treatment related to dementia and cognitive decline in individuals with type 2 diabetes: an observational analysis from the ADVANCE study [^ca92fe5c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated levels of blood lipids, including triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, while their reduction lowers the risk, especially in patients at high risk.

Up to a quarter of total body cholesterol is found in or near neurons. Cholesterol is vital for brain development, and low HDL (but not LDL or triglycerides) has been associated with a smaller hippocampus, which is also seen in neurodegenerative disease. However, the relationship between circulating lipid levels and brain development is disputed, as the blood–brain barrier is impermeable to cholesterol, and the cholesterol needed for brain function is produced locally. There is no clear evidence that low LDL cholesterol levels as a result of lipid-lowering treatment would affect brain lipids. In addition to vascular mechanisms, the ApoE ε4 allele may influence the relationship between lipid levels and incident Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia.

In meta-analyses, high midlife, but not late-life, total cholesterol has been positively associated with Alzheimer's disease. HDL and LDL were not associated with dementia or cognitive decline (CD), but few studies reported relevant data. In cohort studies, overall results continue to be mixed with both HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol found to be associated with both subsequent increased and decreased risks of dementia and CD. Despite epidemiologic associations between lipid levels and dementia risk, clinical trials of statins have not demonstrated a protective effect against dementia or CD. Trials on proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 serine inhibitors and fibrates have shown mixed results. On the other hand, in observational studies, associations between low LDL as a result of statin treatment and CD may be the result of confounding from pre-treatment hyperlipidaemia. Observed associations between statin treatment and reduced incident dementia may also be the result of other residual confounders as well as reverse causation. In randomized controlled trials on lowering of LDL cholesterol, the follow-up time observed may be too short and the participants too young, to capture any negative effects on cognition.

In individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), large studies on hyperlipidaemia as a risk factor and the potential modifying effect of statin use on CD and dementia are few. T2D itself, as well as hyperlipidaemia, has been found to be associated with an increased risk of dementia, but findings are conflicting.

### Systemic medications and dementia risk: a systematic umbrella review [^fc24d599]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Proposed mechanisms by which systemic drugs may alter dementia risk include vascular risk factors, hormonal status, direct neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects, and neurotransmitter modulation. Treatment of hypertension appears to reduce dementia risk, and the increased risk of cardiovascular events and stroke associated with HRT use has been proposed to explain the increased dementia risk seen in the WHIMS RCTs. In contrast, other evidence suggests that lack of oestrogens may have a detrimental neurological effect, leading to increased levels of dementia among post-menopausal women. Studies in postmenopausal women have found higher levels of tau pathology and reduced brain glucose metabolism seen on positron emission tomograpy scanning than in premenopausal women. Duration of oestrogen exposure has previously been shown to be potentially protective for dementia, with those in the prolonged duration of exposure group showing a 28% lower risk of dementia than those in the shortest exposure group. In Nerattini et al. the risk of dementia with HRT varied according to the timing of administration and type of HRT, with HRT in mid-life (< 10 years after last menstrual period) being protective. However, they found that administration of oestrogen and progesterone HRT in older women was associated with increased risk of dementia, such as in the WHIMS RCTs. This suggests that there may be chronological factors that determine the impact of HRT on dementia risk.

Androgens are purported to have neuroprotective effects, and suppression of these in mid-life may support the observed association between ADT and increased dementia risk. In particular, the association between ADT and dementia incidence was consistent at around a 20% increased risk of dementia, with similar results being found across most systematic reviews that we examined. Lipophilic statin subtypes have been proposed to have a direct neuroprotective effect due to their increased ability to cross the blood-brain barrier compared to hydrophilic statins, however there was no evidence to support this mechanistic hypothesis from available observational data. Anticholinergic medications are known to affect cognition acutely and there is evidence of correlation between anticholinergic use over time and brain atrophy, which may be due to the direct effects of reduced cholinergic neuronal activity. The association seen with anticholinergics found with dementia risk seen in this review is consistent with the use of anticholinesterase inhibitors as symptomatic treatment for dementia.

### Simvastatin is associated with a reduced incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease [^f7047745]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Statins are a class of medications that reduce cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Whether statins can benefit patients with dementia remains unclear because of conflicting results. We hypothesized that some of the confusion in the literature might arise from differences in efficacy of different statins. We used a large database to compare the action of several different statins to investigate whether some statins might be differentially associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease.

Methods

We analyzed data from the decision support system of the US Veterans Affairs database, which contains diagnostic, medication and demographic information on 4.5 million subjects. The association of lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin with dementia was examined with Cox proportional hazard models for subjects taking statins compared with subjects taking cardiovascular medications other than statins, after adjusting for covariates associated with dementia or Parkinson's disease.

Results

We observed that simvastatin is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of dementia in subjects ≥ 65 years, using any of three models. The first model incorporated adjustment for age, the second model included adjusted for three known risk factors for dementia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and the third model incorporated adjustment for the Charlson index, which is an index that provides a broad assessment of chronic disease. Data were obtained for over 700000 subjects taking simvastatin and over 50000 subjects taking atorvastatin who were aged > 64 years. Using model 3, the hazard ratio for incident dementia for simvastatin and atorvastatin are 0.46 (CI 0.44–0.48, p < 0.0001) and 0.91 (CI 0.80–1.02, p = 0.11), respectively. Lovastatin was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia. Simvastatin also exhibited a reduced hazard ratio for newly acquired Parkinson's disease (HR 0.51, CI 0.4–0.55, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Simvastatin is associated with a strong reduction in the incidence of dementia and Parkinson's disease, whereas atorvastatin is associated with a modest reduction in incident dementia and Parkinson's disease, which shows only a trend towards significance.

### Lipid lowering agents, cognitive decline, and dementia: the three-city study [^2a7672ba]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate the effects of lipid lowering agent (LLA) intake on cognitive function in 6,830 community-dwelling elderly persons. Cognitive performance (global cognitive functioning, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed, and executive function), clinical diagnosis of dementia, and fibrate and statin use, were evaluated at baseline, and 2, 4, and 7 year follow-up. Multivariate Cox models were stratified by gender and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, mental and physical health including vascular risk factors, and genetic vulnerability (apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein). For women but not men, fibrate use was specifically associated with an increased risk over 7 years of decline in visual memory only (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09–1.54, p = 0.004), and did not increase risk for incident dementia. This association was independent of genetic vulnerability related to apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl exchange transfer protein polymorphisms and occurred only in women with higher low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and treated with fibrate (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.08–1.79, p = 0.01) and not in those with lower LDL-cholesterol levels irrespective of fibrate treatment. For both genders, no significant associations were found between statins (irrespective of their lipophilicity) and either cognitive decline or dementia incidence. This prospective study, adjusting for multiple confounders, found no evidence that LLA given in late life reduced the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but did raise the possibility that women with treatment-resistant high LDL-cholesterol may be at increased risk of decline in visual memory.

### Systemic medications and dementia risk: a systematic umbrella review [^a1bec81f]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

In our umbrella review, there was limited RCT evidence available for other systemic medications (Table 3). Even when RCT evidence was available, dementia was a secondary outcome. An exception to this was the WHIMS RCT, for which dementia was a primary outcome. Results of the WHIMS RCT were included in several meta-analyses, which found evidence that oestrogen-progesterone HRT and antidepressants increased the risk of all-cause dementia. In contrast to RCT data, in our umbrella review, observational studies found a protective effect of oestrogen monotherapy HRT on dementia risk. Results from the WHIMS RCT were also included in one of our included meta-analyses on antidepressant use and dementia, which found an increased risk of dementia with antidepressant use among postmenopausal women.

Our umbrella review found that RCTs suggested moderate evidence of a reduced risk of dementia with statin use. The included RCTs all examined dementia as a secondary outcome, with primary endpoints being cardiovascular outcomes, such as stroke. However, a Cochrane review of the RCT evidence for statins and an RCT examining the role of statins in slowing progression of AD have found no association between statin use and dementia incidence or progression.

One RCT reported on antacids and dementia risk as a secondary outcome, finding no increased risk of dementia with this medication.

One RCT examined dementia as a secondary outcome for anticoagulant use. Four RCTs included dementia as a secondary outcome for NOACs vs warfarin. However, a Cochrane review of RCT data and anticoagulation did not support their use to prevent cognitive decline.

Observational studies suggested reduced risk of dementia with NSAIDs and vitamin E, and vitamin C use. However, Cochrane reviews of RCTs of NSAIDs, vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation concluded that there was no evidence for their use in preventing dementia. In fact, RCTs were halted early due to harm associated with NSAID use.

Our umbrella review also found observational evidence suggesting an increased risk of dementia with ADT, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, and anticholinergics, and decreased risk of dementia with lithium. There was little evidence for an association between dementia risk and antacids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. We could not find available RCT evidence and only found observational studies for diabetes medications, NSAIDs, cancer treatments, most psychotropic medications apart from antidepressants, anticholinergics, and dietary supplements.

### Weight loss in a cardiovascular trial population identifies people at future risk of dementia [^3fd2f749]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Populations at increased risk of dementia need to be identified for well-powered trials of preventive interventions. Weight loss, which often occurs in pre-clinical dementia, could identify a population at sufficiently high dementia risk.

Methods

In 12,975 survivors in the Heart Protection Study statin trial of people with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease, the association of weight change over 5 years during the trial with post-trial dementia recorded in electronic hospital admission and death records (n = 784) was assessed, after adjustment for age, sex, treatment allocation, and deprivation measures.

Results

Among the 60% without substantial weight gain (≤ 2 kg weight gain), each 1 kg weight loss was associated with a risk ratio for dementia of 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.07). Weight loss ≥ 4 kg and cognitive function below the mean identified participants aged ≥ 67 years with a 13% 10-year dementia risk.

Discussion

The combination of weight loss and high vascular risk identified individuals at high risk of dementia who could be recruited to dementia prevention trials.

### Association of year-to-year lipid variability with risk of cognitive decline and dementia in community-dwelling older adults [^00099fc8]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Routine screening of lipids in older adults is common in most high-income countries such as Australia and the United States, with the data easily accessible through the electronic medical record system. The feasibility of calculating lipid variability using electronic health records to predict adverse events has been demonstrated. Monitoring cholesterol change over time of older people can help clinicians to identify asymptomatic at-risk individuals who are likely to benefit from the early detection and treatment. Because the causes of cholesterol variability can vary and coexist, it is crucial for clinicians to discern any pathologic factors that contribute to this variation. Our stratified analysis by cholesterol fluctuation and baseline levels, despite reduced statistical power, revealed a dose-dependent relationship between higher cholesterol variability and increased dementia risk, regardless of the trend or baseline values. Individuals with an ascending cholesterol trend and high baseline levels exhibited the highest risk, suggesting that those with suboptimal cholesterol control over time may benefit most from interventions. Such interventions could include lifestyle change and persistent statin use to prevent further cholesterol elevation and potentially reduce dementia risk.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5e68118a]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — adults older than 75 years: According to national mortality data, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were respectively the first and fourth leading causes of death in adults 65 years or older in 2018, yet trial data on benefits in persons older than 75 years are limited, and available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against initiating statins for primary prevention in this age group. Evidence on potential harms specifically in adults 76 years or older is limited, while trials in the general adult population show statins are not associated with an increased risk of myalgia, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, or cognitive harms.

### Association of lipid-lowering therapy with dementia and cognitive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^200d1c89]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

A descriptive analysis of included trials is reported in Table 1. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome of interest from individual studies. Weighted pooled treatment effects were calculated overall and individually for drug class; statin, PCSK9 inhibitor and other, using restricted maximum likelihood estimation to fit a random effects meta-analysis model. The variability across studies due to heterogeneity was investigated using forest plots and I 2 statistics. For difference in cognitive score outcome, the mean change from baseline to follow-up was meta-analysed. The difference in cognitive test score change between the intervention and control group was calculated when the difference was not reported in the trial. A pooled mean difference, with 95%, CI, was estimated using a random effects model. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of included trials.

A priori subgroup sensitivity analyses that assessed pooled estimates for trials that reported follow-up above and below the median number of months of follow-up, and including only trials with low risk of bias were performed. A post hoc sensitivity analysis excluding open label extension studies was also conducted. The rationale for this was to mitigate for ascertainment bias in open label extension studies.

### Low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and dementia risk over 17 years of follow-up among members of a large health care plan [^43992bf3]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The associations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with dementia risk in later life may be complex, and few studies have sufficient data to model nonlinearities or adequately adjust for statin use. We evaluated the observational associations of HDL-C and LDL-C with incident dementia in a large and well-characterized cohort with linked survey and electronic health record (EHR) data.

Methods

Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan members aged 55 years and older who completed a health behavior survey between 2002 and 2007, had no history of dementia before the survey, and had laboratory measurements of cholesterol within 2 years after survey completion were followed up through December 2020 for incident dementia (Alzheimer disease-related dementia [ADRD]; Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and/or nonspecific dementia) based on ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes in EHRs. We used Cox models for incident dementia with follow-up time beginning 2 years postsurvey (after cholesterol measurement) and censoring at end of membership, death, or end of study period. We evaluated nonlinearities using B-splines, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and survey confounders, and tested for effect modification by baseline age or prior statin use.

Results

A total of 184,367 participants [mean age at survey = 69.5 years, mean HDL-C = 53.7 mg/dL (SD = 15.0), mean LDL-C = 108 mg/dL (SD = 30.6)] were included. Higher and lower HDL-C values were associated with elevated ADRD risk compared with the middle quantile: HDL-C in the lowest quintile was associated with an HR of 1.07 (95% CI 1.03–1.11), and HDL-C in the highest quintile was associated with an HR of 1.15 (95% CI 1.11–1.20). LDL-C was not associated with dementia risk overall, but statin use qualitatively modified the association. Higher LDL-C was associated with a slightly greater risk of ADRD for statin users (53% of the sample, HR per 10 mg/dL increase = 1.01, 95% CI 1.01–1.02) and a lower risk for nonusers (HR per 10 mg/dL increase = 0.98; 95% CI 0.97–0.99). There was evidence for effect modification by age with linear HDL-C (p = 0.003) but not LDL-C (p = 0.59).

Discussion

Both low and high levels of HDL-C were associated with elevated dementia risk. The association between LDL-C and dementia risk was modest.

Recommendation‐specific supportive text

Clinical decision making and communication for deprescribing statins can be complex regardless of the patient's medical conditions and frailty. It is prudent for clinicians to have thoughtful conversations with their patients and their caregivers regarding the potential benefits and risks of statin continuation and deprescribing in older age. Some clinicians may need to acknowledge and overcome their own uncertainty about stopping statins if their patients are interested in discontinuation. A study of 180 acutely ill Australian older adults found that 95% were willing to stop their statin, predominantly over concerns for adverse effects. When discussing statin discontinuation through shared decision‐making, clinicians may also need to alter their communication about deprescribing based on their patient's preferences. A survey of 90 Danish general practitioners identified that the most important topic clinicians wanted to discuss related to stopping statins was goals of therapy, while adverse effects were considered less important. However, a U.S. study of 835 older adults found that most patients preferred phrasing focused on the risk of adverse effects when discussing deprescribing a statin. Although existing data suggest the risk of statin‐related adverse effects is low, older adults with frailty, severe functional or cognitive impairment, or polypharmacy have not been well‐represented in studies that assessed adverse effects. Adverse effects, even mild ones, may play a greater role in driving decisions about statin therapy for such patients, and observational data suggest that nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness are associated with the total number of medications as well as with individual medications. Another small qualitative study of clinicians, caregivers and older adults with dementia found that patients and caregivers preferred clinicians to explain that aging and comorbid conditions may shift the balance of benefits and risks of medications such as statins. Examples of such phrasing are "Our bodies change over time and certain medicines may no longer be needed" and "These medications take years to have an effect and I think that we should focus on what can help you right now".
Three observational cohort studies of older adults taking statins for primary prevention in France, Denmark and Italy (aggregate N > 200,000 individuals) reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events over a subsequent 2–5 year period among patients who stopped their statin, compared to patients who continued (Table 6). Adjusted HRs suggested an approximately 30% increase in admissions for ASCVD events during follow‐up among those who discontinued statins. The reasons for statin discontinuation were unknown. While investigators adjusted for baseline characteristics or performed propensity‐matching prior to data analysis, results may in part reflect residual unmeasured or unknown confounding. It is also unknown whether these estimates translate to the U.S. population. Nevertheless, these studies provide risk estimates for statin discontinuation that can be incorporated into shared decision‐making conversations.
Deprescribing may provide benefits for patients near the end of their life. Kutner et al. evaluated 60‐day survival after statin deprescribing in an unblinded randomized, parallel group non‐inferiority trial of 381 individuals with life‐limiting illness and an estimated survival of < 1 year; 36% of patients were enrolled in hospice. There were no differences in 60‐day survival or cardiovascular events between the 2 groups. Quality of life was improved and medication cost (using 2012 retail pricing) lowered among those who discontinued their statin. These results indicate that it may be reasonable to discontinue statin therapy in patients with limited life expectancy due to co‐morbid conditions. Further research would be helpful to guide deprescribing discussions in this population.

### Sociodemographic modifiers of effects of statin initiation on dementia incidence: an emulated trial design in a large health care member population with 10 + years of follow-up [^a42e6733]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we aimed to emulate a target trial to evaluate sociodemographic modifiers of the effect of statin initiation on the incidence of dementia, leveraging a uniquely robust EHR database that includes up to 20 years of follow‐up and a large, embedded survey cohort. Our findings suggested that the association of statin initiation with ADRD/AD incidence was close to null across all sociodemographic groups evaluated, including by age, sex, racial/ethnic identity, education, marital status, income, U.S. nativity, and maternal U.S. nativity.

Our findings suggest that statin initiation does not significantly impact ADRD/AD incidence across various sociodemographic groups. This inference is bolstered by the observation of no significant effects for statin initiation on ADRD/AD overall, and no statistically or clinically significant estimated associations within any of the evaluated sociodemographic groups, with results consistent in both the full and the survey cohorts. This lack of association suggests that the protective cardiovascular effects of statins may not extend to reducing dementia risk.

Previous studies on the risk of dementia associated with statin use have produced inconsistent results. RCTs with short follow‐up periods have generally suggested no overall effect of statins on dementia or cognitive outcomes. RCTs are often limited by small sample size, short follow‐up periods, and participant characteristics that differ significantly from the typical clinical populations. High‐quality observational studies have achieved much larger samples than RCTs, and generally have suggested protective effects, of statins for cognition and dementia, although results have been mixed, supporting no association, or protective effects only when initiated at younger ages. A previous emulated trial of statin initiation on dementia risk found no ITT effect of statin initiation on dementia incidence using pooled logistic regression in a sample of 6373 participants with up to 10 years of follow‐up. However, with only 622 statin initiators and 63 dementia cases among those initiators, the sample in the previous emulated trial was too small to rule out important effects or evaluate heterogeneity. Our emulated trial design included over 400 times more statin initiators in the full cohort and 43 times as many statin initiators in the survey cohort, with slightly longer average follow‐up, allowing for precise effect estimates even in subgroups.

### The relationship between midlife dyslipidemia and lifetime incidence of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^42a67bf8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by changes in cognition, behavior, and functioning. Although the exact cognitive functions affected may depend on the subtype of dementia, impairment in various domains can occur including processing speed, attention, learning and memory, language, visuospatial and executive functions, and social cognition. As of 2019, more than 55 million people were affected by the disease worldwide, with this projected to rise to 153 million people by 2050. The burden of dementia is driven by its progressive and generally irreversible nature, placing long‐term stresses on both patients and carers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the most common causes of dementia, frequently co‐occurring as a "mixed dementia", and together account for ≈80% of global dementia cases. AD is characterized by decline in two or more of the aforementioned cognitive domains, with resultant impact on the person's activities of daily living. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a prodrome or "at‐risk" stage for dementia. It involves a decline in cognitive function beyond what is expected for normal aging, without the significant decline in daily functioning that would be evident in dementia. More than50% of patients with MCI progress to dementia within 5 years.

Up to 40% of dementia risk has been attributed to modifiable risk factors. Coupled with evidence that pathology leading to dementia begins 10 to 20 years before clinical symptoms emerge, there is substantial interest in identifying early to midlife interventions that may prevent lifetime occurrence of dementia. One risk factor gaining interest is dyslipidemia, which refers to an imbalance of lipid levels in the blood. A proposed mechanism for the observed association between dyslipidemia and dementia is the conversion of systemic cholesterol into 27‐hydroxycholesterol, which may cross the blood‐brain barrier and promote deposition of amyloid beta and tau proteins characteristic of AD. It is postulated that 27‐hydroxycholesterol increases beta‐site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, which is the rate‐limiting step (i.e. the slowest, most critical step that determines the overall reaction rate) in amyloid beta (Aβ) production. A similar mechanism has been suggested to underlie an increased risk of MCI with early life exposure to elevated cholesterol. Furthermore, hyperlipidemia may aggravate both carotid atherosclerosis contributing to VaD and oxidized low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)–mediated neuronal cell death implicated in dementia and MCI pathophysiology.

### The controversies of statin therapy: weighing the evidence [^2adc3209]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The debate whether statins, 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are safe to use has been raging since their introduction in 1987. Statins are generally well tolerated and are believed to have minimal adverse effects. However, individual, specific rare adverse events have been reported, such as elevations of liver enzymes, muscle aches, and very rarely, rhabdomyolysis. Discontinuation and/or reduction in the dose of the statin usually leads to resolution of these side effects. Recently, however, debate has focused on the possible negative long-term effects of statin treatment on cognitive decline, the incidence of cancer, and the development of diabetes mellitus. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded the warning for statins with a statement that statin use may lead to cognitive impairment. In this review, we discuss all levels of evidence, from case reports to large randomized controlled clinical trials, for the possible adverse effects of statins on cognitive decline, cancer, and diabetes. After careful consideration of all discussed scientific evidence, we conclude that there is no increased risk of cognitive decline or cancer with statin use. However, statin use is related to a small increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In view of the overwhelming benefit of statins in the reduction of cardiovascular events, we believe the small absolute risk for development of diabetes is outweighed by the cardiovascular benefits in patients for whom statin therapy is recommended. We, therefore, suggest that clinical practice for statin therapy should not be changed on the basis of the most recent Food and Drug Administration informational warnings.

### Effect of statin therapy on cognitive Decline and incident dementia in older adults [^a6a441b4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The neurocognitive effect of statins in older adults remain uncertain.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of statin use with cognitive decline and incident dementia among older adults.

Methods

This analysis included 18,846 participants ≥ 65 years of age in a randomized trial of aspirin, who had no prior cardiovascular events, major physical disability, or dementia initially and were followed for 4.7 years. Outcome measures included incident dementia and its subclassifications (probable Alzheimer's disease, mixed presentations); mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its subclassifications (MCI consistent with Alzheimer's disease, other MCI); and changes in domain-specific cognition, including global cognition, memory, language and executive function, psychomotor speed, and the composite of these domains. Associations of baseline statin use versus nonuse with dementia and MCI outcomes were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and with cognitive change using linear mixed-effects models, adjusting for potential confounders. The impact of statin lipophilicity on these associations was further examined, and effect modifiers were identified.

Results

Statin use versus nonuse was not associated with dementia, MCI, or their subclassifications or with changes in cognitive function scores over time (p > 0.05 for all). No differences were found in any outcomes between hydrophilic and lipophilic statin users. Baseline neurocognitive ability was an effect modifier for the associations of statins with dementia (p for interaction < 0.001) and memory change (p for interaction = 0.02).

Conclusions

In adults ≥ 65 years of age, statin therapy was not associated with incident dementia, MCI, or declines in individual cognition domains. These findings await confirmation from ongoing randomized trials.

### Comparative effect of statins on the risk of incident Alzheimer disease [^d4017a8a]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether fungus-derived statins are associated with a lower risk of incident Alzheimer disease (AD) compared with synthetic statins using real-world clinical practice data.

Methods

We identified a population-based retrospective cohort of patients aged ≥ 60 years newly prescribed a statin between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2012, and followed until March 31, 2015, using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Statins were consecutively classified according to their type, lipophilicity, and potency. For each group, we calculated the crude AD incidence rates per 1,000 person-years. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for propensity score deciles were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) of incident AD associated with different statin categories.

Results

Over the 18-year study period, we identified 465,085 statin users, including 7,669 patients who developed AD during 2,891,268 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 2.65 [95% CI 2.59–2.71] per 1,000 person-years). Compared to synthetic, fungus-derived statins were associated with an increased risk of AD (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.15). Lipophilic statins also were associated with higher AD risk (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09–1.27) compared to hydrophilic statins, while statin potency did not modify the risk of AD (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98–1.08). The risk was further reduced in sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

Fungus-derived and lipophilic statins were not associated with decreased incidence of AD compared to synthetic and hydrophilic statins. The modest variations in the risk of incident AD observed between statin characteristics needs to be evaluated in future studies on their possible heterogeneous neuroprotective effect.

### Lipid lowering and Alzheimer disease risk: a mendelian randomization study [^5c56855b]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This MR study did not identify support for the repurposing of statins, or medications that inhibit NPC1L1 or block ApoB production, to delay or prevent AD onset. Our results also raise the possibility (but in no way confirm) that exposure to PCSK9 inhibitors might predispose individuals to AD, although with the magnitude of relative risk observed being smaller than for the estimated degree of protection from CAD.

If the use of lipid‐lowering medications in general does not affect AD risk, this may signify the absence of a substantial role of primary hypercholesterolemia in AD etiology. The only major RCT to have addressed the effect of therapeutic LDL‐C reduction on dementia risk to date found equal incidence (0.3%) in both simvastatin and placebo‐allocated arms after 5 years of follow‐up (albeit in a sample aged 40–80 years at baseline, thus including many individuals too young to be at risk of late onset AD). 33 Taking this finding alongside no prominent genetic associations observed for general LDL‐C lowering (as others have observed previously), 34, 35 and unclear or null results for HMGCR and 2 other drug targets, suggests that previous prospective observational associations of hyperlipidemia with AD, and of higher LDL‐C with AD‐related neuropathology, may have been overstated due to residual confounding. Associations of lipid‐lowering drug use with AD risk would also be prone to bias via confounding by indication. 36

A previous analysis has also addressed whether variation at HMGCR and PCSK9 is associated with AD risk using MR. 37 After excluding pleiotropic variation at APOE, the authors found no association of a genetically predicted reduction in LDL‐C exposure with AD in a sample that overlaps with one of those in the current analyses (a previous IGAP GWAS from 2013). 38 Their result using HMGCR and PCSK9 variation (combined in a single IVW model) from IGAP data had a consistent direction and similar magnitude of association as in our findings, but conflated the potentially independent associations of the different gene regions with AD, and may have lacked precision due to the use of fewer variants and a smaller sample. 37 Using a more comprehensive survey of genetic variation at PCSK9 separately in 2 large AD datasets, our analyses yielded consistent estimates of higher AD risk from lower PCSK9 function, regardless of the MR method used. We also report tentative MR evidence to suggest that lower circulating PCSK9 might reduce AD risk, although these findings were inconclusive, because the precision of the models was limited by the use of few variants with which to proxy exposure to PCSK9 concentrations.

### Serum lipid traits and the risk of dementia: a cohort study of 254, 575 women and 214, 891 men in the UK biobank [^c0fd5c66]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

ApoB is the main structural component of atherogenic lipoproteins and can be a direct measure of the total circulating atherogenic particles, as they can then enter the arterial wall while containing the mass of cholesterol (usually LDL cholesterol) within them. The 'response-to-retention' hypothesisdetailing the entrapment of ApoB containing particle within the tunica intima arterial wall as a necessary step in order for the process of atherosclerosis to initiate. From experimental animal models, mice that were overexpressing ApoB exhibited hyperlipidaemia, neurodegeneration, amyloid plaques accumulation, and cognitive impairment, similar to transgenic mouse model overexpressing proteins related to Alzheimer's disease. Our study provided further empirical evidence in line with these pathophysiological hypotheses for apolipoproteins, even in the absence of any, or very weak associations between circulating cholesterols and dementia, non-linear relationship between ApoB and dementia was observed. While it may be due to reverse causation, after excluding the people diagnosed with dementia or that died within the first five years, the U-shaped association remained robust for ApoB and dementia.

Notwithstanding the growing evidence for lipids being potential predictors for dementia, dyslipidaemia was not included as one of the twelve potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia outlined in the Lancet Commission Report. Intervention studies involving lipid-lowering treatments, such as statins, which is considered as the first-line treatment for lowering ApoB level, have not yielded sufficient evidence from clinical trials in favour of its therapeutic benefits in preventing cognitive decline or dementia. Albeit observational studies demonstrating lower risk of dementia in association with statin use, conflicting results remain around the benefits of statin on reducing the risk of dementia caused by cerebrovascular diseases. The assessment of a comprehensive panel of lipid traits (beyond cholesterols) should be considered to identify at-risk individuals. ApoB from cerebrospinal fluid sample was identified as an important marker for tau pathology and cognitive decline, which reinforces the need for considering apolipoproteins in clinical practice, and these findings may also be useful for designing more effective drug interventions.

### Association between statin exposure and Alzheimer disease by sex / race… [^bc27879b]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

We compared AD diagnosis rates of Medicare beneficiaries with high and low exposure to statins. To mitigate concern that AD onset could lead to poor adherence or discontinuation of statins, we designated the period from 2006 to 2008 the statin exposure period prior to our outcome period, which is from 2009 to 2013. Beneficiaries were followed up for an average of
7. 2 years and the mean number of years between statin exposure and AD diagnosis was 5.
4. We conducted analyses of the association of statin use and AD incidence for any statin and separately by specific statin. We compared AD incidence of individuals with low or high exposure to statins because all statin users are similar across other dimensions. For example, average age difference between high- and low-exposure statin users is 0. 6 years, and low- and high-exposure statin users have similar disease prevalence: non-AD dementia. acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. In our sample, they are 2 years older than statin users and less likely than statin users to have acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension, and slightly more likely to have atrial fibrillation. As such, we compared high-exposure users with later users but not lesser users, and confirmed our findings of reduced AD incidence associated with high exposure to statins.

We also compared AD incidence between low and high statin users for AD onset that occurred at least 4 years later.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^8331905a]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Subsequent analyses have also addressed this question. Prospective observational data analysis (> 57 000 subjects followed for a median of 4 years) showed that statin use was associated with a lower risk of dementia [RR 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43–0.81; P = 0.001]. A meta-analysis of more than 46 000 patients in 25 RCTs (23 with cognitive testing), did not identify any significant negative effect of statins on cognitive function, both for cognitively normal subjects or those with Alzheimer's disease. Added to this, a Cochrane review of four trials including 1154 patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease found no significant differences in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale — cognitive subscale and the Minimal Mental State Examination between patients treated with statin or placebo, implying that statins do not delay cognitive deterioration in patients with known dementia. While transient global amnesia has been linked with statin use in case reports, there is no evidence to support causality from the totality of evidence to date.

Another question is whether there is any risk of adverse effects on cognitive function with the very low LDL-C levels attained with the combination of a statin and ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor. A prespecified analysis of the [Examining Outcomes in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome: Vytorin (Ezetimibe/Simvastatin) vs. Simvastatin] IMPROVE-IT trial showed no increase in neurocognitive adverse events with ezetimibe compared with placebo when associated with exposure to LDL-C levels < 0.78 mmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) for up to 6 years. Data from the Open-Label Study of Long-term Evaluation Against LDL-C (OSLER) trial involving treatment with evolocumab for up to 4 years, and a pooled analysis of studies of alirocumab treatment for up to 2 years, add further support. Even at the very low LDL-C levels (< 0.5 mmol/L or < 20 mg/dL) attained with evolocumab plus moderate or high intensity statin therapy in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, there was no increase in neurocognitive adverse events compared with placebo (statin alone).

### Pharmacologic interventions to prevent cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and clinical Alzheimer-Type dementia: a systematic review [^b80b2996]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment to prevent or delay cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia is uncertain.

Purpose

To summarize current evidence on the efficacy and harms of pharmacologic interventions to prevent or delay cognitive decline, MCI, or dementia in adults with normal cognition or MCI.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases from January 2009 to July 2017, bibliographies, and expert recommendations.

Study Selection

English-language trials of at least 6 months' duration enrolling adults without dementia and comparing pharmacologic interventions with placebo, usual care, or active control on cognitive outcomes.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently rated risk of bias and strength of evidence; 1 extracted data, and a second checked accuracy.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-one unique trials were rated as having low to moderate risk of bias (including 3 that studied dementia medications, 16 antihypertensives, 4 diabetes medications, 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or aspirin, 17 hormones, and 7 lipid-lowering agents). In persons with normal cognition, estrogen and estrogen-progestin increased risk for dementia or a combined outcome of MCI or dementia (1 trial, low strength of evidence); high-dose raloxifene decreased risk for MCI but not for dementia (1 trial, low strength of evidence); and antihypertensives (4 trials), NSAIDs (1 trial), and statins (1 trial) did not alter dementia risk (low to insufficient strength of evidence). In persons with MCI, cholinesterase inhibitors did not reduce dementia risk (1 trial, low strength of evidence). In persons with normal cognition and those with MCI, these pharmacologic treatments neither improved nor slowed decline in cognitive test performance (low to insufficient strength of evidence). Adverse events were inconsistently reported but were increased for estrogen (stroke), estrogen-progestin (stroke, coronary heart disease, invasive breast cancer, and pulmonary embolism), and raloxifene (venous thromboembolism).

Limitation

High attrition, short follow-up, inconsistent cognitive outcomes, and possible selective reporting and publication.

Conclusion

Evidence does not support use of the studied pharmacologic treatments for cognitive protection in persons with normal cognition or MCI.

### Lipoprotein levels and statin treatment related to dementia and cognitive decline in individuals with type 2 diabetes: an observational analysis from the ADVANCE study [^51d29ce3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Studies on the association between lipid levels and lipid-lowering treatment and the risk of dementia and/or cognitive decline (CD) have shown conflicting results and are few in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim was to evaluate the relationship of baseline LDL cholesterol levels and statin treatment with the development of dementia/CD in patients with T2D from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation trial.

Methods

Dementia was diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and CD was defined as at least a 3-point decrement in the Mini Mental State Examination score. Exposures were baseline LDL cholesterol levels, statin treatment at baseline, and statin treatment initiation during the first 18 months of follow-up. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI for the composite of dementia/CD.

Results

Of 11,140 participants, 1827 (16.4%) developed dementia/CD over the 5-year follow up. The OR (95% CI) of dementia/CD were 1.06 (1.00–1.14) per standard deviation higher in baseline LDL cholesterol and 0.90 (0.79–1.03) for participants with vs without statin treatment.

Conclusion

We observed an association between LDL levels, but not statin treatment, and incident dementia/CD. Although causality cannot be determined by our study, the results are in line with multiple randomised controlled trials. However, to understand the long-term effects of lipid levels and statin treatment on dementia/CD, studies of longer follow-up are still needed.

### Statin initiation and dementia incidence in a large health care system from 1997 to 2020: a target trial emulation study [^8e9683c3]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We designed this study to allow follow-up of at least 10 years, resulting in follow-up periods beginning 2001–2010, and continuing through the end of 2020 at the latest. Initial statin prescriptions in the data during this time range were dominated by simvastatin (31.6%) and lovastatin (64.8%), and many people switched from 1 type of statin to another as different statin types were featured in the KPNC formulary over the study period. Different statin types or doses may have heterogeneous effects on AD/ADRD incidence. However, notable benefits of any particular type could only be consistent with the overall null association if offset by notable harms associated with another statin type.

AD, ADRD, and other dementia diagnoses in this analysis were based on clinical diagnoses by general and specialist practitioners as occurred in routine clinical care; most individuals with dementia diagnoses in KPNC are not referred for a specialist's neurologic evaluation. This may result in misclassification of the outcome, with some cases of AD or other specific dementias designated as nonspecific dementia and included with ADRD. However, pathologies underlying AD, vascular dementia, and other dementia subtypes are often co-occurring, symptoms of dementia subtypes are often overlapping and cannot be diagnosed unambiguously, and clinical assignment of dementia subtypes may not agree with autopsy findings. While misclassification may add noise, it is unlikely to bias the results unless the chance of covariate diagnosis or laboratory measurement is strongly influenced by prodromal dementia. Effects of prodromal dementia may be lessened in an integrated system such as KPNC.

Finally, while we did not model selective survival, differences in cumulative mortality between statin initiators and noninitiators were small. With this level of difference in mortality, there would have to be a very strong interaction with another determinant of dementia to introduce substantial bias.

AD/ADRD diagnoses increased transiently in the first year after statin initiation, likely attributable to factors other than statin use per se. After the first year, initiation of statins was not associated with AD/ADRD diagnoses in this large and diverse cohort over extended follow-up.

### Outcome age-based prediction of successful cognitive aging by total cholesterol [^ef13c215]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Some associations of high total cholesterol with dementia risk diminish as the outcome age-age at cognitive assessment-increases.

Methods

The Framingham Heart Study provided 1897 participants with intact cognition at entry. Cox regression analysis for incident marked cognitive decline included "time-dependent" coefficients, with associations between total cholesterol and covariates changing by outcome age. Decline within age categories of 75–84 and 85–94 years was also examined.

Results

Significant associations of rising total cholesterol linear slope, low entry age, low education, and statin nonuse with risk diminished significantly by outcome age. At 85–94 years, falling linear slope was significant.

Discussion

The protected survival model posits a minority subpopulation with protection against mortality and cognitive decline associated with total cholesterol risk factors. It predicts the observed diminished or reversed cholesterol associations with increasing age. Protection is particularly likely for successful cognitive aging-intact cognition at very old age-despite increased risk from cholesterol.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, statin therapy, AGS/NLA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating statin therapy in patients aged > 75 years without established ASCVD for ASCVD risk reduction, despite the potential for statin-associated muscle symptoms,

### Statin safety: an overview and assessment of the data – 2005 [^58be9f43]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statin drugs, have been studied in numerous controlled human research trials involving hundreds of thousands of study participants. Statins have been prescribed for millions of patients. Based on this vast research and clinical experience, statins have been shown to improve lipid blood levels and reduce atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, resulting in reduced CAD morbidity and mortality, and in several studies, reduced overall ("all-cause") mortality. From a safety perspective, both research trial evidence and clinical practice experience have demonstrated that statins are generally well tolerated. However, as with all pharmaceuticals, safety considerations exist with both monotherapy and combination statin therapy, mainly involving potential adverse effects on muscle, liver, kidney, and the nervous system. The evidence supporting statin-related potential adverse experiences on these organ systems is sometimes strong and based on clear clinical trial evidence (such as the increased risk of muscle enzyme elevation with higher statin doses). The evidence is at other times more speculative, being based on case reports and inconclusive clinical trial data (such as possible favorable or unfavorable effects of statins on cognition). Because the use of statins is so widespread, it is useful for the clinician to understand statin safety issues and the level of available evidence supporting the contention that various adverse effects are caused by statins. This review presents an assessment of statin safety based on an overview of the current statin safety data and their clinical implications.
