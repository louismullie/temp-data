## Question

can mannitol cause hypotension in a patient with less bp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mannitol can cause hypotension in a patient who already has low blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about mannitol's pharmacology and immediate hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify its diuretic properties and how those interact with volume status. Next, I will review guideline positions on hypotension and mannitol use. After that, I should examine clinical evidence for or against hypotension as an adverse effect. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and outline practical management and alternatives, especially in patients with preexisting low blood pressure.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and immediate hemodynamic effects. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that expands plasma volume transiently by drawing water from the intracellular and interstitial spaces into the vasculature, which can acutely increase preload and potentially raise blood pressure briefly, while also reducing blood viscosity and cerebral blood volume to lower ICP, with these effects beginning within minutes and peaking over roughly 15–30 minutes [^111Xyikw] [^116XCZ5v] [^113Rz2En].

> Wait, let me verify the diuretic phase and its consequences. Within about 15–30 minutes, mannitol's osmotic diuresis begins, increasing urine output and promoting intravascular volume loss. If this diuresis is not matched by fluid replacement, effective circulating volume declines and hypotension can be precipitated or worsened, particularly in patients who are already volume depleted or have impaired autonomic or vasoconstrictive responses [^113Q2biz] [^113Rz2En] [^111F8EJQ].

> I need to check guideline positions on hypotension and mannitol. Multiple high-credibility neurocritical care guidelines explicitly advise avoiding arterial hypotension in patients with intracranial hypertension and recommend restricting mannitol use in the setting of low blood pressure; specifically, the Brain Trauma Foundation advises avoiding SBP less than 90 mmHg and cautions that mannitol's eventual diuretic effect is undesirable in hypotensive patients, while the AHA/ASA notes mannitol can cause hypovolemia and hypotension and favors hypertonic saline in hypovolemia; the FDA contraindicates mannitol in severe hypovolemia, reinforcing the hemodynamic risk signal [^112t3g1q] [^116XCZ5v] [^114nHoDW] [^111F8EJQ] [^112xZpev].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review direct evidence for hypotension as an adverse effect. FDA labeling lists hypotension among adverse reactions, and meta-analytic data in TBI show mannitol did not significantly change MAP compared with hypertonic saline, suggesting that while MAP may be neutral on average, individual patients — especially those with low baseline BP — can experience clinically meaningful drops due to diuresis; importantly, in intradialytic settings, hypertonic mannitol has been used to mitigate hypotension, but that strategy targets osmotic plasma volume support and does not negate mannitol's intrinsic diuretic potential in other contexts [^115S4gPg] [^113a9kH4] [^112h8Kfj] [^1153jTnL].

> Let me consider the patient-specific risk in someone who already has low blood pressure. In hypovolemic or vasodilated states, the osmotic diuresis can outpace compensatory mechanisms, worsening effective hypovolemia and lowering MAP; elderly patients and those with renal impairment are at higher risk because delayed mannitol clearance prolongs the osmotic load and diuretic effect, and the FDA warns of fluid and electrolyte imbalances that can precipitate hypotension in these populations [^114UtZzt] [^113Q2biz].

> I should double-check the clinical implications for neurocritical care. In TBI and other cerebral edema states, hypotension reduces cerebral perfusion pressure and worsens secondary brain injury; guidelines therefore emphasize maintaining adequate SBP/MAP and often prefer hypertonic saline when volume status is tenuous, given its volume-expanding properties and minimal diuresis compared with mannitol, which is particularly relevant when baseline BP is low [^115en5fx] [^111F8EJQ] [^112t3g1q].

> But wait, what if mannitol is unavoidable? If mannitol must be used in a patient with borderline BP, I need to ensure strict hemodynamic monitoring and proactive volume replacement to offset the diuresis. Dosing should be conservative (commonly 0.25–1 g/kg as a bolus), with reassessment of volume status, urine output, electrolytes, and osmolarity after each dose, and consideration of switching to hypertonic saline if hypotension emerges or persists [^115en5fx] [^113Xa6a1] [^112t3g1q].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes, mannitol can cause or worsen hypotension in patients with low baseline blood pressure, primarily via osmotic diuresis leading to relative or absolute hypovolemia; guidelines and labeling advise caution or avoidance in hypotension, and when hypotension is present or likely, hypertonic saline is generally preferred to maintain intravascular volume while achieving osmotherapy goals [^115en5fx] [^111F8EJQ] [^112xZpev].

---

Mannitol can cause or worsen hypotension in patients with low blood pressure because its osmotic diuresis can precipitate **hypovolemia** and **electrolyte disturbances** [^113Q2biz], especially in those with pre-existing hypovolemia or impaired autoregulation [^112xZpev]. Clinicians should **monitor closely** and correct volume status before use; if hypotension occurs, stop mannitol and treat with fluids and vasopressors as needed [^113Xa6a1] [^112t3jeW]. Hypertonic saline is often preferred in hypovolemic or hypotensive patients because it expands plasma volume without causing diuresis [^111F8EJQ] [^114nHoDW] [^112L5ub4].

---

## Mechanisms of hypotension induced by mannitol

Mannitol lowers blood pressure via **two main mechanisms**:

- **Osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia**: Mannitol increases renal excretion of water and electrolytes, causing hypovolemia and reduced preload, which can precipitate hypotension — especially in patients with limited compensatory reserve [^113Q2biz] [^111Xyikw].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Mannitol-induced shifts in sodium, potassium, and calcium can impair vascular tone and cardiac function, contributing to hypotension [^113Q2biz] [^113Xa6a1].

---

## Clinical evidence of hypotension associated with mannitol

Several studies and guidelines document **hypotension with mannitol**:

- **Neurosurgical patients**: Mannitol is associated with hypotension, particularly in patients with pre-existing hypovolemia or impaired autoregulation [^111F8EJQ] [^116XCZ5v].

- **Dialysis patients**: Mannitol has been used to mitigate intradialytic hypotension, but its diuretic effect can also precipitate hypotension if not carefully managed [^112h8Kfj] [^111F8EJQ].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The Brain Trauma Foundation advises avoiding arterial hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) in patients receiving mannitol for intracranial hypertension [^115en5fx] [^115STnfU].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk of hypotension

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of mannitol-induced hypotension:

| **Patient population** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic brain injury patients | - Pre-existing hypovolemia <br/> - Impaired autoregulation <br/> - Sedation-related hypotension [^116XCZ5v] [^112byKcQ] |
| Dialysis patients | - Intradialytic hypotension <br/> - Rapid osmotic shifts <br/> - Volume depletion [^112h8Kfj] [^113e7HLw] |
| Elderly patients | - Reduced compensatory reserve <br/> - Comorbidities <br/> - Polypharmacy [^notfound] |
| Patients with renal impairment | - Prolonged mannitol half-life <br/> - Accumulation <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances [^111Xyikw] [^116u5VbU] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **careful patient selection and monitoring** when using mannitol:

- **Avoidance of hypotension**: Mannitol should be avoided or used with extreme caution in patients with pre-existing hypotension or hypovolemia [^116XCZ5v] [^112xZpev].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, fluid status, and electrolytes is essential during mannitol administration [^113Xa6a1] [^113Q2biz].

- **Alternative therapies**: Hypertonic saline is often preferred in hypovolemic or hypotensive patients because it expands plasma volume without causing diuresis [^111F8EJQ] [^114nHoDW].

---

## Clinical management of hypotension induced by mannitol

If hypotension occurs during mannitol administration, **immediate actions** include:

- **Stop mannitol infusion**: Discontinue mannitol immediately [^notfound].

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Administer isotonic fluids (e.g. normal saline) to restore intravascular volume [^112t3jeW].

- **Vasopressor support**: Use vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine) if hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation [^112t3jeW].

- **Correct electrolyte imbalances**: Address any electrolyte disturbances contributing to hypotension [^114e88FM].

---

## Comparison with alternative osmotic agents

Hypertonic saline is increasingly favored in patients at risk of hypotension because it **expands plasma volume** and does not cause diuresis, making it a safer alternative in hypovolemic or hypotensive patients [^111F8EJQ] [^1136VtEG].

---

Mannitol can cause or worsen hypotension in patients with low blood pressure, particularly due to its osmotic diuretic effect and electrolyte disturbances. Clinicians should **monitor closely**, correct volume status, and consider hypertonic saline in at-risk patients.

### PRO: osmotherapy for the treatment of acute intracranial hypertension [^114fN8vD]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Persisting severe brain edema causes intracranial hypertension and is associated with poor patient outcome. The treatment of acute intracranial hypertension is complex and multimodal. The most important options for medical treatment include controlled ventilation and osmotherapy, maintenance of brain and body homeostasis, and sedation. Osmotherapy is recommended in all relevant guidelines. The 2 osmotic agents most frequently used are mannitol and hypertonic saline. Both reduce intracranial pressure and improve cerebral perfusion and cerebral oxygen delivery. However, hypertonic saline seems advantageous over mannitol in many situations. In multitrauma patients, hypertonic saline contributes to hemodynamic stabilization and to the prevention of secondary insults. In addition, hypertonic saline has neurohumoral and immunologic effects, which may be beneficial in cerebral resuscitation.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^114e88FM]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury — goal-directed physiologic targets emphasize keeping parameters within normal physiologic ranges, with specific thresholds including intracranial pressure (ICP) 22 mm Hg as an initial treatment threshold with consideration of 20–25 mm Hg when risk/benefit is a concern, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) ≥ 60 mm Hg as a practical target, and partial brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2) ≥ 15 mm Hg if monitored; initial oxygenation targets include SpO2 ≥ 94% and PaO2 80–100 mm Hg while avoiding PaO2 > 100 mm Hg unless guided by brain oximetry; PaCO2 35–45 mm Hg and pH 7.35–7.45 are recommended in the absence of intracranial hypertension; when ICP is not monitored, treatment targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg/mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 80 mm Hg will allow adequate cerebral perfusion, and the probability of mortality increases linearly with every 10-point drop of SBP below 119 mm Hg; temperature management targets normothermia (36–37.9°C), electrolyte management emphasizes serum sodium 135–145 mEq/L with osmolality monitoring when mannitol is used, and these goals represent ideal ranges rather than mandatory, at-all-costs targets.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions associated with the use mannitol were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Most common adverse reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, renal failure, CNS toxicity, hypo/hypervolemia, hypo/hypernatremia, hypo/hyperkalemia, and infusion site reactions. (6)

### Management of low blood pressure in ambulatory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients [^113SzLF7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Low blood pressure is common in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). While spontaneous hypotension predicts risk in HFrEF, there is only limited evidence regarding the relationship between hypotension observed during heart failure (HF) drug titration and outcome. Nevertheless, hypotension (especially orthostatic hypotension) is an important factor limiting the titration of HFrEF treatments in routine practice. In patients with signs of shock and/or severe congestion, hospitalization is advised. However, in the very frequent cases of non‐severe and asymptomatic hypotension observed while taking drugs with a class I indication in HFrEF, European and US guidelines recommend maintaining the same drug dosage. In instances of symptomatic or severe persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg), it is recommended to first decrease blood pressure reducing drugs not indicated in HFrEF as well as the loop diuretic dose in the absence of associated signs of congestion. Unless the management of hypotension appears urgent, a HF specialist should then be sought rather than stopping or decreasing drugs with a class I indication in HFrEF. If symptoms or severe hypotension persist, no recommendations exist. Our HF group reviewed available evidence and proposes certain steps to follow in such situations in order to improve the pharmacological management of these patients.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^111NTGQT]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

This prospective randomized clinical study investigated the efficacy and safety of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 (7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5) in comparison with 15% mannitol in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

Methods

Forty neurosurgical patients at risk of increased ICP were randomized to receive either 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 or 15% mannitol at a defined infusion rate, which was stopped when ICP was < 15 mmHg.

Results

Of the 40 patients, 17 patients received 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and 15 received mannitol 15%. In eight patients, ICP did not exceed 20 mmHg so treatment was not necessary. Both drugs decreased ICP below 15 mmHg (p < 0.0001); 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 within 6.0 (1.2–15.0) min (all results are presented as median (minimum-maximum range)) and mannitol within 8.7 (4.2–19.9) min (p < 0.0002). 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 caused a greater decrease in ICP than mannitol (57% vs 48%; p < 0.01). The cerebral perfusion pressure was increased from 60 (39–78) mmHg to 72 (54–85) mmHg by infusion with 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 (p < 0.0001) and from 61 (47–71) mmHg to 70 (50–79) mmHg with mannitol (p < 0.0001). The mean arterial pressure was increased by 3.7% during the infusion of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 but was not altered by mannitol. There were no clinically relevant effects on electrolyte concentrations and osmolarity in the blood. The mean effective dose to achieve an ICP below 15 mmHg was 1.4 (0.3–3.1) ml/kg for 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and 1.8 (0.45–6.5) ml/kg for mannitol (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased ICP. A dose of 1.4 ml/kg of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 can be recommended as effective and safe. The advantage of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 might be explained by local osmotic effects, because there were no clinically relevant differences in hemodynamic clinical chemistry parameters.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^112J8ZEm]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — hyperosmolar therapy recommendations state: We suggest using either hypertonic sodium solutions or mannitol for the initial management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend either hypertonic saline or mannitol for improving neurological outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We suggest that clinicians consider administration of hypertonic sodium solutions for management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke who do not have an adequate response to mannitol (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest against the use of prophylactic scheduled mannitol in acute ischemic stroke due to the potential for harm (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Patient-specific factors may be employed to aid clinicians in selecting the appropriate initial agent in patients with either measured elevated ICP or symptoms of cerebral edema, and the literature in patients with AIS suggested that patients who do not have an adequate treatment response to mannitol may still respond to HTS.

Osmotherapy

Osmotherapy with mannitol is often applied in the acute phase of ICH to control the increased intracranial pressure. However, mannitol may have the possibility of aggregating haematoma expansion or perihaematomal oedema, because it may open the blood–brain barrier or reverse the osmotic concentration gradient between the oedematous brain and plasma. In a randomised controlled trial, 128 patients with ICH were treated either with mannitol or sham infusion in their early stage of hospitalisation, and the result showed no difference in one-month mortality and secondary outcome. The Cochrane systemic review, including two trials of mannitol for ICH, did not find significant differences in mortality and morbidity between treatment groups and controls. In those without significant intracranial hypertension or mass effect, mannitol should not be used but close monitoring should be applied.

For a patient with an increased ICP, elevating the head to 30 degrees, giving 1.0–1.5 g/kg of 20% mannitol by a rapid infusion, and hyperventilating the patient to a pCO 2 of 28–32 mmHg are the usual management protocols. Hypertonic saline is an alternative choice for decreasing intracranial pressure. Wagner et al. treated ICH patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia/thalamic bleeding with continuous hypertonic saline infusion within 72 h, and the relative oedema volume and the occurrence of intracranial pressure crisis had significantly decreased.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^112hBBmo]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Mannitol or hypertonic saline for acute major traumatic brain injury — Red Cross Guidelines state that mannitol or hypertonic saline may be given to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have a monitored elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), signs of transtentorial herniation prior to ICP monitoring, or progressive neurological deterioration not due to extracranial causes. Mannitol is effective for control of raised ICP at doses of 0.25 to 1 gram per kilogram (kg) of body weight (0.25 g/kg to 1 g/kg). Arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) should be avoided in patients with intracranial hypertension. For pediatric patients with major TBI and acute intracranial hypertension, hypertonic saline is preferred over mannitol to lower the ICP to less than 20 mmHg. A bolus of hypertonic saline (3%) is recommended at a dose between 2 and 5 milliliters (ml) per kilogram of body weight (2 ml/kg to 5 ml/kg) over 10 to 20 minutes. A continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is suggested at a rate between 0.1 mL/kg and 1.0 ml/kg per hour, and the minimum dose needed to maintain ICP less than 20 mmHg is suggested. A bolus of 23.4% hypertonic saline is suggested for refractory ICP; the suggested dose is 0.5 ml/kg with a maximum of 30 ml. A serum sodium level of greater than 170 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) for a sustained period (greater than 72 hours) should be avoided, and a sustained serum sodium greater than 160 mEq/L should be avoided.

From a pragmatic standpoint, the impact of hypotension must be assessed according to the vintage of treatment introduction: if hypotension occurs a few days after increasing the treatment dose, it is likely that treatment is the cause of hypotension. In contrast, when doses have been stable over a long period, other causes of hypotension should always be investigated (fever, diarrhoea, other new drugs, dehydration, etc.) rather than systematically and permanently decreasing treatment dose.

Key messages

- 	7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol in the treatment of increased ICP

- 	A dose of 1.4 ml/kg 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 can be recommended as an initial dose

- 	The local dehydration of brain tissue after application of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 seems to be the primary mechanism for the improved CPP

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^113zQr7Z]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury — hyperosmolar therapy evidence and implications: The ADAPT trial is described as the first to compare a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline with mannitol in this population and reported a modest decrease in intracranial pressure (ICP) and increase in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with hypertonic saline and increased CPP with mannitol; a Cochrane review also noted improved outcomes of ICP reduction with hypertonic saline, while long-term outcomes are lacking except that mortality was not shown to be improved with hypertonic saline compared with mannitol. Safety considerations include that the hyperosmolar state induced by hypertonic saline can be associated with a higher risk of kidney injury, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and, after repeated doses, hyperchloremic acidosis, and mannitol was associated with acute tubular necrosis in one included study. Hypertonic saline may thus be more appropriate in patients with decreased renal perfusion, but additional controlled trials comparing hypertonic saline with mannitol are needed to determine efficacy for lowering ICP, short- and long-term neurologic and survival outcomes, and adverse effects or limitations. The most recent (2019) Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines were used to inform the Red Cross guidelines related to the use of hypertonic saline in pediatric severe TBI and for avoiding complications related to hypernatremia.

Mannitol in pediatric traumatic brain injury — mechanisms, timing, and renal risk are described as follows: "Mannitol can reduce ICP by two distinct mechanisms", including an immediate blood viscosity effect whose impact on viscosity "is transient (< 75 min)", and an osmotic effect that "develops more slowly (over 15–30 min)" with an effect that "persists up to 6 hours and requires an intact blood-brain barrier". Accumulation in injured regions may lead to a reverse osmotic shift "possibly increasing ICP", particularly "when mannitol is used for extended periods of time". A renal risk threshold noted in adults is that risk has been "suggested… when serum osmolarity levels greater than 320 mOsm in adults".

### Mannitol in critical care and surgery over 50 + years: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and complications with meta-analysis [^113a9kH4]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite clinical use spanning 50+ years, questions remain concerning the optimal use of mannitol. The published reviews with meta-analysis frequently focused on mannitol's effects on a specific physiological aspect such as intracranial pressure (ICP) in sometimes heterogeneous patient populations. A comprehensive review of mannitol's effects, as well as side effects, is needed.

Methods

The databases Medline (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and NLM PubMed were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mannitol to a control therapy in either the critical care or perioperative setting. Meta-analysis was performed when feasible to examine mannitol's effects on outcomes, including ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), brain relaxation, fluid intake, urine output, and serum sodium. Systematic literature search was also performed to understand mannitol-related complications.

Results

In total 55 RCTs were identified and 7 meta-analyses were performed. In traumatic brain injury, mannitol did not lead to significantly different MAP (SMD [95% confidence interval (CI)] = -3.3 [-7.9, 1.3] mmHg; P = 0.16) but caused significantly different serum sodium concentrations (SMD [95% CI] = -8.0 [-11.0, -4.9]mmol/L; P < 0.00001) compared with hypertonic saline. In elective craniotomy, mannitol was less likely to lead to satisfactory brain relaxation (RR [95% CI] = 0.89 [0.81, 0.98]; P = 0.02), but was associated with increased fluid intake (SMD [95% CI] = 0.67 [0.21, 1.13]L; P = 0.004), increased urine output (SMD [95% CI] = 485 [211, 759]mL; P = 0.0005), decreased serum sodium concentration (SMD [95% CI] = -6.2 [-9.6, -2.9]mmol/L; P = 0.0002), and a slightly higher MAP (SMD [95% CI] = 3.3 [0.08, 6.5]mmHg; P = 0.04) compared with hypertonic saline. Mannitol could lead to complications in different organ systems, most often including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. These complications appeared dose dependent and had no long-term consequences.

Conclusions

Mannitol is effective in accomplishing short-term clinical goals, although hypertonic saline is associated with improved brain relaxation during craniotomy. Mannitol has a favorable safety profile although it can cause electrolyte abnormality and renal impairment. More research is needed to determine its impacts on long-term outcomes.

Severe traumatic brain injury — Class 3 evidence regarding mannitol and hypertonic saline is outlined, noting that of the three Class 3 studies maintained from the 3rd Edition, one compared hypertonic saline (2% to 3%) to normal saline (0.9%), one compared hypertonic saline to lactated ringers, and one compared mannitol to barbiturates, and because these are single, Class 3 studies, they were not used to support a recommendation. The additional studies from the 3rd Edition supporting Level III recommendations were descriptive, non-comparative studies that provided a basic understanding of mechanisms and effects of mannitol but did not provide definitive evidence about comparative effectiveness or different regimens of administration, and as these studies were not comparative, they were not included in this edition.

Severe traumatic brain injury — retrospective database comparison of hypertonic saline (HTS) versus mannitol indicates that HTS may be more effective than mannitol in lowering intracranial pressure (ICP) with no difference in short-term mortality. Adults over 16 years admitted between June 6, 2000, and August 21, 2008, who stayed at least 5 days were included, with exact matching on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hypotension, and pupil reactivity; matching resulted in inclusion of 24 patients who were given HTS compared with 48 who were given mannitol. In the 1:1 matched analysis, mortality at 2 weeks was not significantly different (common odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.51, p = 0.56). Intensive care unit (ICU) stays were shorter for the HTS group but the difference was not significant in the 2:1 comparison, and the number of days ICP was recorded did not differ between groups. Cumulative ICP burden was significantly lower with HTS (15.2 ± 19.9% vs. 36.5 ± 30.9%, p = 0.003), and daily ICP burden was also significantly lower (0.3 ± 0.6 vs. 1.3 ± 1.3 hours/day, p = 0.001).

### Medical management of cerebral edema [^116g8AHx]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema is frequently encountered in clinical practice in critically ill patients with acute brain injury from diverse origins and is a major cause of increased morbidity and death in this subset of patients. The consequences of cerebral edema can be lethal and include cerebral ischemia from compromised regional or global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial compartmental shifts due to intracranial pressure gradients that result in compression of vital brain structures. The overall goal of medical management of cerebral edema is to maintain regional and global CBF to meet the metabolic requirements of the brain and prevent secondary neuronal injury from cerebral ischemia. Medical management of cerebral edema involves using a systematic and algorithmic approach, from general measures (optimal head and neck positioning for facilitating intracranial venous outflow, avoidance of dehydration and systemic hypotension, and maintenance of normothermia) to specific therapeutic interventions (controlled hyperventilation, administration of corticosteroids and diuretics, osmotherapy, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression). This article reviews and highlights the medical management of cerebral edema based on pathophysiological principles in acute brain injury.

### Mannitol increases renal blood flow and maintains filtration fraction and oxygenation in postoperative acute kidney injury: a prospective interventional study [^115ZvTJz]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates 15% to 30% of cardiac surgeries and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Even minor changes in serum creatinine are associated with increased inpatient mortality. Impaired renal oxygen delivery, caused by intraoperative hypotension and hemodilution-induced anemia and postoperative low cardiac output, is considered to be the cause of postoperative AKI in this group of patients. The renal medulla is at the border of hypoxia under normal conditions, due to the concentration mechanism, and therefore particularly sensitive to ischemia.

It was recently shown that renal oxygenation (renal oxygen supply/demand relation) is severely impaired in patients with early AKI after complicated cardiac surgery, in turn, caused by a 50% increase in renal vascular resistance, compared with uncomplicated postcardiac-surgery patients. From experimental studies, it has been suggested that renal vasoconstriction in AKI is caused by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction mediated by the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, vasoconstrictors (catecholamines, angiotensin II, endothelin), and outer medullary congestion. Furthermore, it has been ascribed to ischemic endothelial cell injury, causing an imbalance in the production of endothelin and endothelial nitric oxide, or to angiotensin II-induced activation of reactive oxygen species that inactivates NO. Finally, it has been suggested that outer medullary hypoxia may cause endothelial ischemic injury and cell swelling, contributing to congestion and impaired perfusion of this region. It would therefore be logical that interventions that alleviate this afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction would be beneficial, as they could potentially increase RBF and GFR.

Oliguria is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with AKI, and diuretic agents are frequently used to improve urine output and to facilitate fluid management in these patients. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, has been used in the belief that it exerts renoprotective properties in patients undergoing surgery. However, results from studies in which mannitol has been evaluated in the perioperative setting, for prevention or treatment of AKI, are divergent. Although mannitol has failed to show a prophylactic effect in patients undergoing abdominal aortic or cardiac surgery, mannitol has been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI in the setting of renal transplantation, along with volume expansion. Furthermore, mannitol treatment has been shown to increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients after severe trauma or surgery. In addition, our group recently showed that mannitol increases GFR in postoperative cardiac surgery patients, possibly by a deswelling effect on tubular cells.

Intracranial aneurysm — management of intraoperative rupture (IAR) during neurosurgery emphasizes optimizing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), ventilation, and venous drainage while maintaining the transmural pressure gradient (TMPG); excessive hyperventilation should be avoided and an external ventricular drain (EVD) should not be opened. Osmotherapy can be used to decrease brain edema with mannitol 0.25 to 1 g/kg or 3% hypertonic saline with a sodium goal of 145 to 155 mEq/L. For bleeding control and visualization, induced hypotension with mean arterial pressure 50 to 60 mm Hg can be used; temporary flow arrest with adenosine 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg may provide a brief period of profound systemic hypotension. Burst-suppression to reduce cerebral metabolic rate can be achieved with propofol bolus 50 to 100 mg and infusion to > 125 mcg/kg/min. After clip placement, volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid and/or red blood cells should target a goal hemoglobin > 8 g/dL, and reversal of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy may be required if IAR occurs.

Anesthetic osmotherapy in aSAH — Both mannitol and hypertonic saline have been used to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain relaxation, but mannitol is a potent diuretic that can cause hypovolemia and hypotension whereas hypertonic saline increases blood sodium, has minimal effect on diuresis, and can increase BP; a clinical trial to evaluate the optimal intraoperative dose of mannitol in patients with aSAH is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01453456), and currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend one therapy over the other or to affirm whether outcomes are affected.

### Mannitol increases renal blood flow and maintains filtration fraction and oxygenation in postoperative acute kidney injury: a prospective interventional study [^116kA2G4]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of the present study on cardiac surgery patients with postoperative early AKI were that mannitol induced a renal vasodilatation and increased RBF with no changes in filtration fraction or the renal oxygen supply/demand relation, as assessed by the lack of effect on RO 2 Ex.

To our knowledge, no previous studies exist on the effects of mannitol on renal perfusion, filtration, and oxygenation in patients with AKI. In most animal studies, it has been shown that mannitol increases RBF by renal vasodilation during both normotensive and hypotensive conditions. Data on the effects of mannitol on RBF in humans, however, are scarce. With the xenon 133 washout technique, Castaneda-Zuniga et al. studied the effects of mannitol (20%) infusion on RBF in humans and demonstrated only a minimal increase in RBF. With the same methods as in the present study, Kurnik et al. studied the effect of mannitol (15%) on RBF in patients with moderate chronic renal failure and found that mannitol did not affect RBF. Those results are supported by a study, recently published by our group, demonstrating no effect of mannitol on RBF, in postoperative uncomplicated cardiac surgery patients with normal renal function.

What are the mechanisms behind the mannitol-induced decrease in RVR in early clinical, ischemic AKI, as demonstrated in the present study? It has been suggested that the mannitol-induced renal vasodilatory response to experimental renal ischemia is mediated directly by increased synthesis of prostacyclin, or indirectly by augmenting plasma levels of ANP because of the plasma volume expansion. In the present study, plasma volume expansion with mannitol was not large enough to cause increased cardiac filling pressures at the time of RBF measurements. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that mannitol bolus plus infusion induced a transient increase in cardiac filling pressures and distention, causing a release of natriuretic peptides. In our previous study in postoperative uncomplicated cardiac patients with normal renal function, by using an identical protocol, we found that mannitol did not affect RBF, suggesting that mannitol-induced plasma volume expansion and the consequent cardiac release of renal vasodilatory cardiac peptides is not the main mechanism behind the renal vasodilation, as demonstrated in the present study.

### Mannitol [^117EGyfB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma, has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with pre-existing compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of Mannitol Injection must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

### Mannitol [^116u5VbU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concomitant administration of neurotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) with Mannitol Injection may potentiate neurotoxicity. Avoid concomitant use of neurotoxic drugs, if possible [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3)].

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if CNS toxicity develops [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.4 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity

Depending on dosage and duration, administration of Mannitol Injection may result in hypervolemia leading to or exacerbating existing congestive heart failure. Accumulation of mannitol due to insufficient renal excretion increases the risk of hypervolemia. Mannitol-induced osmotic diuresis may cause or worsen dehydration/hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Administration of Mannitol Injection may also cause hyperosmolarity [see DESCRIPTION (11)].

Depending on dosage and duration of administration, electrolyte and acid/base imbalances may also result from transcellular shifts in water and electrolytes, osmotic diuresis, and/or other mechanisms. Such imbalances may be severe and potentially fatal.

Imbalances that may result from administration of Mannitol Injection include:

Hypernatremia, dehydration, and hemoconcentration
Hyponatremia, which can lead to headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, coma, cerebral edema, and death. Acute symptomatic hyponatremic encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency.
Hypo/hyperkalemia. The development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) associated with mannitol administration may result in cardiac adverse reactions in patients receiving drugs that are sensitive to such imbalances (e.g., digoxin, agents that may cause QT prolongation, neuromuscular blocking agents) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)].
Other electrolyte disturbances
Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis
Pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following administration of Mannitol Injection due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)].
During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor fluid and electrolyte status and discontinue Mannitol Injection if imbalances occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116XCZ5v]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar therapy — mechanisms and agent-specific considerations note that mannitol and hypertonic saline are routinely employed hyperosmolar agents in North America, that hypertonic saline administration may be hazardous for a hyponatremic patient, and that although mannitol can be used as a resuscitation fluid, its eventual diuretic effect is undesirable in hypotensive patients and attention needs to be paid to replacing intravascular volume loss; both mannitol and hypertonic saline work to reduce intracranial pressure, at least in part, through reducing blood viscosity, leading to improved microcirculatory flow of blood constituents and consequent constriction of the pial arterioles, resulting in decreased cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Mannitol, when administered intravenously, exerts its osmotic diuretic effect as a solute of relatively small molecular size largely confined to the extracellular space. Mannitol hinders tubular reabsorption of water and enhances excretion of sodium and chloride by elevating the osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate.

This increase in extracellular osmolarity affected by the intravenous administration of mannitol will induce the movement of intracellular water to the extracellular and vascular spaces. This action underlies the role of mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure, intracranial edema, and intraocular pressure.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Mannitol distributes largely to the extracellular space within 20 to 40 minutes after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution of mannitol is approximately 17 L in adults.

Elimination

In subjects with normal renal function, the total clearance is 87 to 109 mL/minute. The elimination half-life of mannitol is 0.5 to 2.5 hours

Metabolism

Only a relatively small amount of the mannitol dose is metabolized after intravenous administration to healthy subjects.

Excretion

Mannitol is eliminated primarily via the kidneys in unchanged form. Mannitol is filtered by the glomeruli, exhibits less than 10% of tubular reabsorption, and is not secreted by tubular cells. Following intravenous administration, approximately 80% of an administered dose of mannitol is estimated to be excreted in the urine in 3 hours with lesser amounts thereafter.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, the elimination half-life of mannitol is prolonged. In a published study, in patients with renal impairment including acute renal failure and end stage renal failure, the elimination half-life of mannitol was estimated at about 36 hours, based on serum osmolarity. In patients with renal impairment on dialysis, the elimination half-life of mannitol was reduced to 6 and 21 hours during hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6), OVERDOSAGE (10)].

Treating nOH — step 2: non-pharmacological measures

The next step in the treatment algorithm is to have the patient incorporate a number of simple non-pharmacological measures into their daily routines to address symptoms due to nOH. From a practical perspective, these measures are often incorporated into a treatment plan in parallel to the changes to pharmacology outlined in step 1 above. For patients who are experiencing syncope, near-syncope, or falls, there is some urgency to eliminating destabilizing postural changes. Hence, non-pharmacologic measures may be used individually, but are most effective when used in combination or while concomitantly titrating pharmacologic treatments.

Blood volume repletion

Patients with nOH require interventions which are aimed at ensuring normal or even expanded blood volume. Many patients with nOH, especially older patients, are often blood volume depleted due to inadequate oral fluid intake. This may be due to voluntary restriction of intake for self-management of common conditions causing urinary urgency and urinary frequency including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), overactive bladder, neurogenic bladder, stress incontinence or similar bladder dysfunctions as are commonly seen in many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the most common identifiable and readily treatable problem is decreased daily water intake. Most patients are unaware of the volume of water intake necessary during a typical day. A minimum of 64 oz (approximately 2 L) of water daily is recommended to achieve adequate daily hydration, although many clinicians recommend over 100 oz (3 L) daily to ensure blood volume repletion, depending on cardiac status. Modifications in fluid volume recommendations also need to be considered in geographic areas with warmer weather or during the summer season.

In addition to maintaining intravascular blood volume and to support standing blood pressure, patients with nOH who rapidly consume (within 5 min) 16 oz (approximately 500 ml) of free water can raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mmHg within 5 min. The effect is due to a hypo-osmolar reflex in the portal circulation and can last for an hour to help alleviate the symptoms of nOH experienced on standing. Liquids other than water do not provide the same blood pressure response. Thus, proper hydration can produce both acute and long-lasting significant clinical benefits to patients with nOH.

5 WARNINGS

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, hypotension, and dyspnea resulting in cardiac arrest and death have been reported with Mannitol Injection [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)]. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a suspected hypersensitivity reaction develop. Initiate appropriate therapeutic countermeasures as clinically indicated.

5.2 Renal Complications Including Renal Failure

Renal complications, including irreversible renal failure, have been reported in patients receiving mannitol.

Reversible, oliguric acute kidney injury has occurred in patients with normal pretreatment renal function who received large intravenous doses of mannitol. Although the osmotic nephrosis associated with mannitol administration is in principle reversible, osmotic nephrosis in general is known to potentially proceed chronic or even end-stage renal failure. Monitor renal function closely, including signs of urine output reduction, during mannitol injection.

Patients with pre-existing renal disease, patients with conditions that put them at risk for renal failure, or those receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics, are at increased risk for renal failure following administration of Mannitol Injection. Avoid concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) or other diuretics with Mannitol Injection, if possible [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

Patients with oliguric acute kidney injury who subsequently develop anuria while receiving mannitol are at risk of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, hypertensive crisis, coma, and death.

### A randomized trial of albumin infusion to prevent intradialytic hypotension in hospitalized hypoalbuminemic patients [^113m6hwa]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the use of diuretics, fluid overload (> 10% change in body weight from admission) is commonly encountered in hospitalized patients. The amount and duration of fluid overload is a major independent risk factor for adverse outcomes including mortality, reduced renal recovery, and resource utilization. Avoidance of fluid accumulation and early mobilization of fluid are now the main therapeutic goals for these patients and often portend a need for dialysis initiation. Unfortunately, fluid mobilization and removal with intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) are often difficult, particularly in patients with severe AKI/ESKD and multi-organ failure due to intradialytic development hypotension (IDH). IDH complicates 17–70% of acute hemodialysis (HD) sessions in the ICU and in as much as 50% in the inpatient setting. It decreases renal replacement therapy's efficacy, delays function recovery, and organ failure reversal.

During ultrafiltration, the plasma refilling rate is dependent on colloid osmotic pressure. Consequently, volume expanders, including mannitol, albumin, hypertonic, and 0.9% sodium chloride, dextran, and hydroxyethyl starch have been used to manage IDH in chronic outpatient HD with the varying results. In hypoalbuminemic patients, albumin's infusion would be expected to increase colloid osmotic pressure and thus enhance plasma refilling to improve fluid mobilization and reduce IDH. This study evaluated the efficacy of albumin infusion in preventing intradialytic hypotension during HD in hospitalized patients. We hypothesized that the concurrent use of intravenous albumin during dialysis would result in higher quantities of fluid removal per unit time and be associated with a reduced incidence of IDH.

### Dose-response relationship of mannitol and intracranial pressure: a metaanalysis [^115K9yEy]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Brain edema can increase intracranial pressure (ICP), potentially leading to ischemia, herniation, and death. Edema and elevated ICP are often treated with osmotic agents to remove water from brain tissue. Mannitol is the osmotic diuretic most commonly used in the intensive care unit; however, despite its clinical importance, treatment protocols vary from center to center, and the dose-response relationship is not understood. The goal of this metaanalysis was to aggregate and analyze data from studies in which authors have described the dose-response relationship between mannitol and ICP.

Methods

The authors identified 18 studies that quantitatively characterized the dose-response relationship of mannitol and ICP. We also examined study designs and mannitol administration protocols.

Results

Meta-regression found a weak linear relationship between change in ICP (delta ICP) and dose (delta ICP = 6.6 × dose − 1.1; p = 0.27, R² = 0.05). The lack of statistical significance could reflect the variation in protocols among studies and the variation in patients both within and among studies. However, the authors found a highly significant difference (p < 0.001) in decrease in ICP when the initial ICP was higher or lower than 30 mm Hg. Nonlinear regression suggested that ICP decrease is greatest shortly after mannitol is given (R² = 0.63). Finally, the authors found that recent studies tend to include fewer patients and set a lower ICP threshold for mannitol administration but report more parameters of interest; the duration of mannitol's effect was the most frequently unreported parameter.

Conclusions

Despite its clinical importance, the determination of the mannitol dose-response curve continues to be challenging for many reasons. This metaanalysis highlights the need for a consensus of methods and results required to determine this important relationship.

### How I manage intracranial hypertension [^112byKcQ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

How I manage intracranial hypertension

Figure 1 summarises the algorithm that I use in clinical practice. Before starting any ICP-directed therapies, I try to correct any reversible cause and systemic abnormality affecting intracranial volumes and causing raised ICP (see Additional file 1). I always consider the surgical option with a neurosurgeon; mass-occupying space should be promptly evacuated when indications are met, and hydrocephalus should be drained.

Fig. 1
Summary of the available ICP-directed therapies. Before starting an HICP-directed therapy, I consider removing confounders (summarised in ESM as malfunctioning of ICP monitoring devices, pneumothorax, hypoxia, hypercapnia, pain, hypo/hypertension, hyperpyrexia, seizures, hypo-osmolality). These factors need to be corrected early with specific therapeutical manoeuvres. In all TBI patients, I consider always obtaining an early neurosurgical opinion on surgery for intracranial mass lesions and if the patient presents a clinical or imaging neuroworsening. I will escalate TIL (therapy intensity level) accordingly to the ICP response. The progression I use is summarised in the TILs described below. The therapies with a * are short lasting. TIL 1 — Basic. If ICP is > 20–22 mmHg, consider head-up positioning (15–30°), sedation and analgesia: propofol 4–6 mg/kg/h, opioids: fentanyl 1–4 mcg/kg/h), mild hypocapnia* (PaCO 2 = 35 mmHg), normothermia and antiepileptics (if the patents has seizures or non-convulsive status). Maintain CPP 50–70 mmHg according to autoregulatory status. The risks and level of evidence for these therapies are low but this bundle is effective in many patients for controlling ICP. TIL 2 — Mild. If ICP is > 20–25 mmHg with TIL-1 therapies, I consider the following: increasing sedation (side effect: hypotension and need of vasoactive drugs), CSF drainage* inserting external ventricular drainage (side effect: infections, hematoma), osmotherapy* (mannitol and/or hypertonic saline. Maintain a euvolemic status) and mild hypocapnia*. Maintaining CPP 50–70 mmHg according to autoregulatory status. If pressure autoregulation is preserved, higher CPP (around 70 mmHg) is tolerated and might reduce ICP maintaining cerebral blood flow. If pressure autoregulation is not preserved, higher CPP increases cerebral blood volumes and, consequentially, ICP TIL 3 — Moderate. If ICP remains > 20–25 mmHg with TIL-2 therapies, I use higher doses of osmotic* (limits: natremia < 155 mEq, Osm 320), profound hypocapnia* with a brain oxygen monitor. CPP 50–70 mmHg according to autoregulatory status. Consider repeating a CT scan. TIL 4 — Extreme. If ICP persists > 25 mmHg, refractory to TIL-3 therapies, consider before using extreme therapies the prognosis of the patient, the best outcome that might be obtained and the patient's wills and inform the patient's family. Use barbiturates for "buying time" while discussing the utility of decompressive craniectomy. Evaluate DC soon when TIL 3 therapies have failed. I am using moderate hypothermia only in selected cases. See text for details. A continuous check of the efficacy of the therapies needs to be implemented and, if ICP is controlled, consider moving backwards in the flowchart, deescalating ICP lowering as soon as possible

Effects of intravenous infusions of 20 mL of 10% saline, 20 mL of 50% glucose, 200 mL of 0.9% saline, or physiological doses of AVP were examined during intradialytic hypotension.

Outcomes & Measurements

Changes in plasma AVP levels, osmolality, plasma volume, and blood pressure were analyzed.

Results

Hypertonic saline infusion increased plasma osmolality (mean, 292.7 to 302.3 mOsm/kg H(2)O; P < 0.001), plasma AVP levels (3.9 to 7.8 pg/mL; P = 0.03), and mean arterial pressure (66.6 to 71.8 mm Hg; P = 0.01). The increase in plasma volume (2.3%; P = 0.03) was too small to increase blood pressure because of volume alone. Hypertonic glucose infusion yielded similar results. Isotonic saline infusion increased blood pressure with an abrupt increase in plasma volume (12.7%; P < 0.001). AVP infusion increased blood pressure and plasma AVP to levels similar to those induced by the hypertonic solutions.

Limitations

There are limitations in accurately measuring changes in plasma volume during hemodialysis.

Conclusions

Results strongly suggest that the osmotic stimulation of AVP secretion by hypertonic solutions has an important role in increasing blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypotension. Manipulating plasma AVP appropriately may help correct and prevent intradialytic hypotension.

### Mannitol increases renal blood flow and maintains filtration fraction and oxygenation in postoperative acute kidney injury: a prospective interventional study [^114vTSET]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Experimental studies have shown that renal ischemia causes endothelial cell injury and dysfunction followed by endothelial cell edema. Flores et al. showed in an animal study that ischemia-induced endothelial cell swelling can be reversed and prevented by mannitol. They suggested that the failure of blood flow to return to the kidney after transient ischemia, the so-called "no reflow" phenomenon, was due to swollen endothelial cells, and that the no-reflow could be corrected by mannitol. Based on those experimental studies, one could therefore speculate that mannitol might exert its beneficial effect on renal perfusion in patients with AKI by a deswelling effect on injured endothelial cells.

Data on the effects of mannitol on the GFR are divergent. In animal studies, mannitol has been shown to decrease, increase, or to have no effect on the GFR. In hypoperfused animal kidneys, mannitol infusion tends to restore the GFR toward normal levels, when given both before and after the induction of hypotension. Flores et al. suggested that mannitol maintains the GFR in renal ischemia primarily by an osmotic effect that reduces vascular endothelial cell swelling, which would reduce RVR and increase RBF. A study on healthy human volunteers showed no effect of mannitol on GFR, whereas mannitol increased creatinine clearance in patients with severe trauma/surgery, as shown in a study by Valdes et al. In a recent study on uncomplicated postcardiac-surgery patients with normal renal function, by using a protocol identical to that in the present study, we showed that mannitol induced a 20% increase in GFR and filtration fraction with no change in RBF. Those findings were interpreted as deswelling effect on tubular cells, subjected to intraoperative hypotensive episodes, and recruitment of functional nephrons that are opened up by mannitol, which will increase tubular flow and restore GFR. In the present study, mannitol tended to increase GFR (16%), but the increase in GFR did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.16). This study was powered to detect a 20% increase in GFR, based on our previous study. In a post hoc power analysis, we found that the sample size would have to be increased to 30 patients to detect a 16% increase in GFR, in the present study, at a power of 0.8. The fact that filtration fraction was not altered with mannitol, however, suggests that GFR increased in proportion to the increase in renal plasma flow in the present study. If mannitol affected only RBF, one would have expected a decrease in the filtration fraction, which was seen in similar group of patients receiving low-dose dopamine, which was found to increase RBF with no effects on the GFR. Thus, we suggest that mannitol treatment in early AKI results in both vascular endothelial and tubular epithelial deswelling, which will improve both renal perfusion and filtration

### Preservation of blood pressure stability with hypertonic mannitol during hemodialysis initiation [^1153jTnL]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intradialytic hypotensive events are common among hemodialysis patients and are associated with a variety of patient- and procedure-related factors, including intradialytic decline in plasma osmolality. Prior studies and practice have suggested that administration of osmotically active drugs may ameliorate blood pressure decline during chronic hemodialysis.

Methods

Clinical and treatment data were collected for 102 consecutive patients requiring initiation of renal replacement therapy in 2 major teaching hospitals. Routine administration of mannitol differed according to institutional protocols, allowing its examination as the primary exposure of interest. Generalized linear models were fit to estimate associations of mannitol use during dialysis initiation with intradialytic blood pressure, as assessed by: (1) intradialytic blood pressure decline; (2) nadir intradialytic blood pressure; (3) absolute systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or decline > 20 mm Hg.

Results

Mean age was 62 years (± 16), 70% were male and 44% were diabetic. Mean predialysis and nadir systolic blood pressure were 142 mm Hg (± 29) and 121 mm Hg (± 26), respectively. Mannitol administration was associated with a lesser decline in intradialytic blood pressure, a higher nadir blood pressure and fewer hypotensive events requiring intervention. No effect modification was evident according to diabetes or acuity of kidney disease (chronic vs. acute).

Conclusions

Mannitol administration appears to preserve hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis initiation. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and identify optimal management strategies to prevent intradialytic hypotension.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Prior to administration of OSMITROL, evaluate renal, cardiac and pulmonary status of the patient and correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

The total dosage, concentration, and rate of administration depend on the age, weight, and condition of the patient being treated, including fluid requirement, electrolyte balance, serum osmolality, urinary output, and concomitant therapy.

The following outline of administration and dosage is only a general guide to therapy.

Reduction of Intracranial Pressure Usually a maximum reduction in intracranial pressure can be achieved with a dose of 0.25 gram/kg given intravenously as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes which may be repeated every six to eight hours.

During and following OSMITROL infusion, monitor fluid and electrolytes, serum osmolarity, and renal, cardiac and pulmonary function. Discontinue OSMITROL if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5)].

Reduction of Intraocular Pressure

The recommended dosage is 1.5 to 2 grams/kg of a 20% w/v solution (7.5 to 10 mL/kg) or as a 15% w/v solution (10 to 13 mL/kg) as a single dose administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. When used preoperatively, administer OSMITROL sixty to ninety minutes before surgery to achieve maximal reduction of intraocular pressure before operation.

### Hyperosmolar agents in neurosurgical practice: the evolving role of hypertonic saline [^117D3Aaj]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Medical management of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a critical component of perioperative care in neurosurgical practice. Traumatic brain injury, arterial infarction, venous hypertension/infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, tumor progression, and postoperative edema can all generate clinical situations in which ICP management is a critical determinant of patient outcomes. Although osmotic agents are among the most fundamental tools to control ICP, prospective data to establish clear guidelines on their use are lacking. Hypertonic saline is emerging as an alternative to mannitol. Early data suggest that indications for each agent may ultimately depend on ICP etiology.

5.4 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity

Depending on dosage and duration, administration of OSMITROL may result in hypervolemia leading to or exacerbating existing congestive heart failure. Accumulation of mannitol due to insufficient renal excretion increases the risk of hypervolemia. Mannitol-induced osmotic diuresis may cause or worsen dehydration/hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Administration of OSMITROL may also cause hyperosmolarity [see Description (11)].

Depending on dosage and duration of administration, electrolyte and acid/base imbalances may also result from transcellular shifts in water and electrolytes, osmotic diuresis and/or other mechanisms. Such imbalances may be severe and potentially fatal.

Imbalances that may result from OSMITROL administration include:

Hypernatremia, dehydration and hemoconcentration
Hyponatremia, which can lead to headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, coma, cerebral edema, and death. Acute symptomatic hyponatremic encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency.
Hypo/hyperkalemia. The development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) associated with mannitol administration may result in cardiac adverse reactions in patients receiving drugs that are sensitive to such imbalances (e.g., digoxin, agents that may cause QT prolongation, neuromuscular blocking agents) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].
Other electrolyte disturbances
Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis

Pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following OSMITROL administration due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor fluid and electrolyte status and discontinue OSMITROL if imbalances occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

5.5 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor:

serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate) and acid base balance,
the osmol gap
signs of hypo- or hypervolemia, including urine output
renal, cardiac and pulmonary function
intracranial pressure

Discontinue OSMITROL if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see Contraindications (4)].

Patient interventions

Full-time surgical intensivists (four) and neurosurgeons (three) managed all patients and ordered interventions based on hourly ICP and CPP values. The hourly StcO 2 and BIS values did not influence treatment decisions.

Routine clinical targets included: isotonic fluid administration at maintenance rates, hemoglobin > 10 g/dL, SaO 2 > 92%, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO 2) 35 to 42 torr, MAP 80 to 90 torr, head of bed elevation (15 to 30 degrees), euthermia, CPP ≥ 60 torr, euvolemia or mild hypervolemia, cardiac index ≥ 3.0 L/min/m 2, serum osmolality ≥ 290 mOsm/kg, and serum lactate ≤ 2.5 mmol/L. Primary interventions for patients with ICP > 20 torr included: brain CT scan to detect surgical lesions and the need for craniotomy, sedation when MAP ≥ 85 torr, CSF drainage, neuromuscular blockade for motor hyperactivity uncontrolled by sedatives or sedative-induced hypotension, mannitol (if serum osmolality < 320 mOsm/kg or earlier, if cerebral edema was present), diuretics (for hypo-osmolar serum and/or hypervolemia), and modest hyperventilation (PaCO 2 31 to 34 torr).

Secondary interventions for recalcitrant intracranial hypertension included: brain CT scan to detect surgical lesions that require a craniotomy, alpha agonist (dopamine (> 8 μg/kg/minute), phenylephrine, or norepinephrine) to elevate MAP to a supranormal level, hypothermia, aggressive hyperventilation, barbiturate coma, and decompressive craniectomy. Interventions for systemic arterial hypotension included: for obvious vasodilation (capillary nail bed hyperemia or decreased systemic vascular resistance index), afterload augmentation with an alpha agonist and discontinuance of sedatives; for obvious hypovolemia (low central venous pressure or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, low cardiac index, or fluid input much less than fluid output), fluid-bolus administration (250 mL of normal saline over 20 minutes), pitressin for diabetes insipidus, or red blood cells for hemoglobin < 10 gm/dL; and, for impaired cardiac contractility (cardiac index < 3.5 L/min/m 2, or increased lactate and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure > 15 torr), inotropic support. When the etiology was unclear, combinations of the above recommendations were used.

### Effects of calorie and fluid intake on adverse events during hemodialysis [^113BLnaQ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the incidence of adverse events during hemodialysis treatments as a function of calories and fluid intake.

Methods

The study period was August 3–26, 1999. Hemodialysis visits were studied. Twenty-three patients receiving hemodialysis during the 2nd shift on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday were studied. A total of 166 hemodialysis patient visits were studied. Data collected included: amount of fluid and food consumed, blood pressure levels, and mannitol use during each hemodialysis treatment; and any symptoms that occurred either during or after the dialysis treatment (hypotension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and access problems).

Results

Using regression analysis, calories and fluids were strong predictors of both hypotension (P = 0.003) and mannitol use (P = 0.000), but not of cramping or access problems. Patients were 3 times more likely to have hypotension if taking any fluids (P = 0.011). Patients consuming > 200 calories were 2 times as likely to have hypotension (P = 0.058). Patients were 5 times more likely to use mannitol if taking any fluids (P = 0.005). Mannitol use increased significantly (P = 0.001) with those patients consuming > 200 calories.

Conclusion

Patients who ate more than 200 calories and consumed more than 200 mL of fluid during hemodialysis had an increased incident of hypotensive events and increased use of mannitol.

### Pediatric advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^111NGP7X]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Red Cross Guidelines — pediatric major traumatic brain injury (TBI) with acute intracranial hypertension: Mannitol or hypertonic saline may be given to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have a monitored elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), signs of transtentorial herniation prior to ICP monitoring, or progressive neurological deterioration not due to extracranial causes. Arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) should be avoided in patients with intracranial hypertension. For pediatric patients with major TBI and acute intracranial hypertension, hypertonic saline is preferred over mannitol to lower the ICP to less than 20 mmHg. A bolus of hypertonic saline (3%) is recommended at a dose between 2 and 5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight (2 mL/kg to 5 mL/kg) over 10 to 20 minutes. A continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is suggested at a rate between 0.1 mL/kg and 1.0 mL/kg per hour, and the minimum dose needed to maintain ICP less than 20 mmHg is suggested. For refractory ICP, a bolus of 23.4% hypertonic saline is suggested; the suggested dose is 0.5 mL/kg with a maximum of 30 ml. A serum sodium level of greater than 170 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) for a sustained period (greater than 72 hours) should be avoided to preclude complications of thrombocytopenia and anemia, and sustained serum sodium greater than 160 mEq/L should be avoided to preclude the complication of deep venous thrombosis. When hypertonic saline cannot be used, mannitol may be considered to lower the ICP, with a bolus of 0.25 g/kg to 1 g/kg over 10 minutes suggested.

### Evidence for mannitol as an effective agent against intracranial hypertension: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^114PnYin]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Mannitol is currently used to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP), but the evidence supporting its usefulness has been questioned. We aim to meta-analyze the effectiveness of mannitol in reducing ICP in adult patients with cerebral injuries and its dependency on baseline ICP values, comparing findings from individual patient data (IPD) and aggregated data (AD) meta-analysis performed on the same studies. We searched the Medline database, with no time limitation, through March 1, 2019. We selected studies for which IPD were available, with a before-after design, concerning adult patients with traumatic cerebral hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhages, or hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, treated with mannitol for increased intracranial hypertension. We extracted ICP values at baseline and at different time-points, and mannitol doses. We used a multilevel approach to account for multiple measurements on the same patient and for center variability. The AD meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted using random-effects models. Three studies published IPD, and four authors shared their datasets. Two authors did not own their datasets anymore. Eight authors were unreachable, while 14 did not answer to our request. Overall, 7 studies provided IPD for 98 patients. The linear mixed-effects model showed that ICP decreased significantly after mannitol administration from an average baseline value of 22.1 mmHg to 16.8, 12.8, and 9.7 mmHg at 60, 120, and 180 min after mannitol administration. ICP reduction was proportional to baseline values with a 0.64 mmHg decrease for each unitary increment of the initial ICP value. Dose did not influence ICP reduction. The AD meta-analysis, based on data collected between 30 and 60 min from mannitol administration not accounting for multiple time-point measurements, overestimated ICP reduction (10 mmHg), while meta-regression provided similar results (0.66 mmHg decrease for each unitary increase of initial ICP). Mannitol is effective in reducing pathological ICP, proportionally to the degree of intracranial hypertension. IPD meta-analysis provided a more precise quantification of ICP variation than the AD approach.

Discussion

The strong relationship between incidence of increased ICP and outcome in patients with neuronal damage emphasizes the vulnerability of the injured brain and the need for adequate treatment. The management of severely injured neurosurgical patients has changed over recent decades, especially regarding the introduction and acceptance of clinical guidelines among neurosurgeons and intensivists. It has become a generally accepted treatment goal to keep the CPP above 70 mmHg, because episodes of CPP < 60 mmHg or ICP > 20 mmHg are associated with a worse outcome. These goals are incorporated into current treatment protocols, which are constantly analyzed with regards to their efficacy and feasibility, and updated accordingly. Osmotic agents are important components of all treatment protocols, especially mannitol as it is a well-established treatment for increased ICP following brain injury. Surveys of the critical care management of head-injured patients show that 83% of the centers in the United States and 100% of the centers in the United Kingdom used mannitol to control ICP. The clinical use of mannitol is, however, limited by renal complications and the fast increase of the osmotic gradient followed by its reversal due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, mannitol (at concentrations which may be reached in clinical conditions) and the hyperosmotic stress itself can activate the process of apoptotic cell death.

### Cognitive aids for the diagnosis and treatment of neuroanesthetic emergencies: consensus guidelines on behalf of the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care (SNACC) education committee [^115dcenN]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) — acute intraoperative management includes hyperosmolar therapy, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and hyperventilation with specified PaCO2 targets. Medications that may be given to reduce raised ICP include: 20% mannitol (0.25 to 1.5 g/kg) as an intravenous bolus and 3% hypertonic saline as a continuous infusion at 0.1 to 1 mL/kg/h to target a serum sodium level of 145 to 155 mEq/L. Intraoperative drainage of cerebral spinal fluid via an EVD allows good control of ICP and provides good emergency ICP reduction when tumor resection is not possible. Hyperventilation results in hypocapnia, leading to cerebral vasoconstriction, and CBF is roughly linearly related to PaCO2 between 20 and 80 mm Hg; the CBF, cerebral blood volume, and ICP reducing effects of hypocapnia are apparent for < 24 hours, and a typical goal PaCO2 value in the acute setting is 30 to 35 mm Hg; PaCO2 as revealed by arterial blood gas analysis, rather than end-tidal CO2, should be used to assess hypocapnia. The main complication associated with hyperventilation is a dangerous reduction in CBF, which can give rise to cerebral ischemia. There is a role for steroid administration in patients with tumors/vasogenic edema, with efficacy against tumor-related vasogenic edema established, but there is no established benefit with cytotoxic edema associated with TBI or SCI; the benefit of the use of furosemide alone or in combination with mannitol is unclear.

### Hypertonic mannitol for the prevention of intradialytic hypotension: a randomized controlled trial [^112h8Kfj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common complication at the initiation of hemodialysis (HD) therapy, is associated with greater mortality, and may be related to relatively rapid shifts in plasma osmolality. This study sought to evaluate the effect of an intervention to minimize intradialytic changes in plasma osmolality on the occurrence of IDH.

Study Design

Double-blind, single-center, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Individuals requiring initiation of HD for acute or chronic kidney disease.

Intervention

Mannitol, 0.25g/kg/h, versus a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution during the first 3 HD sessions.

Outcomes

The primary end point was average decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The secondary end point was the proportion of total sessions complicated by IDH (defined as a decrease ≥ 20mm Hg from the pre-HD SBP). Exploratory end points included biomarkers of cardiac and kidney injury.

Results

52 patients were randomly assigned and contributed to 156 study visits. There were no significant differences in average SBP decline between the mannitol and placebo groups (15 ± 11 vs 19 ± 16mm Hg; P = 0.3). The proportion of total sessions complicated by IDH was lower in the mannitol group compared to placebo (25% vs 43%), with a nominally lower risk for developing an episode of IDH (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14–1.00), though this finding was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05). There were no consistent differences in cardiac and kidney injury biomarker levels between treatment groups.

Limitations

Modest sample size and number of events.

Conclusions

In this pilot randomized controlled trial studying patients requiring initiation of HD, we found no difference in absolute SBP decline between those who received mannitol and those who received saline solution. However, there were fewer overall IDH events and a nominally lower risk for dialysis sessions being complicated by IDH in the mannitol group. A larger multicenter randomized controlled trial is warranted.

Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

5.6 Infusion Site Reactions

The infusion of hypertonic solutions through a peripheral vein, including Mannitol Injection, may result in peripheral venous irritation, including phlebitis. Other severe infusion site reactions, such as compartment syndrome and swelling associated with extravasation, can occur with administration of Mannitol Injection [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)]. Mannitol Injection is preferably administered through a central venous catheter [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].

5.7 Interference with Laboratory Tests

High concentrations of mannitol can cause false low results for inorganic phosphorus blood concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)].

Mannitol may produce false positive results in tests for blood ethylene glycol concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis: Stop infusion immediately if hypersensitivity reactions develop. (5.1)
Renal Complications Including Renal Failure: Risk factors include pre-existing renal disease, conditions that put patients at risk for renal failure and concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics. Avoid use of nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens. (5.2, 8.6)

Mannitol Injection is approved for use in the pediatric population for the reduction of intracranial and intraocular pressure. Studies have not defined the optimal dose of Mannitol Injection in the pediatric population. The safety profile for mannitol use in pediatric patients is similar to adults at dosages described in labeling. However, pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following administration of Mannitol Injection due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Mannitol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in elderly patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate the renal, cardiac and pulmonary status of the patient and correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances prior to administration of Mannitol Injection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Patients with pre-existing renal disease, patients with conditions that put them at high risk for renal failure, or those receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics, are at increased risk of renal failure with administration of mannitol. Evaluate the renal, cardiac, and pulmonary status of the patient and correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances prior to administration of Mannitol Injection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5)].

### Increased risk of acute kidney injury associated with higher infusion rate of mannitol in patients with intracranial hemorrhage [^116DCpnn]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Mannitol, an osmotic agent used to decrease intracranial pressure, can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). The objectives of this study were to assess the impact of mannitol on the incidence and severity of AKI and to identify risk factors and outcome for AKI in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

The authors retrospectively evaluated 153 adult patients who received mannitol infusion after ICH between January 2005 and December 2009 in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for AKI after ICH. Based on the odds ratio, weighted scores were assigned to predictors of AKI.

Results

The overall incidence of AKI among study participants was 10.5% (n = 16). Acute kidney injury occurred more frequently in patients who received mannitol infusion at a rate ≥ 1.34 g/kg/day than it did in patients who received mannitol infusion at a rate < 1.34 g/kg/day. A higher mannitol infusion rate was associated with more severe AKI. Independent risk factors for AKI were mannitol infusion rate ≥ 1.34 g/kg/day, age ≥ 70 years, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, and glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The authors developed a risk model for AKI, wherein patients with a higher risk score showed a graded association with a higher incidence of AKI.

Conclusions

The incidence of AKI following mannitol infusion in patients with ICH was 10.5%. A higher mannitol infusion rate was associated with more frequent and more severe AKI. Additionally, age ≥ 70 years, DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, and established renal dysfunction before starting mannitol therapy were associated with development of AKI.

### Hypotension during intensive care stay and mortality and morbidity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122m43u]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomized trials studying the effect of hypotension on mortality and morbidity are limited due to challenges in maintaining predefined blood pressure targets and the absence of consensus on the definition for hypotension. This systematic review included four RCTs that assigned patients to different blood pressure targets. Although these trials showed a clear distinction in average blood pressure values in both study arms, the average MAP in the lower target group of all RCTs exceeded the commonly used hypotension definitions of MAP < 65 mmHg and SBP < 90 mmHg. Consequently, exposure to hypotension in the lower target groups might have been limited compared to the observational studies included in this systematic review. Furthermore, assigning patients to a higher blood pressure threshold does not necessarily prevent hypotensive events. Patients in both the higher and lower blood pressure target group may have had similar exposure to critically low blood pressure, even if the average blood pressure of one group was substantially higher. Moreover, maintaining higher blood pressure thresholds required higher vasopressor dosages, which is independently associated with poor patient outcomes. This may have contributed to the neutral findings of blood pressure target RCTs, and the absence of an association between hypotension and AKI in our main meta-analysis, as halve of the included studies were RCTs.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^116fvbwG]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and mannitol 15% are effective and safe drugs in the treatment of increased ICP, although 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol. A dose of 1.4 ml/kg can be recommended as an initial dose. The advantage of hypertonic saline can be explained by individual local osmotic effects, because no relevant systemic changes occur. The observed effects on electrolytes and plasma osmolarity are not significantly different between the two osmotic drugs and have no clinical relevance here. Further experimental and clinical research is required to evaluate the optimal administration regime, the best treatment strategies adapted to the individual patient's needs and the impact on patients' morbidity and mortality.

### Mannitol for acute traumatic brain injury [^112r2UEE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol is sometimes effective in reversing acute brain swelling, but its effectiveness in the ongoing management of severe head injury remains unclear. There is evidence that, in prolonged dosage, mannitol may pass from the blood into the brain, where it might cause increased intracranial pressure.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different mannitol therapy regimens, of mannitol compared to other intracranial pressure (ICP) lowering agents, and to quantify the effectiveness of mannitol administration given at other stages following acute traumatic brain injury.

Search Strategy

The review drew on the search strategy for the Injuries Group as a whole. We checked reference lists of trials and review articles, and contacted authors of trials. The searches were last updated in April 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of mannitol, in patients with acute traumatic brain injury of any severity. The comparison group could be placebo-controlled, no drug, different dose, or different drug. We excluded cross-over trials, and trials where the intervention was started more than eight weeks after injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers independently rated quality of allocation concealment and extracted the data. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial on an intention to treat basis.

Main Results

In the acute management of comatose patients with severe head injury, the administration of high-dose mannitol resulted in reduced mortality (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79) and reduced death and severe disability (RR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.72) when compared with conventional-dose mannitol. One trial compared ICP-directed therapy to 'standard care' (RR for death = 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.46). One trial compared mannitol to pentobarbital (RR for death = 0.85; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). One trial compared mannitol to hypertonic saline (RR for death = 1.25; 95% CI 0.47 to 3.33). One trial tested the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol against placebo (RR for death = 1.75; 95% CI 0.48 to 6.38).

Authors' Conclusions

High-dose mannitol may be preferable to conventional-dose mannitol in the acute management of comatose patients with severe head injury. Mannitol therapy for raised ICP may have a beneficial effect on mortality when compared to pentobarbital treatment, but may have a detrimental effect on mortality when compared to hypertonic saline. ICP-directed treatment shows a small beneficial effect compared to treatment directed by neurological signs and physiological indicators. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^111MPf2F]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The various treatments for ICP or cerebral edema reviewed in this guideline are used in patients with critical intracranial pathologies worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials. The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments. The concepts of hyperosmotic therapy have been entrenched in the critical care management of patients with neurological injuries for years, yet there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal practical use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema. The goals of research activities in this area should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures. Basic criteria of research efforts should include a definition of how cerebral edema is being measured, the specific purpose of any intervention (e.g. resuscitation, management of ICP, effect on physiological parameters), and what outcome measures will be assessed. In addition, research efforts should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on designated outcomes. Finally, while the goal of all interventions in the management of neurological injuries is to improve survival and minimize disability, it must be acknowledged that a single intervention to address a specific physiological variable may have limited impact on the multiple factors that contribute to both short- and long-term outcomes.

### Perioperative anesthesia care for the pediatric patient undergoing a kidney transplantation: an educational review [^113yTgge]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hemodynamic therapy

Hemodynamic goals can be reached using a balanced mix of fluids and vasoactive drugs.

Fluid administration should cover basic metabolic needs, fluid load to prepare for reperfusion of the donor kidney and compensation of urine output. Maintenance fluids should cover insensible loss, urine output and caloric needs. For basic fluid need, approximately 50% of the standard 4–2–1 rule can be used in the anuric patient. Caloric needs are covered by adding glucose to the maintenance fluids. Higher glucose concentrations may be needed in children at risk for perioperative hypoglycemia, for example, children on parenteral or continuous enteral feeding. However, large amounts of hypotonic solutions should be avoided as they carry the risk of hyponatremia and subsequent brain swelling. Particularly in pediatric transplants, hypotonic solutions in conjunction with quickly resolving hyperuricemia can aggravate the osmolality disequilibrium between serum and cerebral cells leading to cerebral edema. Mannitol, given shortly before reperfusion of the graft, might reduce this risk. In addition, mannitol forces osmotic diuresis and is thought to serve as a free radical scavenger, thereby mitigating ischemic reperfusion damage and decreasing the incidence of acute renal failure after transplantation. Therefore, mannitol is included in most kidney transplantation protocols.

Before unclamping, anticipating on the concurrent hypotension caused by the release of waste products from the ischemic donor kidney, it is advised to give fluid loading. Balanced crystalloids like lactated Ringer's solution are preferred for fluid loading, because large volumes of normal saline can cause hyperchloremic acidosis. Although lactated Ringer's solution contains potassium, its use is not associated with hyperkalemia during kidney transplantation. Because the concentration of potassium in the lactated Ringer's is similar to that in the human serum, the volume expansion will not alter the concentration of potassium in the patient. Moreover, fluid loading with normal saline shows a higher risk of causing hyperkalemia as its induced acidemia might force potassium out of the cells in exchange for the excess serum hydrogen ions.

### Early management of isolated severe traumatic brain injury patients in a hospital without neurosurgical capabilities: a consensus and clinical recommendations of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) [^114nHoDW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Brain-focused therapy

The maintenance of the head of a severe isolated TBI patients in the midline, avoiding compression of the neck veins, and with a bed elevated at 30°–45° to facilitate brain venous drainage are basic maneuvers in the neurocritical care setting. These should always be applied with adequate spine precautions. Some panelists emphasized as some patients may require a lower bed elevation; this, considering what has been said previously for the zeroing of the arterial transducer in the case of invasive ABP monitoring, could lead to a reduced use of vasopressors for maintaining the blood pressure target.

Osmotherapy (i.e. mannitol or hypertonic saline) is effective in the rapid control of ICP through a reduction in blood viscosity and an increase in plasma osmolarity. Currently, adequately powered randomized controlled studies clearly showing the superiority of mannitol compared to hypertonic saline are lacking. Considering the diuretic effect of mannitol, hypertonic saline is a potentially reasonable choice in cases of hypovolemia. Moreover, the early utilization of mannitol, but not hypertonic saline, seems to be associated with increased incidence of acute kidney injury.

Hypocapnia associated with hyperventilation results in cerebral vasoconstriction with a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume and consequently ICP. This temporary effect is associated with the risk of development of cerebral ischemia. Profound hypocapnia is not recommended as a prophylactic maneuver but could be utilized briefly for patients awaiting emergent neurosurgery.

Metabolic suppression with sedatives can be useful in the control of intracranial hypertension but can increase the risk of hypotension. The reduction in blood pressure, observed in this scenario, should be aggressively corrected. In this regard, ketamine could be a useful option, but more data are necessary to confirm this.

Considering the above, in patients with signs of intracranial hypertension/brain herniation awaiting emergent neurosurgery, we recommend osmotherapy, short-term hyperventilation and an increase in sedation (ensuring an acceptable ABP).

According to BTF guidelines, prophylactic phenytoin or valproate are not recommended for preventing late post-traumatic seizures (PTS) and phenytoin is recommended to decrease the incidence of early PTS (within 7 days of injury), when the overall benefit is thought to outweigh the complications associated with such treatment (early PTS have not been associated with worse outcomes). Considering the above and awaiting the results of the ongoing "Management of Seizure after Traumatic Brain Injury" (MAST) trial (NCT04573803), we were unable to provide any recommendations regarding seizure prophylaxis in severe isolated TBI patients.

### Mannitol and outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage: propensity score and multivariable intensive blood pressure reduction in acute cerebral hemorrhage trial 2 results [^112gyY9n]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Mannitol is often used to reduce cerebral edema in acute intracerebral hemorrhage but without strong supporting evidence of benefit. We aimed to determine the impact of mannitol on outcome among participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2).

Methods

INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trial of 2839 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (< 6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure allocated to intensive (target systolic blood pressure, < 140 mmHg within 1 hour) or guideline-recommended (target systolic blood pressure, < 180 mmHg) blood pressure-lowering treatment. Propensity score and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between mannitol treatment (within 7 days) and poor outcome, defined by death or major disability on the modified Rankin Scale score (3–6) at 90 days.

Results

There was no significant difference in poor outcome between mannitol (n = 1533) and nonmannitol (n = 993) groups: propensity score-matched odds ratio of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.09; P = 0.30) and multivariable odds ratio of 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.07; P = 0.18). Although a better outcome was suggested in patients with larger (≥ 15 mL) than those with smaller (< 15 mL) baseline hematomas who received mannitol (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.78] versus odds ratio, 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.15]; P homogeneity < 0.03 in propensity score analyses), the association was not consistent in analyses across other cutoff points (≥ 10 and ≥ 20 mL) and for differing grades of neurological severity. Mannitol was not associated with excess serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Mannitol seems safe but might not improve outcome in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions may result from intravascular absorption of sorbitol and mannitol. The literature reports occasional adverse reactions from intravenous sorbitol-mannitol infusions. Consequences of absorption of urologic irrigating solutions include fluid and electrolyte disturbances such as acidosis, electrolyte loss, marked diuresis, urinary retention, edema, dryness of mouth, thirst and dehydration; cardiovascular disorders such as hypotension, tachycardia, angina-like pains; pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary congestion; and other general reactions such as blurred vision, convulsions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rhinitis, chills, vertigo, backache and urticaria. Allergic reactions from sorbitol-mannitol have also been reported.

Should any adverse reaction occur, discontinue the irrigant, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

Mannitol monitoring and acute kidney injury (AKI) risk — clinicians commonly use a serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg or an osmolar gap of 20–55 mOsm/kg to estimate the risk of AKI with mannitol. Early publications described a serum osmolality threshold of 320 mOsm/L, whereas recent studies have shown that an osmolality threshold of greater than 320 mOsm/L does not affect the incidence of AKI. In one case series of eight patients with mannitol-induced AKI, an elevated osmolar gap was present in all but two patients (mean osmolar gap 74 mOsm/kg). Clinicians should monitor intravascular volume status, renal function, and some measure of serum osmolarity closely when using mannitol in patients with cerebral edema.

Studies have also evaluated emergent, pre-hospital resuscitation with HTS or mannitol in patients with TBI. A phase II feasibility study evaluated 229 TBI patients with a GCS < 9 and those who were hypotensive (SBP < 100 mm Hg) and randomized each to receive pre-hospital 250 mL 7.5% NaCl or 250 mL Ringer's lactate. Survival to hospital discharge was similar in both groups, as was GOSE and survival at 6 months. Bulger et al. performed a prospective, double-blind trial of 1282 TBI patients who received a 250 mL bolus of 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 70, a 250 mL bolus of 7.5% NaCl, or a 250 mL 0.9% NaCl in the pre-hospital setting. No significant differences in distribution of GOSE category, Disability Rating Score, or mortality by treatment group were found. Sayre et al. evaluated the use of mannitol in the pre-hospital setting in patients with TBI and also found no benefit on mortality.

While the overall quality of the evidence in this area is low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across the published studies to suggest that both HTS and mannitol are effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema. The panel noted that the evidence supporting HTS is more robust, but mannitol is also an effective option. The decision regarding which agent to use should be based on available resources, the patient's individual characteristics, and local practice patterns. While either agent can address the physiological abnormalities of ICP elevations and cerebral edema, there is evidence that neither agent directly influences long-term neurological outcome, particularly when used in the pre-hospital setting.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke

In patients with ischemic stroke, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions improve cerebral edema compared to mannitol?
In patients with ischemic stroke, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions for cerebral edema improve neurological outcomes compared to mannitol?

Recommendations

We suggest using either hypertonic sodium solutions or mannitol for the initial management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend either hypertonic saline or mannitol for improving neurological outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

We suggest that the use of mannitol as an effective alternative in patients with TBI unable to receive hypertonic sodium solutions (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), with rationale that the literature consistently suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol and that neither agent has been demonstrated to improve neurological outcomes.

### Randomized, controlled trial on the effect of a 20% mannitol solution and a 7.5% saline / 6% dextran solution on increased intracranial pressure after brain injury [^116ZXYdP]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this pilot study was to compare the effects of equimolar doses of hypertonic saline and dextran solution (HSD, Rescueflow) with 20% mannitol solution for reduction of increased intracranial pressure.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover trial in the intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital.

Setting

Academic hospital and tertiary referral center for neuroscience.

Patients

Nine patients with an intracranial pressure of > 20 mm Hg were recruited and received two treatments of each, HSD and 20% mannitol, in a randomized order.

Intervention

Equimolar, rapid intravenous infusions of either 200 mL of 20% mannitol or 100 mL of 7.5% saline and 6% dextran-70 solution (HSD) over 5 mins.

Measurements

Intracranial pressure, blood pressure, serum and urine sodium and osmolality, and urine output.

Main Results

Treatments reduced intracranial pressure with both mannitol (median decrease, 7.5 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval, 5.8–11.8) and HSD (median decrease, 13 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, 11.5–17.3). HSD caused a significantly greater decrease in intracranial pressure than mannitol (p = .044). HSD had a longer duration of effect than mannitol (p = .044).

Conclusion

When given in an equimolar, rapid, intravenous infusion, HSD reduces intracranial pressure more effectively than mannitol.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1142ZDhd]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

Acute treatment of cerebral edema and herniation syndromes is often necessary in the pre-hospital setting. However, well-designed clinical trials did not suggest any benefit from the use of HTS in the pre-hospital setting on long-term outcomes in patients with TBI.
4 We suggest against the use of mannitol in the pre-hospital setting to improve neurological outcomes for patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low and did not suggest any potential benefit in the pre-hospital setting on long-term outcomes in patients with TBI.

The panel evaluated several studies to inform recommendations on the use of HTS and/or mannitol to improve ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes (Table 1, Questions 3 and 4). These two agents have been compared in at least eight randomized, controlled trials of patients with elevated ICP from a variety of causes, including TBI. A number of uncontrolled, retrospective, and non-comparative studies have also evaluated either HTS or mannitol in patients with TBI. These studies all support the notion that both hyperosmolar therapies effectively reduce ICP (Table 3). The available data are limited by patient heterogeneity, low sample size, and inconsistent methods among studies. For example, several studies utilized a crossover study design where patients served as their own control, sequentially receiving HTS and then mannitol or vice versa, whereas others randomized patients to receive one agent or the other. In addition, several of the early studies evaluating HTS used a combination product which included HES. The overall quality of evidence was low (Evidentiary Table 2 of Electronic Supplementary Material).

### Effect of mannitol on cerebral blood volume in patients with head injury [^1159gUFe]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol has traditionally been the mainstay of medical therapy for intracranial hypertension in patients with head injury. We previously demonstrated that mannitol reduces brain volume in patients with cerebral edema, although whether this occurs because of a reduction in brain water, blood volume, or both remains poorly understood.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that mannitol acts by lowering blood viscosity leading to reflex vasoconstriction and a fall in cerebral blood volume (CBV).

Methods

We used O positron emission tomography to study 6 patients with traumatic brain injuries requiring treatment for intracranial hypertension. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), CBV, and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were measured before and 1 hour after administration of 1.0 g/kg 20% mannitol.

Results

CBV rose from 4.1 ± 0.4 to 4.2 ± 0.2 mL/100 g (P = 0.3), while intracranial pressure fell from 21.5 ± 4.9 to 13.7 ± 5.1 mm Hg (P < .003) after mannitol. Blood pressure, PaCO2, oxygen content, CBF, and CMRO2 did not change.

Conclusion

A single bolus of 1 g/kg of 20% mannitol does not acutely lower CBV. Another mechanism, such as a reduction in brain water, may better explain mannitol's ability to lower intracranial pressure and reduce mass effect.

### Mannitol for acute traumatic brain injury [^112bW3xy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol is sometimes dramatically effective in reversing acute brain swelling, but its effectiveness in the on-going management of severe head injury remains open to question. There is evidence that, in prolonged dosage, mannitol may pass from the blood into the brain, where it might cause reverse osmotic shifts that increase intracranial pressure.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different mannitol therapy regimens, of mannitol compared to other intracranial pressure (ICP) lowering agents, and to quantify the effectiveness of mannitol administration given at other stages following acute traumatic brain injury.

Search Strategy

The review drew on the search strategy for the Injuries Group as a whole. We checked reference lists of trials and review articles, and contacted authors of trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of mannitol, in patients with acute traumatic brain injury of any severity. The comparison group could be placebo-controlled, no drug, different dose, or different drug. Trials where the intervention was started more than eight weeks after injury, and cross-over trials were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers independently rated quality of allocation concealment and extracted the data. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial on an intention to treat basis.

Main Results

Overall there were few eligible trials. In the pre-operative management of patients with acute intracranial haemorrhage the administration of high-dose mannitol resulted in reduced mortality (RR = 0.55; 95%CI 0.36, 0.84) and reduced death and severe disability (RR = 0.58; 95%CI 0.45, 0.74) when compared with conventional-dose mannitol. One trial compared ICP-directed therapy to 'standard care' (RR for death = 0.83; 95%CI 0.47,1.46). One trial compared mannitol to pentobarbital (RR for death = 0.85; 95% CI 0.52, 1.38). No trials compared mannitol to other ICP-lowering agents. One trial tested the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol against placebo (RR for death = 1.75; 95% CI 0.48, 6.38).

Reviewer's Conclusions

High-dose mannitol appears to be preferable to conventional-dose mannitol in the pre-operative management of patients with acute intracranial haematomas. However, there is little evidence about the use of mannitol as a continuous infusion in patients with raised intracranial pressure in patients who do not have an operable intracranial haematoma. Mannitol therapy for raised ICP may have a beneficial effect on mortality when compared to pentobarbital treatment. ICP-directed treatment shows a small beneficial effect compared to treatment directed by neurological signs and physiological indicators. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol to preclude either a harmful or a beneficial effect on mortality.

### Mechanisms for hemodynamic instability related to renal replacement therapy: a narrative review [^113e7HLw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lastly, dialysis-induced hypovolemia may be exacerbated by the Bezold–Jarisch reflex which, triggered by LV emptying, results in the loss of peripheral sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, worsened hypotension and bradycardia. Patients with underlying left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction are thought to be predisposed to this phenomenon.

Rapid osmotic/oncotic shifts

When RRT results in rapid plasma solute clearance, there is a consequent reduction in plasma osmolality that promotes free water to shift from the intravascular to the interstitial and intracellular spaces that are left with relatively higher osmolality. This results in decreased effective arterial blood volume and reduced plasma refilling leading to HIRRT when compensatory mechanisms are inadequate or if coupled with excessive UF. The rate of change of plasma osmolality depends on the pre-RRT osmolality of the patient and the small solute clearance achieved by the RRT. Thus, one can expect more gradual osmotic shifts with prolonged intermittent or continuous RRT modalities relative to intermittent HD.

Maintenance HD patients with ESKD have elevated pre-dialysis plasma osmolality, typically in the range of 291–339 mOsm/kg (normal 275–295 mOsm/kg) and plasma osmolality may decline by up to 33 mOsm/kg with HD. Higher pre-dialysis calculated plasma osmolality correlates with an increased risk of IDH in this population. Moreover, a higher dialysis dose with HD and greater urea removal rate have also been shown to correlate with IDH. Given the association between IDH and rapidity of the dialysis-associated decline in plasma osmolality, studies have evaluated the efficacy of isolated UF (not inducing an osmolality change) and hypertonic solutions (preventing fluid shifts) for mitigating HIRRT. A study of maintenance HD patients found that isolated UF [i.e. treatment using the HD machine to perform UF without any diffusive clearance (i.e. dialysis)] maintained blood pressure stability compared to usual HD, and that hypertonic mannitol stabilized plasma osmolality and prevented post-dialysis orthostatic hypotension. A larger study including both AKI and maintenance HD patients (excluding those on vasopressors or transitioning from CRRT) found that administration of hypertonic mannitol during HD initiation prevented hemodynamic instability.
