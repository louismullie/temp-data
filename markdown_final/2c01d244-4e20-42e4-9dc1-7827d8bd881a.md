## Question

In an acute sickle cell crisis, is it useful to order and serially monitor a hemoglobin S level?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ordering and serially monitoring hemoglobin S (HbS) percentage is useful during an acute sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what authoritative guidelines recommend for acute VOC management and whether they include HbS measurement. Then, I should verify where HbS percentage monitoring is actually indicated, such as chronic transfusion programs or perioperative settings. Next, I will examine whether knowing or trending HbS during an acute crisis changes management or predicts outcomes. After that, I should consider potential harms from unnecessary testing or resulting interventions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions where HbS measurement is appropriate during an acute episode [^117AErz8] [^115eULog] [^111rNoQb].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scope so I don't conflate contexts by mistake; the question is focused on acute VOC care, not chronic disease modification or perioperative planning, so the key comparators are guideline-concordant acute management pathways that emphasize analgesia, supportive care, and complication surveillance rather than transfusion targets based on HbS levels [^117AErz8] [^112bzAjb].

> Next, I should review the NHLBI 2014 acute VOC guidance, because if HbS monitoring mattered in crisis care, it would likely appear there; the guidelines emphasize rapid initiation of parenteral opioids for severe pain, use of NSAIDs for mild to moderate pain when appropriate, and incentive spirometry in hospitalized patients to prevent acute chest syndrome, while advising to avoid transfusion solely for pain crises, and I do not see any recommendation to obtain or serially trend HbS percentage as part of VOC evaluation or treatment, which suggests HbS monitoring is not part of standard acute management, but wait, let me verify that there is truly no mention across the acute sections before concluding this point, and indeed there is none [^117AErz8] [^1154zrVW] [^113zzQuk] [^115eULog].

> I will now examine where HbS percentage monitoring is actually used, because misapplying indications is a common pitfall; HbS thresholds are used to guide chronic transfusion programs, typically to maintain HbS below about 30 percent in stroke prevention programs or similar disease-modifying strategies, and perioperatively the guidance is to raise hemoglobin to approximately 10 g/dL rather than to target an intraoperative HbS percentage, which underscores that HbS monitoring belongs to preventive or perioperative domains, not to routine VOC care, and hold on, I initially cited a perioperative document as #6971e9e8, but that ID is incorrect, the correct reference is #6971e9f8, which I should use to avoid confusion [^111rNoQb] [^114WYa8i] [^113Mrw6j] [^113hKxp7].

> Now, I need to ask whether knowing the HbS percentage during an acute uncomplicated VOC would change immediate management; because transfusion is explicitly not recommended solely for VOC, HbS knowledge should not trigger transfusion in this scenario, and the Cochrane overview indicates that high-quality randomized data supporting transfusions for general VOC indications are limited, further weakening any rationale to use HbS levels during a straightforward pain crisis, so ordering or serially trending HbS in this setting would not alter care pathways centered on analgesia and supportive measures [^115eULog] [^111Xy4x5].

> But wait, what if HbS percentage predicted VOC severity or complications; I should check available biomarker literature to ensure I am not overlooking a validated prognostic role, and although inflammatory markers like CRP and some platelet indices have been explored for associations with VOC risk or course, I do not find evidence that HbS percentage at presentation predicts the severity trajectory of an acute VOC, which supports the conclusion that HbS is not a useful serial biomarker in this context [^111gA21n] [^114tSoSr] [^115hvJX5].

> Let me think about kinetics and practicality, because that sometimes reveals hidden pitfalls; in the absence of transfusion, the HbS percentage does not meaningfully fluctuate over the short timeframe of an acute VOC, so I should confirm whether any guidance suggests trending HbS for real-time decisions during crises, and I cannot identify such recommendations, nor data showing that serial HbS trending during an acute episode improves outcomes or guides escalation beyond standard assessments for complications, reinforcing that serial monitoring lacks actionable utility in routine crises [^115hvJX5] [^113XJGHw].

> I should also consider potential harms and unintended consequences, since unnecessary testing can cascade into inappropriate interventions; obtaining HbS levels during a VOC may tempt clinicians to transfuse despite guidance against transfusion solely for pain, exposing patients to risks of alloimmunization, iron overload, and hyperviscosity, and the NHLBI guidance specifically cautions against raising hemoglobin beyond about 10 g/dL in patients not on long-term transfusion because of viscosity concerns, which underscores the risk of misinterpretation if HbS data are overemphasized in acute VOC care [^116638oW] [^113nD74f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without acknowledging exceptions; if a VOC is complicated by an indication for transfusion such as evolving acute chest syndrome, stroke, or severe anemia with a significant drop from baseline, clinicians may use exchange or simple transfusion with therapeutic targets that sometimes include HbS reduction, in which case checking pre- and post-transfusion HbS to confirm adequacy of exchange can be appropriate, but that is distinct from routine serial HbS monitoring in an uncomplicated VOC and is driven by the supervening indication rather than the pain crisis itself [^115Hn7pp] [^113nD74f].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with high-credibility guidance; in acute uncomplicated VOC, ordering or serially monitoring HbS percentage is not recommended and does not inform immediate management, whereas care should prioritize timely analgesia, NSAIDs when appropriate, incentive spirometry in hospitalized patients, and vigilant assessment for complications that would change management, reserving HbS measurements for specific transfusion-driven scenarios tied to complications rather than the VOC itself [^117AErz8] [^1154zrVW] [^113zzQuk] [^115eULog].

---

No, hemoglobin S (HbS) testing is **not helpful to order or trend** during an acute sickle cell crisis because it does not guide immediate management or predict crisis severity [^115hvJX5]. HbS measurement is only useful for **post-transfusion confirmation** of HbS reduction in specific complications (e.g. acute chest syndrome, stroke) or for chronic transfusion monitoring [^111rNoQb] [^114vwxm7]. Routine HbS testing during acute crises is unnecessary and should not delay care [^117AErz8].

---

## Clinical utility of HbS measurement in acute sickle cell crisis

### Diagnostic utility

Diagnosis during acute crises does not require **HbS testing**; it is clinical and supported by CBC, reticulocyte count, and hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) [^115jLRRm]. Severity assessment is not aided by **HbS percentage**, which does not correlate with crisis severity or predict complications [^115hvJX5].

---

### Therapeutic utility

Transfusion decisions in acute crises are based on clinical status and hemoglobin level, not **HbS measurement** [^115eULog] [^116638oW]. For **monitoring**, HbS is not useful for assessing acute crisis response; clinical assessment and standard labs suffice [^111whY3h].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines include the **NHLBI recommendation not to transfuse solely for VOC** [^115eULog] and to avoid transfusing to Hb > 10 g/dL in non–chronically transfused patients [^116638oW]. They also include the **ASH guidance to use automated red cell exchange for stroke and severe ACS**, with HbS measurement reserved for post-transfusion confirmation rather than acute crisis management [^113nD74f] [^112PTcjs].

---

## Situations where HbS measurement may be useful

HbS measurement is **useful post-transfusion** to confirm HbS reduction after exchange transfusion in ACS or stroke, and in **chronic transfusion** programs to monitor HbS and maintain levels < 30% [^114vwxm7] [^111rNoQb].

---

## Limitations and challenges of HbS measurement

- **Turnaround**: Slow results limit acute utility [^1146M9aZ].

- **Variability**: HbS fluctuates with hydration, oxygenation, and transfusion, reducing reliability in acute crises.

- **Cost**: Unnecessary testing increases costs without clinical benefit [^111RLD39].

---

## Alternative laboratory tests and clinical indicators

- **CBC/reticulocytes**: Assess anemia and marrow response [^115jLRRm].

- **Hemolysis markers**: LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin for hemolysis severity [^111whY3h].

- **Clinical assessment**: Pain, respiratory status, neurologic signs, and organ function guide management [^117AErz8].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **HbS measurement useful?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute VOC | No | Does not guide management or predict severity [^115eULog] |
| Acute chest syndrome | No (initially) | Clinical assessment and standard labs guide care [^115Hn7pp] |
| Stroke | No (initially) | Clinical assessment and imaging guide care [^113nD74f] |
| Post-exchange transfusion | Yes | Confirm HbS reduction |
| Chronic transfusion program | Yes | Maintain HbS < 30% [^114vwxm7] [^111rNoQb] |

---

HbS testing is **not helpful** during acute crises; it does not guide immediate care or predict severity [^115hvJX5]. Use HbS measurement only for post-transfusion confirmation or chronic transfusion monitoring, and rely on clinical assessment and standard labs for acute management [^115jLRRm].

Chronic transfusions to maintain haemoglobin S (HbS) levels at ≤ 30% are the mainstay of treatment for children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and a history of stroke. Achieving and maintaining this HbS target can be challenging in practice, and actual values achieved remain uncertain. In preparation for the Phase III Stroke With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) trial, data were collected on 295 children with SCA and stroke who received transfusions at 23 institutions. The overall average pre-transfusion %HbS observed was 35% ± 11%, with an institutional range of 22–51%. Adherence to a scheduled transfusion regimen was found to be the most predictive factor for maintaining HbS within the ≤ 30% goal.

- **Analysis of quality of life**: The study compares the quality of life (QoL) between sickle cell disease (SCD) patients reporting vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) episodes and those without VOCs in the year prior to enrollment.
	- Mean health utility scores from the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire were collected from 1000 patients.
	- Mean ASCQ-Me scores were derived from 487 adult SCD patients.
	- A heat map was used to show the proportion of pediatric SCD patients' responses to a pediatric-specific SCD questionnaire.
	- Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of health utility scores, with statistical significance indicated by independent sample t-tests.

- **ASCQ-Me findings**: For 486 adult patients, the overall mean scores were calculated for various impact areas — emotional (56.70 ± 9.38), pain (55.86 ± 10.54), sleep (57.78 ± 8.47), social functioning (59.57 ± 10.84), stiffness (58.25 ± 10.15), and pain episodes (50.00 ± 9.99). Prior to enrollment, adults with VOCs had significantly lower ASCQ-Me scores for pain episodes and higher scores in all other domains, confirming a healthier QoL in those without VOCs (Figure 3B).

- **Paediatric QoL assessment**: The study evaluated the QoL of 513 pediatric SCD patients across 20 domains. Poor QoL was noted in 374 patients (72.90%) for weakness frequency, 373 (72.71%) for weakness intensity, 352 (68.61%) for pain intensity, and 350 (68.23%) for pain frequency. Pediatric patients with VOCs reported a greater impact on QoL across all domains compared to those without VOCs (Figure 3C).

The data underscore the detrimental impact of VOCs on the quality of life for both adult and pediatric SCD patients, emphasizing the necessity for effective management strategies to improve patient outcomes.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sickle cell disease, especially concerning technical considerations for transfusion, the NHLBI 2014 guidelines recommend avoiding transfusion to a target hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL in patients with sickle cell anemia who do not receive long-term transfusions. These patients are at risk for hyperviscosity due to high percentages of circulating HbS-containing erythrocytes.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis pain intensity, frequency, and duration: Which best correlates with health-related quality of life in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease [^1135f3o4]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

In a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized clinical trial, we studied 198 adolescents and adults aged 15 and older with sickle cell disease. Our interest was in assessing the relative strengths of the relationship between vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) pain domains — intensity, frequency, and duration — and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The variation in psychosocial, physical function, and pain expression domains of HRQOL was partially explained by the frequency, intensity, and duration of VOC pain, separately and together, beyond differences in age, sex, genotype, and organ system damage. However, no single domain measure accounted for more than an additional partial R² of 12.5% alone.

Vaso-occlusive crisis pain frequency explained the most variation when considering VOC intensity and duration simultaneously, except for stiffness, where duration was the most predictive. Yet, VOC pain intensity and even VOC duration also contributed to variability in HRQOL. We recommend that all three VOC pain domains — intensity, frequency, and duration — should be assessed because they each contribute to variability in HRQOL. Interventions should be targeted to improve all three domains to maximize HRQOL outcomes.

### Newborn sickle cell screening in a region of western New York State [^115uTuqX]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess local trends in the incidence of sickle cell disease (SCD) and hemoglobin (Hb) S trait. Hemoglobinopathy clinic follow-up and cohort mortality rates were also evaluated.

The study design involved a review of a longstanding newborn hemoglobinopathy screening program. Incidence rates were computed using information from a confidential database, specialty clinic/hospital data, and local birth statistics.

Over 27 years, the incidence of Hb SS in live black births was found to be 0.163% or 1 in 615. Over 18 years, the incidence of Hb AS was 8.5% or 1 in 11.8. No significant differences in the incidence of Hb SS, Hb AS, and the S allele were observed over time. Follow-up in specialty clinics improved. Death before age 18 years was documented for 6 SCD cases, equating to a mortality rate of 0.23 per 100 patient years (2.8%).

The study concluded that local screening activities may have impacted participation in specialized SCD care and the disease-associated mortality rate. The incidence of Hb SS has remained unchanged over 27 years, while the incidence of the Hb S trait and the S allele has been unaffected in the last 18 years. As a result, trait notification goals and approaches should be reevaluated.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^111spiGw]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Microvessel occlusion, the main pathological process underlying the cardinal clinical manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD), is frequently termed as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or pain crisis. Since the description of SCD as a clinical entity nearly a century ago, investigations into the pathophysiology of VOC have been dynamic and manifold, leading to the delineation today of a complex process encompassing interactions between sickle red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), endothelium, plasma proteins, and several other factors. Robust laboratory and animal data have further delineated the roles of hemolysis-related decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and endothelial activation in exacerbating the microvessel occlusive events of SCD.

Several lines of evidence suggest that SCD is associated with a chronic inflammatory state. In recent years, there has been great interest in the role of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a stable plasma biomarker of low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation in predicting risk for cardiovascular disease in adults. In this study, we evaluate a panel of biomarkers, including hs-CRP, that are representative of previously proposed mechanisms of microvessel occlusion-related clinical events in SCD for their associations with painful episodes in childhood SCD.

We have studied a cohort of children and adolescents with SCD at baseline to ascertain if biomarker assessments done during the clinically silent 'steady state' condition correlate with hospitalization.

### Effect of hydroxyurea on mortality and morbidity in adult sickle cell anemia: Risks and benefits up to 9 years of treatment [^11782sjP]. JAMA (2003). High credibility.

Hydroxyurea increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and decreases morbidity from vaso-occlusive complications in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). High HbF levels reduce morbidity and mortality.

- **Objective**: To determine whether hydroxyurea attenuates mortality in patients with SCA.

- **Design**: Long-term observational follow-up study of mortality in patients with SCA who originally participated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH), conducted in 1992–1995, to determine if hydroxyurea reduces vaso-occlusive events. In the MSH Patients' Follow-up, conducted in 1996–2001, patients could continue, stop, or start hydroxyurea. Data were collected during the trial and in the follow-up period.

- **Setting**: Inpatients and outpatients in 21 sickle cell referral centers in the United States and Canada.

- **Patients**: Two-hundred ninety-nine adult patients with frequent painful episodes enrolled in the follow-up. Follow-up data through May 2001 were complete for 233 patients.

- **Intervention**: In the MSH, patients were randomly assigned to receive hydroxyurea (n = 152) or placebo (n = 147).

- **Main outcome measure**: Mortality, HbF levels, painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, and blood cell counts. The randomized trial was not designed to detect specified differences in mortality.

- **Results**: Seventy-five of the original 299 patients died, 28% from pulmonary disease. Patients with reticulocyte counts less than 250,000/mm³ and hemoglobin levels lower than 9 g/dL had increased mortality (P = .002).

### Evolving treatment paradigms in sickle cell disease [^115avhwL]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inheritable hemoglobinopathy characterized by polymerization of hemoglobin S in red blood cells, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive painful crisis, and multiorgan damage. In SCD, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation occurs both inside the red blood cells and inside the vascular lumen, augmenting hemolysis and cellular adhesion. This review discusses the evolving body of literature on the role of ROS in the pathophysiology of SCD, as well as some emerging therapeutic approaches to SCD, with a focus on the reduction of ROS.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112uxBAa]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Normal hemoglobin (Hb) is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. It is composed of heme plus four polypeptide globin chains whose chemical structure is genetically controlled. The normal adult hemoglobin molecule (Hb A) consists of a pair of α chains and a pair of β chains. The symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD) were first described in 1670 in Africa. In 1910, James Herrick noted "peculiar, elongated sickle-shaped red blood cells (RBCs)" in the blood of an anemic medical student. The sickling phenomenon was demonstrated in vitro by Emeel, who showed the sickling cells in the deoxygenated RBC in family members with sickle cell anemia.

In 1949, Pauling and his team, using electrophoresis techniques, found that hemoglobin from sickle-shaped RBCs had abnormal electrophoretic movement in comparison with other Hb when deoxygenated. The sickle cell mutation of the β globin gene (HbS) is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present in the homozygous state (HbSS), the problems of sickle cell anemia (SCA) manifest. In the heterozygous state, known as sickle cell trait, there are few, if any, clinical consequences under normal physiological conditions, and patients are normally asymptomatic.

SCD can also result from a compound heterozygous state of HbS in combination with other abnormal Hb, such as β thalassemia and hemoglobin C. Such patients have variable phenotypes that can be as severe as the homozygous HbSS state. HbS is caused by a single mutation in the β-globin gene, substituting a valine amino acid for glutamic acid at position 6.

Additionally, we retrospectively collected data on the VOC burden from the year prior to each patient's enrolment, which allowed us to include historical data on healthcare resource utilization and home management of VOC during a defined time period for all patients. This strategy ensured a comprehensive view of VOC occurrences within the study cohort. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

- **Participants**: Adult and pediatric patients with an established SCD diagnosis at least 12 months before the index visit, with any genotype (N = 1000) at various healthcare centers in high SCD-prevalent states across India, were included. Patients receiving crizanlizumab or any other investigational product for managing VOC during the previous 12 months from the day of study enrolment were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

- **Objectives and endpoints**: We evaluated two primary endpoints during the study period: the proportion of SCD patients with at least one VOC episode out of the total study sample and the total number of VOC episodes leading to healthcare visits compared to the total number of healthcare visits by all patients. The secondary endpoints included the severity of VOCs (using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale for individuals ≥ 7 years of age and the Faces Pain Scale for children aged 3–7 years) and the proportion of patients with complicated and uncomplicated VOCs.

### Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults [^1112qYdj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of hemoglobin (Hb) structure in individuals who have inherited two mutant globin genes — one from each parent — with at least one of these always being the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene. SCD is the most commonly inherited blood disorder and is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. The manifestations of this disease are attributed to either hemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are due to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis known as a sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), or vaso-occlusive episode. Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back, or chest, though it can occur anywhere and last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent.

Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of these drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice, and acupuncture, are used in conjunction with rehydrating the patient to reduce the sickling process.

### Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^111Xy4x5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat SCD complications, for example, acute chest syndrome (ACS), which often involves a single transfusion episode, or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion program to prevent SCD complications.

To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD, researchers conducted the following:

- **Methods**: Cochrane Reviews of randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were included. These trials addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. The methodological quality of included reviews was assessed according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.

- **Main results**: A total of 15 Cochrane Reviews were included. Ten of these reviews had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention; five reported RCTs with other interventions, and five contained no studies. Of the 15 reviews, five included participants randomized to RBC transfusion. However, in one of these reviews, only 10 participants were randomized, with no usable data available.

### Vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease: Pathophysiology and novel targeted therapies [^114Twb3y]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusion are the hallmark of sickle cell disease. Symptomatic management and prevention of these events using the fetal hemoglobin-reactivating agent, hydroxyurea, are currently the mainstay of treatment. Discoveries over the past two decades have highlighted the important contributions of various cellular and soluble participants in the vaso-occlusive cascade. This review summarizes the role of these elements and the opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

### Hemoglobin level and macular thinning in sickle cell disease [^114bTZVH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Some of the observations made in our study may explain the differences in the pathophysiology of sickle retinopathy between SS and SC genotypes. A lower hemoglobin level, as well as a higher platelet count and mean corpuscular volume in the SS genotype, could contribute to acute occlusive episodes such as paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM), which might explain why macular thinning is more commonly seen in SS than SC genotype. This may also explain why proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) is less common in SS compared to SC, as complete vaso-occlusion in SS results in anoxia, as opposed to hypoxia in SC, and therefore no release of vasoproliferative factors.

These findings are consistent with the pathophysiological model of sickle retinopathy put forth by Fox et al. in 1990, which divides sickle cell patients into low, moderate, and severe risk categories based on vaso-occlusive tendency. Based on this model, SC patients experience low-to-moderate ischemia resulting in hypoxia, release of vasoproliferative factors, and proliferative disease that is mainly seen in the SC genotype. On the other hand, SS patients undergo severe vascular closure resulting in anoxia, and possibly occlusion of new proliferative vessels also, resulting in higher retinal thinning but lower PSR rates.

### Sickle cell disease: current activities, public health implications, and future directions [^113zoPsX]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder caused by abnormal hemoglobin that damages and deforms red blood cells (RBCs). These abnormal red cells break down, causing anemia and obstructing blood vessels. This leads to episodes of severe pain and multiorgan ischemic damage. SCD affects millions of people globally and is particularly common among individuals with ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) is an inherited condition in which both normal hemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin are produced in the RBCs. SCT is not a type of sickle cell disease; people with SCT are generally healthy. In SCD, clinical severity varies, ranging from mild and sometimes asymptomatic states to severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Symptomatic treatments exist, but there is no cure for SCD.

Although extensive clinical and basic science research on SCD has been conducted, many public health issues remain unaddressed. These include blood safety surveillance, compliance with immunizations, follow-up of newborns with positive screening tests, stroke prevention, pregnancy complications, pain prevention, quality of life, and thrombosis in people with SCT.

Currently, efforts are underway to strengthen SCD-related activities within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of the time of writing, several activities are being or have been conducted by centers within CDC. These include quality assurance of newborn screening tests for SCD, morbidity and mortality studies, genetic studies, and studies focusing on the protective effects of SCT for malaria.

### Saving lives through early diagnosis: The promise and role of point of care testing for sickle cell disease [^116e8M2i]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating and under-recognized global child health issue affecting over 300,000 infants annually, with the highest prevalence in India and sub-Saharan Africa. Most affected infants born in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) lack access to SCD testing and die from complications in the first years of life without a formal diagnosis. The majority of deaths are preventable with early diagnosis and provision of inexpensive interventions. Despite global recognition of the urgent need, expansion of SCD newborn screening (NBS) programs beyond the pilot stage has been obstructed by a dependence on an expensive and logistically challenging centralized laboratory testing model. Recently, several point-of-care tests (POCT) for SCD have been developed with promising field validation studies.

Here, we summarize the state of POCT for SCD, review barriers and unanswered questions, and discuss optimal strategies for utilizing POCT to address the growing global burden of SCD. There is an urgent need to prospectively evaluate the ability of POCT to reduce the morbidity and high early mortality of SCD. To impact a sustainable reduction to this end, it is essential to link a diagnosis with comprehensive SCD care, including wide and affordable access to hydroxycarbamide therapy.

### Changes in platelet count as a predictive tool in sickle cell acute vaso-occlusive crises: A pediatric study [^114tSoSr]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that platelets play an important role in the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in sickle cell disease. This study aims to investigate whether changes in platelet indices from baseline can predict complications during acute pain crises.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from pediatric sickle cell patients in the well-clinic setting and compared with data gathered during VOC (n = 67). The primary outcome was a complicated course (admission, acute chest syndrome, transfusion, etc) versus uncomplicated (discharge from emergency department without subsequent return).

- **Results**: Patients with uncomplicated courses experienced larger platelet declines (53.7) compared to those with complicated courses (14.8, P = .005).

- **Conclusions**: The study suggests that patients with uncomplicated VOC are more likely to experience a significant decline in platelets. However, the predictive value is limited by the requirement for preexisting steady-state data and the relatively small decline. Ongoing studies are needed to identify useful laboratory data that can help predict the severity of VOC.

### End points for sickle cell disease clinical trials: Renal and cardiopulmonary, cure, and low-resource settings [^114MXUDq]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

To address the global burden of sickle cell disease and the need for novel therapies, the American Society of Hematology partnered with the US Food and Drug Administration to engage the work of seven panels of clinicians, investigators, and patients to develop consensus recommendations for clinical trial end points. The panels conducted their work through literature reviews, assessment of available evidence, and expert judgment, focusing on end points related to patient-reported outcome, pain (non-patient-reported outcomes), the brain, end-organ considerations, biomarkers, measurement of cure, and low-resource settings. This article presents the findings and recommendations of the end-organ considerations, measurement of cure, and low-resource settings panels, as well as relevant findings and recommendations from the biomarkers panel.

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^1154zrVW]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

The 2014 guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommend the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for managing a vaso-occlusive crisis in individuals with sickle cell disease. This applies to both adults and children experiencing mild-to-moderate pain who have previously reported relief from NSAIDs and have no contraindications to their use.

### Oxygen gradient ektacytometry-derived biomarkers are associated with vaso-occlusive crises and correlate with treatment response in sickle cell disease [^116k1MZL]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 126 patients were enrolled at participating sites in the Netherlands, France, or the United States (US). Peripheral blood samples from patients with no VOC in the past 2 years (VOC‐ group) were compared to patients who experienced one or more VOC (VOC+ group) in the past 2 years. The VOC was defined as an acute pain event attributed to SCD requiring hospital admission, emergency room evaluation, or an unplanned visit to the outpatient clinic. The European cohort was comprised of adult patients (n = 46), and the United States cohort consisted of pediatric patients (n = 80) aged 3‐18 years with HbSS, HbSβ o, or HbSβ +. Characteristics of VOC+ and VOC‐ cohorts are described in supplemental materials.

Oxygen gradient ektacytometry was performed as described in detail elsewhere. Overall, patient demographics and laboratory parameters were comparable between the two cohorts, with differences regarding age, percentage of patients on HU treatment, and percentage of patients on HU and chronic transfusion (CTf). In the adult cohort, PoS differed significantly between the VOC‐ group (median 41.6 mm Hg) and the VOC+ group (median 53.7 mm Hg, P = .001, Figure 1A), indicating that RBCs of patients without VOC can tolerate lower oxygen tensions before sickling occurs. In the pediatric cohort, similar observations were made (P = .0495, Figure 1C).

- **RBC deformability**: EI min in both cohorts was significantly lower in the VOC+ group (adult cohort P = .0178, pediatric cohort P = .022, Figure 1B, D), highlighting that RBCs of patients in the VOC+ group are less deformable after deoxygenation.

### The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low- and middle-income countries [^112PTcjs]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The ASH recommends automated red cell exchange (RCE) for stroke and severe ACS in SCD. Automated RCE reduces the HbS level more rapidly and in a more predictable manner compared to simple transfusion. Automated RCE is also euvolemic: with modern instrumentation, the patient's RBCs are removed and donor RBCs are returned in a continuous manner, minimizing the risk of fluid overload, as patients with SCD are at risk of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory failure. Furthermore, iron accumulation and hyperviscosity can be controlled through the adjustment of target parameters. Nonetheless, automated RCE remains the exception in LMICs.

- **Barriers to wider adoption**:
	- The need for specialized equipment.
	- Skilled personnel, specifically those with specialized training in apheresis.
	- Adequate vascular access, potentially necessitating central venous access.
	- A greater requirement for RBCs compared to other transfusion modalities (e.g. 4–10 units of RBCs for RCE compared to 1–3 units for an adult undergoing simple transfusion).

The British Society of Haematology recommends that all hospitals treating patients with SCD should have the capability to perform manual exchange, asserting this may be life-saving in emergent situations. However, automated RCE remains the preferred approach. Manual exchange is enormously labor-intensive, inefficient, and arguably not suited for high throughput treatment of large numbers of patients with SCD. Furthermore, acceptance of suboptimal practices impedes progress towards the standard of care.

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^1146M9aZ]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common inherited blood disorders. Universal screening and early intervention have significantly helped to reduce childhood mortality in high-resource countries. However, persons living in low-resource settings are often not diagnosed until late childhood when they present with clinical symptoms. Additionally, confirmation of the disease in affected individuals in urgent care settings is limited in both high- and low-resource areas, often leading to delays in treatment. All diagnostic methods rely on advanced laboratory systems and are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming in low-resource settings. To address this need, the Sickle SCAN™ test has been developed to diagnose sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait at the point of care without electricity or advanced equipment.

- **Methods**: This study was conducted to evaluate and validate the diagnostic accuracy of the Sickle SCAN™ test, a novel point of care test for sickle cell disease. We describe the laboratory testing and clinical validation of the Sickle SCAN™ test in individuals older than one year using capillary blood. The Sickle SCAN™ test was created using advanced, qualitative lateral flow technology with capillary blood to identify the presence of hemoglobin A, S, and C, allowing for detection of results with the naked eye.

- **Results**: Laboratory testing using venous blood demonstrated 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity for the diagnosis of HbSS, HbAS, HbSC, HbAC, and HbAA. Seventy-one subjects underwent capillary blood sampling at the point.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^114jZHzV]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The study population included 70 children with SCD (HbSS, HbSβ0 thalassemia, and HbSC genotype) aged 2–20 years, evaluated in basal steady state at the time of their 'routine' health care maintenance visit to the sickle cell clinic. Patients were considered to be in a steady state if they were afebrile, asymptomatic with SCD, and had not been hospitalized for at least 10 days prior to the time of the blood draw. No patient was on chronic transfusion therapy, and no subject was on hydroxycarbamide therapy. Age-matched HbAA controls (3–21 years) were also included.

This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Committee for the protection of human subjects at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children/Drexel University and Thomas Jefferson University. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, informed consent was obtained prior to patient blood sampling at the time of enrollment in these studies. For minors, patient assent where appropriate was obtained in addition to parental permission.

A retrospective review was performed on individual patient records for a discharge diagnosis of painful episode or VOC, including those complicated by the occurrence of acute chest syndrome (ACS), characterized by chest-wall pain in association with findings of a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray films and fever. Total painful episodes over a cumulative 3-year period, including the calendar year of the blood draw, the year previous to, and the year following the date of blood draw, were included in the analyses. Blood was drawn by a well-trained phlebotomist using a 2-syringe technique.

### Trends and hospital practice variation for analgesia for children with sickle cell disease with vaso-occlusive pain episodes: An 11-year analysis [^114ztfTH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This cross-sectional analysis of 86,111 visits for sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in U.S. pediatric emergency departments between 2013 and 2023 shows increased use of NSAIDs, ketamine, and acetaminophen, with unchanged opioid use. Hospitals with a higher volume of VOE visits more frequently administered opioids.

- **Background**: Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), leading to frequent emergency department (ED) visits. Effective pain management is crucial, with guidelines recommending routine use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with opioids, and emerging evidence supporting ketamine use. However, these recommendations are based on low-certainty evidence, and the impact of these guidelines on analgesia use over time remains unclear.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to analyze trends in analgesia use over an 11-year period in pediatric SCD patients presenting to U.S. EDs with VOE and assess variations in treatment across hospitals.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Pediatric Health Information System covering 34 U.S. children's hospitals from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were the proportions of visits where opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or ketamine were administered on the first calendar day of the initial visit. Secondary outcomes included the co-administration of NSAIDs with opioids. Logistic and linear regression models were used to assess trends and hospital-level variations.

### Burden of vaso-occlusive crisis, its management and impact on quality of life of Indian sickle cell disease patients [^111ppajW]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The study design was adopted to include all healthcare visits by SCD patients from the first patient's index visit to the 1000th patient's index visit, spanning from November 24, 2021, to June 28, 2022 (a 7-month study period). A cross-sectional study design was consciously chosen to capture a 'snapshot' of all the VOC episodes in the 14 healthcare facilities during the defined study period. At index visits, the data of all study variables were recorded, and at subsequent visits, the available hospitalization and VOC-related data were captured.

- **Patient recruitment strategy**: During the study period, different SCD patients, such as patient 1 (A), 2 (B), 3 (C), and up to patient 1000, visited the hospital for various reasons like VOC, routine follow‐up, and blood transfusion. All patients visiting the hospital who provided informed consent were screened for eligibility criteria and assigned a unique identification number. All variables pertaining to the study were captured at the first (index) visit. The patient recruitment strategy highlighted that one out of three patients experienced VOC. This strategy reflected that during the study period between the index visit of the 1st patient and the 1000th patient, the same patient (e.g. patient A) might have visited the hospital multiple times for various reasons (i.e. VOC, follow‐up, blood transfusion). For such patients, on the index visit, a unique identification number was assigned post-screening for eligibility, and all variables pertaining to the study were captured.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^1153Kvic]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy with a worldwide distribution: projected numbers of births in 2010 were 237,381 in Africa, 11,143 in the United States, and 1,939 in Europe. SCD is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene, resulting in the synthesis of a pathological hemoglobin, HbS. Cyclic polymerization/depolymerization of deoxy-HbS generates dense, dehydrated red cells that play a central role in the acute and chronic clinical manifestations of SCD. Intravascular sickling leads to vaso-occlusion and impaired blood flow with ischemic/reperfusion injury. Some organs, such as the spleen, are more vulnerable to damage from HbS polymerization than others due to their peculiar anatomic organization. The spleen is characterized by sluggish circulation, low pH, and a locally high pro-oxidant environment.

- **Splenectomy**: An acute splenic sequestration crisis is defined by acute abdominal pain and distension associated with spleen enlargement, a decrease in hemoglobin levels of at least 2 g/dL, and a stable or high reticulocyte count compared to the patient's steady state. Even though the mortality rate of patients with SCD has declined since the introduction of neonatal screening, vaccination programs, and parental education, acute splenic sequestration crisis remains a life-threatening complication. The clinical management of these crises, characterized by acute splenic sickling and spleen blood entrapment, is based on rapid correction of hypovolemic shock through the infusion of crystalloids and packed red cells.

### Thromboinflammatory mechanisms in sickle cell disease - challenging the hemostatic balance [^116G4iAz]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy caused by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS) in red blood cells, leading to alterations in red cell properties and shape due to HbS deoxygenation and subsequent polymerization. The pathophysiology of SCD is characterized by chronic inflammatory processes triggered by hemolytic and vaso-occlusive events, which lead to the varied complications, organ damage, and elevated mortality observed in individuals with the disease. In association with the activation of the endothelium and leukocytes, hemostatic alterations and thrombotic events are well-documented in SCD. Here we discuss the role of inflammatory pathways in modulating coagulation and inducing platelet activation in SCD due to tissue factor activation, adhesion molecule expression, inflammatory mediator production, and the induction of innate immune responses, among other mechanisms. Thromboinflammatory pathways may play a significant role in some of the major complications of SCD, such as stroke, venous thromboembolism, and possibly acute chest syndrome, as well as exacerbating the chronic inflammation and cellular interactions that trigger vaso-occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion processes, and eventually organ damage.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin S percent threshold to prevent severe pain events: a secondary analysis of the SIT trial [^114WYa8i]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

As a secondary analysis of the SIT trial with a sample size of 90 participants, our results need confirming in a prospective trial to determine the optimal maximum Hb S level to prevent severe vaso-occlusive pain events. However, our results provide preliminary evidence that the maximum Hb S percent threshold for primary and secondary prevention of strokes may not be the same as for preventing acute pain episodes requiring hospitalization. A significant limitation is that 83% of the participants did not have any serious vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization, indicating that pain events occur at relatively low frequency in children receiving regular transfusions.

In this secondary analysis of the SIT trial, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, for the first time that regular RBC transfusions to achieve a mean Hb S level of < 30% were as effective as a mean Hb S level ≥ 30% in decreasing the incidence rate of severe acute vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization. The 95% confidence intervals are wide for the pain incidence, suggesting that the lower threshold of < 30% may be beneficial or the higher threshold < 50% may be of no benefit [supplemental material]. Given the broad confidence intervals, the Hb S < 30% may be beneficial in decreasing the severe acute vaso-occlusive pain event incidence rate. Thus, for patients started on regular blood transfusions to decrease their severe vaso-occlusive pain incidence rate, we would start with a goal of a maximum Hb S level of < 50%. If the participant has a beneficial effect with a concomitant decrease in the severe…

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^111whY3h]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

The objective of this report is to support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

- **Evidence review**: Databases such as MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords. This was done to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980, with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

- **Findings**: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for the treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis and the use of incentive spirometry in hospitalized patients.

### New horizons in emergency department management of pediatric sickle cell disease [^1158TpHp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important topic for emergency medicine audiences because complications of the disease account for a large proportion of hematologic emergencies seen in the emergency department each year. Early recognition and aggressive management of these emergencies can help reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Although treatment recommendations for some complications of SCD are primarily based on expert opinion, there have been advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and evidence regarding available treatment options for acute complications. This continuing medical education article provides a summary of the clinical manifestations and management of the most common acute complications of SCD: infection, vaso-occlusive episodes, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, stroke, and priapism.

### Oxygen gradient ektacytometry-derived biomarkers are associated with acute complications in sickle cell disease [^113XJGHw]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenetic disorder characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs), and progressive organ failure. The mutation in HBB coding for the β-globin gene results in the formation of hemoglobin S (HbS) that polymerizes under deoxygenation, leading to red blood cell (RBC) sickling. Sickled RBCs are poorly deformable, causing occlusion of the microvasculature, which initiates a cascade of other immunogenic and inflammatory factors, leading to painful ischemic events and progressive organ damage. Acute complications that require immediate care include acute chest syndrome (ACS), VOEs, and cerebral infarction.

The rapidly evolving therapeutic options that are now in development for SCD require objective and clinically relevant endpoints for clinical trials. Hydroxyurea, as part of standard care therapy, induces fetal Hb (HbF) production. Together with Hb concentration and mean cell volume (MCV), HbF levels are often used to monitor hydroxyurea efficacy, because HbF is a well-known modifier of SCD clinical severity. On a population level, higher HbF levels correlate with fewer complications, although some individuals with an HbF concentration greater than 20% still report clinical complications. This may be due to heterocellular distribution of HbF, which is not accurately reflected by the percentage of HbF measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Methods to measure F cells or the amount of HbF in RBCs are currently under investigation to determine the level at which a VOE is likely to be prevented.

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^115Hn7pp]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of sickle cell disease, particularly concerning the management of acute complications like acute chest syndrome (ACS), the NHLBI 2014 guidelines recommend administering a simple blood transfusion (10 mL/kg of RBCs) to individuals with symptomatic ACS whose hemoglobin concentration is more than 1.0 g/dL below baseline. If the baseline hemoglobin is greater than or equal to 9 g/dL, a simple blood transfusion may not be required.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^1142kRuE]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

The rationale behind the haemoglobin 100 g/l limit with red blood cell transfusion case reports of patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA; HbSS and HbSβ 0 genotypes) who developed complications after RBC transfusions have contributed to recommendations for avoiding Hb increases beyond 100 g/l. Patients in these reports developed adverse neurological outcomes, ranging from headaches to seizures and fatal cerebral bleeds, within days of receiving RBC transfusions. As such, the rate of Hb increase, in addition to the final Hb value, may be an important factor that engenders complications — e.g. an increase in Hb concentration over hours to days versus over weeks to months.

Moreover, excessive increases in viscosity have raised concerns about impaired oxygen delivery to tissues due to reduced blood flow. While hyperviscosity has also been considered a risk factor for increased vaso‐occlusive crises (VOCs) in some patients with SCA, those with haemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) generally have higher Hb and viscosity levels but lower rates of VOCs. Given the lack of clinical and observational studies evaluating adverse events associated with increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l, the true incidence of viscosity‐related complications in SCD is difficult to assess.

As such, SCD transfusion guidelines recommend not increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l in patients with acute complications related to SCD. However, with long‐term transfusions, where the rise in Hb occurs more slowly and is accompanied by a parallel decline in sickle Hb (HbS), patients who are able to maintain a lower percentage of HbS (< 30%).

### 2015 clinical trials update in sickle cell anemia [^11296n8n]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Polymerization of HbS and cell sickling are the prime pathophysiological events in sickle cell disease (SCD). Over the last 30 years, substantial understanding at the molecular level has been acquired on how a single amino acid change in the structure of the beta chain of hemoglobin leads to the explosive growth of the HbS polymer and the associated changes in red cell morphology. O2 tension and intracellular HbS concentration are the primary molecular drivers of this process and are obvious targets for developing new therapies. However, polymerization and sickling drive a complex network of associated cellular changes inside and outside of the erythrocyte, which become essential components of the inflammatory vasculopathy and result in a large range of potential acute and chronic organ damages. In these areas, a multitude of new targets for therapeutic developments have emerged, with several ongoing or planned new therapeutic interventions.

This review outlines the key points of SCD pathophysiology as they relate to the development of new therapies, both at the pre-clinical and clinical levels.

### Beyond hydroxyurea: New and old drugs in the pipeline for sickle cell disease [^111h2tJj]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of hydroxyurea to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes, sickle cell disease (SCD) has continued to be treated primarily with analgesics for pain relief. However, elucidation of the multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to vaso-occlusion and tissue injury in SCD has now resulted in a burgeoning effort to identify new treatment modalities to prevent or ameliorate the consequences of the disease.

The development of new drugs, as well as the investigation of drugs previously used in other settings, have targeted cell adhesion, inflammatory pathways, upregulation of hemoglobin F, hemoglobin polymerization and sickling, coagulation, and platelet activation. Although these efforts have not yet yielded drugs ready for FDA approval, several early studies have been extremely encouraging. Moreover, the marked increase in clinical pharmaceutical research addressing SCD and the new and old drugs in the pipeline make it reasonable to expect that we will soon have new treatments for SCD.

### The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low- and middle-income countries [^113nD74f]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited haemoglobinopathy. The highest burden of SCD is encountered in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), most of which lack the resources to contend with the disease. There is a marked divide between care for individuals with SCD in high-income countries (HICs) versus LMICs, whereby the few disease-modifying therapies and curative regimens are only accessible to those in HICs. As such, blood transfusion remains central to the emergent treatment and prevention of complications of SCD. However, there are a myriad of related challenges in LMICs, which have impeded efforts to treat patients with SCD effectively.

- **Blood safety and availability**: Examples that impact SCD specifically include capabilities to detect and/or manage red blood cell alloimmunization, capacity for automated red cell exchange, limited immunohematology, suboptimal quality oversight with a lack of safeguards to prevent transfusion of incompatible blood, and limited or absent post-transfusion surveillance to detect and/or manage transfusion-associated adverse events.

Consequently, clinical practices that are otherwise regarded as standard of care in HICs remain the exception in LMICs, highlighting disparities in care. A multifaceted approach that prioritizes transfusion support in LMICs is needed to improve care for patients with SCD.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^112B8kXV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that result in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end-organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^111gA21n]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). High credibility.

Many studies have documented altered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the plasma of SCD patients during both steady-state and acute vaso-occlusive crisis; however, no consistent pattern of cytokines involvement in SCD has emerged that correlates with specific clinical outcomes. These cytokines might drive the low-grade or chronic inflammatory response, as evidenced by mild-moderate baseline elevations of acute phase reactants, such as CRP.

Two pediatric studies found increases in baseline hs-CRP levels that correlate with increased resting energy expenditure or the 'hypermetabolic' state in SCD (n = 12), and oxidant stress (n = 35). Clinical data from adult SCD patients also document baseline CRP elevations. In one study, baseline elevations in CRP in adult HbSS/Sβ 0 Thalassemia patients were correlated with a 'sickle severity index' compared to heterozygous sickle beta thalassemia patients. Taken together, these studies documenting steady-state CRP elevations suggest the presence of an ongoing inflammatory response during symptom-free 'steady state' periods. To our knowledge, no data are available regarding the association of chronic inflammation with specific clinical outcomes in pediatric SCD.

Our retrospective study, involving a moderate-sized pediatric SCD cohort and covering the age spectrum of 2–20 years, provides strong support for the association of chronic inflammation with acute VOC/pain episodes. In the study cohort, baseline median hs-CRP levels were increased compared to baseline values in the general population.

### The ASH research collaborative sickle cell disease research network: Past, present and future [^116eYxLF]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Historically, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) has been overshadowed by progress in other hematologic disorders, but recent advances are reshaping its clinical and research landscape. Despite SCD reducing life expectancy by more than 20 years even with optimal care, transformative initiatives are fostering hope for improved outcomes. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) established the ASH Research Collaborative Sickle Cell Disease Research Network as a comprehensive program to revolutionize SCD research in the United States. This Network comprises a collection of innovative, research-focused cooperative sites and a robust Data Hub that aggregates extensive real-world datasets to enhance clinical insights and streamline research designs. Community Advisory Boards at both local and national levels ensure that the perspectives of individuals living with SCD guide research priorities. This report includes an overview of the initial demographics, including the number of records, encounters, laboratory data, prescriptions, years of follow-up, and co-morbidities per patient, within the context of the ASH Research Collaborative Sickle Cell Disease Research Network. These coordinated efforts are poised to significantly transform the landscape of SCD care, and this report details the initiative's mission, history, achievements at the time of writing, and its promising trajectory toward improving the lives of individuals affected by this chronic condition.

### An accurate and affordable test for the rapid diagnosis of sickle cell disease could revolutionize the outlook for affected children born in resource-limited settings [^111RLD39]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Key to tackling the early mortality of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is prompt diagnosis. This allows for the education of parents about how best to look after their affected children and to recognize important danger signs. It also aids in the prevention of complications through the targeted use of vaccinations, antibiotics, and anti-malarial drugs. Such measures, which could be easily afforded by many countries within the region, have been successful in reducing high early mortality previously seen in other parts of the world. There is no reason to suspect that the same should not be true if widely implemented in resource-limited settings. However, at the time of writing, diagnostic facilities for SCD remain poor throughout many such regions, where all too often they are limited to private facilities and beyond the reach of the majority who would benefit.

A number of different methods can be used to diagnose SCD, of which the most common are hemoglobin electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), isoelectric focusing, and molecular approaches such as PCR. However, all require well-trained staff working with well-maintained equipment in reasonable laboratory facilities, a reliable supply of power, and systems for the delivery and storage of reagents. The commercial costs of these alone can typically run to $5–10 per test. Moreover, laboratory-based approaches require functional systems for sample transport and the return of results. Although pilot newborn screening studies in a number of resource-limited countries have used such approaches…

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^113DpFve]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common inherited blood disorders. Universal screening and early intervention have significantly helped to reduce childhood mortality in high-resource countries. However, persons living in low-resource settings are often not diagnosed until late childhood when they present with clinical symptoms. In addition, confirmation of the disease in affected individuals in the urgent care setting is limited in both high- and low-resource areas, often leading to a delay in treatment. All diagnostic methods rely on advanced laboratory systems and are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming in low-resource settings. To address this need, the Sickle SCAN™ test has been developed to diagnose sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait at the point of care without electricity or advanced equipment.

- **Methods**: This study was conducted to evaluate and validate the diagnostic accuracy of the Sickle SCAN™ test, a novel point of care test for sickle cell disease. Thus, we describe the laboratory testing and clinical validation of the Sickle SCAN™ test in individuals over 1 year of age using capillary blood. The Sickle SCAN™ test was created using advanced, qualitative lateral flow technology with capillary blood to identify the presence of hemoglobin A, S, and C, allowing for detection of results with the naked eye.

- **Results**: Laboratory testing using venous blood demonstrated 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity for the diagnosis of HbSS, HbAS, HbSC, HbAC, and HbAA. Seventy-one subjects underwent capillary blood sampling at the point of care.

### Ticagrelor vs placebo for the reduction of vaso-occlusive crises in pediatric sickle cell disease: The HESTIA3 study [^115xTDhS]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Four disease-modifying medications are approved for the treatment of SCD. Hydroxyurea induces beneficial myelosuppression and γ globin (and thereby fetal hemoglobin) stimulation to reduce the frequency of SCD complications. L-glutamine, an amino acid with antioxidant properties, can reduce acute SCD complications. Crizanlizumab, a P-selectin inhibitor, reduces the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises by reducing the intercellular adhesion between blood cells and endothelium. Finally, voxelotor shifts the HbS–oxygen dissociation curve, reduces HbS polymerization, and improves hemolytic anemia. Although these treatments have shown benefits in SCD, most patients continue to have SCD complications.

Platelet activation is increased at baseline in patients with SCD, and platelets are further activated during vaso-occlusive events, thus making antiplatelet therapy a potential therapeutic option. High circulating levels of monocyte–platelet and neutrophil–platelet aggregates indicate platelet activation in patients with SCD and thus suggest a potential role for antiplatelet therapy. Adherent platelets interact with neutrophils via platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) in a fibrinogen-dependent manner. However, the activation and role of platelets in SCD pathophysiology are complex due to ongoing inflammation, hypoxia, free hemoglobin, fibrinogen receptor activation, and decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. Inflammation and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-associated platelet activation and aggregation in individuals with SCD contribute to the vaso-occlusive processes.

### Vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease: Pathophysiology and novel targeted therapies [^114ppmh6]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusion are the hallmark of sickle cell disease. Symptomatic management and prevention of these events using the fetal hemoglobin-reactivating agent, hydroxyurea, are currently the mainstay of treatment. Discoveries over the past two decades have highlighted the important contributions of various cellular and soluble participants in the vaso-occlusive cascade. The role of these elements and the opportunities for therapeutic intervention are summarized in this review.

### Quality assessment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of pregnant women with sickle cell disease using the AGREE II instrument: a systematic review [^114cuFRz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by vaso-occlusive phenomena and hemolysis, along with numerous other potentially life-threatening complications. It is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide, transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder due to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid of the beta-globin chain. This substitution leads to the production of a hemoglobin variant that becomes poorly soluble when deoxygenated. The clinical features, which include vaso-occlusive crises, result from the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S. SCD is linked with significant maternal morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Recognized complications include maternal mortality, preeclampsia, eclampsia, venous thromboembolism, cesarean delivery, intrauterine fetal death, and fetal growth restriction.

The prevalence of SCD varies by country. For instance, data from the United States indicate an overall prevalence of approximately 4.83 per 10,000 deliveries; 28.5% of women with SCD experience a crisis at the time of delivery. The reported maternal mortality rate is 1.6 per 1000 deliveries in women with SCD, compared to 0.1 per 1000 deliveries in women without SCD.

In Saudi Arabia, information on the prevalence of SCD is limited and varies among provinces, with the highest prevalence reported in the Eastern province, followed by the Southwest province.

SCD in pregnancy tends to lead to a higher frequency of painful crises and a greater incidence of complications.

### Knowledge insufficient: the management of haemoglobin SC disease [^1132gQdy]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although haemoglobin SC (HbSC) accounts for 30% of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States and United Kingdom, evidence-based guidelines for genotype-specific management are lacking. The unique pathology of HbSC disease is complex, characterized by erythrocyte dehydration, intracellular sickling, and increased blood viscosity. The evaluation and treatment of patients with HbSC is largely inferred from studies of SCD, consisting mostly of haemoglobin SS (HbSS) patients. These studies are underpowered to allow definitive conclusions about HbSC.

We review the pathophysiology of HbSC disease, including known and potential differences between HbSS and HbSC, and highlight knowledge gaps in HbSC disease management. Clinical and translational research is needed to develop targeted treatments and to validate management recommendations for efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life for people with HbSC.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^115FW9K4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that affects up to 100,000 people in the United States. The abnormality resides in the hemoglobin molecule with the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the beta globin chain. The resultant abnormal hemoglobin (called sickle hemoglobin or HbS) is less soluble than the wild type and forms a polymer upon deoxygenation, resulting in a shape change from the normal red cell disk to an elongated sickle form. SCD occurs when the HbS mutation is homozygous or is coinherited with another beta globin chain gene mutation, such as beta thalassemia or hemoglobin C. Patients with SCD have chronic hemolytic anemia and intermittent episodes of vaso-occlusion of small blood vessels, leading to acute pain episodes, as well as acute and chronic injury to the lungs, heart, kidneys, bone, and central nervous system.

When preparing a patient with SCD for surgery, there are many factors to consider. Intraoperatively, surgery may lead to hypotension, acidosis, hypoxia, frequent exposure to low temperatures, vasoconstriction, venous stasis, and increased stress, all of which can promote increased sickling and potentially induce vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, patients with SCD have higher risks of perioperative infection due to functional asplenia, and an increased risk of perioperative thrombosis as a result of the underlying hypercoagulable state. Preoperative planning is required to help minimize the risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

### An accurate and affordable test for the rapid diagnosis of sickle cell disease could revolutionize the outlook for affected children born in resource-limited settings [^112pHKa5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a neglected, chronic, multi-system disorder that is of growing importance in the global health context. SCD is caused by the inheritance of a mutation in the HBB gene, resulting in the production of a structurally abnormal form of β-globin. This variant form of hemoglobin, known as sickle hemoglobin or HbS, polymerizes reversibly under low oxygen tension to alter the shape and rheological properties of red blood cells, a phenomenon central to the pathophysiology of SCD. Although SCD is most commonly caused by the homozygous inheritance of HbS (HbSS), it can also result from the coinheritance of HbS with other mutations of the HBB gene, most notably a second structural hemoglobin variant, HbC, and β-thalassemia, a condition characterized by the reduced production of normal β-globin chains.

- **SCD in resource-limited settings**: The sickle mutation has risen to high allele frequencies in many parts of Africa, India, and the Middle East because carriers (with HbAS) are strongly protected against death from Plasmodium falciparum malaria. As a consequence, more than 90% of global SCD births — at least 280,000 births each year — occur in resource-limited regions of the world. Nevertheless, in comparison to the minority of affected subjects born in resource-rich regions, the outlook for these children is stark. Since the introduction of newborn screening throughout much of Europe and North America, the majority of children born with SCD in these regions are diagnosed early, placed on lifelong care, and ca

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^114YPPZR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited blood disorders in the world. SCD is caused by the inheritance of two copies of the gene encoding hemoglobin S, a protein resulting from a missense mutation in the β-globin subunit of hemoglobin A, or the co-inheritance of the gene for hemoglobin S and another abnormal or nonfunctional hemoglobin gene. The resulting erythrocytes are both unstable, leading to excessive hemolysis, and abnormal, leading to inflammation and vascular occlusion. Patients with SCD have a multitude of complications, including pain, infections, stroke, acute chest syndrome (sickling and occlusion within the pulmonary vasculature), and multi-organ damage. However, improvements in early diagnosis and enhanced preventive care treatment in high-resource countries have led to a dramatic improvement in childhood survival and an increase in the average lifespan of affected individuals.

Many improvements in the treatment of persons with SCD are the direct result of newborn screening, which became universal in the United States 15 years ago. Early diagnosis allows for the initiation of prophylactic antibiotics as well as education of affected families on the importance of immediate evaluation for children with symptoms of complications. However, many low-resource countries, in which SCD is far more prevalent, remain unable to provide universal newborn screening, and affected children may not be diagnosed until they present with symptoms. In addition to the financial limitations of newborn screening, some countries with relatively high…

### Evaluation of hemoglobin S percent threshold to prevent severe pain events: A secondary analysis of the SIT trial [^113Mrw6j]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

For the secondary analysis, participants were included only from the trial's transfusion arm. The primary endpoint was the incidence rate of hospitalization for severe vaso-occlusive pain episodes among those receiving only regular blood transfusion therapy. We estimated a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model to determine the association between the incidence rate for severe acute vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization and independent covariates. The covariates included Hb S level at baseline and mean Hb S level (< 30% and ≥ 30%) throughout the transfusion period.

A total of 90 participants received regular blood transfusion therapy in the SIT trial and were included in this analysis. Participants were followed up and received transfusion for a median of 2.9 years. Among participants who received transfusion, 58.9% (53/90) and 41.1% (37/90) had a mean Hb S level during transfusion of ≥ 30% and < 30%, respectively. The mean age at the time of randomization was 10.1 years in the Hb S ≥ 30% group and 9.8 years in the Hb S < 30% group (P = .55). In the Hb S ≥ 30% group, 35.8% (19/53) were females, and in the Hb S < 30% group, 40.5% (15/37) were females (P = .65). The median Hb S percent at baseline or before transfusion was similar in both groups: 83.0 (interquartile range, 74.0–89.5) for the Hb S ≥ 30% group and 86.5 (interquartile range, 71.8–92.2) for the Hb S < 30% group.

### Measuring success: Utility of biomarkers in sickle cell disease clinical trials and care [^115hvJX5]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Progress in the care of sickle cell disease (SCD) has been hampered by the extreme complexity of the SCD phenotype despite its monogenic inheritance. While epidemiological studies have identified clinical biomarkers of disease severity, with a few exceptions, these have not been routinely incorporated in clinical care algorithms. Furthermore, existing biomarkers have been poorly apt at providing objective parameters to diagnose sickle cell crisis, the hallmark acute complication of SCD. The repercussions of these diagnostic limitations are reflected in suboptimal care and scarcity of adequate outcome measures for clinical research.

Recent progress in molecular and imaging diagnostics has heralded a new era of personalized medicine in SCD. Precision medicine strategies are particularly timely since molecular therapeutics are finally on the horizon. This chapter will summarize the existing evidence and promising data on biomarkers for clinical care and research in SCD.

### Trends in blood transfusion among hospitalized children with sickle cell disease [^111dYitK]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Blood transfusions represent a major therapeutic option in the acute management of sickle cell disease (SCD). Few data exist documenting trends in transfusion among children with SCD, particularly during hospitalization.

- **Procedure**: This analysis examined cross-sectional data of hospital discharges within the Kid's Inpatient Database for the years 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. Hospitalizations for children (aged 0–18 years) with a primary or secondary SCD-related diagnosis were evaluated. The primary outcome was blood transfusion. Trends in transfusion were assessed using weighted multivariate logistic regression in a merged dataset, with the year being the primary independent variable. Co-variables included child and hospital characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted for the 2009 data to assess child and hospital-level factors associated with transfusion.

- **Results**: From 1997 to 2009, the percentage of SCD-related hospitalizations with transfusions increased from 14.2% to 28.8% (P < 0.0001). Among all SCD-related hospitalizations, the odds of transfusion increased by over 20% for each successive study interval. Hospitalizations with vaso-occlusive pain crisis (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.27–1.43) or acute chest syndrome/pneumonia (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13–1.35) as the primary diagnoses had the highest odds of transfusion for each consecutive study interval. Older age and male gender were associated with higher odds of transfusion.

- **Conclusions**: Blood transfusion is increasing over time among hospitalized children with SCD. Further study is warranted to identify indications contributing to this trend.

### Emergency medicine management of sickle cell disease complications: An evidence-based update [^115jLRRm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Due to alterations in the structural conformation of hemoglobin molecules under deoxygenated conditions, patients with SCD are predisposed to numerous sequelae, many of which require acute intervention.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an evidence-based update regarding the diagnosis and management of SCD complications.

- **Discussion**: SCD patients experience significant morbidity and mortality secondary to cerebrovascular accident, acute chest syndrome, acute vaso-occlusive pain crises, SCD-related multi-organ failure, cholecystitis, acute intrahepatic cholestasis, acute sickle hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration, priapism, and renal disease. Emergency physicians must recognize acute manifestations of SCD in order to deliver timely management and determine patient disposition.

- **Conclusions**: A comprehensive review of the emergency department management of acute SCD complications is provided. Comprehensive understanding of these aspects of SCD can assist physicians in expediting patient evaluation and treatment, thus decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with this hemoglobinopathy.
