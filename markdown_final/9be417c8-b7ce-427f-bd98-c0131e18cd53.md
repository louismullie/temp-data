## Question

how to manage high TSH, normal T4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage high TSH with normal free T4, i.e., subclinical hypothyroidism, including when to treat, how to monitor, and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding assay or transient causes. Then, I should stratify by TSH severity and patient-specific risk factors. Next, I will outline treatment thresholds and dosing, followed by monitoring plans. After that, I need to address special populations such as pregnancy, older adults, and children. Finally, I will consider rare etiologies like central hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone resistance, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways anchored in guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and avoid premature conclusions. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH with normal free T4, but I should verify persistence on repeat testing over 3 to 6 months because TSH has high biological variability and many individuals normalize spontaneously, especially in the 4.5–10 mIU/L range, so a single abnormal value is insufficient to label someone with SCH [^112VJzEn] [^116e2Ezy] [^112pWQ61]. Hold on, I should also check for analytical interference or transient contributors such as recent illness, recovery from hyperthyroidism, or assay issues; if results are discordant, I need to repeat testing, consider alternate platforms, or send to a reference lab to exclude heterophile antibodies or macro-TSH phenomena before committing to long-term management [^112jhSYv] [^114fiaqB].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and risk modifiers. I need to check for symptoms that could reflect hypothyroidism, assess cardiovascular risk, and look for goiter or thyroid autoimmunity, because these factors influence treatment decisions and prognosis in SCH [^1147cuNh]. Wait, let me verify antibody status; thyroid peroxidase antibodies increase the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and are commonly present in SCH, so documenting TPOAb helps with counseling and follow-up intensity [^1151QfPg].

> Now, I will stratify by TSH severity because this is pivotal. Mild elevations, typically 4.5–10 mIU/L, are common and often transient, whereas TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L carries a higher risk of progression and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, which shifts the balance toward treatment in many adults [^111CspHm]. I should double-check that I'm aligning with guideline thresholds; yes, most guidance uses 10 mIU/L as a key inflection point for considering therapy, while acknowledging uncertainty below that level [^112XrBR8] [^114LBMH9].

> For TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, I should confirm that treatment is generally indicated, especially with symptoms, positive TPOAb, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease, given higher risks of heart failure, coronary events, and mortality in this subgroup [^111CspHm] [^116GJCRE] [^1144hu97]. Let me think about dosing; I should start low and go slow, typically 25–50 mcg daily in adults, with lower starts in older patients or those with cardiac disease, and titrate every 6–8 weeks to a TSH target within the reference range, recognizing that overtreatment increases risks of atrial fibrillation and bone loss, particularly in the elderly [^113KWfGB] [^115ZzzzT] [^112JaoNb] [^111yYVBa].

> For TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, hold on, let's not jump to treatment. High-quality evidence shows no consistent improvement in quality of life or symptoms with levothyroxine in this range, so observation is reasonable for most, with individualized decisions for those with symptoms, positive TPOAb, goiter, or higher cardiovascular risk profiles [^114LBMH9] [^113WMKg9] [^1147cuNh]. I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized here; yes, guidelines recommend discussing uncertainties and patient preferences given minimal benefit and potential harms of overtreatment in this stratum [^114LBMH9] [^111trvZ4].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit. If untreated, I should recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–12 months, then annually if stable, with earlier reassessment if symptoms emerge or TSH rises. If treated, I should reassess TSH 6–8 weeks after any dose change and aim for a TSH in the reference range, adjusting by 12.5–25 mcg increments as needed while watching for iatrogenic hyperthyroidism [^115ZzzzT] [^112VJzEn] [^112JaoNb]. Wait, I should verify that I'm not overpromising symptom relief; RCTs in mild SCH show no consistent QoL benefit, so expectations must be tempered even when treating for cardiovascular risk or progression prevention [^114LBMH9] [^115D5oVA].

> Pregnancy is a special case where thresholds tighten. I should confirm that in women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, treatment is indicated when TSH is above trimester-specific limits or ≥ 2.5 mIU/L if TPOAb positive, with a goal to maintain TSH below 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester using trimester-specific reference ranges and close monitoring every 4–6 weeks [^111RdcN1] [^112K8EdX] [^117FnhsE]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even with normal free T4; yes, maternal SCH with TSH elevation carries increased miscarriage risk, especially with antibody positivity, justifying proactive treatment and monitoring in this context [^1163FDv1].

> In older adults, I should reconsider the TSH reference range and avoid overtreatment. Many individuals over 65 have TSH up to 7–8 mIU/L without clear benefit from levothyroxine, and treatment in those ≥ 65 with mild SCH has not improved outcomes in randomized trials, so observation is often preferred unless TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or there are compelling symptoms or risks [^1151QfPg]. Let me verify the natural history; spontaneous normalization is common when TSH is 5–10 mIU/L, reinforcing a conservative approach in this group [^11363Bwp] [^116e2Ezy].

> For children and adolescents, I should confirm that most cases of mild SCH resolve spontaneously and that routine treatment is not indicated. Monitoring every 6–12 months is reasonable, with treatment reserved for persistent TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, positive thyroid antibodies, goiter, growth failure, or symptoms, using weight-based levothyroxine dosing and careful follow-up of growth and puberty [^116qSWKu] [^113yEN4h]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought treatment was warranted for all with TSH > 10 mIU/L; let me reconsider — pediatric data emphasize high rates of spontaneous normalization, so even TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L warrants individualized decisions rather than automatic therapy [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the pattern is not primary hypothyroidism. I should double-check for central hypothyroidism when TSH is inappropriately normal or mildly elevated with low free T4, in which case TSH cannot guide therapy and free T4 should be titrated to the mid–upper normal range with clinical judgment guiding dose adjustments and monitoring intervals [^115QehcY] [^115iuzjg]. I also need to consider thyroid hormone resistance or a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma if free T4 and/or T3 are high with nonsuppressed TSH; in those scenarios, specialist evaluation, pituitary imaging, and genetic testing may be required to differentiate these rare entities before initiating any therapy [^11385f4o] [^115N9GwJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. First, confirm persistence of elevated TSH with normal free T4 on repeat testing after 3–6 months and exclude assay interference or transient causes. Second, assess symptoms, cardiovascular risk, goiter, and TPOAb. Third, if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, offer levothyroxine with low starting dose and cautious titration, whereas if TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L, favor observation with individualized treatment only for compelling symptoms, positive antibodies, goiter, or high cardiovascular risk. Fourth, in pregnancy or preconception, treat to trimester-specific targets when TSH is elevated or ≥ 2.5 mIU/L with positive TPOAb. Fifth, in older adults, avoid treating mild elevations and prioritize observation unless TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or there are strong indications. Finally, monitor TSH and free T4 at 6–12 month intervals if untreated, and 6–8 weeks after dose changes if treated, adjusting to keep TSH in the reference range while avoiding overtreatment [^116XK1nC] [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9] [^112K8EdX] [^115ZzzzT] [^112JaoNb].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm alignment with the strongest evidence: for most adults with SCH, especially TSH < 10 mIU/L, observation is preferred because levothyroxine does not improve quality of life or symptoms, while treatment at TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L is reasonable given higher risks of progression and cardiovascular events, with all decisions individualized and grounded in shared decision-making and careful monitoring to prevent iatrogenic harm [^114LBMH9] [^111CspHm] [^11777Vu1].

---

High TSH with normal free T4 is subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) [^11777Vu1]. Most patients do not require treatment; **observe and recheck TSH in 6–12 months** [^114LBMH9] [^116XK1nC]. Treat if TSH is **≥ 10 mIU/L**, if there are symptoms, goiter, or positive anti-TPO antibodies, or if pregnancy is planned or present [^111CspHm] [^1147cuNh] [^112K8EdX]. Use **levothyroxine** starting at 25–50 mcg/day, titrate to normalize TSH, and monitor every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually. Avoid overtreatment to prevent iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and bone loss [^113KWfGB] [^112VJzEn].

---

## Definition and diagnosis

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a **TSH above the upper limit of normal** with a normal free T4 [^1129gwkb]. Confirm persistence with repeat TSH and free T4 in 3–6 months [^116XK1nC], and exclude assay interference or transient causes [^112jhSYv].

---

## Clinical significance and progression risk

SCH is common and often benign; **annual progression to overt hypothyroidism is ~2.5% overall**, higher with TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or positive anti-TPO antibodies [^11777Vu1]. Many patients normalize spontaneously, especially when TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L [^116e2Ezy].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is **not routine**; reserve it for specific scenarios:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L | Increased risk of progression and cardiovascular events [^111CspHm] [^116GJCRE] |
| Symptoms of hypothyroidism | Potential symptom improvement with therapy [^1131kBp9] |
| Goiter or positive anti-TPO antibodies | Higher progression risk; treatment may slow goiter growth [^1151QfPg] |
| Pregnancy or planning pregnancy | Maternal-fetal benefits; target TSH < 2.5 mIU/L in first trimester [^115ZWWRV] [^117FnhsE] |

---

## Treatment approach

When indicated, **use levothyroxine**:

- **Initial dose**: 25–50 mcg/day (lower in elderly/cardiac patients) [^116fJhFR].
- **Titration**: Adjust every 6–8 weeks to normalize TSH [^115ZzzzT].
- **Monitoring**: Check TSH and free T4 every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually [^112VJzEn].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Untreated patients should have **TSH and free T4 rechecked in 6–12 months** [^1131kBp9]; if stable, extend intervals. Treated patients need TSH and free T4 every 6–8 weeks after dose changes until stable, then annually [^112ShkJj].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of treatment

Benefits include symptom improvement, lipid profile enhancement, and reduced progression risk in selected patients [^115D5oVA] [^116GJCRE]. Risks include **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism**, atrial fibrillation, and bone loss, especially in older adults [^114piSPH] [^111yYVBa].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly**: Higher TSH is common; avoid overtreatment and individualize decisions [^113kszhz].
- **Pregnancy**: Treat to TSH < 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester; monitor closely [^112K8EdX] [^117FnhsE].
- **Children**: Most normalize spontaneously; treat only if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or symptomatic [^116qSWKu].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Observe**: Most patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L and no symptoms [^114LBMH9].
- **Treat**: TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, symptoms, goiter, positive anti-TPO, or pregnancy [^111CspHm] [^1131kBp9].
- **Levothyroxine**: Start 25–50 mcg/day, titrate to normalize TSH [^116fJhFR].
- **Monitor**: Recheck TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months if untreated; every 6–8 weeks until stable if treated [^1131kBp9] [^115ZzzzT].

---

High TSH with normal free T4 defines subclinical hypothyroidism; **most patients do not need treatment**. Treat selectively based on TSH level, symptoms, antibodies, goiter, and pregnancy status, using levothyroxine with careful monitoring to avoid overtreatment [^11777Vu1].

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood, treatment or only follow-up? [^116qSWKu]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit with normal concentrations of free T4 (fT4). Its management remains challenging. The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory findings as well as the clinical course of children with SH followed in a third level hospital. Sixty-five patients aged between 2 and 18years old were retrospectively studied.

Methods

The patients were followed for a median period of 9months (range 6months to 24months). Those who normalized TSH levels were discharged (Group 1). If TSH persisted mildly elevated (5–10μUI/mL) with normal fT4 and negative TPOAb/TgAb, they were classified as Group 2 and followed semi-annually without treatment. Those patients whose TSH raised ≥ 10μUI/mL or who maintained TSH 5–10μUI/mL and positive TPOAb/TgAb were considered suitable for thyroxin therapy (Group 3, G3).

Results

In 89% of our patients, TSH concentrations spontaneously reverted to normality or remained stable without treatment (Groups 1 and 2), whereas less than 11% progressed to clinical hypothyroidism (Group 3). Baseline TSH was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 3. In group 3 the prevalence of female sex (71%) was higher and TPO antibodies were present in 85% of patients. The risk of developing overt hypothyroidism in patients with positive anti-thyroid antibodies respect to those who normalized TSH was 45 (95%CI 6.5–312.5).

Conclusion

Baseline TSH, female sex and the presence of thyroid autoimmunity were the best predictors of the evolution to SH over time.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Incidence and determinants of spontaneous normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults [^11363Bwp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

With increasing age, circulating levels of TSH generally rise, accompanied by a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated TSH level while the serum free T4 (fT4) concentration is within the normal range. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that treatment of mild subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults does not improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, it has been suggested to reevaluate the reference range for TSH in older adults. To this end, we need to further explore the natural course of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults. Interestingly, several studies in adults have shown that subclinical hypothyroidism can spontaneously normalize. However, it is not known what the most important determinants are for spontaneous TSH normalization in older adults. Enhanced understanding of the natural history and factors contributing to normalization may help clinical decision making on the follow-up strategy.

In this longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the incidence of spontaneous normalization of TSH levels and identify determinants of normalization in a large group of adults aged 65 years and older with (persistent) subclinical hypothyroidism. We combined individual participant level data from 2 randomized trials investigating the effect of levothyroxine treatment in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults With Subclinical Hypothyroidism Trial (TRUST) and Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO) trials. Because we were interested in spontaneous normalization, we only included the pretrial screening populations and the in-trial placebo groups of the 2 clinical trials.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood-current knowledge and open issues [^113yEN4h]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as serum levels of TSH above the upper limit of the reference range, in the presence of normal concentrations of total T 4 or free T 4. This biochemical profile might be an indication of mild hypothyroidism, with a potential increased risk of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular disease recorded among adults. Whether subclinical hypothyroidism results in adverse health outcomes among children is a matter of debate and so management of this condition remains challenging. Mild forms of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism do not seem to be associated with impairments in growth, bone health or neurocognitive outcome. However, ongoing scientific investigations have highlighted the presence of subtle proatherogenic abnormalities among children with modest elevations in their TSH levels. Although current findings are insufficient to recommend levothyroxine treatment for all children with mild asymptomatic forms of subclinical hypothyroidism, they highlight the potential need for assessment of cardiovascular risk among children with this condition. Increased understanding of the early metabolic risk factors associated with subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood will help to improve the management of affected individuals.

Postoperative thyroid function monitoring — testing schedule and coordination: After total thyroidectomy, testing of thyroid function should be coordinated with the patient's endocrinologist and/or primary care physician, and TSH level should be checked at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and T4 dose adjusted accordingly. The appropriate TSH level depends on multiple factors, including whether the patient has a diagnosis of TC of follicular cell origin and has ongoing features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115pVsK9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1138vdXP]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116Sn7Cd]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults — Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112JaoNb]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, particularly if patients have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

Regarding specific circumstances for thyroid hormone resistance, more specifically with respect to patients with resistance to thyroid hormone beta (management of hypothyroidism), ETA 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that elevated circulating TSH with normal free thyroid hormone concentrations in levothyroxine treatment of hypothyroidism (autoimmune or congenital) with coexisting resistance to thyroid hormone beta signifies under-replacement. Titrate levothyroxine therapy to achieve fT4 concentrations comparable to other family members (with resistance to thyroid hormone beta alone) or maintain concurrent high-normal thyroid stimulating-hormone and high free thyroid hormone concentrations, with monitoring of cardiac function to avoid overtreatment.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Hypothyroidism in the pregnant woman [^11237sgh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Around 1–2% of pregnant women receive levothyroxine treatment for overt hypothyroidism. This condition, which commonly has an autoimmune cause, is defined as a low plasma free thyroxine (T4) concentration and a raised plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. Around another 2.5% of pregnant women have subclinical ('compensated') hypothyroidism, which is defined as a raised plasma TSH concentration with a normal free T4 concentration. Here we review the evidence on whether such problems affect pregnancy outcome or the offspring and update our previous advice on the management of hypothyroidism in pregnancy; we do not cover postpartum thyroid disorders.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Association of subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease with mortality [^1144hu97]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

To what extent are subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations associated with mortality through cardiovascular disease among US adults?

Findings

In this cohort study of 9020 US adults, higher TSH levels were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Cardiovascular disease mediated 14.3% and 5.9% of the association of subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH concentrations with all-cause mortality, respectively.

Meaning

This study found that cardiovascular disease mediated the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and all-cause mortality, indicating that investigations are needed to examine the clinical benefit of medical intervention for people with elevated TSH concentrations.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113XGvyo]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of elevated TSH on levothyroxine — Variable adherence or nonadherence to LT4 therapy should be considered, and some patients with high TSH values while being prescribed LT4 were shown to be able to absorb LT4 normally and were thought to have poor adherence. Absorption testing can be conducted by administering a specific oral dose of LT4 under supervised conditions, measuring T4 concentrations at specific time points thereafter, and comparing the observed and predicted Cmax and AUC; doses of LT4, of 600 μg to 2 mg have been employed in absorption testing. One survey of patients prescribed LT4 found a self-reported nonadherence rate of 22%. Since LT4 is generally a lifelong medication, it is important for patients to identify a medication schedule that facilitates adherence; given the long half-life of LT4, patients can safely be advised to make up any omitted doses, and a weekly pill box may be helpful for identifying omitted doses. If a combination of a high TSH and a normal or high T4 concentration is documented by laboratory testing, this pattern could be consistent with the syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance, a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, a macro-TSH phenomenon, or recent resumption of LT4 therapy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Management of subclinical hypothyroidism… [^1131kBp9]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How should patients with subclinical hypothyroidism be managed. Evidence-Based Answer Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine may be of most benefit to patients with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism and those patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels higher than 10 μIU per mL or positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Evidence Summary Subclinical hypothyroidism is a laboratory diagnosis that refers to a patient with an elevated TSH level and a normal free thyroxine level. About 2 to 5 percent of these patients each year will develop overt hypothyroidism, 1–3 but the benefits of detecting and treating the subclinical disease are not well established. Patients with a TSH level higher than 10 μIU per mL but a normal FT4 level had a higher risk of developing overt hypothyroidism, but evidence that treatment with thyroid hormone replacement would improve patient-oriented outcomes was inconclusive. Similarly, the presence of anti-TPO antibodies predicted a higher risk of developing overt disease, but the evidence was insufficient to recommend routine measurement of anti-TPO antibodies. Recommendations from Others One expert panel recommends that TSH levels between 4. 5 and 10 μIU per mL should not be routinely treated, but patients with these levels should have thyroid function tests repeated at six- to 12-month intervals. 1 Patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism may benefit from a trial of levothyroxine while monitoring symptomatic improvement, although distinguishing a true therapeutic effect from placebo effect may be difficult.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends levothyroxine therapy for patients with TSH levels higher than 10 μIU per mL, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or goiter; the recommended starting dose of 25 to 50 mcg daily must be adjusted as necessary after repeating the TSH level in six to eight weeks. 2 Annual evaluation of TSH is appropriate after a level between 0. 3 and
3. 0 μIU per mL is achieved.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QehcY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### How does thyroid hormone profile differ on and off replacement treatment? [^116MtbCY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, normal TSH), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating L-thyroxine in female patients of childbearing age planning a pregnancy in the immediate future (including assisted reproduction) and in pregnant patients with normal serum TSH levels in the presence of current or past positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies, particularly with a history of miscarriage or past history of hypothyroidism.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116GJCRE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) — lipids and cardiovascular risk: Across included studies, 82% defined SCH as normal T4 with TSH 5–10 mIU/L and 18% as normal T4 with TSH 10 to 20 mIU/L; SCH cohorts generally show lipid abnormalities, with higher total cholesterol and LDL-C reported even when TSH < 10 mIU/L, though some studies find elevations only when TSH > 10 mIU/L. Lipid levels decrease after levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, with an Endocrine Society meta-analysis showing reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG after LT4 while lipids did not change in untreated SCH. Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data indicate increased CV events at TSH > 10 mIU/L; overall stroke risk was not increased for adults with SCH (TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L) but was significantly higher in those younger than 65 years, and across TSH 4.5 to 6.9, 7.0 to 9.9, and 10–19.9 mIU/L, fatal stroke rose with higher TSH without a significant trend. An individual participant meta-analysis (11 studies; 55 287 adults, including 3450 with SCH) found increased CVD risk with TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L but not at lower TSH; CHD mortality was increased for TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L and 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, reaching statistical significance only in the higher TSH group.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid hormone replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism [^115D5oVA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with normal free thyroid hormones values. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is 4% to 8% in the general population, and up to 15% to 18% in women who are over 60 years of age. There is considerable controversy regarding the morbidity, the clinical significance of subclinical hypothyroidism and if these patients should be treated.

To assess the effects of thyroid hormone replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. Ongoing trials databases, reference lists and abstracts of congresses were scrutinized as well.

Selection Criteria

All studies had to be randomised controlled trials comparing thyroid hormone replacement with placebo or no treatment in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. Minimum duration of follow-up was one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing or additional information.

Main Results

Twelve trials of six to 14 months duration involving 350 people were included. Eleven trials investigated levothyroxine replacement with placebo, one study compared levothyroxine replacement with no treatment. We did not identify any trial that assessed (cardiovascular) mortality or morbidity. Seven studies evaluated symptoms, mood and quality of life with no statistically significant improvement. One study showed a statistically significant improvement in cognitive function. Six studies assessed serum lipids, there was a trend for reduction in some parameters following levothyroxine replacement. Some echocardiographic parameters improved after levothyroxine replacement therapy, like myocardial relaxation, as indicated by a significant prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time as well as diastolic dysfunction. Only four studies reported adverse events with no statistically significant differences between groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. Some evidence indicates that levothyroxine replacement improves some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) — thyroid hormone replacement monitoring and dosing: We recommend against using serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CH. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) Many patients with CH have undetectable TSH levels on presentation, and almost all CH patients adequately treated with L-T4 to maintain serum fT4 levels in the mid to high-normal range will have undetectable TSH levels; therefore, clinicians should not interpret undetectable TSH levels as a sign of overtreatment in CH, even in patients with initial measurable TSH levels. A randomized controlled study of CH measured fT4 levels 2 hours after dose ingestion and reported slightly elevated mean fT4 levels with adequate doses; therefore, we recommend checking fT4 before the L-T4 dose. Alternate preparations of thyroid hormones or nutraceuticals are not recommended for treating CH.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

4) or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed. The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased.

Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, because of the minimal extent of the thyroid hormone deficiency, may be controlled with total daily dosages of levothyroxine as low as 25 to 50 μg. This initial dosage should be maintained for six to eight weeks before a TSH measurement is repeated to guide adjustment of the levothyroxine dosage. The goal is to maintain the TSH level within normal limits; the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased if the TSH level remains above normal and should be decreased if the TSH level falls below normal. Once the correct dosage of thyroxine is established, the frequency of TSH measurement may be decreased to every six to 12 months.

A common error is the failure to decrease the levothyroxine dosage if the TSH level is suppressed below the normal range, which may occur without the free T 4 level rising above normal. This state is considered to represent "subclinical hyperthyroidism, " and although formerly it was thought to be harmless, it is now believed to be associated with undesired effects on bone density and cardiac function, and to be a possible cause of neuropsychologic symptoms and other mild manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 16, 17.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained. A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment.

Management of confirmed hypophysitis includes replacement of deficient hormones (physiologic doses of steroids and thyroid hormone). In the presence of both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, steroids should always be started prior to thyroid hormone in order to avoid an adrenal crisis. High doses of steroids are necessary in the setting of severe headaches, vision changes or adrenal crisis. Both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism appear to represent long term sequelae of hypophysitis and lifelong hormonal replacement is needed in most cases. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed to obtain and carry a medical alert bracelet.

Thyroid dysfunction

Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6–20% of patients in large phase 3 clinical trials.

Hypothyroidism

Patients with unexplained fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, cold intolerance, constipation, depression and other recognized symptoms should be suspected of having hypothyroidism. Lab tests showing high TSH and low free T4 are indicative of biochemical hypothyroidism and, if present, additional testing for thyroid antibodies such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is warranted. Patients with confirmed hypothyroidism should be started on thyroid hormone, with repeat TSH and free T4 levels evaluated 6–8 weeks later. Once a maintenance dose is identified (TSH within normal range) clinical and biochemical re-evaluation should be undertaken every 12 months.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

Pregnancy — management of maternal hypothyroidism and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) patients: When a woman with hypothyroidism becomes pregnant, the dosage of L-thyroxine should be increased as soon as possible to ensure that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is < 2.5 mU/L and that serum total thyroxine (T4) is in the normal reference range for pregnancy; in TPOAb-positive pregnancies, serum TSH should be measured as soon as possible and if ≥ 2.5 mU/L, treatment should be initiated. Serum TSH and total T4 measurements should be monitored every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Total T4 increases predictably in pregnancy, with the reference range ~1.5 fold that of the nonpregnant range; the upper limit of normal for the first trimester is generally < 2.5 mIU/L with respective upper normal values for the second and third trimesters approximately 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels decline in the first trimester and rise after 10–12 weeks gestation.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### When to begin treatment in patients with elevated TSH… [^114Ch9kj]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The author recommends an "individualized" approach and gives several parameters to aid in decision-making. One important factor is missing from this discussion: the lipid panel. Patients with "mild thyroid failure" usually have dyslipidemia, which may be improved with thyroid hormone replacement. Indeed, mild hypothyroidism is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. I had the benefit of serving on two expert panels on this illness. However, lead investigators have convinced me that all patients with an elevated TSH level should be treated unless a contraindication is present. Improvement in several health parameters are often observed in patients who receive treatment, including improved well-being, improved lipid panel, and modest weight loss.

These patients are often overweight and lose weight much easier when their TSH is normal. In summary, I consider patients with an elevated TSH level as having hypothyroidism, and patients with normal free thyroxine level as having mild thyroid failure, which is a real condition. Why should physicians wait to treat these patients until they, if ever, progress to worse disease. Early treatment is beneficial, especially considering the lipid profile that results from an elevated TSH level. 1 on hypothyroidism in AFP. The issue of small elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone with normal thyroxine levels is still controversial. While it is recognized that hypothyroidism is clearly associated with elevations in cholesterol, 2 there are no population-based data showing that persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels. However, given these limitations, a patient at high risk for cardiac disease treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism with low doses of thyroxine probably carries more benefits than risks. For elderly, white women with low risk of cardiac disease, the risk of osteopenia from excessive thyroid use may outweigh any benefits of thyroid replacement. Therefore, I think we must individualize care for our patients with this condition rather than advocating blanket therapy with thyroxine.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

Laboratory evaluation for thyroid disease and nodules — The initial evaluation for all patients should include a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If TSH is suppressed, a free T4 and total T3 should be obtained, and a thyroid uptake scan should be obtained to assess if the index nodule is hyperfunctioning; such nodules have a low risk of malignancy and do not require FNAB.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^11314zSF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment and terminology: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 October to 24 November 2014. The USPSTF also clarified that the systematic evidence review searched for studies on the treatment of thyroid dysfunction that used placebo or no treatment as the comparator. The USPSTF notes there are no high-quality studies that show that treatment of "overt" thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons affects important health outcomes, and given the widespread practice of screening and the absence of high-quality evidence on effectiveness, a presumption that treatment is effective seems unwarranted. To reduce terminology confusion, the USPSTF believes alternative terms are needed and suggests the term "overt thyroid disease" to describe symptomatic patients who also have persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels. This recommendation replaces the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for thyroid disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XK1nC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1148sX8Q]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — post-lobectomy follow-up for TA: Following lobectomy for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the reference range (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). After lobectomy for TA, serum calcium levels do not need to be obtained and calcium and calcitriol supplements do not need to be administered. Thyroid hormone replacement is required in about 15%–20% of patients following thyroid lobectomy. TSH levels may remain in the high normal range for 3–6 months; therefore, continued monitoring for 4–6 months postoperatively is reasonable.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.
