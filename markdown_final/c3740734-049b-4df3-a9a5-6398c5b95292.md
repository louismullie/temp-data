## Question

Workup and management of gastroenteritis leading to frequent vomiting

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage gastroenteritis when frequent vomiting is present. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial stabilization and dehydration assessment. Then, I should verify red flags and the differential that would change management. Next, I will review what selective diagnostics are justified. After that, I need to outline management by severity, including the role of ondansetron, oral rehydration, nasogastric versus IV fluids, and special pharmacologic cautions. Finally, I should confirm disposition criteria, follow-up, and special populations, and consider prevention where applicable.

> Let me first confirm priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, and in vomiting patients I should ensure mental status, perfusion, and risk for aspiration are addressed while I obtain a focused history of fluid intake and output, vomiting frequency and duration, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and weight change; in children, I should double-check urine output and tears, and in adults, comorbidities and medications that could complicate volume status or electrolytes, since these directly inform dehydration severity and route of rehydration [^115AD1jk] [^115tX9y8].

> Wait, let me verify how to grade dehydration: bedside clinical scales can guide but are imperfect, so I should use a structured approach such as the four-item Clinical Dehydration Scale in children (appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, tears; 0–8) and interpret it alongside vitals, skin turgor, capillary refill, and mental status while acknowledging these tools can misclassify severity and should not be used in isolation to drive aggressive therapy without reassessment [^115xEro7] [^115swQN4] [^117VVp7x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I need to screen for red flags that warrant escalation or alternative pathways — bilious or bloody emesis, severe or localized abdominal pain raising concern for surgical causes, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, or inability to retain any fluids; in infants under 3 months, bilious vomiting demands urgent imaging to evaluate for obstruction or malrotation, and in older children with shock or hypotension, immediate IV resuscitation is indicated while diagnostics proceed in parallel [^1111oujr] [^112r2PYE] [^111GcL98].

> I will now examine the differential before labeling this "simple gastroenteritis": if vomiting is recurrent and stereotyped with symptom-free intervals, I should consider cyclic vomiting syndrome using Rome IV criteria and plan a limited, high-yield workup once the acute episode abates; if vomiting is profuse with lethargy and pallor in young children, I should consider FPIES and distinguish it from sepsis or common gastroenteritis; if bilious vomiting occurs in infants, I must rule out obstruction; and if symptoms are chronic, I should think about gastroparesis, functional nausea and vomiting, medication effects, or central causes; I should also remember Dietl's crisis (intermittent ureteropelvic junction obstruction) can mimic CVS and can be rapidly screened with renal POCUS when episodes are stereotyped [^1154xBoH] [^115bRq5u] [^1111oujr] [^115tX9y8] [^1162b27s] [^112HCynJ].

> Next, I should review what testing is appropriate: in likely viral, mild cases, no labs are needed; in moderate-to-severe dehydration or atypical presentations, I should check electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, and glucose, reserving stool studies for dysentery, high fever, immunocompromise, suspected outbreaks, or severe disease; imaging is targeted — urgent evaluation for obstruction in bilious vomiting infants, plain radiographs only when obstruction is suspected, and renal ultrasound if I suspect Dietl's crisis; for chronic or unexplained vomiting, upper endoscopy after rehydration can exclude structural mimics such as gastric volvulus [^116t5QFh] [^111GcL98] [^1111oujr] [^1162b27s] [^112HCynJ].

> Let me think about mild dehydration management: oral rehydration therapy is first-line and usually sufficient, with continued, age-appropriate diet rather than restrictive regimens; in children, half-strength apple juice followed by preferred liquids performs comparably to formal ORS for mild dehydration, although reduced-osmolarity ORS remains appropriate and is preferred as dehydration worsens; in adults, most can maintain balance with water, juices, sports drinks, soups, and crackers; a single oral ondansetron dose can facilitate ORT and reduce vomiting, but wait, I should double-check the age nuance — trials support use in children ≥ 6 months, while IDSA specifically notes pediatric patients over 4 years and adolescents, so I need to align use with local policy and patient risk, and avoid routine use in nondehydrated children per RCT data [^117VVp7x] [^116t5QFh] [^117NKqpB] [^111Fwbx2] [^117S7csM] [^112bDBgK].

> For moderate dehydration, I should confirm that reduced-osmolarity ORS is first-line, administer a single oral ondansetron dose before ORT to improve tolerance, and, if the child cannot drink but is otherwise stable, use nasogastric ORS rather than moving directly to IV fluids; let me verify systems approaches — triage nurse–initiated protocols that start ondansetron and ORT early reduce IV use and unnecessary labs without compromising safety, which supports implementing pathway-based care [^116t5QFh] [^111Fwbx2] [^1117Tzi7] [^112yLZik] [^115o4L45].

> Severe dehydration or shock requires IV therapy; I should start with isotonic crystalloid boluses, typically 20 mL/kg, with frequent reassessment of perfusion, mental status, and urine output, and I need to ensure I do not over-resuscitate; WHO Plan C recommends 100 mL/kg in two phases, but hold on, I should verify applicability — evidence suggests clinical signs often overestimate true deficits and rapid regimens may not generalize beyond cholera, so I should titrate to clinical response and stop when rehydration is achieved; early IV dextrose may help terminate vomiting in select patients, and once urine output is established, I can add potassium to maintenance fluids [^117Bv1Gb] [^112r2PYE] [^117XwQth] [^115swQN4] [^115jLK8E].

> I need to check antiemetic and adjunctive pharmacology: ondansetron is the antiemetic of choice to facilitate ORT in appropriate pediatric patients, but I should avoid multiple doses and IV administration unless there is a compelling indication; alternatives like domperidone have less robust evidence and safety concerns, and in adults, dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide can be considered when etiology suggests benefit; I should reconsider probiotics because recent large trials show no benefit and potential harm in some settings [^111Fwbx2] [^117S7csM] [^1134Czzk] [^114THufC] [^115tX9y8].

> But wait, what about antibiotics and antidiarrheals: I should confirm that antibiotics are not routine for presumed viral gastroenteritis and reserve them for specific indications such as febrile dysentery, prolonged or severe illness suggestive of bacterial etiologies, or immunocompromise, recognizing they do not shorten stay in uncomplicated cases; in adults, loperamide may be used only when there is no fever or blood in stool and should be avoided in children [^116t5QFh] [^1114Yef4] [^116PfkuA] [^117V6B7Z] [^117NKqpB].

> I will now examine disposition: discharge is appropriate once patients tolerate oral fluids without excessive emesis, urine output is normalizing, pain is controlled, and reliable caregivers can provide follow-up; admission is warranted for severe dehydration, persistent vomiting despite ondansetron with failed ORT or NG therapy, age under 6 months, significant comorbidities or immunocompromise, or social barriers that preclude safe care; at home, I should advise continuing ORS with replacement of ongoing losses and give clear return precautions for decreased urine output, persistent vomiting, lethargy, or worsening abdominal pain [^117VVp7x] [^116t5QFh].

> Next, I should review special populations: for infants under 3 months, I need a low threshold for admission and urgent imaging when bilious vomiting is present because surgical causes are common and time-sensitive; for the elderly, I must tailor fluid choices considering renal or cardiac comorbidities and recognize higher risk of electrolyte derangements; in pregnancy, I should rule out hyperemesis gravidarum with appropriate evaluation and prefer ORT when feasible while individualizing antiemetic use based on obstetric guidance [^1111oujr] [^117NKqpB] [^113pHt9M].

> Let me reconsider recurrent vomiting phenotypes: if the pattern suggests cyclic vomiting syndrome, I should arrange gastroenterology follow-up, perform a limited evaluation including CBC, electrolytes, glucose, liver panel, lipase, urinalysis, and EGD after rehydration to exclude structural mimics, and consider supportive nutrition, including enteral or parenteral routes, if attacks prevent intake for several days; critically, I should verify that ureteropelvic junction obstruction is not the culprit when episodes are stereotyped by using focused renal ultrasound when appropriate [^112HCynJ] [^1173E9Pp] [^1162b27s].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention is addressed when relevant: rotavirus immunization for eligible infants reduces severe diarrheal disease burden, and in suspected norovirus clusters, meticulous hand hygiene, exclusion policies, and environmental cleaning are essential control measures alongside hydration-focused management [^116twHoq] [^117VVp7x].

The workup for gastroenteritis with frequent vomiting centers on **clinical assessment of dehydration** [^117VVp7x] and exclusion of red flags (shock, altered mental status, severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, or blood in stool) [^111GcL98]. Routine labs are not needed for mild cases [^115tX9y8]; obtain electrolytes, glucose, and renal function if moderate–severe dehydration or red flags are present. Oral rehydration with **reduced-osmolarity ORS** is first-line for mild–moderate dehydration [^116t5QFh]; use ondansetron to facilitate ORT when vomiting persists [^111Fwbx2]. Escalate to **IV isotonic fluids** for severe dehydration or ORT failure [^117Bv1Gb], and reserve antibiotics for specific indications (e.g. dysentery, immunocompromise) [^1114Yef4]. Early refeeding [^117VVp7x] and strict hand hygiene are essential [^117VVp7x]; admit for severe dehydration, shock, or inability to tolerate fluids [^117VVp7x].

---

## Clinical assessment and initial evaluation

### History and physical examination

For the **history** [^111GcL98], assess onset, duration, and frequency of vomiting; associated symptoms (diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain); recent travel; sick contacts; dietary history; medication use; and comorbidities [^115tX9y8]. The **physical examination** should evaluate general appearance, vital signs, hydration status (capillary refill, skin turgor, mucous membranes, fontanelle in infants) [^115xEro7], and include an abdominal and neurologic assessment [^117VVp7x].

---

### Assessment of dehydration severity

Severity is categorized as **mild, moderate, or severe**. Mild dehydration presents with minimal clinical signs, normal vital signs, and slight thirst; moderate with tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes, and delayed capillary refill; and severe with hypotension, lethargy, shock, markedly delayed capillary refill, and minimal urine output [^115xEro7] [^116t5QFh].

---

### Red flag symptoms requiring immediate attention

- Persistent vomiting (> 24–48 hours)
- Inability to retain fluids
- Signs of severe dehydration or shock
- Altered mental status
- Severe abdominal pain
- Blood in vomitus or stool
- Immunocompromised status
- Very young infants (< 3 months) [^1111oujr] [^115tX9y8]

---

## Laboratory and diagnostic testing

Routine laboratory testing is generally unnecessary in mild cases [^116t5QFh], but evaluation is indicated with moderate to severe dehydration, persistent vomiting (> 48 hours), red flag symptoms, or in immunocompromised patients [^116PfkuA]. Recommended tests include **serum electrolytes, glucose, and renal function**; obtain blood gas analysis if severe dehydration or metabolic disturbance is suspected, and reserve stool studies for severe illness, persistent symptoms, immunocompromised hosts, or suspected outbreaks. Imaging with abdominal ultrasound or X-ray is reserved for suspected complications or alternative diagnoses such as obstruction or intussusception [^11251zsX] [^114NvTJh].

---

## Management strategies

### Rehydration therapy

Rehydration is the **cornerstone of management** [^111s7q5h]. The choice of rehydration method depends on the severity of dehydration and the patient's ability to tolerate oral intake [^116UtX9W].

---

#### Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)

- **Indication**: First-line for mild to moderate dehydration [^111s7q5h].
- **Solution**: Reduced-osmolarity ORS (75 mmol/L sodium, 75 mmol/L glucose, osmolarity 245 mOsm/L) [^116t5QFh].
- **Administration**: Small, frequent sips (5–10 mL every 1–2 minutes); increase gradually as tolerated.
- **Adjunct**: Ondansetron may be used to facilitate ORT in children with persistent vomiting [^111Fwbx2] [^117S7csM].

---

#### Intravenous (IV) rehydration

IV rehydration is indicated for **severe dehydration, shock, or failure of ORT** [^117Bv1Gb]. Use isotonic solutions (normal saline or Ringer's lactate) and deliver 20 mL/kg boluses for severe dehydration or shock, repeating as needed. After stabilization, provide maintenance fluids using the 4–2–1 rule (4 mL/kg/h for the first 10 kg, 2 mL/kg/h for the next 10 kg, and 1 mL/kg/h for remaining weight).

---

### Antiemetic therapy

Ondansetron is effective in **reducing vomiting**, facilitating ORT, and decreasing the need for IV fluids and hospitalization [^117S7csM]. A single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg (maximum 8 mg) is recommended in children with persistent vomiting [^115TaTXr]. Avoid routine use of multiple doses due to potential adverse effects, including diarrhea and QT prolongation [^1134Czzk] [^114THufC].

---

### Nutritional management

Resume age-appropriate feeding within 4–6 hours after rehydration; continue breastfeeding or formula for infants, and return to a regular diet for older children. Avoid restrictive diets, as **early refeeding** supports recovery and maintains nutritional status [^117VVp7x].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** [^116PfkuA]; reserve use for severe bacterial infections (e.g. dysentery, cholera) or in immunocompromised patients [^111toLwQ] [^1114Yef4].

---

## Prevention of complications

Prevent complications by closely **monitoring hydration status**, electrolyte balance, and nutritional status. Educate caregivers on recognizing dehydration, administering ORT correctly, and when to seek medical attention, and emphasize strict hand hygiene and infection control to limit transmission [^115AD1jk] [^116UtX9W].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

- Severe dehydration or shock
- Persistent vomiting despite antiemetic therapy
- Inability to tolerate oral or nasogastric rehydration
- Significant electrolyte disturbances
- Altered mental status or severe systemic illness
- Immunocompromised patients
- Very young infants (< 3 months) [^117VVp7x] [^117Bv1Gb]

---

## Follow-up care and patient education

Arrange **follow-up within 24–48 hours** to reassess hydration status and clinical improvement [^117VVp7x]. Reinforce the importance of adequate hydration, early refeeding, hand hygiene, and recognition of warning signs, and ensure that infants receive rotavirus vaccination to prevent severe gastroenteritis [^116twHoq] [^1171KLXE] [^1125i3wt].

## Summary table: management of gastroenteritis with frequent vomiting

| **Severity** | **Rehydration** | **Antiemetic** | **Nutrition** | **Hospitalization** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | ORT | Not routinely | Early refeeding | No |
| Moderate | ORT ± ondansetron | Single dose | Early refeeding | If ORT fails |
| Severe | IV fluids | Ondansetron | Delayed until stable | Yes |

---

Management of gastroenteritis with frequent vomiting centers on **rehydration therapy**, antiemetic use, and early nutritional support. Hospitalization is reserved for severe cases or complications, and patient education is essential for prevention and follow-up care [^116UtX9W].

### Gastroenteritis in children [^117VVp7x]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is defined as a diarrheal disease of rapid onset, with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain. In the United States, acute gastroenteritis accounts for 1.5 million office visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths in children each year. Evaluation of a child with acute gastroenteritis should include a recent history of fluid intake and output. Significant dehydration is unlikely if parents report no decrease in oral intake or urine output and no vomiting.

The physical examination is the best way to evaluate hydration status. The four-item Clinical Dehydration Scale can be used to determine the severity of dehydration based on physical examination findings. In children with mild illness, stool microbiological tests are not routinely needed when viral gastroenteritis is the likely diagnosis. Mild gastroenteritis in children can be managed at home. Oral rehydration therapy, such as providing half-strength apple juice followed by the child's preferred liquids, is the mainstay of treatment for mild dehydration and is as effective as intravenous rehydration for preventing hospitalization and return to the emergency department. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended for moderate dehydration.

Ondansetron may be prescribed if needed to prevent vomiting and improve tolerance of oral rehydration solutions. Hospitalization and intravenous fluids are recommended for children who do not respond to oral rehydration therapy plus an antiemetic, and patients with severe dehydration (i.e. signs of shock or more than 10% dehydration).

### Norovirus illnesses in children and adolescents [^115AD1jk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of childhood vomiting and diarrhea in the United States and globally. Although most illnesses caused by norovirus are self-resolving, severe outcomes may occur from dehydration, including hospitalization and death. A vast majority of deaths from norovirus occur in developing countries. Immunocompromised children are at risk for more severe outcomes. Treatment of norovirus illness focuses on early correction of dehydration and maintenance of fluid status and nutrition. Hand hygiene, exclusion of ill individuals, and environmental cleaning are important for norovirus outbreak prevention and control, and vaccines to prevent norovirus illness are currently under development.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116t5QFh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute diarrhea, specifically in relation to oral rehydration, the IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend administering a reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution as first-line therapy. This is advised for mild-to-moderate dehydration in infants, pediatric, and adult patients with acute diarrhea from any cause. It is also recommended for patients experiencing mild-to-moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea.

### Therapy of acute gastroenteritis: role of antibiotics [^1114Yef4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhea remains a very common health problem, even in the industrialized world. One of the dilemmas in assessing patients with acute diarrhea is deciding when to test for etiological agents and when to initiate antimicrobial therapy. The management and therapy of acute gastroenteritis is discussed in two epidemiological settings: community-acquired diarrhea and travelers' diarrhea. Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute gastroenteritis, as the illness is usually self-limiting. Antimicrobial therapy can also lead to adverse events, and unnecessary treatments contribute to resistance development. Nevertheless, empirical antimicrobial therapy may be necessary in certain situations, such as patients with febrile diarrheal illness, fever and bloody diarrhea, symptoms persisting for more than one week, or an immunocompromised status.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally result from infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to various conditions.

- **Gastrointestinal etiologies**: Include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases.
- **Central nervous system etiologies**: Primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure and typically cause other neurologic signs.
- **Endocrinologic causes**: Pregnancy is the most common and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age.
- **Other causes**: Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses may also cause nausea and vomiting.

Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications requiring hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Antiemetic drug use in children: What the clinician needs to know [^114THufC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Vomiting is not only unpleasant for both children and families but can lead to frequent hospital admissions. Persistent vomiting hampers oral intake and increases the risk of dehydration, making the proper use of antiemetic drugs crucial. The pharmacological treatment of vomiting in children remains a challenge for pediatricians because several antiemetics are prescribed "off-label", outside their authorized drug label. Domperidone and ondansetron are the most commonly known antiemetic drugs.

A single oral dose of ondansetron has been shown to reduce the risk of re-vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids, and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis. There is enough evidence to support ondansetron administration in children, defining the clinical use as "off-label/on evidence". This review aims to provide an overview of the therapeutic use, safety, and main pharmacological properties of antiemetic drugs in children.

A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed MEDLINE database was carried out to identify all articles published in English from 1998 to February 2018. At present, the "off-label/on-evidence" use of some antiemetics could improve the success rate of oral rehydration therapy in pediatric emergency settings and change the management of vomiting by preventing complications.

### Rotavirus infection: A disease of the past [^1171KLXE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children worldwide. Vaccination is the only control measure likely to have a significant impact on the incidence of severe disease. Rotavirus vaccines have reduced the burden of disease in the United States and Europe, and vaccine programs are being introduced in Asia and Africa, where it is hoped that the vaccine will have a significant impact on severe infection. Long-term monitoring and strain surveillance are needed to assess the effects of rotavirus immunization programs and to determine whether changes in strain ecology will affect rotavirus vaccine effectiveness.

### It's not cyclic vomiting syndrome until Dietl's is ruled out: A case for point of care renal ultrasound [^1162b27s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain and vomiting are frequent complaints for pediatric patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). When a diagnosis such as chronic abdominal pain, cyclic vomiting, or abdominal migraine has previously been made, it can lead to diagnostic momentum and confirmation bias on behalf of the treating physician. Dietl's crisis is a commonly missed diagnosis in the pediatric population that presents with intermittent episodes of pain and vomiting. It can be readily diagnosed at the bedside by the emergency physician (EP) through the employment of point of care ultrasound (POCUS).

- **Case series**: We present two cases of pediatric patients with episodic abdominal pain and vomiting who were previously diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. In both cases, pediatric gastroenterology evaluations had occurred with negative diagnostic testing having been performed. Both patients also presented to their primary pediatrician and the ED multiple times, with each encounter resulting in treatment of symptoms and discharge. Each patient eventually presented to the ED when an EP was present, who performed a renal POCUS. In each patient, the POCUS revealed severe unilateral hydronephrosis. Subsequent workup confirmed the diagnosis of Dietl's crisis as the etiology of symptoms.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: In pediatric patients, EPs should be wary of the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome until ureteral obstruction has been ruled out. A bedside POCUS can rapidly establish this diagnosis and potentially preclude recurrent healthcare visits.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Knf24]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Efficacy (secondary) outcomes**: Time to successful rehydration was measured as continuous or categorized data. Any definition of 'successful rehydration' pre-specified in the manuscript was acceptable, based on clinical parameters such as weight gain, improved urinary output, increased skin turgor, improved level of consciousness, and the ability to keep down oral fluids. The length of hospital stay was recorded either as continuous or categorized data, and the mean duration of diarrhea was noted in hours or days, also as continuous or categorized data. Treatment failure used any criteria defined in the manuscript.

- **Study type**: We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Search methods for identification of studies**:

### Hospital management of children with acute gastroenteritis [^112yLZik]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a major cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and the prescription of investigations, drugs, and dietary changes. Several guidelines on management have been produced.

- **Recent findings**: There is new information on different rehydration protocols, and the use of antiemetics and antidiarrheal drugs that could reduce the burden of AGE. The need for intravenous (i.v.) rehydration is the main cause of hospital admission, yet a standardized rehydration scheme is not available. Rehydration therapy through a nasogastric tube is better than i.v. rehydration in children with moderate-severe dehydration. Ultrarapid rehydration has been proposed via enteric or i.v. routes to reduce time in the hospital and costs. However, reduced rehydration times are associated with high readmission rates and side effects. Antiemetics may reduce the need for i.v. rehydration due to vomiting and the number of hospital admissions. However, the main antiemetic, ondansetron, has been associated with potentially severe side effects. Selected antidiarrheal drugs could reduce the length of stay, but data on their use in inpatients are still not conclusive.

- **Summary**: Inappropriate medical interventions remain common in the hospital setting and have a high impact on costs. A validated management protocol is still needed for inpatients.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112r2PYE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

For children with moderate to severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE), rehydration with oral or intravenous isotonic fluids to correct fluid and electrolyte deficits and ongoing losses is the mainstay of treatment. Where oral rehydration is not feasible, rehydration by nasogastric tube is the preferred option and is recommended before intravenous rehydration in some guidelines. However, some aspects of management recommendations are controversial. First, the decision to treat with either oral or intravenous fluids is largely based upon an assessment of the level of dehydration, which has been shown to be notoriously unreliable. Second, although the evidence supporting the recommendations is scant, World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the treatment of severe dehydration ('Plan C') are based on the rapid, intravenous administration of isotonic fluids. Plan C recommends a minimum of 100 ml/kg, the equivalent volume replacement for losses in those with 10% dehydration. Plan C is given in two stages over 3–6 hours, dependent on age.

- **Initial stage**: Recommends an initial 30 ml/kg to be administered rapidly (30–60 minutes).
- **Second stage**: The remaining 70 ml/kg is administered more slowly over 2.5–5 hours in infants under 12 months and older children.

For those with hypovolemic shock, initial management recommends fluid boluses (of up to 60 ml/kg), followed by step 2 of Plan C, which is 70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 hours. While this aggressive regimen may be appropriate for cholera, the only infective cause of secretory diarrhea (leading to excess fluid and electrolyte loss), it may not be generalizable to non-cholera cases.

### Oral ondansetron administration to nondehydrated children with diarrhea and associated vomiting in emergency departments in Pakistan: A randomized controlled trial [^112bDBgK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

We also found antibiotic use to be surprisingly common both before ED arrival and in the ED itself, despite the fact that international guidelines recommend against antibiotic treatment for nonbloody diarrhea. Our findings are in keeping with those of other reports, including the recently completed Malnutrition and Enteric Disease birth cohort study (2,134 children from 8 sites in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, and the United Republic of Tanzania) that reported antibiotic use in 44% of cases of nonbloody diarrhea.

In summary, our findings do not provide evidence to support the routine administration of a single dose of oral ondansetron for the prevention of intravenous fluid administration in children with gastroenteritis but without evidence of dehydration.

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: Pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^112tphpt]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Other potential explanations could include the existence of a time lag between intravascular volume repletion and the resolution of clinical dehydration, or that the clinical dehydration scale overestimated the severity of dehydration in our study population. While no data are available to support the former hypothesis, the dehydration scale used has previously performed well in evaluating children similar to those enrolled in our study. The scale, however, might have overestimated the severity of dehydration in some children, as our standard rehydration protocol (20 mL/kg) was sufficient to rehydrate many of the study participants.

In addition to lacking evidence of effectiveness, the routine use of intravenous fluid bolus treatment should be reconsidered as children initially diagnosed with gastroenteritis might have alternative or coexistent disease processes that, when treated with rapid intravenous rehydration, might result in important complications. Examples include patients with myocarditis who, if given excessive volumes of intravenous fluids, can suddenly decompensate, and those with diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetes insipidus who can develop cerebral oedema.

### External validation of the clinical dehydration scale for children with acute gastroenteritis [^115xEro7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to validate the clinical dehydration scale (CDS) for children with gastroenteritis in a different pediatric emergency department (ED) from where it was initially derived and validated.

A prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care pediatric ED over a one-year period. A sample of triage nurses was trained in applying the CDS. The CDS consists of four clinical characteristics: general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears. Each characteristic is scored 0, 1, or 2, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 8. A score of 0 represents no dehydration; 1 to 4 indicates some dehydration; and 5 to 8 signifies moderate/severe dehydration. Children aged 1 month to 5 years with vomiting and/or diarrhea who had the CDS documented at triage and a final diagnosis of gastroenteritis, gastritis, or enteritis were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included chronic disease, treatment with intravenous (IV) rehydration within the previous 24 hours, a visit to the ED for the same illness in the 7 days prior to arrival, and diarrhea lasting more than 10 days. The primary outcome measured was the length of stay (LOS) in the ED from the time of seeing a physician to discharge, analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test.

From April 2008 to March 2009, a total of 150 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 22 (± 14) months, ranging from 4 months to 4 years, were enrolled. Fifty-six patients had no dehydration, 74 had some dehydration, and 20 had moderate/severe dehydration. The median LOS in the ED after being seen by a physician was significantly longer as children appeared more dehydrated according to the CDS.

### Oral ondansetron for gastroenteritis in a pediatric emergency department [^111Fwbx2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Vomiting limits the success of oral rehydration in children with gastroenteritis. We conducted a double-blind trial to determine whether a single oral dose of ondansetron, an antiemetic, would improve outcomes in children with gastroenteritis.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 215 children aged 6 months to 10 years who were treated in a pediatric emergency department for gastroenteritis and dehydration. After being randomly assigned to treatment with orally disintegrating ondansetron tablets or placebo, the children received oral rehydration therapy according to a standardized protocol. The primary outcome was the proportion who vomited while receiving oral rehydration. The secondary outcomes were the number of episodes of vomiting and the proportions who were treated with intravenous rehydration or hospitalized.

- **Results**: As compared with children who received placebo, children who received ondansetron were less likely to vomit (14 percent vs. 35 percent; relative risk, 0.40; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.61) and vomited less often (mean number of episodes per child, 0.18 vs. 0.65; P < 0.001). They also had greater oral intake (239 mL vs. 196 ml; P = 0.001) and were less likely to be treated by intravenous rehydration (14 percent vs. 31 percent; relative risk, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.79). Although the mean length of stay in the emergency department was reduced by 12 percent in the ondansetron group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.02), the rates of hospitalization (4 percent and 5 percent, respectively; P = 1.00) and of return visits to the emergency department were not significantly different between the groups.

### Estimating foodborne gastroenteritis, Australia [^114qy8Lj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The definition of community gastroenteritis used in this Australian study refers to moderate-to-severe illness, characterized by at least three loose stools or two episodes of vomiting in a single day. To improve the specificity of our definition for enteric illness, we excluded patients with concomitant respiratory symptoms unless they exhibited more severe symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting. Previous studies have found similarly high rates of respiratory symptoms among cases of gastroenteritis. A definition inclusive of milder illnesses would lead to a higher estimate of foodborne gastroenteritis, whereas a definition that included only more severe illness would lead to a lower estimate.

We also took account of those with respiratory symptoms in our definition of community gastroenteritis, although most studies estimating the prevalence of gastroenteritis have not considered this aspect. A United States study adjusted for those with respiratory illness by excluding a proportion of case-patients who were believed to have symptoms secondary to respiratory infections rather than a primary enteric infection. The UK definition of gastroenteritis differs from the Australian definition in several ways. While differing arguments can be presented regarding the best definition of gastroenteritis, the main concern is to establish a consistent and reasonable definition for comparative purposes.

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^112rXpbB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

There are significant challenges in developing, modifying, or validating the measures for outcome assessment to evaluate patients with CVS and related treatments. Although these challenges may also apply to other GI conditions, they tend to be magnified in CVS because of the nature of the disease: (1) absence of tools to objectively diagnose CVS and assess treatment effect; (2) heterogeneity and episodic nature of CVS disease presentation, course, and response to treatment, while having unknown or incomplete disease natural history; (3) affecting vulnerable populations who live with many comorbidities and are associated with significant disability.

First, the diagnosis of CVS is based on a set of clinical criteria called the Rome IV criteria, as there is no validated biomarker for the diagnosis of CVS. Assessment of future CVS drugs relies on subjectively reported PRO data (e.g. vomiting, retching, nausea), and there are rigorous requirements from the key stakeholders (e.g. the FDA) to assess treatment efficacy, particularly when PRO is the primary endpoint. So far, there has been no PRO instrument developed and validated specifically for CVS.

Second, the mechanisms involved in the perception of DGBIs are complex. While patients with CVS have intense episodes of vomiting, the interval between consecutive episodes can vary between a few weeks to several months apart. This variability requires well-designed natural history studies to have a balanced design that is not too burdensome for patients, while still able to secure quality data entry.

### Diagnostic characteristics of pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113DVHjo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) remains a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific presentation, despite consensus-based diagnostic criteria. There is a need for improved, evidence-based diagnostic criteria. We hypothesized that symptoms differ quantitatively between children with CVS and those with other vomiting conditions and that the current diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently sensitive for diagnosing CVS.

- **Methods**: An observational, prospective study was conducted with children aged 3–18 years experiencing unexplained vomiting episodes. They were evaluated in outpatient gastroenterology clinics, emergency departments, and inpatient units at Children's Wisconsin. Parents completed symptom surveys at 0, 3, and 6 months. Diagnostic workup and treatment response were monitored by chart review. A final diagnosis (CVS vs. non-CVS) was assigned for group comparisons and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of diagnostic cutoffs.

- **Results**: Of the 108 subjects enrolled, 46 had CVS, and 54 had non-CVS conditions. The groups reported different frequencies of episodes, with more CVS patients (81%) having ≥ 4 episodes in the preceding 12 months compared to non-CVS patients (55%) (p = 0.013). CVS patients also experienced longer vomiting episodes (p = 0.03). ROC analyses revealed the highest sensitivity for distinguishing CVS from non-CVS was a frequency of 4–10 episodes in 12 months (p = 0.002) and a duration threshold of > 2 hours (p < 0.001). CVS patients reported specific episode characteristics, including photophobia (p = 0.003), diaphoresis (p = 0.002), multiple emeses per hour (p = 0.001), stereotypical episodes (p = 0.008), and continued retching after gastric emptying.

### Effects of rotavirus vaccination coverage among infants on hospital admission for gastroenteritis across all age groups, Japan, 2011–2019 [^1125i3wt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Gastroenteritis is one of the most common infectious diseases, characterized by a rapid onset of diarrhea with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Enteric viruses and bacteria are major causes of gastroenteritis, although the causes of hospitalizations related to gastroenteritis are often unidentified. Gastroenteritis affects persons of all ages and is a leading cause of death worldwide; younger children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients, in particular, are at risk of severe gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits continue to be significant burdens on health systems.

Rotavirus is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and diarrhea, including fatal illnesses, in both young children and persons of all ages. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the pooled rotavirus prevalence was 7.6% (95% CI 6.2%–9.2%) among persons over 5 years of age with diarrhea. Rotavirus infection is estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths annually in children under 5 years of age. Since 2006, oral live-attenuated rotavirus vaccines for infants have been implemented worldwide. The World Health Organization in 2009 recommended routine immunization for all infants to prevent rotavirus disease.

In Japan, the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2011 to be administered to infants aged 2–8 months. Rotavirus vaccination coverage in Japan gradually increased from 30% in 2012 to 78% in 2019; however, the disparity among prefectures in coverage rates remains relatively high, approximately 30% in 2019. The implementation of rotavirus vaccines has substantially…

### ACR appropriateness criteria vomiting in infants up to 3 months of age [^1111oujr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). High credibility.

Vomiting is a commonly reported symptom in infants less than three months of age. There are a multitude of pathologies to consider, both within and outside the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to conducting a thorough history and physical examination, a clinician formulates a reasonable differential diagnosis by considering two main factors: the infant's age and the characterization of the vomit as bilious or nonbilious. In this endeavor, the clinician can determine if an imaging study is needed and, if so, the urgency of the request.

A review of the appropriate imaging evaluation of vomiting infants in the newborn to three-month-old age group is organized around the following three clinical scenarios: bilious vomiting, intermittent nonbilious vomiting since birth, and new-onset bilious vomiting. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in 41 adults: The illness, the patients, and problems of management [^113kyFno]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) consists of recurrent, stereotypic episodes of incapacitating nausea and vomiting lasting hours to days and separated by symptom-free intervals, which typically last weeks or months.

- **The illness has four phases**: The inter-episodic phase, during which the patient is relatively symptom-free; the prodrome, which begins when the patient senses the approach of an episode and experiences nausea of varying intensity but can still retain oral medications; the emetic phase, characterized by intense, persistent nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms; and the recovery phase, which begins with the subsidence of nausea and ends when hunger, tolerance of oral intake, and vigor return to normal. Episodes typically recur 6–12 times per year. CVS is considered to be a functional disorder, and some investigators have suggested that it is a manifestation of migraine diathesis.

CVS was first described in the English literature in 1882 by Samuel Gee, who reported a series of nine children ranging in age from 4 to 8 years. Thereafter, CVS was considered to be a pediatric disorder, and the absence of characteristic physical, laboratory, or radiological markers for CVS resulted in its poor recognition by physicians who practice adult medicine. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome has been reported in adults with onset ranging from childhood to middle age. CVS in adults has been characterized as similar to CVS in children.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): A phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^115fJBX9]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Following the correction of dehydration (based on a review of WHO clinical signs and observations), children were assessed for their ability to take oral rehydration or feeds. Children who were able to take and retain oral fluids/feeds and who were in neutral or marginally positive fluid balance (both input and output were measured) were considered satisfactorily rehydrated.

For the purposes of protocol adherence, each child completed their allocated intravenous fluid hydration regimen regardless of when they were satisfactorily rehydrated, as WHO recommends completing rehydration first before re-evaluating. Once able to tolerate oral fluids, children were offered oral rehydration fluids alongside their intravenous rehydration regimen. Each child had an input-output fluid monitoring chart, which included urinary catheter volumes (where parents consented) and diaper weights, designed to document the volumes that children in both arms were drinking and retaining as well as to define clinical endpoints.

If a child developed suspected signs of fluid overload, intravenous fluids were stopped, and if there were signs of pulmonary oedema, clinicians were permitted to administer intravenous furosemide (1–2 mg/kg) and supplemental oxygen (if saturations < 90% by pulse oximetry). When stable, further fluid management was administered orally (or via nasogastric tube if the child was unable to take fluids orally). If there were ongoing significant gastrointestinal fluid losses with persisting dehydration, the protocol permitted one repeat of the rehydration regime as per protocol.

### The use of a triage-based protocol for oral rehydration in a pediatric emergency department [^115o4L45]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and avoidance of laboratory tests and intravenous fluids for mild to moderate dehydration in children with gastroenteritis; oral ondansetron has been shown to be an effective adjunct.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to determine if a triage-based, nurse-initiated protocol for early provision of ondansetron and ORT could safely improve the care of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis.

- **Methods**: This study evaluated a protocol prompting triage nurses to assess dehydration in gastroenteritis patients and initiate ondansetron and ORT if indicated. Otherwise well patients aged 6 months to 5 years with symptoms of gastroenteritis were eligible. Prospective postintervention data were compared with retrospective, preintervention control subjects.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-eight (81 postintervention and 47 preintervention) patients were analyzed; average age was 2.1 years. Ondansetron use increased from 36% to 75% (P < 0.001). Time to ondansetron decreased from 60 minutes to 30 minutes (P = 0.004). Documented ORT increased from 51% to 100% (P < 0.001). Blood testing decreased from 37% to 21% (P = 0.007); intravenous fluid decreased from 23% to 9% (P = 0.03). Fifty-two percent of postintervention patients were discharged with prescriptions for ondansetron. There were no significant changes in ED length of stay, admissions, or unscheduled return to care.

- **Conclusions**: A triage nurse-initiated protocol for early use of oral ondansetron and ORT in children with evidence of…

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: Pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^117Bv1Gb]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine if rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration results in improved hydration and clinical outcomes when administered to children with gastroenteritis.

- **Design**: Single centre, two-arm, parallel randomised pragmatic controlled trial. Blocked randomisation was stratified by site. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment assignment.

- **Setting**: Paediatric emergency department in a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada.

- **Participants**: The study involved 226 children aged 3 months to 11 years, with complete follow-up obtained on 223 children (99%). Eligible children were aged over 90 days, had a diagnosis of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis, had not responded to oral rehydration, and had been prescribed intravenous rehydration. Exclusion criteria included weight less than 5 kg or more than 33 kg, requirement for fluid restriction, suspected surgical condition, or an insurmountable language barrier. Children were also excluded if they had a history of chronic systemic disease, abdominal surgery, bilious or bloody vomit, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.

- **Interventions**: Rapid (60 mL/kg) or standard (20 mL/kg) rehydration with 0.9% saline over an hour; subsequent fluids were administered according to protocol.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was clinical rehydration, assessed with a validated scale two hours after the start of treatment. Secondary outcomes included prolonged treatment, mean clinical dehydration scores over the four-hour study period, time to discharge, and repeat visits to the emergency department.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^1154xBoH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is being increasingly recognized in adults. It is characterized by episodic nausea and vomiting and is associated with significant morbidity. Approximately one-third of adult patients become disabled. There is considerable variation in the recognition, diagnosis, and management of CVS.

The diagnosis for CVS is based on Rome criteria, first developed in 2006 and subsequently revised in 2016. Although their sensitivity and specificity in making a diagnosis of CVS have not been determined, the Rome IV symptom-based criteria established a uniform, symptom-based framework that is useful in clinical practice. While other disorders of nausea and vomiting, such as gastroparesis, may be confused with CVS, these disorders lack the stereotypical and sudden onset of symptoms, features that appear to be fairly unique to CVS.

With further research, the clinical features of CVS will become better delineated, and this information is likely to influence future iterations of symptom-based CVS diagnostic criteria. For example, many patients with CVS experience abdominal pain during an acute attack, but this feature is not currently incorporated in the Rome IV CVS criteria and should be considered in future revisions.

### Healthcare-associated gastroenteritis: Outbreak report and systematic review of the literature [^112FrHYx]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Low credibility.

Healthcare-associated gastroenteritis continues to be associated with significant pediatric morbidity and mortality despite the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. Infection prevention (IP) measures are critical in mitigating outbreaks. We describe an outbreak of norovirus and effective IP strategies utilized and calculated the costs associated with the outbreak. To demonstrate the burden of these events, we conducted a systematic review of pediatric healthcare-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks since 1973 to describe changing epidemiologic trends.

Twenty-four publications describing 27 outbreaks were included in the final analysis, with 293 healthcare-associated cases. Rotavirus (14) and norovirus (7) outbreaks were most commonly described. Limitations include the retrospective nature of included reports and nonuniform data ascertainment and reporting among publications. Norovirus has replaced rotavirus as the most common etiology of healthcare-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks in North America, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines.

### Changes in the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of viral gastroenteritis among hospitalized children in the mainland of China: a retrospective study from 2016 to 2020 [^114bwFN4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is generally a self-limiting condition that resolves within one week and is most commonly associated with viral infection. There were no fatal cases in our study. However, viral gastroenteritis often led to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte disorders, and acidosis. Our study showed higher incidence of dehydration in children with norovirus (NV) infections, electrolyte disturbances in children with rotavirus (RV) infections, and electrolyte disorders with adenovirus (ADV) infections. Length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization expenses for children with viral gastroenteritis were associated with age, region, and pathogens.

Our study has some limitations. The most frequently seen patients with viral gastroenteritis are outpatients, yet our database contains only data from hospitalized children, providing limited insight into the total incidence of viral gastroenteritis. Furthermore, the use of various detection methods for pathogens across different hospitals leads to diverse effectiveness in detecting the same pathogen, complicating comparisons between different pathogens. In this study, no follow-up information was available for children with viral gastroenteritis, particularly those transferred to other hospitals. The lack of clear information about the patients' RV vaccination status makes it difficult to assess the protective effect of RV vaccination in cases of viral gastroenteritis.

### Antibiotic therapy in acute gastroenteritis: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^117V6B7Z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) presents a major burden to the global and the United States healthcare systems, as it is one of the most common diagnoses for emergency department visits and hospitalizations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that there are 37.2 million cases of infectious gastroenteritis annually in the United States alone, with 228,744 hospitalizations and 2,612 deaths. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP-US) found the average length of hospital stay (LOS) to be 2.9 days nationwide, with an average cost of $11,910 per stay.

While there are a broad variety of pathogens responsible for acute infectious gastroenteritis, the majority of cases are attributed to viral illness. The management of patients presenting with AGE is primarily supportive and consists of rehydration. Oral hydration is the preferred modality for fluid repletion. However, in patients with severe hypovolemia or an inability to tolerate oral hydration (including impaired mental status or severe ileus), intravenous hydration is a recommended alternative. The role of antibiotic therapy in the management of AGE is unclear. There are limited data in the literature to strongly support their use. To our knowledge, no prior studies had looked at the role of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with AGE and the LOS.

### Burden of acute gastroenteritis among children younger than 5 years of age — a survey among parents in the United Arab Emirates [^115WQ7k9]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Despite its high incidence among children under the age of five, little is known about the burden of pediatric gastroenteritis outside the medical setting. The objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute gastroenteritis among children residing in the United Arab Emirates, including those not receiving medical care.

- **Methods**: A quantitative cross-sectional survey of 500 parents of children under 5 years of age who had suffered from acute gastroenteritis in the preceding three months was conducted in the cities of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain. Data collected included respondent characteristics, disease symptoms, medical care sought, and parental expenditures and work loss. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistical methods.

- **Results**: Vomiting and diarrhea episodes lasted on average between 3 and 4 days. Overall, 87% of parents sought medical care for their children; 10% of these cases required hospitalization with an average length of stay of 2.6 days. When medical care was sought, the average parental cost per gastroenteritis episode was US$64, which is 4.5 times higher than with home care only (US$14). Nearly 60% of this difference was attributable to co-payments and medication use: 69% of children used oral rehydration solution, 68% antiemetics, 65% antibiotics, and 64% antidiarrheals. Overall, 38 parents missed work per 100 gastroenteritis episodes for an average of 1.4 days.

- **Conclusions**: Given its high incidence, pediatric gastroenteritis has an important financial and productivity impact on parents in the United Arab Emirates.

### An unusual infection on an unusual gastroenteritis [^113rHo82]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Various gastrointestinal (GI) presentations have been attributed to primary or secondary eosinophilic disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune diseases, reactions to drugs, hypereosinophilia syndrome, and solid organ transplantation. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a heterogeneous disorder affecting both children and adults, characterized by an intense eosinophilic infiltrate in one or multiple segments of the GI tract — from the esophagus to the rectum. This infiltrate may involve part or the full thickness of the organ wall. A strong history of various allergies may present in up to 25–75% of patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

Mucosal eosinophilic gastroenteritis is the most common form, potentially due to easier diagnosis via endoscopy and biopsies. It usually presents with non-specific abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, or protein-losing enteropathy. Occasionally, there could be involvement of deeper layers with signs and symptoms of gastric outlet and intestinal obstruction. Serosal layer involvement occurs in 10–40% of EG cases and typically presents with ascites. It is associated with significant bloating, higher peripheral eosinophilia, and a better response to steroids, although relapses are common, necessitating repeated steroid treatment. Diagnosing this entity requires a high index of suspicion and the exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia.

Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for EG, providing rapid and effective relief of symptoms; however, long-term response and histological improvement have not been demonstrated in large prospective studies. Relapses frequently occur with tapered steroid regimens.

In China, infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, and enteric fever) has been classified as a Class C infectious disease according to the national notifiable infectious diseases reporting system. Enteric viral pathogens are gradually becoming the leading pathogens of gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, due to the improved quality of drinking water and the frequent use of antibiotics. Clinical manifestations of viral gastroenteritis include fever, abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Viral gastroenteritis is usually a self-limiting illness, requiring mainly supportive therapy, which usually resolves within 2–5 days. Viral pathogens include rotavirus (RV), norovirus (NV), astrovirus (AV), and adenovirus (ADV). NV infection affects people of all ages, while RV mainly infects children, particularly those under five years of age.

The implementation of RV vaccination has reduced RV problems to some extent, but the contribution of RV to pediatric acute gastroenteritis has not been replaced by other pathogens. Vaccination has helped to reduce RV hospitalization, as well as change the epidemiology of RV disease in the United States and Spain. RV vaccine is part of the National Immunization Programs (NIPs) in many countries, but it has not been included in China's NIPs. The epidemiology and distribution of common pathogens causing infectious gastroenteritis, particularly viral pathogens, continue to evolve.

### Differentiating acute food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome from its mimics: A comparison of clinical features and routine laboratory biomarkers [^115bRq5u]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is frequently misdiagnosed and subject to diagnostic delay. Profuse vomiting, the cardinal feature of acute FPIES, may occur in more common pediatric disorders such as gastroenteritis and sepsis.

- **Objectives**: We sought to determine differentiating features at acute presentation between FPIES, gastroenteritis, and sepsis in young children presenting to an emergency department (ED) with profuse vomiting.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of children aged 6 months to 4 years with a diagnosis of acute FPIES who had presented to ED. We compared the clinical features, vital signs, and routine laboratory studies of this cohort with similarly aged children presenting to ED with vomiting diagnosed with bacterial/viral gastroenteritis or bacterial sepsis.

- **Results**: A total of 181 acute FPIES ED presentations were compared with 55 gastroenteritis and 36 bacterial sepsis ED presentations. Children with FPIES were more likely to present with lethargy, floppiness, and pallor. Compared with children with FPIES, children with sepsis were likely to present with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and diarrhea, whereas those with gastroenteritis were likely to present with fever, diarrhea, and blood in stools. Normal C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocytosis, lymphocytosis, thrombocytosis, low MPV, and an elevated albumin/globulin ratio were more commonly seen in FPIES than in sepsis or gastroenteritis. No other clinical or laboratory markers examined reliably distinguished between the three disease groups.

- **Conclusion**: The study highlights that specific clinical presentations such as lethargy, floppiness, and pallor, along with certain laboratory markers, can help differentiate FPIES from its mimics in pediatric emergency settings.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in the emergency department: A 10-year review of clinical presentation and management [^1177mtMj]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were (1) to determine how frequently patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with CVS-related symptoms, (2) to identify variables in clinical presentation that occur frequently in patients with multiple ED visits, and (3) to compare ED management of CVS with recommended guidelines.

This study is a retrospective chart review of all ED visits for CVS between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2018, at a single center. Patients were identified from a master list of patients diagnosed with CVS in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic at the same center between June 1, 2004, and June 19, 2018.

Of the 181 CVS clinic patients identified, 65 had visited the ED (35.9%). Two hundred twenty-eight visits met the inclusion criteria. A total of 42.5% of these visits were made by a small number of high-intensity patients (n = 6) who had an average of 16.1 visits each. These patients represented less than 10% of the total patient group. Patients with frequent visits had longer visits (536.52 vs. 380.55 minutes), more frequent hospital admissions (57.73% vs. 29.01%), and more visits to the ED before a formal diagnosis of CVS was made (5.83 vs. 1.22), but few other distinguishing characteristics. Only 27% of eligible visits were managed with an available order set, and management varied from recommended guidelines.

An ambiguous presentation makes the identification and consistent management of CVS in the ED difficult. Physicians should consider CVS for patients who present multiple.

### Antibiotic therapy in acute gastroenteritis: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^112nJnTW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common reason for emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The role of antibiotics in AGE is unclear, as the literature shows only a minor impact on the duration of symptoms and the overall clinical course. Our goal was to assess whether antibiotic therapy in patients with AGE affects the length of hospital stay (LOS).

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, we evaluated 479 patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of AGE. The study compared the 219 patients (46%) treated with antibiotics to those treated with supportive therapy. The diagnosis of AGE was made either clinically or based on imaging findings. The primary outcome of this study was to compare the LOS in days between both groups.

- **Results**: Patients treated with antibiotics had a similar LOS to those treated with supportive therapy (2.62 vs. 2.66 days, P = 0.77). Patients with presumed sepsis had a higher likelihood of receiving antibiotics compared to those without presumed sepsis (risk ratio 1.49, 62.5% vs. 41.95%; P < 0.001). In this subgroup, patients who received antibiotics had a slightly shorter LOS than those who received only supportive therapy, but the difference was not statistically significant (2.09 vs. 2.54 days, P = 0.69).

We found no difference in the LOS for hospitalized patients with AGE treated with antibiotics when compared to supportive therapy. This calls into question the role of antibiotics in the management of AGE.

### Viral gastroenteritis [^116UtX9W]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of norovirus in 1972 as a cause of what was contemporarily known as acute infectious non-bacterial gastroenteritis, scientific understanding of viral gastroenteritides has continued to evolve. It is now recognized that a small number of viruses are the predominant cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, in both high-income and low-income settings. Although treatment is still largely restricted to the replacement of fluid and electrolytes, improved diagnostics have allowed attribution of illness, enabling both targeted treatment of individual patients and prioritization of interventions for populations worldwide.

Questions remain regarding specific genetic and immunological factors underlying host susceptibility, and the optimal clinical management of patients who are susceptible to severe or prolonged manifestations of the disease. Meanwhile, the worldwide implementation of rotavirus vaccines has led to substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality and spurred interest in vaccine development to diminish the impact of the most prevalent viruses implicated in this syndrome.

### Rehydration: Role for early use of intravenous dextrose [^115jLK8E]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is a common reason for children to seek health care. Among the potential complications of acute gastroenteritis, the most common is dehydration. For mild to moderate dehydration, treatment options include oral and intravenous rehydration. Outpatient treatment failure for either method, when it occurs, is often due to persistent nausea and vomiting. Some authorities have suggested that the early administration of dextrose to patients receiving intravenous rehydration may help terminate vomiting and result in fewer outpatient treatment failures. The purpose of this report was to review the evidence supporting the effectiveness of early intravenous dextrose administration in the outpatient management of dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis.

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^111i1Sde]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

The development of PROs suitable to measure treatment outcomes in patients with CVS is in an early stage and still needs to be operationalized in the context of the special challenges associated with CVS populations. Some have transitioned from cross-sectional to longitudinal study settings, and further examinations are needed from observational to interventional and from small- to large-sized study types.

A few unmet needs in the outcome measurement for CVS have been noticed. First, CVS-specific PRO measures are needed to assess the outcomes in emesis as fit-for-purpose, given the importance of vomiting and retching in CVS clinical development and trial efficacy. In contrast to having "CVS episode" as a concept that integrates multiple dimensions, it is probably clearer to define each dimension of the episode aspects separately, for example, criteria to define "episode start" versus "episode end".

Furthermore, more data is needed that consistently measures the impact (e.g. HRQoL, disability, productivity loss in work or school days, other functioning) in relation to CVS episode occurrence in a longitudinal time frame. However, such data have not been sufficiently reported even in the most recent studies. Lastly, cardinal symptoms reported by patients with CVS other than emesis (e.g. abdominal pain, other GI symptoms, psychiatric symptoms) need to be further assessed to evaluate their relevance to CVS. Consequently, appropriate formats for measurement should be looked into.

In addition to clinical development, PRO measures should also be explored in therapeutic settings to enhance understanding and management of CVS.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^112HCynJ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). High credibility.

- **Investigations**: The Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) require that there is "no organic pathology" to explain the symptoms. Hence, it is reasonable to pursue some higher-yield diagnostic investigations to exclude other disorders that may mimic CVS. Unfortunately, many patients with CVS undergo extensive and often repetitive diagnostic testing before the diagnosis is even considered. Diagnosing CVS efficiently and cost-effectively can be achieved by early clinical recognition based on the Rome IV criteria, followed by a limited diagnostic workup to exclude alternative disorders. The following suggestions reflect the committee's expert opinion, as there is limited published data on the approach.

	- A basic workup for a patient with previously uninvestigated episodes of vomiting should include biochemical, endoscopic, and potentially radiographic assessments. Biochemical testing should include a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, glucose, liver panel, lipase, and urinalysis. Although patients will undoubtedly receive some testing in an emergency department setting if presenting with a CVS episode, diagnostic tests should generally be performed after resolution to minimize confounding variables such as dehydration. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be performed to exclude organic pathology, such as gastric volvulus, which may mimic CVS in rare instances. It is important not to over-interpret some endoscopic findings, such as a Mallory-Weiss tear, mild gastritis, or esophagitis, as being causal when those findings may more likely be incidental.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): A phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^117XwQth]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

World Health Organization rehydration management guidelines (plan C) for severe dehydration are widely practiced in resource-poor settings but have never been formally evaluated in a trial. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy trial raised concerns regarding the safety of bolus therapy for septic shock, warranting a formal evaluation of rehydration therapy for gastroenteritis.

- **Methods**: A multi-centre, open-label, phase II randomized controlled trial evaluated two rehydration strategies in 122 Ugandan and Kenyan children aged 60 days to 12 years with severe dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. The study compared the safety and efficacy of standard rapid rehydration using Ringer's lactate (100 ml/kg over 3 hours, or 6 hours if under 1 year), incorporating 0.9% saline boluses for children with shock (plan C), versus slower rehydration: 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate over 8 hours for all ages without boluses (slow: experimental). The primary outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) within 48 hours, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical, and physiological measures of response to treatment by intravenous rehydration.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-two eligible children (median age 8 months, IQR 6–12 months) were randomized to plan C (n = 61) or slow (n = 61), with two (2%) lost to follow-up at day 7. Following randomization, the mean time to start intravenous rehydration was 15 minutes. Mean fluid received by 1 hour was greater in plan C (mean 20.2 ml/kg compared to 33.1 ml/kg for children experiencing shock).

### Update on nonantibiotic therapies for acute gastroenteritis [^1134Czzk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on nonantibiotic therapies for acute gastroenteritis (AGE), focusing on antiemetics and probiotics.

Recent findings suggest that the mainstay of therapy for nonsevere AGE remains oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have further strengthened the evidence base supporting single-dose ondansetron administration in emergency departments to facilitate ORT, based on evidence that it safely reduces intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization rates. Intravenous ondansetron administration and multiple-dose use should be avoided. A bimodal release ondansetron formulation was shown to improve outcomes in adolescents and adults with AGE in one study, but further evidence is required to support its use. Recent large trials evaluating probiotic administration demonstrated a lack of benefit, and guidelines that recommend their use should reevaluate their positions in light of this evidence. Furthermore, caution should be exercised when their use is considered in high-risk populations and settings.

The summary clarifies the benefits, dosing/route, and target populations most likely to benefit from ondansetron. Optimization of the real-life effectiveness of this therapy will require implementation strategies. Recent high-quality evidence showing a lack of efficacy and potential harm associated with probiotic use suggests that routine use for AGE should be discouraged.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasized.

- **Initial presentation in primary care**: In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders, and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea as the abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care, and patients may be referred if their condition interferes with normal activities or compromises quality of life sufficiently to warrant further action.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^115tX9y8]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins.

A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities.

- **Nonpharmacologic management**: Options include fluid and electrolyte replacement, small, frequent meals, and avoidance of trigger foods.

Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest appropriate duration.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): A phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^115swQN4]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In the design of the trial, when considering secondary outcomes, we aimed to use guideline recommendations for assessing the reversal of dehydration. First, we aimed to check whether the clinical signs for severe dehydration accurately predict the degree of dehydration. We based this on the gold standard by looking at the percentage change in weight from admission to day 7, rather than weight at discharge since this time point has not been reliable previously.

We found that although the trial targeted children assumed to have 10% or more dehydration, our data suggests this was present in only 33 (29%), with 30 (26%) having a deficit of > 5- < 10% and nearly half with only a modest deficit (1–5%). Several systematic reviews have covered the issue of the specificity of all the available dehydration scores; nearly all perform poorly in practice, including the WHO scoring. Of note, during initial rehydration, at 8 hours, most children remained clinically dehydrated based on the same signs but were not re-prescribed intravenous rehydration (even though it is recommended to start plan C again).

To address the lack of specificity of these signs, we added two additional parameters also considered as rehydration goals and/or adverse consequences. We selected time to pass urine as a more reliable marker of perfusion, as it is specified or required as an endpoint for management of shock or hydration status. We also included dysnatraemia, as this has been used in a number of other clinical trials as a safety endpoint, defined as a sodium level outside normal ranges.

Regarding medical management for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to oral rehydration, ACG 2016 guidelines recommend administering balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in elderly patients with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea. Recognize that most patients with acute diarrhea or gastroenteritis can maintain fluid and salt balance by consuming water, juices, sports drinks, soups, and saltine crackers.
