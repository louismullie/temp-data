## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of a 34-year-old woman with jaundice 5 days after cholecystectomy and a cholestatic liver test pattern. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory pattern and whether this is cholestatic versus hepatocellular. Then, I should verify the most likely postoperative biliary complications given the timing and pattern. Next, I will consider alternative etiologies that could mimic this presentation. After that, I need to outline the immediate diagnostic workup, including imaging and targeted labs. Finally, I will prioritize the differential, highlight red flags, and propose an initial management pathway with escalation triggers, making sure each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory pattern and its implications. The bilirubin is predominantly conjugated (direct 2.9 mg/dL of total 3.9 mg/dL), with markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT and only modest ALT elevation, which fits a cholestatic process rather than a purely hepatocellular injury; the R ratio using ALT and ALP would be low, supporting cholestasis rather than hepatocellular injury, and the elevated direct bilirubin points toward impaired excretion or obstruction rather than overproduction or conjugation defects [^116MrpTo] [^113LJvTk] [^113BpbEZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should anchor the differential to the postoperative context. In the first week after cholecystectomy, retained or newly migrated common bile duct stones, bile duct injury with leak or stricture, and postoperative cholangitis are the leading considerations, and the timing of 5 days makes retained or missed choledocholithiasis and early bile duct injury particularly salient, especially with a cholestatic pattern and systemic inflammatory response evidenced by CRP 214 mg/L [^1146Pg9u] [^116Kw6SM].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis: retained or missed choledocholithiasis. Wait, let me verify the biochemical plausibility; choledocholithiasis typically produces a cholestatic pattern with elevated ALP, GGT, and direct bilirubin, and although ALT is often modest, it can be mildly to moderately elevated, which matches this profile; importantly, up to 40–50% of patients with choledocholithiasis may have no classic preoperative red flags, so absence of preoperative evidence does not exclude it, and MRCP or EUS is highly accurate when ultrasound is nondiagnostic [^1147c4rs] [^115MWxCQ] [^116MRVTF].

> Next, I should review bile duct injury as a competing diagnosis. Bile leaks and strictures can present within days to weeks with pain, jaundice, and cholestatic enzymes; early leaks may show rising bilirubin and ALP with relatively modest transaminases, and bilirubin can be disproportionately elevated when there is obstruction or impaired drainage; CRP elevation supports inflammation, and persistent or rising cholestatic markers beyond 72 hours postoperatively should prompt urgent biliary imaging and consideration of ERCP if a leak or stricture is suspected [^1146Pg9u] [^116XPLCC] [^1164hY8w].

> But wait, what if this is postoperative cholangitis without frank obstruction on initial imaging? I need to ensure I consider Tokyo guideline criteria; systemic inflammation with fever or elevated inflammatory markers plus cholestasis or imaging evidence of biliary pathology supports cholangitis, and the markedly elevated CRP here strengthens that concern even if fever is not yet documented, so I should actively screen for Charcot's triad and obtain urgent biliary imaging to look for stones, sludge, stricture, or ductal dilation [^1127GnzZ] [^1127GnzZ].

> Let me consider alternative etiologies that could mimic this pattern. Drug-induced liver injury remains possible, but the cholestatic pattern with prominent ALP and GGT and only modest ALT makes DILI less likely unless the agent is classically cholestatic; nonetheless, I should review all perioperative and recent medications, including antibiotics and anesthetics, and apply DILI severity criteria if suspected; ischemic hepatopathy would typically show AST in the thousands and is less consistent with this pattern; postoperative benign cholestasis can occur but is usually transient and mild; hemolysis would produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not the case here [^113s1NHW] [^116AMfR6] [^114qp9im].

> I should double-check the immediate diagnostic steps. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is first-line to assess for ductal dilation, retained stones, and fluid collections; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, MRCP or EUS should follow given their superior sensitivity and specificity for choledocholithiasis and subtle ductal injuries; concurrently, I need a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and cultures if infection is suspected, and I should trend liver chemistries every 24–48 hours to detect evolution toward obstruction or leak [^1147c4rs] [^112SbFyr] [^1146Pg9u].

> Let me prioritize the differential while I await imaging. Most likely is retained or missed choledocholithiasis causing partial obstruction and cholangitis; next is bile duct injury with either leak or evolving stricture; less likely but still plausible is postoperative cholangitis without a clearly visualized stone; I should keep drug-induced cholestasis and ischemic injury on the list only if the clinical course or imaging argues against biliary etiologies [^1147c4rs] [^1146Pg9u] [^113s1NHW].

> I need to ensure I flag red flags that mandate urgent intervention. Rising bilirubin despite supportive care, new fever or rigors, hypotension, mental status changes, or INR prolongation suggest severe cholangitis or evolving sepsis and should trigger urgent biliary decompression, typically via ERCP with stone extraction and possible sphincterotomy or stenting; early ERCP reduces morbidity and length of stay in appropriate contexts, and delays can worsen outcomes [^1127GnzZ] [^1147c4rs] [^1164hY8w].

> Next, I should review the initial management pathway. Admit for observation, IV fluids, hold oral intake if nausea/vomiting, obtain cultures before antibiotics if feasible, and start empiric coverage for biliary flora if cholangitis is suspected; arrange urgent hepatobiliary imaging with ultrasound followed by MRCP or EUS if needed; consult gastroenterology and surgery early for potential ERCP or percutaneous intervention; if a bile leak is confirmed, endoscopic stenting is first-line and often avoids reoperation [^1177QuKY] [^1147c4rs] [^1164hY8w].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation triggers and follow-up. If ultrasound shows ductal dilation or a stone, proceed to ERCP; if ultrasound is normal but cholestatic enzymes and jaundice persist, MRCP or EUS is indicated; if all imaging is unrevealing and cholestasis persists beyond 1–2 weeks, I should reconsider intrahepatic cholestatic diseases or drug injury and consider liver biopsy, but in this early postoperative window, biliary complications remain most probable [^1147c4rs] [^112SbFyr] [^113BpbEZ].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is retained or missed choledocholithiasis with partial obstruction and possible early cholangitis, with bile duct injury as the key alternative; the cholestatic pattern and marked CRP elevation fit these postoperative biliary complications, and the next best step is urgent right upper quadrant ultrasound followed by MRCP or EUS if indicated, alongside supportive care and early biliary intervention if obstruction or leak is confirmed [^1147c4rs] [^1146Pg9u] [^1127GnzZ].

The most likely cause of jaundice 5 days post-cholecystectomy with cholestatic LFTs is **retained common bile duct stones** or **bile duct injury** (stricture or leak) [^116Kw6SM] [^112Ms3GZ]. Other considerations include **postoperative cholangitis**, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, and drug-induced cholestasis [^111dGSyL] [^113s1NHW]. Immediate evaluation with **right upper quadrant ultrasound** and MRCP is indicated to assess for ductal dilation, stones, or leaks; if inconclusive, proceed to ERCP for diagnosis and therapy [^113BpbEZ] [^1164hY8w]. Delay in diagnosis increases the risk of **cholangitis**, **pancreatitis**, and **biliary cirrhosis** [^116eU55L].

## Differential diagnosis

### Biliary obstruction

- **Retained common bile duct (CBD) stones**: The most common cause of post-cholecystectomy jaundice, occurring in 3–15% of patients [^116eU55L]. Stones may be missed or newly migrate into the CBD, causing obstruction and cholestasis [^116Kw6SM].

- **Bile duct injury**: Stricture or leak from unrecognized ductal injury can cause obstruction or bile leak, presenting with jaundice, pain, and cholestatic LFTs [^112Ms3GZ] [^116XPLCC].

- **Postoperative cholangitis**: Infection of obstructed bile ducts, often due to retained stones or strictures, presenting with jaundice, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers [^1127GnzZ].

- **Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction**: Functional obstruction at the ampulla, causing cholestasis and jaundice after cholecystectomy [^111dGSyL].

---

### Hepatocellular injury

Drug-induced liver injury (**DILI**) from perioperative medications (e.g. antibiotics, anesthetics) can cause mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic injury [^116S2rSP]. Postoperative **hepatic ischemia** from transient hypotension or hepatic artery injury can also cause hepatocellular injury with cholestasis [^116AMfR6].

---

### Other causes

Postoperative **pancreatitis** may cause biliary obstruction or cholestasis due to edema of the pancreatic head [^notfound]. Uncommon entities such as **biliary strictures**, **benign biliary strictures**, or **malignant obstruction** (e.g. cholangiocarcinoma) may also present with jaundice and cholestatic LFTs [^112Ms3GZ] [^113Px9wJ].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

History should document the onset and progression of **jaundice**, **abdominal pain**, **fever**, **pruritus**, **dark urine**, and **pale stools** [^116MRVTF]. Review perioperative details, including operative notes, and document any **biliary complications** or **difficulties**. The physical examination should assess for **icterus**, **hepatomegaly**, **right upper quadrant tenderness**, and signs of **sepsis** [^116KfqJx].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Fractionated bilirubin**: Confirms conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, indicating hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction [^113LJvTk].

- **AST, ALT, ALP, GGT**: Cholestatic pattern (disproportionate ALP/GGT elevation) suggests biliary obstruction; hepatocellular pattern (AST/ALT elevation) suggests hepatocellular injury [^1155asMt].

- **Complete blood count (CBC) and inflammatory markers**: Leukocytosis and elevated CRP suggest infection or inflammation (e.g. cholangitis) [^1127GnzZ].

- **Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)**: Prolonged PT/INR indicates severe hepatocellular dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency from cholestasis [^113LJvTk].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Right upper quadrant ultrasound (US)**: First-line to detect ductal dilation, retained stones, or bile collections (bilomas) [^113BpbEZ].

- **Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)**: Non-invasive gold standard for detecting retained stones, strictures, or bile leaks [^1147c4rs].

- **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: Diagnostic and therapeutic for retained stones, strictures, or bile leaks; consider if MRCP is inconclusive or intervention is needed [^111tvvKQ].

---

## Management strategies

### Retained CBD stones

For retained CBD stones, **ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction** is first-line therapy [^notfound]. If ERCP is unavailable, **laparoscopic or open CBD exploration** is an alternative [^114qMD2p].

---

### Bile duct injury

For bile duct injury, **ERCP with stenting** is first-line for bile leaks or strictures [^1164hY8w]. Definitive surgical repair (e.g. hepaticojejunostomy) is indicated for complex injuries or failed endoscopic therapy [^notfound].

---

### Postoperative cholangitis

For postoperative cholangitis, initiate **broad-spectrum antibiotics** and provide supportive care [^1127GnzZ]. Perform **urgent biliary drainage** (ERCP or percutaneous) if obstruction is present [^1177QuKY].

---

### Drug-induced liver injury

For suspected drug-induced liver injury, discontinue the **offending medication** and provide supportive care [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis and management can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Cholangitis**: Life-threatening infection of the biliary tree [^notfound].

- **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas due to biliary obstruction [^116MRVTF].

- **Biliary cirrhosis**: Chronic liver disease from prolonged biliary obstruction [^116eU55L].

- **Sepsis**: Systemic infection with multi-organ dysfunction [^notfound].

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^113mH35x]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### A patient with abdominal pain and markedly elevated transaminase levels after cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar pain in the abdomen. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

Investigations

History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

Diagnosis

Choledocholithiasis.

Management

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^1146Pg9u]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Biochemical tests for the diagnosis of BDI

After elective LC, laboratory tests are not routinely required because mild to moderate elevations in hepatocellular enzymes are frequently observed during the postoperative period but have no pathological meaning; CO 2 pneumoperitoneum seems to be the main reason for these changes.

In clinical practice, surgeons should consider postoperative biochemical investigations whenever difficulties were encountered during the intervention or in the presence of postoperative clinical signs suggestive of complications. These are performed to aid in the diagnosis. Ben-Ishay et al. evaluated the utility of post-LC blood examinations by retrospectively analyzing the chart data of approximately 340 patients undergoing LC and confirmed that they may be useful to make diagnoses and lead to early interventions in complicated cases. Blood tests were most often obtained in elderly patients and those who had prolonged surgery, multiple drains, and longer hospital stays.

Serum levels of direct and indirect bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and albumin, as well as a complete blood count (CBC), are usually measured to diagnose iatrogenic BDI. In BDI patients, liver function tests and cholestatic enzymes may either be elevated, supporting the clinical suspicion, or remain within the normal ranges. In the case of stenosis or complete occlusion of the bile duct, bilirubin values increase, whereas no elevation or only a slight elevation may be observed as a result of peritoneal bile absorption in the presence of bile leakage. In the very early stages, cholestasis markers are increased, but there is no significant hepatic damage; therefore, aminotransferases are not increased. Early in the initial postoperative course, the determination of ALP and total bilirubin is not sensitive.

Biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and serum lactate, can help to evaluate the severity of the inflammation or sepsis and provide a baseline to follow the therapeutic response. PCT, CRP, and lactate levels can also be used to predict fatal progression in septic patients and are associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality.

### Bile duct fascioliasis [^111fr8kN]. VideoGIE (2018). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old woman who had experienced nausea, vomiting, and right subchondral pain for a month was referred to the gastroenterology clinic because of elevated liver and biliary enzymes.

Her medical history was uneventful except for a cholecystectomy 5 years earlier because of gallstones. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. Laboratory screening revealed abnormal liver and biliary enzymes: alanine aminotransferase 631 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 536 U/I, alkaline phosphatase 185 IU/mL, γ-glutamyl transferase 286 IU/I, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin 1 mg/dL. The results of a hemogram and other blood biochemistry tests; viral serology including hepatitis A, B, and C; and tests for Toxoplasma gondii, other infections, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus were unremarkable.

### Obstructive jaundice due to a blood clot after ERCP: a case report and review of the literature [^117GN4a8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for 3 days. She did not drink alcohol, and there was no clinical or biochemical evidence of primary liver disease or coagulopathy. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed that the percentage of neutrophils (N%) was 80.3% (50–70%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 192 U/L (< 64 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 66 U/L (< 64 U/L), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) was 197 U/L (< 47 U/L), and all other laboratory parameters were normal (e.g. haemoglobin and platelet counts, prothrombin time, and renal function). An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct with a stone at the lower CBD and sludge in the gallbladder. (Fig. 1) Bile duct cholangiopancreatography revealed a dilated CBD (10 mm in diameter) with a round filling defect (8 mm in diameter) (Fig. 2). Balloon dilation (10 mm in diameter) of terminal CBD after a 5-mm long sphincterotomy for extraction of the stone was uneventful. Unfortunately, she presented with cholangitis and a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils (94%) and cholestatic parameters (total bilirubin 111.1 μmol/L (2–18 μmol/L), direct bilirubin 81.3 μmol/L (< 7 μmol/L), ALT 465 U/L, AST 538 U/L, and γ-GT 634 U/L) after 3 days.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Severe elevation of liver tests in choledocholithiasis: an uncommon occurrence with important clinical implications [^1143Kinu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Choledocholithiasis is not commonly associated with dramatic elevations in aminotransferase or total serum bilirubin. Ours is the largest case series thus far studying the prevalence of dramatic elevations in liver tests associated with choledocholithiasis.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with choledocholithiasis diagnosed on endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiogram at a tertiary referral hospital over 7 years. We identified 740 patients with available liver tests and determined the prevalence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 1000 IU/L and of total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL. We compared clinical characteristics of these 2 nonoverlapping groups.

Results

Of 740 patients, AST and/or ALT values > 1000 IU/L were present in 45 (6.1%) patients. On average AST and ALT decreased 79% and 56%, respectively, at discharge 1 to 8 days later. Total serum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dL were present in 35 (4.7%) patients and decreased by an average of 64% at discharge 1 to 8 days later. When compared with the group with total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL, the group with elevated aminotransferases had significantly more females (93% vs. 43%, P < 0.001), had smaller common bile duct diameter (8.5 vs. 10.6 mm, P = 0.04), and were more likely to have had a prior cholecystectomy (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.01). These 80 patients had higher utilization of health resources: half had additional laboratory studies and one fourth had additional imaging studies performed.

Conclusions

In patients with high AST and/or ALT and serum total bilirubin levels with known choledocholithiasis, elaborate work up to look for another etiology is not required. As long as the values decrease significantly, they do not need to be followed until they normalize in the same hospitalization.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### Biliary causes of postcholecystectomy syndrome [^111dGSyL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The postcholecystectomy syndrome refers to the persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms after cholecystectomy; patients with this syndrome commonly seek treatment in the Emergency Department (ED). There are a multitude of biliary and non-biliary causes of postcholecystectomy syndrome.

Objectives

To review the biliary causes of postcholecystectomy syndrome and present a suggested diagnostic workup.

Discussion

A number of biliary causes are discussed, including choledocholithiasis, bile duct injury and biliary leaks, cystic duct and gallbladder remnants, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, and biliary ascariasis. The ED workup should focus on differentiating biliary from non-biliary causes of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusion

A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound, liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin are the tests most useful in the ED for making this distinction and determining the most appropriate treatment and disposition of the patient. Computed tomography may be of use in the initial post-operative period.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Acute cholangitis in an old patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II-a case report [^115epmX2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

An 80-year-old female patient was admitted to Santa Maria Hospital's emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, chills and vomiting. Her medical history was relevant for CN type II, systemic hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Although she presented persistent jaundice since birth, the diagnosis of CN was only made in adulthood, based only on clinical grounds. She had never required treatment for CN. Seven years earlier, she had been admitted to a different institution with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis. She underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy. The patient declined cholecystectomy for personal reasons. A laboratory evaluation requested by her general practitioner 5 years earlier showed normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) – 24 U/L (normal range < 34 U/L), gama-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) - 30 U/L (normal range < 32 U/L), prothrombin time – 11.6 s (normal range < 11.8 s), markedly increased total bilirubin - 11.7 mg/dl (normal range < 1.0 mg/dl), and only slightly elevated direct bilirubin - 0.37 mg/dl (normal range < 0.35 mg/dl). At admission, physical examination showed fever (39 °C), severe icterus and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed signs of systemic inflammation (leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein) and a cytocholestatic pattern with unusual elevation in total bilirubin, but only a slight elevation of the direct fraction. There was no evidence of hemolysis (Table 1). Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated distention of the gallbladder with marked wall thickening (10 mm), pericholecystic fluid, positive sonographic Murphy's sign and cholelithiasis. The intrahepatic and common bile ducts were dilated (11 mm) and there was an echogenic material within the common bile duct suggestive of gallstones (Fig. 1). This was compatible with acute obstructive cholangitis with cholecystitis. After starting broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient underwent emergency ERCP which revealed multiple gallbladder and common bile duct stones. Following exploration with basket and balloon, sludge and pus were observed coming out from the papilla, thus confirming cholangitis (Fig. 2). The patient evolved uneventfully. By the 7 th day of admission there was a clear improvement in cholestasis (Table 2). She was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Four weeks later, the patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The surgical specimen measured 7 × 3.5 cm. The gallbladder wall was moderately thickened. The outer surface was partially rough, yellow-gray with multiple hemorrhagic foci. The lumen exhibited multiple ovoid yellow-brown stones, the largest measuring 15 mm. Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses could also be seen. These findings were compatible with chronic calculous cholecystitis.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

In three clinical trials, elevations in serum transaminase [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] levels > 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 2.3% [exposure adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of 2.7 per 100 person-years] of women receiving VEOZAH and 0.9% (EAIR of 1.5 per 100 person-years) of women receiving placebo. No elevations in serum total bilirubin (> 2 x ULN) occurred. Women with ALT or AST elevations were generally asymptomatic. Transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels (or close to these) without sequelae with dose continuation, and upon dose interruption, or discontinuation. Women with cirrhosis were not studied [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the postmarketing setting, cases of drug-induced liver injury with elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin occurred within 40 days of starting VEOZAH. Patients reported a general sense of feeling unwell and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, and dark urine. The patients' signs and symptoms gradually resolved after discontinuation of VEOZAH [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Perform baseline hepatic laboratory tests to evaluate for hepatic function and injury [including serum ALT, serum AST, serum ALP, and serum bilirubin (total and direct)] prior to VEOZAH initiation. Do not start VEOZAH if ALT or AST is ≥ 2 x ULN or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory.

Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory tests monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months after initiation of therapy.

Advise patients to discontinue VEOZAH immediately and seek medical attention including hepatic laboratory tests if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury:

new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain.

Discontinue VEOZAH if:

transaminase elevations are > 5 x ULN.
transaminase elevations are > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin is > 2 x ULN.

If transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution.

Exclude alternative causes of hepatic laboratory test elevations.

Case Presentation

A 32-year-old female presented with complaints of abdominal pain and hematemesis. History revealed that she has been suffering severe right upper quadrant pain for one year which resolved 4 months ago following elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cystic artery and cystic duct was explored during operation and cholecystectomy was completed without any difficulty. Her physical examination revealed jaundice, abdominal tenderness, and melena. Her heart rate was 98/min. blood pressure 100/60 mm/hg and body temperature 36.7 C. Her abnormal blood analysis results were as following; hemoglobin: 6.4 g/dl, hematocrite: 21%, MCV: 70 fl, AST: 435 IU/L, ALT: 220 IU/L, GGT: 256 IU/L, LDH: 400 IU/L, amylase: 2046 IU/L, lipase: 7339 IU/L, total bilirubine: 8.0 mg/dl and direct bilirubine: 6.2 mg/dl.

Nasogastric intubation and irrigation confirmed the presence of upper GI bleeding. Ten hours after admission source of the bleeding was identified as duodenal papilla by the emergency upper GI endoscopy where esophagus, stomach and bulbus were found to be normal (Figure 1: Initial endoscopy demonstrating blood leakage through duodenal papilla).

### Challenging biliary strictures: pathophysiological features, differential diagnosis, diagnostic algorithms, and new clinically relevant biomarkers-part 1 [^112Ms3GZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-surgical biliary strictures

In Western countries, iatrogenic strictures account for up to 80% of all benign strictures.

Post-cholecystectomy. Although the incidence of biliary injuries at laparoscopy recently decreased to figures similar to those reported with open cholecystectomy (0.08–0.3%), cholecystectomy remains a frequent cause of biliary stricture. These most often involve the CBD, the hilum, or the right hepatic duct (Figure 9). Patients typically present with jaundice or pain, sometimes associated with cholangitis. Various classifications of post-surgical biliary strictures have been proposed.MRCP can be used to identify not only the level of the stricture but may also reveal a bile leak, an obstructed segment lacking continuity with the biliary tree, or a focal liver atrophy.
Post-liver transplantation. Biliary strictures may be anastomotic or non-anastomotic. Anastomotic strictures complicate approximately 6–12% and 34% of deceased and living donor LT procedures, respectively. Non-anastomotic strictures are located > 5 mm proximal to the anastomosis and account for 10–25% of all strictures complicating LT; they may result from ischaemia (e.g. hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis, prolonged cold or warm ischaemia) or from receiver disease (e.g. PSC). They are usually multiple and longer than anastomotic strictures (Figure 10), and may progress to the intrahepatic ducts. Endoscopy has become the first-line treatment; it is technically more difficult for non-anastomotic strictures than for anastomotic strictures, and, in the case of hepatic artery thrombosis, it is mostly ineffective if the arterial blood flow cannot be restored.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

The case of a 54-year-old woman who presented with choledocholithiasis and underwent successful endoscopic stone extraction to clear the common bile duct is described. However, her jaundice and liver biochemistry continued to deteriorate despite repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with further imaging confirming a patent biliary tree. The clinical, radiological and pathological features were in keeping with prolonged cholestasis as a complication of ERCP. The pathophysiology of this unusual syndrome and the therapeutic options available are discussed.

Case presentation

A 43-years-old woman presented to the emergency services of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi with a history of haematemesis and melaena along with postural symptoms. She gave no history of abdominal pain, fever or jaundice. She had been diagnosed to have acute cholecystitis a week before presenting to us and had been managed conservatively with antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days) and anti-inflammatory analgesics. She was a known hypertensive on medical treatment. On examination she had tachycardia of 110/min and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. General physical examination showed marked pallor but no icterus. She had tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) on deep palpation.

At admission her haemoglobin was 4.5 g/dl (10–15 g/dl), total leucocyte count 32.4 × 10 3 cells/cc (4–11 × 10 3 cells/cc), platelet count 3.78 × 10 5 cells/cc (1.5–4 × 10 5 cells/cc) and prothrombin time was 4 seconds prolonged (control: 14 seconds). Her liver function tests showed a bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dl (0.8–1.0 mg/dl), ALT 85 IU (0–50 IU), AST 40 IU (0–50 IU) and alkaline phosphatase of 497 IU (80–240 IU).

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^112RxuPA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

One flaw of the study is that index diagnosis depends to some extent on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of CBDS is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated LFTs; this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.1 We recommend against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC, in which case we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LTFs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a NPV of 97%, whereas the PPV of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in patients without ACC; the literature ranging from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction; a proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had CBDS. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of patients with ACC without CBDS had elevated ALT and AST, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels with leucocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis. Padda et al. found that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without CBDS had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT. Among patients with ACC and CBDS, 77% had raised ALP, 60% had abnormal bilirubin and 90% had elevated ALT; multivariate analysis showed that increased common bile duct size and elevated ALT and ALP were predictors of CBDS. The diagnostic accuracy increases for cholestasis tests, such as serum bilirubin, with the duration and the severity of obstruction. Specificity of serum bilirubin levels for CBDS was 60% with a cut-off level of 1.7 mg/day and 75% with a cut-off level of 4 mg/dl; however, mean level of bilirubin in patients with CBDS is generally lower (1.5 to 1.9 mg/dl).

### Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) [^116YQRtQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatotoxicity has been observed with use of REZDIFFRA. One patient had normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TB) levels at baseline, who received REZDIFFRA 80 mg daily, developed substantial elevations of liver biochemistries that resolved when treatment was interrupted. After reinitiating REZDIFFRA, the patient had elevations of ALT, AST, and TB. Peak values observed were 58 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT, 66 x ULN for AST, 15 x ULN for TB, with no elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Elevations in liver enzymes were accompanied by elevations in immunoglobulin G levels, suggesting drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DI-ALH). The liver tests returned to baseline following hospitalization and discontinuation of REZDIFFRA without any therapeutic intervention.

Monitor patients during treatment with REZDIFFRA for elevations in liver tests and for the development of liver-related adverse reactions. Monitor for symptoms and signs of hepatotoxicity (e.g., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, jaundice, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia [> 5%]). If hepatotoxicity is suspected, discontinue REZDIFFRA and continue to monitor the patient. If laboratory values return to baseline, weigh the potential risks against the benefits of restarting REZDIFFRA. If laboratory values do not return to baseline, consider DI-ALH or autoimmune liver disease in the evaluation of elevations in liver tests.

5.2 Gallbladder-Related Adverse Reactions

In clinical trials, cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, and obstructive pancreatitis (gallstone) were observed more often in REZDIFFRA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. If an acute gallbladder event is suspected, interrupt REZDIFFRA treatment until the event is resolved [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116ESYnj]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Clinical approach to patients with obstructive jaundice [^111XyaWC]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### Case report: cholecystoduodenostomy for cholestatic liver disease in a premature infant with cystic fibrosis and short gut syndrome [^111j5Eei]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cholecystoduodenostomy is a surgical procedure that bypasses the extrahepatic biliary tree and connects the gallbladder directly to the duodenum. This case describes the successful use of this procedure in a novel situation.

Case presentation

A premature (34 weeks gestation) female infant with cystic fibrosis required a laparotomy on day 1 of life due to an intrauterine small bowel perforation. Resection of small bowel and ileostomy formation resulted in short gut syndrome, with 82 cm residual small bowel and intact ileocaecal valve. Post-ileostomy reversal at 2 months old, she developed conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Despite conservative management including increased enteral feeding, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholecystostomy drain insertion and flushes, her cholestatic jaundice persisted. A liver biopsy revealed an "obstructive/cholestatic" picture with fibrosis. To avoid further shortening her gut with an hepatoportoenterostomy, cholecystoduodenostomy was performed at 3 months of age with subsequent post-operative improvement and eventual normalisation of her clinical jaundice and liver biochemistry.

Conclusions

This is the first reported case of a cholecystoduodenostomy being used successfully to treat an infant with persistent conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, cystic fibrosis and short gut syndrome. Cholecystoduodenostomy is a treatment option that with further study, may be considered for obstruction of the common bile duct in patients with short gut and/or where a shorter operating time with minimal intervention is preferred.

### Clinical characteristics of acute cholecystitis with elevated liver enzymes not associated with choledocholithiasis [^114gGaRR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim/Background

Elevated liver enzymes are observed occasionally in patients with acute cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis. The etiology and mechanism of this phenomenon are not well known. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics between acute cholecystitis with and without choledocholithiasis in patients with elevated liver enzymes.

Patients and Methods

The medical records of acute cholecystitis patients who underwent cholecystectomy between January 2001 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. We retrieved data of patients who showed abnormal liver enzymes and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or intraoperative cholangiography.

Results

We analyzed clinical characteristics and comorbidities in 424 patients. Among 424 cholecystectomy patients with abnormal liver enzymes, 178 (42%) patients did not have choledocholithiasis and 246 (58%) patients had choledocholithiasis. The median AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were 47, 82.5 IU/dl, and 1.21 mg/dl, respectively, in patients without choledocholithiasis and 58, 96 IU/dl, and 1.53 mg/dl, respectively, in patients with choledocholithiasis. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fatty liver [odds ratio (OR): 0.218; P < 0.001], radiologic findings (OR: 0.414; P = 0.001), and the level of total bilirubin (OR: 1.410; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of choledocholithiasis.

Conclusion

Elevated liver enzymes in patients with cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis are correlated with the presence of fatty liver and the severity of radiologic finding.

### Acute cholangitis in an old patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II-a case report [^1173J3mw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CN) is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to conjugate bilirubin. Contrary to CN type I, patients with CN II exhibit residual capacity to conjugate bilirubin and may present a normal life expectancy.

Case Presentation

We report an unusual late diagnosis of CN type II in an 80-year-old female admitted with severe acute cholangitis. While the patient present typical clinical and radiologic signs of bile duct obstruction and cholangitis, her blood analysis showed severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the diagnosis and allowed therapeutic intervention. The anatomopathologic examination of her gallbladder following cholecystectomy showed signs of chronic cholecystitis.

Conclusion

The risk of gallstone disease may be increased in patients with CN syndrome. While unusual, we alert to this curious and potential life-threatening presentation.

AC in specific scenarios (jaundice, acalculous acute cholecystitis, pregnancy)

The presence of jaundice should be evaluated with caution because it reflects a wide spectrum of potentially benign and malignant conditions. These include, but are not limited to, CBD obstruction from external compression (cholangiocarcinoma, periampullary cancers, gallbladder cancer), choledocholithiasis, and liver failure (e.g. secondary to sepsis). Although US continues to be the diagnostic gold standard for detecting choledocholithiasis (especially within the distal CBD), MR cholangiography (MRC) may also be useful to define the etiology. The dominant goals in the treatment of patients with choledocholithiasis are three-fold: treat concurrent sepsis, evacuate the CBD, and prevent future recurrences. Although the order of the latter 2 goals is debated on the basis of length of stay, safety and economics, it is clear that ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy represent the 2 dominant therapies. Laparoscopic CBD exploration (transcystic or transductal) is also a viable option and has the added benefit of being performed as a single procedure.

Acalculous cholecystitis is an uncommon and serious presentation observed in 5% to 10% of patients with biliary emergencies. It is typically associated with critical illness, immunosuppressive conditions, uncommon pathogens (anaerobes), and/or sepsis. On a global basis, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continue to represent the most common immunosuppressive cases and are younger, present with elevations in their alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin, and may have cytomegalovirus and cryptosporidium associated infections. Other rare causes of acalculous cholecystitis are chemical cholecystitis after hepatic artery infusion, antibiotic-related cholecystitis, and parasites (ascaris). Since patients with acalculous cholecystitis often present with organ dysfunction and are poor surgical candidates, medical treatment is often the therapy of choice, with surgery performed in selected cases (i.e. if cholecystostomy is ineffective).

Pregnant patients carry a higher risk of developing both gallstones and acute cholecystitis than non-pregnant patients. Complications of gallstones remain the second most common cause of surgery during pregnancy. Despite this epidemiology, surgery should be avoided during the first (i.e. abortion) and third (i.e. premature delivery) trimesters if possible. Most symptomatic patients treated with nonoperative therapy present with recurrence of their symptoms however. Of this cohort, approximately 30% eventually require surgery during their pregnancy.

Patients with occult choledocholithiasis that proceed to cholecystectomy can present with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis in the post-operative period. It is important that any patient in whom choledocholithiasis is suspected undergo MRCP prior to surgery. Alternatively, an intra-operative cholangiogram or choledochoscope can be performed intra-operatively to ensure the common bile duct is clear of stones. Late post-cholecystectomy complications can include stump cholecystitis or a retained cystic duct stump or common bile duct stone. These findings result from incomplete cholecystectomy and can be identified on imaging (Fig. 25).

### Prevalence, severity, duration and resolution of cholestasis after acute liver failure [^1114JkKw]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, in ALF patients, postinjury cholestasis is ubiquitous and peaks after 3–5 days. This cholestatic phase of injury is prolonged, with only a minority of patients achieving normal cholestatic markers at hospital discharge and a median follow-up of 16 days, and, in some patients, failing to return to normal even at subsequent follow-up. These findings inform clinical expectations of the natural course of this condition and help with both diagnosis and prognosis. Importantly, they can be of assistance during conversations with patients and families regarding realistic expectations post-ALF jaundice and its likely duration. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether normalisation of post-ALF cholestasis does eventually occur in all survivors and, if so, when and to understand the impact of long-term cholestasis on future liver function and outcomes.

### Yellow urticaria and biliary pancreatitis [^111bfSDr]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

An 82-year-old woman with chronic cholelithiasis presented to the emergency room with acute abdominal pain secondary to biliary pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis. She was referred to our department because of a 24-hour history of generalized hives and pruritus. During a comprehensive history taking, the patient denied a history of atopia, allergies, previous urticaria episodes, new dietary changes, and recent herbal supplements or drug consumption.

A physical examination found large, disseminated urticarial plaques with erythematous borders and inner yellow areas. The plaques were distributed across the trunk, abdomen, and upper and lower extremities (Fig 1). She also presented with mild and generalized jaundice, and there was no angioedema or dermatographism.

Blood tests found increased bilirubin levels: total bilirubin was 5.3 mg/dL (0.2–1.2 mg/dL), direct bilirubin was 4.0 mg/dL (0–0.5 mg/dL), and indirect bilirubin was 1.3 mg/dL (0–0.8 mg/dL). Liver enzyme readings showed an increase in aspartate aminotransferase of 169 U/L (5–34 U/L), alanine transaminase of 102 U/L (0–55 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase of 244 U/L (40–150 U/L). The pancreatitis diagnosis was supported by a higher-than-normal concentration of blood serum amylase (1178 U/L [13–53 U/L]). Results of other tests, including hematic biometry, blood chemistry, and urinalysis, were normal.

### Radiological biliary intervention for stone disease [^116eU55L]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones are crystalized particles composed mainly of cholesterol and sometimes bilirubin, typically developing in the gallbladder. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of those calculi (stones) in the common bile duct (CBD). It is the primary cause of non-malignant bile duct obstruction. The formation of gallstones is influenced by various clinical conditions and factors, including bile composition, gallbladder motility, genetics, obesity, female sex, and age. The most common etiological factor for choledocholithiasis is the migration of gallbladder stones to the CBD and intrahepatic ducts through the cystic duct. This occurs in approximately 3–15% of patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Another common cause of choledocholithiasis is inadequate bile drainage due to obstructions, such as postsurgical bile duct strictures, which can lead to acute cholangitis or other inflammatory conditions. Hepatolithiasis is the formation of stones in the intrahepatic biliary tract. This condition is often recurrent and requires multiple therapeutic interventions. Treatment for choledocholithiasis is necessary for symptomatic patients, and is recommended for asymptomatic patients given the risk of serious complications, such as cholangitis, obstructive jaundice (which can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis), and pancreatitis.

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (UPGRADE trial) [^114boo4f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary outcome measure

The primary endpoint of this study is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as hospital admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Hospital visit is a condition, because all patients with noteworthy symptoms will eventually visit the hospital. Mild and self-limiting complaints are not a large burden to the health care system or to the patient, and usually gallstone involvement is not objectified in these patients. Symptomatic gallstone disease is defined as biliary pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or biliary colics. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed in the presence of two of the three following: upper abdominal pain; serum lipase or amylase levels above 3 times the upper level of normal; characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Pancreatitis is regarded of biliary origin when imaging reveals gallstones, sludge or a dilated common bile duct, or when laboratory investigation reveals an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > 2 times higher than normal values, with ALT > aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the updated Tokyo Guidelines. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in the presence of at least one local sign of inflammation (either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count). Choledocholithiasis is defined as the presence of stones in the extrahepatic bile ducts as proven by clinical imaging, or clinical suspicion based on abnormal liver function tests in combination with upper abdominal pain for which an ERCP or PTC was indicated. Cholangitis is diagnosed when there is a sign of systemic inflammation (fever/shaking chills or laboratory evidence of inflammatory response) and either clinical or laboratory evidence of cholestasis (total bilirubin ≥ 34 μmol/L, or increased serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ALT, or AST > 1.5× higher than the upper limit of normal value) or evidence of cholestasis on biliary imaging (biliary dilatation or evidence of the etiology on imaging). Biliary colics are defined as upper abdominal pain (either right upper quadrant or epigastric pain) lasting at least 30 min with gallstones visible on ultrasound, according to the Rome criteria. In case of doubt whether a participant has reached the primary endpoint, endpoint adjudication will be done by an independent blinded committee.

### Cholic acid (Cholbam) [^113gTYC4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2. Treatment Monitoring

Treatment with CHOLBAM should be initiated and monitored by an experienced hepatologist or pediatric gastroenterologist.

Monitor serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and INR every month for the first 3 months, every 3 months for the next 9 months, every 6 months during the subsequent three years, and annually thereafter. Monitor more frequently during periods of rapid growth, concomitant disease, and pregnancy. Administer the lowest dose of CHOLBAM that effectively maintains liver function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Discontinue treatment with CHOLBAM if liver function does not improve within 3 months of the start of treatment or if complete biliary obstruction develops.

Discontinue treatment with CHOLBAM at any time if there are persistent clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Concurrent elevations of serum GGT and serum ALT may indicate CHOLBAM overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Continue to monitor laboratory parameters of liver function and consider restarting at a lower dose when parameters return to baseline.

Assessment of serum or urinary bile acid levels using mass spectrometry is used in the diagnosis of bile acid synthesis disorders due to SEDs and PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders. The utility of bile acid measurements in monitoring the clinical course of patients and in decisions regarding dose adjustment has not been demonstrated.

2.3 Administration Instructions

Take CHOLBAM with food.
Take CHOLBAM at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours (or at as great an interval as possible) after a bile acid binding resin or aluminum-based antacid.
Do not crush or chew the capsules.
For patients unable to swallow the capsules, open the capsules and mix the contents with infant formula or expressed breast milk (for younger children), or soft food such as mashed potatoes or apple puree (for older children and adults) in order to mask any unpleasant taste:
Hold the capsule over the prepared liquid/food, gently twist open, and allow the contents to fall into the liquid/food.
Mix the entire capsule contents with one or two tablespoons (15 mL to 30 mL) of infant formula, expressed breast milk, or soft food such as mashed potatoes or apple puree.
Stir for 30 seconds.
The capsule contents will remain as fine granules in the milk or food and will not dissolve.
Administer the mixture immediately.

### Eleven-year experience on the endoscopic treatment of post-cholecystectomy bile leaks [^1164hY8w]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Biliary stricture occurred in only three patients with leak from CHD and CBD and associated stenosis in the cholangiography. Two patients were treated with combination of balloon dilation and stenting and one underwent hepaticojejunal anastomosis. Factors that contribute to stricture formation include local ischemia, electrosurgical injury at surgery and peribiliary inflammation as a result of bile leak. On the other hand, comparably to our findings, endoscopic stenting helps to avoid surgery in more than 80% of patients bearing postcholecystectomy CBD strictures. Complementary percutaneous drainage of bilomas is useful. In our study, a patient with biloma underwent successful percutaneous drainage and three patients with small collections were treated conservatively.

Importantly, we consider that an ERCP should be performed as soon as a probable biliary problem is suspected, particularly bile from the surgically placed abdominal drain, fever, or abdominal distention. Elevated liver function tests during the first two days after cholecystectomy may have no pathologic significance, but the persistence of abnormal liver function tests for more than 72 hours postoperatively should prompt a retrograde opacification and offer possible treatments. Several authors have also emphasized the importance of early aggressive investigation in patients with diffuse abdominal pain, fever, malaise, or liver function abnormalities after cholecystectomy. It should be noted that early ERCP decreases the total hospital stay, thereby reducing the total cost for the patient. In our case series the median time interval from cholecystectomy to ERCP was 8 days. These time intervals show that surgeons often underestimate the importance of prompt referral of patients with possible bile leaks to an experienced biliary endoscopist.

In conclusion, despite the retrospective design of the study, our findings suggest that endoscopic intervention should be considered as the preferred treatment strategy in most patients with post-cholecystectomy bile leak.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Endoscopic treatment remains the first-choice treatment of post-cholecystectomy bile leaks.

What the new findings are:

Endoscopic stenting without sphincterotomy appeared to be safe in our pediatric patient with a bile leak, and suggests that sphincterotomy could be avoided in young patients to prevent long-term complications of duodenobiliary reflux.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis presenting with severe autoimmune neutropenia [^114rGVm3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 59-year-old female presented with non-specific right upper quadrant abdominal pain and intermittent fever with axillary temperature up to 37.9°C for a week, accompanied by mild arthralgias and general fatigue. She did not mention any history of prescription, herbal or over-the-counter medication, or consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs. Her medical history included a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 7 years previously because of acute calculous cholecystitis. She had no previous history of tattoos, no noteworthy allergies and no family history of liver, autoimmune or hematological disease. The results of the physical examination were unremarkable, except for mild icteric sclera and mild tenderness upon palpation of right upper quadrant of the abdomen without muscle tension.

Laboratory tests indicated acute hepatocellular liver injury with intrahepatic cholestasis. Specific values included aspartate aminotransferase 467 U/L (upper limits of normal [ULN] < 37 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 539 U/L (ULN < 45 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 134 U/L (ULN < 120 U/L), γ-glutamyl transferase 162 U/L (ULN < 38 U/L), total bilirubin 4.05 mg/dL (ULN < 1.2 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 2.08 mg/dL (ULN < 0.2 mg/dL), total protein 8.8 g/dL (normal values: 6.6–8.3 g/dL), albumin 3.6 g/dL (normal values: 3.5–5.2 g/dL), prothrombin time 11.6 sec, international normalized ratio 0.98. On presentation, the patient's hemogram revealed mild leucopenia (3.30 × 10 9 /μL) with severe isolated neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 554/L), with normal hematocrit (40.6%) and platelet count (208 × 10 9 /L). A peripheral smear showed decreased neutrophils. The patient was admitted and further investigation ensued.

### A young lady with post-partum jaundice and right upper quadrant lump abdomen: an unusual etiology [^116dJY3X]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Case report

A 22-year-old young lady was referred to the Gastroenterology department by her local physician with 4 weeks history of yellowish discoloration of urine and sclera. Lumpy upper abdomen and significant loss of weight (approx. 5 kg) were present for 3 weeks. There were no prodromal symptoms and she denied any history of pruritus or passage of light colored stool. Her drug and family histories were unremarkable.

She had normal full-term pregnancy with transvaginal delivery of a healthy infant 6 weeks previously. There were no complications during pregnancy and no evidence of jaundice or cholestasis during pregnancy. Patient had a sensation of a lump in the right upper hypochondrium which had been gradually increasing in size over the past 3 weeks. It was associated with colicky pain lasting for 15–20 min and then subsided gradually. The patient also had intermittent spikes of fever with chills for one week.

On general examination there was pallor, jaundice but no lymphadenopathy. Tenderness was present in the right hypochondrium and a globular bulge was felt 4 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatomegaly was present with left lobe enlargement more than the right lobe; margins were sharp with firm consistency. Routine investigations confirmed normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL) with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (10.5/6.8 mg/dL) and deranged liver function test (Table 1). Ultrasonography was done showing grossly dilated common bile duct with large filling defect throughout. Gross dilatation of intrahepatic biliary radicals and common hepatic ducts were seen.

Table 1
Summary of investigations

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) study of abdomen was done showing grossly dilated gallbladder with moderate to gross dilatation of intrahepatic biliary radicals and common bile duct (Fig. 1). A large polypoidal intraluminal multifocal enhancing lesion filling almost the entire common bile duct, cystic duct was also seen multifocally in the gallbladder. Multiple small hypodense lesions seen in both lobes showing peripheral rim enhancement clustered around central intra hepatic biliary radical dilatations were suggestive of cholangitic abscess.

### Prevalence, severity, duration and resolution of cholestasis after acute liver failure [^112V7VPK]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Objective

Persistent cholestasis may follow acute liver failure (ALF), but its course remains unknown. We aimed to describe the prevalence, onset, severity, duration and resolution of post-ALF cholestasis.

Design

Cohort of 127 adult patients with ALF at a liver transplantation centre identified using electronic databases. We obtained laboratory data every 6 hours for the first week, daily until day 30 and weekly, when documented, until day 180.

Results

Median age was 40.7 (IQR 31.0–52.4) years, median peak alanine aminotransferase level was 5494 (2521–8819) U/L and 87 (68.5%) cases had paracetamol toxicity. Overall, 12.6% underwent transplantation (3.4% for paracetamol vs 32.5% for non-paracetamol; p < 0.001). Ninety-day mortality was 20.7% for paracetamol versus 30.0% for non-paracetamol patients. All non-transplanted survivors reached a bilirubin level > 50 µmol/L, which peaked 3.5 (1.0–10.1) days after admission at 169.0 (80.0–302.0) µmol/L. At hospital discharge, 18.8% of patients had normal bilirubin levels and, at a median follow-up time from admission to last measurement of 16 (10–30) days, 46.9% had normal levels. Similarly, there was an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (207.0 (148.0–292.5) U/L) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (336.0 (209.5–554.5) U/L) peaking at 4.5 days, with normalised values in 40.3% and 8.3% at hospital discharge.

Conclusion

Post-ALF cholestasis is ubiquitous. Bilirubin, ALP and GGT peak at 3 to 5 days and, return to baseline in the minority of patients at median follow-up of 16 days. These data inform clinical expectations of the natural course of this condition.

Physical examination revealed jaundice, and tenderness with light palpation at the right upper quadrant of abdomen. Murphy's sign was positive. There was no palpable mass and Courvoisier's sign was negative. The bowel sound was normal in peristalsis and no abdominal bruit was found on auscultation.

Laboratory studies demonstrated a white blood count of 10,800/mm 3 (normal, 4,500 to 10,000/mm 3), a hemoglobin level of 15.3 g/dL (normal 14–18 g/dL), and a platelet count of 22.3 × 10 4 /mm 3 (normal, 13–40 × 10 4 /mm 3). The liver profile showed total bilirubin = 4.3 mg/dL (normal, 0.2–1.2 mg/dL), direct bilirubin = 3.2 mg/dL (normal, 0–0.4 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase = 108 IU/L (normal, 4–44 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase = 103 IU/L (normal, 8–38 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatatse = 327 IU/L (normal, 104–338IU/L). The serum levels of amylase and lipase were 166 U/L (normal, 43–116 U/L) and 208 U/L (normal, 13–60 U/L) respectively. Blood cultures were negative for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a distended gallbladder with thickened wall and filled with stones. A small amount of ascites was detected in the Morison's pouch. The common bile duct (CBD) was mildly dilated with some hyperechoic spots, indicating sandy CBD stones.

We present the case of a 33-year-old woman in her first pregnancy. She presented with pruritus at 34 weeks gestation. A diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy was made based on elevated bile acids and elevated liver transaminases. She re-presented 4 days later, jaundiced with abdominal pain and nausea, and was hypertensive. Her bilirubin was now elevated and her creatinine had doubled. The differential diagnosis-included pre-eclampsia and Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, and delivery was expedited. Postnatally, the patient became coagulopathic, though not thrombocytopaenic; she had persistent hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, developed acute pancreatitis and had profound ascites and peripheral oedema. Management was supportive with multidisciplinary care and over a period of 3 weeks she made a full clinical and biochemical recovery.

### Development of bile duct bezoars following cholecystectomy caused by choledochocolonic fistula formation [^114BB8NA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old female patient presented with a history of recurrent episodes of cholangitis during the last 6 months. She underwent open cholecystectomy five years ago for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Laboratory data on admission showed elevated alkaline phosphatase 1217 IU/L (nl 64–306); total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL (nl 0.2–1.1); SGOT 78 U/L (nl 5–40); and SGPT 85 U/L (nl 5–40). She was evaluated with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which revealed dense sludge occupying the entire common bile duct (CBD) up to the common hepatic duct [Fig. 1]. There was a fistulous tract between the CBD and transverse colon which necessitated surgical removal of the material from CBD, dismantling of fistula and closure of colonic rent [Fig. 2a, b, c]. Choledochocolonic fistula caused concretion of fecal matter in the CBD that accumulated and coalesced to form a bezoar. A histological assessment of the object revealed fibrinoid material with some cellular debris.

DIRECT CHOLANGIOGRAPHY

PRECAUTION

In the presence of acute pancreatitis, direct cholangiography, if necessary, should be employed with caution, injecting no more than 5 mL to 10 mL without undue pressure.

ADVERSE REACTION

Adverse reactions may often be attributed to injection pressure or excessive volume of the medium, resulting in overdistention. Such pressure may produce a sensation of epigastric fullness, followed by moderate pain in the back or right upper abdominal quadrant, which will subside when injection is stopped.

Hepatobiliary reflux of the medium may cause a pancholangitis or hepatitis which is usually transitory. Retrograde spread of the infection may produce liver abscess or septicemia. Pancreatic duct reflux may cause a transitory increase in serum amylase for a period of 6 to 18 hours without ill effects. Rarely it may cause pancreatitis.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The solution should be warmed to body temperature before administration. The injection is made slowly without undue pressure, taking great care to avoid introducing bubbles.

Operative — If no resistance is encountered, from 10 mL to 15 mL of a 25 percent to 50 percent solution is injected or instilled into the cystic duct or common bile duct, as indicated. In patients with obstructive jaundice, 40 mL to 50 mL of the medium may be injected directly into the gallbladder after aspiration of its contents.

Postexploratory or completion T tube cholangiography may also be performed after exploration of the common bile duct.

Postoperative — Delayed cholangiograms are usually made from the fifth to the tenth postoperative day prior to removal of the T tube.

In case of a dilated ductal tract, a larger volume (up to 100 mL) of radiopaque medium may be required for complete filling and visualization.

PERCUTANEOUS TRANSHEPATIC CHOLANGIOGRAPHY

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is recommended for carefully selected patients for the differential diagnosis of jaundice due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction or parenchymal disease. The procedure is only employed where oral or intravenous cholangiography and other procedures have failed to provide the necessary information. In obstructive cases, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is used to determine the cause and site of the obstruction to help plan surgery. The technique may also be of value in avoiding laparotomy in poor risk jaundice patients since failure to enter a duct suggest hepatocellular disease. Careful attention to technique is essential for the success and safety of the procedure. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia following analgesic premedication (eg, 100 mg meperidine intramuscularly).

### Development of bile duct bezoars following cholecystectomy caused by choledochoduodenal fistula formation: a case report [^115iSSsQ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The recurrence of obstructive jaundice after cholecystectomy is estimated to occur in one to seven per cent of all cholecystectomy cases. Symptoms may be due to retained stones which were unrecognized at the time of the initial operation, the development of a bile duct stricture or the presence of a long cystic duct remnant. Furthermore, parasitic infections of the hepatobiliary system, such as fascioliasis and ascariasis, account for other rare causes of recurrent bile duct obstructions, which may mimic the choledocholithiasis picture.

We present another cause of cholestatic jaundice, not commonly considered in differential diagnoses: the obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts by the concretions of fibrinoid materials (biliary bezoars), attributed to the existence of a fistula between the duodenum and the bile duct.

### Cholic acid (Cholbam) [^116X291G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Of 29 patients in Trial 1 with PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders, 12 patients between the ages of 7 months and 2.5 years died. In the majority of these patients (8/12), the cause of death was attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or to a worsening of their primary illness.

Two additional patients in Trial 1 (1 SED and 1 PD) died who had been off study medication for more than one year with the cause of death most likely being a progression of underlying liver disease. Of the patients who died with disease progression, laboratory testing showed abnormal serum transaminases, bilirubin, or cholestasis on liver biopsy suggesting worsening of their underlying cholestasis.

In Trial 2, among the 31 patients with SED, two patients (1 new patient and 1 who rolled over from Trial 1) died. The cause of death in both cases was unrelated to their primary treatment or progression of their underlying liver disease.

Of the 12 patients with PD in Trial 2, four patients died between the ages of 4 and 8 years (1 new patient and 3 who rolled over from Trial 1). The cause of death in three of these patients was attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or to a worsening of their primary illness.

Worsening of Liver Impairment

Seven patients in Trial 1 (4 SED and 3 PD) and 3 patients in Trial 2 (1 SED and 2 PD) experienced worsening serum transaminases, elevated bilirubin values, or worsening cholestasis on liver biopsy during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Common Adverse Reactions

There were 12 adverse reactions reported across 9 patients in the trials, with diarrhea being the most common reaction in approximately 2% of the patient population. All other adverse reactions represented 1% of the patient population. The breakdown by trial follows:

Only one of the reactions (peripheral neuropathy) resulted in discontinuation of medication for a patient in Trial 2. An additional five SED patients (3 from Trial 1 and 2 from Trial 2) and 1 PD patient (Trial 1) discontinued medication and withdrew from the study due to a worsening of their primary disease.

The development of symptomatic cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy has been reported in a single patient with 3β-HSD deficiency.

NCCN biliary tract cancers — gallbladder cancer diagnosis and prognostic impact of jaundice notes frequent incidental detection and worse outcomes with jaundice. In a retrospective review of 435 patients, 123 patients (47%) were diagnosed as an incidental finding after cholecystectomy. Jaundice correlated with more advanced-stage disease (96% vs. 60%; P < .001) and lower disease-specific survival (6 vs.16 months; P < .0001) than in those without jaundice. Among 82 patients presenting with jaundice, the resectability rate was low (7%), negative margins were rarer (5%), and there were no disease-free survivors at 2 years. Another study reported resection with curative intent in 30% of jaundiced patients versus 75% without jaundice. Jaundice also increased perioperative morbidity (69% vs. 38% in those without jaundice) and was associated with worse OS post-resection (median of 14 vs. 32 months in those without jaundice).

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^1147c4rs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Suspected choledocholithiasis — initial investigations and imaging accuracy — For all patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, obtaining liver transaminases, bilirubin and a transabdominal ultrasound are recommended as preliminary investigations, and ultrasound findings consistent with choledocholithiasis include visualization of a common bile duct stone and a dilated common bile duct greater than 8-mm; the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be considered when deciding on management. If diagnosis remains in question, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive option with a sensitivity of > 90% and specificity nearing 100%, though common bile duct stones identified require intervention by another method to be removed; endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has average sensitivity and specificity approximately 95% and 97%, respectively.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^116XPLCC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms of BDI

The most frequent complaints of patients with BDI are persistent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and/or vomiting, fever, and jaundice. The BDI clinical presentations are related to the type of injury. The two most frequent clinical scenarios are bile leakage and bile duct obstruction. In patients with a bile leak, an early visible sign is the presence of bile from the drain or surgical incision. If the subhepatic region is not drained, a perihepatic bile collection (biloma), abscess, or biliary peritonitis may develop with corresponding clinical signs. Generally, jaundice is not observed or is mild in these cases because cholestasis does not occur. In patients with biliary strictures, symptoms are often delayed. Cholestatic jaundice with choluria, fecal acholia, and pruritus are the most common clinical signs and symptoms. If cholangitis develops, fever with chills is typically associated with jaundice. Recurrent cholangitis is the main consequence of bile duct stricture, hepatic injury and dysfunction from complete bile duct occlusion. Sepsis and multiorgan failure may develop in both clinical settings.

When BDI is not identified intraoperatively or during the first postoperative week, patients may have an insidious evolution with relapsing abdominal pain, cholangitis, and bile collections. A late diagnosis, which sometimes is made years after surgery following multiple ineffective attempted repairs or inappropriate management, may result in increased complexity of bile duct repair. Moreover, even if successfully managed, the patient's quality of life and survival may be impaired. Indeed, the clinical course of undiagnosed or unrepaired BDI can evolve to secondary biliary cirrhosis with portal hypertension, liver failure, and, ultimately, death.

### Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) [^117AbP9B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of EPIDIOLEX treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with EPIDIOLEX, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with EPIDIOLEX, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in EPIDIOLEX dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with EPIDIOLEX, as appropriate. Discontinue EPIDIOLEX in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the ULN. Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes. Consider dosage adjustment of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver (e.g., valproate and clobazam).

### Severe cholestatic jaundice after a single administration of ajmaline; a case report and review of the literature [^116N1bSh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Ten weeks after the test, his jaundice and pruritus had worsened, and he was admitted to hospital for investigation. His liver enzyme profile was abnormal on admission and continued to deteriorate, peaking at day 81 after the administration of ajmaline with ALT 90 U/L, AST 67 U/L, ALP 309 U/L, GGT 120 U/L, and bilirubin 244 μmol/L (see Figure 1); no biochemistry results from prior to his illness were available. His platelet count, eosinophil count, prothrombin time and plasma albumin remained within normal limits throughout. His hepatitis A, B, C and E serology were negative. An auto-antibody profile (including anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-liver-kidney-muscle antibody, anti-nuclear and anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibodies) was negative, and his serum markers of iron and copper metabolism normal. Inflammatory markers and white cell count differentials were normal, excluding underlying sepsis. A repeat ultrasound of his liver and biliary tree showed similar findings to that performed previously. Magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) confirmed a CBD of normal calibre, with no filling defects detected at any point in the biliary system. The patient underwent liver biopsy for further assessment. This demonstrated normal bile ducts, but striking centrilobular cholestasis and focal rosetting of hepatocytes (Figure 2). The biopsy results were consistent with a cholestatic drug reaction. Of note, the history of ajmaline administration had not been volunteered by the patient prior to the liver biopsy, and only emerged subsequently after liaison between the patient's hepatologists and his family physician.

By nine days into his admission, his symptoms had begun to improve and his biochemistry stabilised, and he was discharged back to community care. When reviewed three weeks later, his pruritus had completely resolved. By one year after the initial exposure to ajmaline, his serum bilirubin and liver enzymes had near normalised (Figure 1).

Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

All six showed jaundice and two had acholic stool. There were no infants with hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. All 6 patients had increased serum DB (median 7.4 mg/dL, range 3.7–11.0 mg/dL) and TB (median 11.5 mg/dL, range 5.8–15.6 mg/dL). The levels of AST (median 27 IU/L, range 25–61 IU/L) and ALT (median 15 IU/L, range 11–40 IU/L) were normal. Cholesterol (median 166 mg/dL, range 123–246 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase (median 390 U/L, range 234–831 U/L), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT, median 149 IU/L, range 33–209 IU/L) levels were normal or elevated. Prothrombin time (PT) was normal (median 1.1 international normalized ratio (INR)). Serum bile acid was measured in 1 patient and was over 150 µmol/L. Three infants underwent liver biopsy at 2 months of age and showed moderate intracanalicular and intracytoplasmic cholestasis but no melanin-like pigmentation, inflammation and fibrosis.

### Enalapril maleate (enalapril maleate oral solution) [^114WKb5V]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypotension

Enalapril can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology.

In these patients, enalapril should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of enalapril and/or diuretic is increased.

Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be through this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.4 Hepatic Failure

Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.

5.5 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function in patients treated with enalapril. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on enalapril. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on enalapril [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

5.6 Hyperkalemia

Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving enalapril. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Prevalence, severity, duration and resolution of cholestasis after acute liver failure [^113ZYhDf]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rapidly progressive severe illness typically leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. ALF carries a high mortality without emergency liver transplantation (ELT). Nonetheless, with intensive supportive care, some patients (especially after paracetamol overdose) recover sufficient function without transplantation. However, in all cases, in the absence of transplantation, improvement can be slow and may be associated with several biochemical abnormalities.

Almost all studies of the biochemical abnormalities associated with ALF have focused on aminotransferase levels on admission to hospitaland/or have followed biochemical recovery for just 1 week from admission. No studies have provided a prolonged detailed assessment of markers of ALF cholestasis (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)). This is unfortunate because prolonged postinjury jaundice may be of concern to patients, families and clinicians. Moreover, knowledge of the typical course of postinjury cholestasis would provide useful diagnostic and prognostic information.

Accordingly, in order to define the natural course of such cholestasis in the absence of liver transplantation, we aimed to study the prevalence, severity, duration and resolution of postinjury cholestasis in ALF patients overall and according to the aetiology of ALF (paracetamol vs non-paracetamol).

### Safe cholecystectomy multi-society practice guideline and state of the art consensus conference on prevention of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^113B9nNi]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Inflammation phases — timing windows and expected favorability for cholecystectomy are outlined as follows: Phase 2 spans 72 hours to 10 days and is expected to be less favorable for cholecystectomy due to tissue swelling and increased vascularity; Phase 3 spans 10 days to 6 weeks and is expected to be much less favorable for cholecystectomy with acute and chronic inflammation; Phase 4 is 6 weeks or later and is expected to be more favorable again for cholecystectomy with predominately chronic inflammation. There is also some justification for a period greater than 12 weeks but there is very little information in the literature that this time period had been the subject of study.

### A rare late complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114yVuJz]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

An 86-year-old woman presented three years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with right upper quadrant pain and raised inflammatory markers. Liver function tests were normal; however, a previous ultrasound scan suggested a common bile duct stone so she was treated for cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis. Repeat ultrasound scan again showed a common bile duct (CBD) stone and also a subdiaphragmatic abscess. CT scan confirmed the abscess, associated with a surgical clip from her previous surgery. There was no evidence of a persistent CBD stone on the CT scan. She was treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and her symptoms improved. Follow-up MRI did not show any choledocholithiasis. Surgical clips causing delayed abscess formation are very unusual. We discuss the presentation, investigations and treatment of this interesting case. Existing relevant literature is reviewed, and management strategies to treat such rare complications are suggested.

### Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes after short-term administration of amoxicillin [^117RB5pK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Amoxicillin is a widely used antibiotic, rarely being considered a cause of hepatic injury. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who developed a vanishing bile duct syndrome 8 weeks after initiation of amoxicillin therapy. Liver biopsy showed destruction and loss of preformed bile ducts together with an inflammatory infiltrate involving eosinophilic leucocytes. Cholestasis was progressive despite prednisolone treatment and was accompanied by elevation of pancreatic enzymes. The patient died after 18 months from progressive liver failure. This case illustrates that amoxicillin alone can be a cause of progressive and ultimately fatal vanishing bile duct syndrome.

### Impact of jaundice on outcomes following emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with choledocholithiasis [^116futFc]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Traditional teaching dictates that it may not be prudent to take the jaundiced patient to theatre for emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy as they may experience worse outcomes following surgery.

Methods

A prospective cohort of 104 patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was stratified into two groups using a serum total bilirubin of above 50 μmol/L (2.9 mg/dL) to define the jaundiced group. Primary outcomes were morbidity and mortality rate. The Clavien-Dindo classification and the novel Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) were applied to the grading of surgical complications. Multivariate analysis to identify possible predictors of morbidity and length of stay was also performed.

Results

Overall morbidity rate in the jaundiced group was 28 versus 36% (control), p = 0.405. Mean CCI in the jaundiced group was 5.28 versus 8.00 in the control group, p = 0.229. Mean length of stay was shorter in the jaundiced group, 4.65 versus 6.51 days, p = 0.036. There were no peri-operative mortalities or conversions to open surgery. Only male gender and the presence of retained stones were found to be associated with morbidity. Serum total bilirubin was not associated with increased morbidity.

Conclusion

Amongst patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who are found to have choledocholithiasis on IOC, the presence of jaundice does not appear to contribute towards increased morbidity.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholangitis, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests (CBC and serum biochemistry), EASL 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain the following tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with fever, chills, abdominal pain and/or jaundice:

- WBCs

- CRP

- liver biochemical tests.

Timing definitions for delayed surgery — In the debate over early versus delayed cholecystectomy, there is agreement that there is an unfavorable intermediate period during which cholecystectomy is more difficult due to the predictable severity of inflammation, and the span of this unfavorable intermediate period is at a minimum between 10 days and 4 weeks; studies that classify surgeries during this period as delayed are not adequately "delayed", which biases results in favor of early cholecystectomy.

Discussion

A case of a patient with suspected AFLP and poor outcome with the diagnosis confirmed at post-mortem is presented. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion of the condition in women presenting with jaundice in pregnancy. Other differential diagnoses of jaundice occurring during pregnancy include viral hepatitis, preeclampsia, cholelithiasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). The clinical presentation and laboratory findings of AFLP are vague and nonspecific, and pose a diagnostic challenge. It is important to always consider life threatening differentials which may require prompt delivery and intensive care. Whilst HELLP syndrome and AFLP usually complicate the third trimester of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome (1 in 5000) is seen more frequently than AFLP (1 in 13000). In our case, the patient was at risk for both conditions as she was young and nulliparous. The blood pressure was however normal and urinalysis was negative for proteinuria. Key features of jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and the episodes of hypoglycaemia, normal ALT, AST, PLT and a very high WBC as well as the coagulopathy shown by upper gastrointestinal bleeding made the diagnosis of AFLP more likely. Other tests that were not available to us were coagulation studies which would have aided in the diagnosis of the coagulopathy and timely supportive care with blood products. Viral hepatitis also presents with jaundice but is characterised by a generally unwell patient with fever, nausea, vomiting and markedly elevated aminotransferases. Patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy commonly complain of pruritus and their serum bilirubin levels do not usually exceed 6 mg/dl. Ingestion of drugs and herbal remedies that could lead to hypoglycaemia were ruled out from the history. Patients with cholelithiasis, in addition to the jaundice, also have pain the right upper quadrant as well as fever and an ultrasound scan aids in the diagnosis. Cholelithiasis and viral hepatitis may occur at any time during pregnancy unlike AFLP which is usually diagnosed in the third trimester as noted earlier. Sepsis was unlikely as the patient had no tachycardia or hypotension and remained normothermic. Other differential diagnoses were excluded in our case based on the symptoms, the timing of the presentation and investigations that were available. Our patient had a profound fall in the haemoglobin. It was difficult to attribute this fall due to haemolysis alone as we were unable to get the results for bilirubin levels, reticulocyte count and a peripheral blood smear. Blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract may be difficult to ascertain but may account for the fall.

### Prolonged, but transient, elevation of liver and biliary function tests in a healthy infant affected with breast milk jaundice [^115uWmRq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is a common finding in newborns. When it is exaggerated, it is usually investigated in order to exclude several diseases, such as newborn's haemolytic diseases, infections or hypothyroidism. Breast milk jaundice is a form of neonatal jaundice related to breast feeding and it is not usually associated with any clinical issue and/or other laboratory abnormalities. We describe a case of breast milk jaundice being associated, unexpectedly, to significant elevation of plasmatic liver and biliary enzymes. Despite the infant's good clinical condition and growth, several investigations were performed and these ruled out metabolic, infectious and autoimmune liver diseases. All liver function tests normalised by 6–7months of life. We suggest that the finding of hypertransaminasaemia and hyper-γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in a benign clinical context (similar to what we described) should be followed for 6–7months before performing sophisticated and expensive diagnostic investigations which aim at excluding some unlikely and severe diseases in a completely asymptomatic infant.
