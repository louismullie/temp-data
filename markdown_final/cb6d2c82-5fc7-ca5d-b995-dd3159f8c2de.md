## Question

Tim decides to do a movie marathon. The first movie is 2 hours long. The next movie is 50% longer. And the last movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous 2 movies. How long was his movie marathon?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long Tim's movie marathon lasted, given the durations of three movies with relative length relationships. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the duration of the first movie. Then, I should calculate the duration of the second movie as 50% longer than the first. Next, I will compute the combined time of the first two movies. After that, I need to determine the duration of the third movie as 1 hour shorter than that combined time. Finally, I will add all three durations to get the total marathon length and double-check the arithmetic for accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: the first movie is 2 hours long, so Movie 1 = 2 hours.

> Now, the second movie is 50% longer than the first, so I should multiply 2 hours by 1.5 to get Movie 2 = 2 × 1.5 = 3 hours. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating "50% longer" with "50% of"; yes, 50% longer means 1.5 times the original, so 3 hours is correct.

> Next, I should calculate the combined time of the first two movies: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours. Hold on, I should verify the addition before proceeding; 2 + 3 is indeed 5 hours.

> The third movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous two, so Movie 3 = 5 hours − 1 hour = 4 hours. I need to ensure I'm subtracting, not adding; yes, 1 hour shorter means subtraction, so 4 hours is correct.

> Finally, I will sum the three movie durations to get the total marathon length: 2 hours + 3 hours + 4 hours = 9 hours. Let me double-check the total; 2 + 3 is 5, and 5 + 4 is 9, so the total is 9 hours.

---

The total duration of Tim's movie marathon is **9 hours**. The first movie is 2 hours, the second is 3 hours (50% longer), and the third is 4 hours (1 hour shorter than the combined 5 hours of the first two). Adding these gives a total of 9 hours.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | First movie duration | Given | 2 hours |
| 2 | Second movie duration (50% longer than the first) | 2 hours × 1.5 | 3 hours |
| 3 | Combined duration of the first two movies | 2 hours + 3 hours | 5 hours |
| 4 | Third movie duration (1 hour shorter than the combined duration of the first two) | 5 hours − 1 hour | 4 hours |
| 5 | Total duration of the movie marathon | 2 hours + 3 hours + 4 hours | 9 hours |

---

Therefore, Tim's movie marathon lasted a total of **9 hours**.

Uncertainty and odds

Prediction intervals (like confidence intervals) are calculated for a given level of uncertainty, α. For example, the region between the lower and upper prediction interval for an expected value prediction at α = 0.10 implies that one would expect any observation to fall within the interval with 1 − α = 0.90, or 90% likelihood. Importantly, this calculation assumes that the uncertainty (10%) is equally distributed above and below the corresponding interval (two-tailed). So, in effect, the likelihood that an observation will fall outside and below the lower interval (one-tailed) is α /2, or in the example, 5%. In the language of odds, it could equally be said that with a "1 in 20" chance, an event below the lower prediction bound might be observed. For the sub–2-h question, this is exactly the statistically posed question needed to ask of the estimated model. To support ease of interpretation, I shall thus report (two-tailed) α values and "1 in… " odds (one-tailed focus).

All results are provided at a range of α (and corresponding one-tailed odds) levels of uncertainty to provide the reader with a range of risk/uncertainty appetites to work with. However, "1 in 10" (one-tailed; α = 0.20, two-tailed) is used as the benchmark level of uncertainty, as this level of odds squarely places a threshold outcome in the "reasonable chance" category, but not in the "extremal" case. In other words, I will concentrate on the phrasing, "with a 1 in 10 chance of success, when will [outcome x] occur?"

RESULTS

Model estimation

Model estimates are given in Table 1 for males and females, respectively, and graphically by fitted models presented in Figures 1 A and 2. Model fits indicate root mean square error of just 0.0085 (males) and 0.032 (females) and R² for both estimated models are above 0.97. For males, this implies that the baseline model is, on average, accurate to the historical data to within less than 1%, or around 70s, over a 66-yr period, which saw a 19-min (1140 s) decline in the world record time. For females, accuracy is within around 3%, or around 200 s, over the same period where the world record declined by 1 h 22 min (> 5000 s).

Results

The search strategy yielded 219 references after duplicates were removed. The titles and abstracts of those articles were reviewed and 182 were discarded. The full texts of the 37 remaining articles were obtained. An ancestry and citation searchof those articles was performed to ensure no articles had been missed and 14 articles were included in the final analysis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Search strategy and outcomes.

It became clear that there were two categories of papers. The first category comprised papers that examined total marathon participation and associated mortality in countries over a period of time. The second category comprised a number of papers that focused on specific marathons, including the Boston and London Marathons.

American marathons

There have been a number of efforts to collect data from a larger number of marathons that have been staged across America with specific searches of news outlets and approaches to medical teams to endeavour to collect all of the fatalities associated with races. It is probable that the data from these papers overlap.

Introduction

It has long been recognised that during endurance events, such as marathons, fatalities may occur. These events are fortunately rare, but when they occur, often make front page headlines, for example, the death of a young man at the 2018 London Marathon.

As a consequence of the availability heuristic, a widely known cognitive bias, the true risks of participation may be overestimated by both participants and doctors, and act as a potential barrier to marathon participation.

Therefore, it is important for the general public and for doctors who may have to advise patients whether or not to participate, about the likely risks of harm. It is also important for doctors to understand which conditions in particular should be sought prior to participation. Finally, it is important for race organisers and their associated medical teams to understand the frequency of such events, as well as the likely emergencies that they may have to deal with and where such events are most likely to occur.

The purpose of this paper is to draw together the current literature that has been published to quantify the risk of dying during a marathon and the reasons why, whether there is any difference between the sexes, and at what stage of the marathon most fatalities occur, to assist with advising participants and planning medical cover.

Of particular note is Joyner's much earlier study that took a purely physiological approach to the question of the limiting male marathon time (i.e. V̇O₂max, running economy, etc.). Remarkably, Joyner's final estimate was 1 h 57 min 58 s, just 7 s outside my own preferred (1 in 10) limiting performance estimate for the male marathon of 1 h 58 min 5 s. Given the completely different basis for these estimates, the similarity in outcomes strongly triangulates the work of the present study.

The question of an equivalent "sub–2-h" threshold for females has been studied explicitly in Ref. Here (and similar to Ref.), the authors took a 10%–13% performance similarity between males and females as given, and, when applied to the 120 min "sub–2-h" marathon threshold, found that the current female world record was effectively already equivalent to the sub–2-h threshold, commenting that (current female world record holder) "Radcliffe's performances were exceptional". Without detracting from Radcliffe's remarkable sequences of world record runs, the results of my analysis shown in Figure 2 indicate that Radcliffe's most recent world record fell very near the expected value curve for the female world record progression, providing a different perspective to the analysis of Hunter et al. Indeed, what is exceptional is why the recent period has not seen more energetic pursuit of the female world record progression by all stakeholders. On this point, I agree with Hunter et al. who note that most likely asymmetric opportunities exist for females to compete at the highest level in athletic competition. Following this line of inquiry, I note that the demographics of elite marathoning, detailed in Ref. show that for males, when comparing the average running speed of the top 10 athletes by continent of origin, male African runners demonstrate significantly faster running speeds than European runners to the tune of around 2.5%. However, this result is not borne out for females, with female African and European elite marathoners having identical mean running speeds (5.00 m·s⁻¹), suggesting that, if one assumes that European talent search mechanisms are somewhat exhaustive, there are potentially missing African elite females in the marathon. For example, if I apply the male African/European running speed ratio to Radcliffe's world record marathon speed (treating Radcliffe as a representative top-ranked European runner), I obtain a hypothesized running speed of 5.1932 m·s⁻¹, or a marathon time of 2 h 12 min 4.5 s. If such a prototypical African athlete had turned up at the recent 2018 Berlin marathon where the male world record was set, a time of 2 h 12 min 4.5 s would have fallen, just like the male world record time, just inside the 1 in 4 (25% likely) prediction band for the female world record marathon progression model (Fig. 2), indicating that this hypothetical computation is realistic. In any case, this exercise serves to bolster the view that African female marathoners are highly likely to be a genetic pool of future world record marathon progression and correspondingly point to institutional, economic, and social questions as to why this prototypical African female was not, indeed, running to victory on the streets of Berlin in 2018.

### Mortality during marathons: a narrative review of the literature [^eedbfd84]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Summary

These sets of data can be drawn together, yielding a death rate of 1/96 207 finishers or 1.04 deaths/100 000 finishers (table 3). The rates of death are higher than those ascertained by more general surveys, as would be predicted as the authors were directly linked with providing medical support to the marathons over many years. Unfortunately, there are no data to compare fatalities by sex or location in the marathon.

The limits of human performance are an area that has attracted a richer set of academic studies. Two related empirical studies that both use nonlinear fits to the world record progression are those of Nevill and Whyte and Denny. Nevill and Whyte use an expected value logistic modeling approach for male world record progression over a longer series, and given that the logistic function and limiting exponential function (of the present study) share the same tail behavior, Nevill and Whyte provide a reasonable test of the framework of my approach. If I apply the same expected value only approach of Nevill and Whyte (i.e. the main curve, not the prediction interval boundary) and truncate my data to 2005 per the comparison, I obtain a limiting male world record time of 124 min 0 s, which indeed falls within 30 s to Nevill and Whyte's 123 min 38 s (Table 3 in the reference). Alternatively, Denny comes at the question from a biological standpoint, comparing greyhounds, horses, and humans in the same treatment. Similarly to Nevill and Whyte, Denny applies a logistic estimation approach, in addition to a population-based approach to the limiting estimation. However, in contrast to Nevill and Whyte, Denny takes the variation around the curve into account, with a second-step GEV estimation. By this two-step approach, Denny produces long-run estimates of 120 min 28 s for males and 124 min 58 s for females. On face value, these estimates seem quite high compared with the present study. However, results are not directly comparable as Denny uses "annual best" times, with years that have runners found to be repeat "annual best" time holders being omitted (due to assumptions of the GEV step) rather than official IAAF world record times only. Although "annual best" reflects Denny's biological/population framework for the "fastest example of the species per year", it necessarily oversamples from fast but non–world record performances, and so, estimates of both the curve and the variation from the curve will necessarily be blunted. Incidentally, for completeness, I apply GEV analysis to the residuals from the male and female fitting procedure in the present study and find that the first parameter ("a") is not significantly of negative sign, and so, the maximum variation from the GEV is not defined. This matches my intuition around world record–only data having greater variance than "annual best" data.

### Mortality during marathons: a narrative review of the literature [^d1402906]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

Millions of community-dwelling individuals run marathons each year. There are infrequent deaths, which are often reported widely, and may create unnecessary alarm about the potential risks. Equally, sensible planning for such eventualities is important when staging an event.

Objective

The aim of the review was to determine the risk of death from running a marathon and the likely location of such deaths in order to inform the public of the likely risks and improve planning for such events.

Design

Narrative review.

Data Sources

Primary: PubMed. Secondary: contact was made with the organisers and medical teams of specific marathons and online data sought where necessary.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies had to report the number of participants and deaths during, or within 24 hours of completing the marathon. Results relevant to half marathons or ultramarathons or other endurance events, such as triathlons, were not included. Deaths due to terrorist activity were not included.

Results

The risk of death estimated by these studies was approximately 0.67 per 100000 finishers, that is, 1 death per 149968 participants. From those studies that reported deaths by sex, the rate of male deaths was 0.98/100 000 (1 per 102 503) vs 0.41/100 000 (1 per 243 879) in females. Deaths tended to occur in the last quarter of the race.

Summary/Conclusion

The risk of death from participating in a marathon is small. Men are more at risk than women. Deaths tend to occur later in the race.

### Movie viewing elicits rich and reliable brain state dynamics [^626aecc2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

States are consistent over participants during movie watching

We next assessed the degree of inter-subject consistency in the expression of these ten states while participants watched the movie or underwent the resting-state condition. Using a reverse-inference approach, we investigated whether fluctuations in the level of between-subject consistency corresponded with the occurrence of particular events of the movie. Specifically, we counted how many participants visited a particular brain state in a small window around each time point and aligned these to independent annotations of the movie's structure and narrative (Table 1).

Table 1
Annotation of the movie scenes.

These annotations highlight the very high inter-subject consistency either in session A or session B. The time corresponding to the movie is given in minutes:seconds. Further details about the movie are available in Supplementary Note 1. The brief descriptions provided here match independent movie annotations; i.e. Turning point, Development, Obstacle, or Climax. The full details and annotations are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

As anticipated, movie viewing was associated with greater consistency across participants, relative to rest (Fig. 2; also Supplementary Figs 3, 4, and 6). Moreover, the co-occurrence of brain states across participants reached the highest levels during specific movie events (Table 1), with complete consistency observed during the viewing of 11 different scenes in either session A or session B (Fig. 2). For example, in the third act of the movie (from 14 m:14 s to 14 m:40 s), brain state 6 (high DMN and language network expression) was visited by all participants during the first viewing session and 12 participants in the second session (86% consistency). States 5, 9, and 10 were not often present during these consistent times. In contrast, high levels of between-subject consistency did not occur during the resting-state acquisition (Fig. 2).

### Competing risks of mortality with marathons: retrospective analysis [^08eb87da]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine from a societal perspective the risk of sudden cardiac death associated with running in an organised marathon compared with the risk of dying from a motor vehicle crash that might otherwise have taken place if the roads had not been closed.

Design

Population based retrospective analysis with linked ecological comparisons of sudden death.

Setting

Marathons with at least 1000 participants that had two decades of history and were on public roads in the United States, 1975–2004.

Main Outcome Measures

Sudden death attributed to cardiac causes or to motor vehicle trauma.

Results

The marathons provided results for 3,292,268 runners on 750 separate days encompassing about 14 million hours of exercise. There were 26 sudden cardiac deaths observed, equivalent to a rate of 0.8 per 100,000 participants (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.1). Because of road closure, an estimated 46 motor vehicle fatalities were prevented, equivalent to a relative risk reduction of 35% (95% confidence interval 17% to 49%). The net reduction in sudden death during marathons amounted to a ratio of about 1.8 crash deaths saved for each case of sudden cardiac death observed (95% confidence interval: 0.7 to 3.8). The net reduction in total deaths could not be explained by re-routing traffic to other regions or days and was consistent across different parts of the country, decades of the century, seasons of the year, days of the week, degree of competition, and course difficulty.

Conclusion

Organised marathons are not associated with an increase in sudden deaths from a societal perspective, contrary to anecdotal impressions fostered by news media.

2.2 data and preprocessing

fMRI data acquisition took place in a single session which included a short break in the middle. To keep the stimulus at a length of 2 h, some scenes were cut. The movie stimulus represents an FNM, as only scenes that were less relevant to the plot were cut, thus preserving the overarching story. For the purpose of data acquisition, the movie stimulus was separated into eight segments of approximately 15 min each, taking scene boundaries into consideration. This lead to an unequal number of volumes acquired per segment, which were 451, 441, 438, 488, 462, 439, 542, and 338 for segments 1–8, respectively (see Hanke et al.for details and code on movie segment creation). The movie segments were shown in chronological order. For each segment, T2✱‐weighted echo‐planar images (gradient‐echo, 2 s repetition time [TR], 30 ms echo time, 90° flip angle, 1943 Hz/Px bandwidth, parallel acquisition with sensitivity encoding [SENSE] reduction factor 2, 35 axial slices, 3.0 mm slice thickness, 80 × 80 voxels [3.0 × 3.0 mm] in‐plane resolution, 240 × 240 mm field‐of‐view, anterior‐to‐posterior phase encoding direction in ascending order, 10% inter‐slice gap, whole‐brain coverage) were acquired using a whole‐body 3 Tesla Philips Achieva dStream MRI scanner equipped with a 32 channel head coil.

All downloaded data were minimally preprocessed as described in Hanke et al. In short, preprocessing steps included defacing, motion correction, reslicing and data interpolation using in‐house codes that utilize the FSL toolkit. All codes are openly available under: For precise information about observed motion and data quality analyses, see Hanke et al. For this study, the native fMRI data were brought into MNI space using FSL's applywarp function for subsequent NFC extraction.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^60120887]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Figure 3 — world record (WR) marathon and outdoor 100-m sprint performance trends by sex are depicted from the years women could legally compete, with marathon data "(1970 onward)". In the marathon, "The decline in the women's WR was dramatic in the first 15 yr until ~1985 as more women competed", and the WR marathon sex difference is defined as "sex difference = [women − men]/men × 100", showing "a plateau of 10%–12% thereafter". For the outdoor 100-m sprint, WR data begin "(1922 onward)", and across both events "The trends for both events (A and C) show an initial rapid improvement in performance in the WR times by women relative to men, once women were permitted to compete".

### Immediate memory for "when, where and what": short-delay retrieval using dynamic naturalistic material [^c4b2e5c7]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

fMRI Analyses

Statistical inference was based on a random effects approach. This comprised two steps: first‐level analyses estimating contrasts of interest for each subject followed by second‐level analyses for statistical inference at the group‐level [Penny and Holmes, 2004]. For each of the two experiments, we used several different models depending on the specific questions that we sought to address (see below, and Supporting Information Table 1).

All the first‐level, subject‐specific models included one regressor modeling the presentation of the video clips irrespective of task, plus several regressors that modeled the retrieval phase according to the different conditions of interest (see leftmost column in Supporting Information Table 1). The regressor modeling the "encoding phase" (Movie‐regressor) was time‐locked to the onset of each video and had an event duration corresponding to the duration of each specific video (i.e. 7.72–11.40 s). All the retrieval‐related regressors were time‐locked to the onset of the probe image(s) and with a duration corresponding to the probe presentation at retrieval, that is, 4 s in Exp 1 and 5 s in Exp 2. All regressors were convolved with the SPM8 canonical hemodynamic response function. Time series were high‐pass filtered at 128 s and prewhitened by means of autoregressive model AR(1). The sections below detail how the trials were assigned to the retrieval regressors/conditions in the different analyses.

Experiment 1

For Exp 1 we used two different sets of first‐level models (see Supporting Information Table 1, leftmost column). The first set of models included the encoding‐regressor (Movie), plus 5 retrieval‐related conditions: temporal‐short (T short), temporal‐long (T long), spatial (S), object (O) trials and a condition modeling all the error trials irrespective of task (Error). The trials belonging to the Temporal task were modeled with two separate regressors accounting for the factor of temporal distance [T short vs. T long; cf. Kwok et al. 2012]. All temporal trials including probes with a temporal distance shorter than 1.9 s were modeled as T short, while those longer than 1.9 s modeled as T long.

Severity score

The median total weekly severity score was 56.5 (IQR 37.0–58.0). For illnesses, the median severity score was 60.0 (IQR 58.0–60.0). Similarly, acute injury showed a median severity score of 57.5 (IQR 37.0–66.0), whereas for overuse injury a median severity of 30.0 (IQR 28.0–37.0) was recorded (table 2). Based on the mean, the total weekly severity score was 54.1 (95% CI 53.7 to 54.5).

Post-movie questionnaire

The post-movie questionnaire had eight questions. Four questions assessed the following: whether the participants had seen the movie before (none had watched it before), if English was their native language (yes for all participants), how participants rated their English fluency (two participants indicated their fluency as 4 out of 5, whereas the remaining participants indicated 5 out of 5), and how well the participants understood the movie content (all indicated an understanding of 100%). These questions were omitted for the RSA analysis due to the lack of variability across participants. The four remaining questions more closely assessed the subjective appraisal of the movie and were used for the RSA:
Did you get bored during the 1st movie session? Not at all: 1 2 3 4 5: very bored
How well did you enjoy the 1st movie session? Not at all: 1 2 3 4 5: very enjoy
How emotional did you feel during the 1st movie? Very sad: 1 2 3 4 5: very happy
How was the audio quality for the 1st movie? Very poor: 1 2 3 4 5: very good

Pertaining to question 4, the audio quality itself did not change during recordings and all participants reported that they understood the movie content in a similar fashion. Participants likely rated this scale differently depending on their own engagement. To quantify participant differences in movie evaluation, a multidimensional scaling approach was applied to plot the questionnaire answers as points in a two-dimensional representation (engagement by evoked emotion). This approach revealed that there was a group of participants who were more engaged with the movie (i.e. low boredom score combined with high enjoyment, emotional and audio quality scores) and another group who were less engaged (i.e. having high boredom or a low score on the other three questions); see Fig. 6.

Analyses of brain state dynamics: rest versus movie viewing

We next quantified the dynamics of the ten brain states by assessing the following measures: (i) fractional occupancy (FO), defined as the proportion of total time spent in each given state; (ii) state dwell time, representing the total amount of time spent in each state, and (iii) state transition probabilities, representing the likelihood of specific transitions between distinct brain states (Fig. 4; see Supplementary Figs. 3–5 for confirmatory analyses).

Purpose

This study aimed to characterize and describe finishing time trends of the fastest 100 performers in the men's and women's marathon, half-marathon, and road 10-km each year from 2001 to 2019 and assess the underlying basis for recent performance improvements.

Methods

The top 100 performers for each sex, event, and year were partitioned into four arbitrary ranking groups: 1–10, 11–25, 26–50, and 51–100. The percent improvement in mean performance time for each year beyond 2001 was calculated for each ranking group, event, and sex. Multiple linear regression was also used to determine improvement trend for each ranking group, both sexes, and all events for each 3-yr period between Olympic years.

Results

In total, 11,400 performances in the marathon, half-marathon, and 10-km road races from 2001 to 2019 were analyzed. The 3-yr period preceding the original date of the Tokyo Olympics (2017–2019) accounted for 44% and 35% of the overall improvement in marathon time from 2001 to 2019 for women and men, respectively. The years 2017–2019 featured the largest average improvement of any 3-yr period and was the only period where nearly every ranking group in every event for both sexes improved.

Conclusions

The results suggest that recent world record performances are a result of overall circumstances affecting road racing (e.g., shoe technology) rather than the outstanding physiology of individual top runners, per se.

### Human running performance from real-world big data [^a987eaf0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Selection of subjects and activities

Users of the exercise tracking platform were selected as subjects for this study under the conditions that they had completed a run over the marathon distance (42,195 m) in the period between 1 Jul 2015 and 31 Dec 2018, and used the same GPS watch (Polar V800) for activity recording to assure comparable accuracy of GPS based distance recording. We analyzed the running data of ~19,000 individuals who completed ~2.5M activities with a total distance of ~32M km (see Table 1 for details). For each individual all running activities in the 180 days before a completed marathon race were grouped together with the marathon race and the groups labeled uniquely by a subject identifier (SID) and the marathon date (M-date). Note that an individual may have have completed multiple marathons during the studied period. For each of those groups, labeled by the pair (SID, M-date), a race season was defined as the fastest runs of all activities over the four race distances 5km, 10km, half-marathon (21,097.5m) and marathon (42,195 m), if distances were available. A tolerance of ± 3% was allowed in the distance selection to account for GPS inaccuracy, and average race velocities were determined by assuming the actual race distances (which are more reliable than GPS recordings). We applied conditions that race velocities must increase with decreasing race distance and must be slower than current world record velocities. Inconsistent race seasons were identified by violation of these conditions and excluded from further analysis. Race seasons were defined both with and without the marathon race included. A valid race season must contain at least two different race distances. For each race season with a successful performance model fit with mean race time error below 5% (see section below) a corresponding training season was defined as all running activities with a total distance ≥ 1000 m in the 180 days before the marathon. Runs with apparent velocities ≥ 7.8 m·s⁻¹ (world record for 1000 m) were excluded. Only training seasons with 30 or more runs were considered so that runner had trained at least once per week and training seasons with longer interruptions were excluded.

### Stable representation of a naturalistic movie emerges from episodic activity with gain variability [^256baa35]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The neural variability we measured here consisted of two portions: week-to-week fluctuations and trial-to-trial variability within each week. Are they both restricted to the non-coding direction? To answer this question, we quantified week-to-week variability and trial-to-trial variability within each week separately. For week-to-week fluctuations, first, we calculated the trial-averaged projected population activity in the two-dimensional space for each week (Fig. 6e). Second, we calculated the variance of those trial-averaged instantaneous population activity across weeks along the direction parallel or perpendicular to the spline. Finally, we summarized the variance for all the time points in the movie (Fig. 6f, left panel). The significantly larger week-to-week variance along the direction perpendicular to the spline compared with that of parallel direction suggested that the week-to-week fluctuation was also constrained to the non-coding direction. For trial-to-trial variability within each week, first, we calculated the variance of single-trial population activity for each week separately. Second, we summarized the variance for all the weeks and all the time points in the movie (Fig. 6f, right panel). The trial-to-trial variability within each week was larger along the direction perpendicular to the spline compared with that of parallel direction. Furthermore, the same observation held for most imaging fields (Fig. 6g). In conclusion, both week-to-week fluctuations and trial-to-trial variability within each week were restricted to the non-coding direction.

### Time trend of smoking scenes in Iranian movies during the past three decades (1982–2011): a historical analysis [^74b4c551]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence from the USA and elsewhere has linked smoking depictions in movies with youth smoking initiation. Prior research has not focused on depictions in films produced in the Middle East, however.

Objective

We reviewed the 10 most commercially successful Iranian films released each year over three decades (1982–2011) to determine trends in depictions of tobacco use over time.

Methods

Each movie was reviewed in its entirety, and depictions of smoking were recorded and classified as direct (characters holding or using tobacco products) and indirect (tobacco products appearing in the frame, but not being used). Time trends in average duration of direct, indirect and total smoking depictions were analysed using linear regression and Cohen's κ coefficient.

Results

The mean duration of tobacco depictions in the most commercially successful Iranian films fluctuated yearly over the 3 decades, but with an overall significant upward trend (p < 0.005). The proportion of movies depicting tobacco consumption during the three decades was 36% (1982–1991), 60% (1992–2001) and 74% (2002–2011), respectively. The average proportion of total movie time for these depictions (0.75%, 1.41%, 2.08%) increased significantly (p < 0.005) over the 3 decades as did the average duration of smoking depictions,(39.1, 67 and 99.3s, respectively, p < 0.005).

Conclusions

The significant increase in the proportion of movies depicting tobacco consumption and in the duration of smoking depictions over the past 30years underscores the need for increased regulation of the Iranian film industry to minimise this important source of influence on tobacco initiation in young people.

### Stimulus selection influences prediction of individual phenotypes in naturalistic conditions [^ee5d2115]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

4.8 Effect of Data Length on Phenotype Prediction

We conducted two analyses to evaluate the effect of data length on phenotype prediction. First, for each movie clip, we gradually increased data length (N_tr) by steps of 30 TRs (i.e. 30 s) starting from N_tr = 30 until N_tr exceeded the total length of the given movie clip, yielding a maximum of eight different data lengths. We then reapplied the TOPF approach to extract features and perform phenotype prediction for each N_tr and each movie clip separately using the same procedure as described before. Second, we conducted a similar analysis but used a longer time scale by concatenating data across movie clips within each run. We started from N_tr = 120 and increased data length by steps of 120 TRs (i.e. 2 min) until N_tr = 600, resulting in five different data lengths. fMRI data were concatenated in the order of the movie clips as they were presented within each run.

4.9 Significance of Prediction Performance and Model Comparison

We applied a permutation test to evaluate whether prediction performance achieved significantly above the chance level for each movie clip. We randomly shuffled the labels (i.e. the phenotypic scores) across subjects 1000 times and for each permutation we rerun the classification/prediction pipeline as was described above and computed a performance score (average over all CV folds). A p ‐value was then calculated based on a null distribution constructed by these performance scores obtained on permuted data. The p ‐value was defined as the proportion of permutations where the performance score was higher or equal to the original performance score that was derived from the non‐permuted data. To test whether the difference in prediction performance between two movie clips was significant, we employed corrected resampled paired t tests to the accuracies across all 100 CV folds for each pair of movie clips (Nadeau and Bengio). This approach accounted for the fact that CV folds were not independent.

### Inter-and intra-subject similarity in network functional connectivity across a full narrative movie [^9009cc80]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the unusual length of data acquisition, effects of the MRI measurement might have influenced the participants' focus on and perception of the movie stimulus. For example, participants might have needed some time to familiarize themselves with the MRI scanner. However, as all participants had already participated in previous MRI measurements of the studyforrest project (Hanke et al; Sengupta et al.), high familiarity to MRI scanning and all related procedures was present in this sample. The length of acquisition might also have affected the participants' attention. Previous studies indicate that movie watching is very engaging and might decrease drowsiness and sleep in the scanner (Eickhoff et al.), but attention might still have been impacted over such a long duration. NV paradigms are designed to include minimal participant instructions so as not to influence participants' perception of the stimuli or add task demands not directly related to movie watching. In future studies, post hoc questionnaires might be useful to estimate attention fluctuations, distractions, drowsiness and other potential confounds that might have occurred during data acquisition.

### Mortality among marathon runners in the United States, 2000–2009 [^10e9d160]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

As participation in marathon running has increased, there has also been concern regarding its safety.

Purpose

To determine if the increase in marathon participation from 2000 to 2009 has affected mortality and overall performance.

Study Design

Descriptive epidemiology study.

Methods

We used publicly available racing and news databases to analyze the number of marathon races, finishing race times, and deaths from 2000 to 2009 in marathons in the United States.

Results

The total number of marathon finishers has increased over this decade from 299,018 in 2000 to 473,354 in 2009. The average overall marathon finishing time has remained unchanged from 2000 to 2009 (4:34:47 vs 4:35:28; P = 0.85). Of 3,718,336 total marathon participants over the 10-year study period, we identified 28 people (6 women and 22 men) who died during the marathon race and up to 24 hours after finishing. The overall, male, and female death rates for the 10-year period were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38–1.13), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.48–1.36), and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.21–0.79) deaths per 100,000 finishers, respectively. There was no change in the death rate during this time period for overall, male, or female groups (P = 0.860, .533, and .238, respectively). The median age among deaths was 41.5 years (interquartile range, 25.5 years). Fifty percent (14/28) of deaths occurred in participants less than 45 years old. Myocardial infarction/atherosclerotic heart disease caused 93% (13/14) of deaths in those 45 years and older. A variety of conditions caused death in younger racers, the most common being cardiac arrest not otherwise specified (21%, n = 3).

Conclusion

Participation in marathons has increased without any change in mortality or average overall performance from 2000 to 2009.

### Consensus recommendations on training and competing in the heat [^d915ddbd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In competition settings, hydration is dependent on several factors, including fluid availability and the specificities of the events. For example, while tennis players have regular access to fluids due to the frequency of breaks in a match, other athletes such as marathon runners have less opportunity to rehydrate. There are also differences among competitors. Whereas the fastest marathon runners do not consume large volume of fluids and become dehydrated during the race, some slower runners may conversely overhydrate, with an associated risk of 'water intoxication' (ie, hyponatraemia). The predisposing factors related to developing hyponatraemia during a marathon include substantial weight gain, a racing time above 4 h, female sex and low body-mass index. Consequently, although the recommendations below for competitive athletes explain how to minimise the impairment in performance associated with significant dehydration and body mass loss (ie, ≥ 2%), recreational athletes involved in prolonged exercise should be cautious not to overhydrate during the exercise.

Section 3: medical service and management considerations

The reader is referred to the recently published evidence-based guidelines on EHS management developed for the Olympicand ParalympicGames. This section complements those guidelines by presenting some applied perspectives for their implementation.

FoP supervision

Time to reduce the internal body temperature is the key factor for the success of EHS treatment. Therefore, the FoP medical plan should facilitate the identification of the athletes suffering from heat-related illness and their rapid transfer to a medical station. In the case of endurance sports like race walking, long-distance running, or triathlon, a course that has been planned in laps, may reduce the transfer time to the finish line and/or a medical station. Organisers should however keep in mind that the length of the lap may be influenced by the number of competitors (mass vs elite competitions). For road events spread along a long distance (ie, without lap), positioning medical stations along the route may minimise the transfer time and allow the EHS to be treated immediately (on-site) by trained practitioners as opposed to transferring the patient to the nearest hospital. Thus, the race protocol should supersede the local emergency medical system in case of EHS and should be implemented as a common understanding between the FoP medical and local emergency medical services. Assigning spotters at regular intervals on the competition course to inform the triage medical manager of any athlete in distress (as in the 2019 World Athletics Championships) is helpful. For competitions with many participants or competitions where the visibility is not optimal (eg, buildings, tents, turns, etc) spotter towers may be installed to provide a better view of the finishing area. The spotters should be in radio contact with the triage manager and the sweep team, and there should be a well-practised rescue procedure in place for rapid retrieval of collapsed athletes.

Recommendations

If allowed by the sporting requirements and the number of competitors, organising committees should consider a lap course design to simplify supervision and retrieval of EHS athletes (eg, such as during the marathons of the recent 2019 World Athletics Championships and the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games).
Spotters (or video surveillance) should be positioned along the course to identify and report any heat-related event without delay.

### Movie viewing elicits rich and reliable brain state dynamics [^1b7557f5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Adaptive brain function requires that sensory impressions of the social and natural milieu are dynamically incorporated into intrinsic brain activity. While dynamic switches between brain states have been well characterised in resting state acquisitions, the remodelling of these state transitions by engagement in naturalistic stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the temporal dynamics of brain states, as measured in fMRI, are reshaped from predominantly bistable transitions between two relatively indistinct states at rest, toward a sequence of well-defined functional states during movie viewing whose transitions are temporally aligned to specific features of the movie. The expression of these brain states covaries with different physiological states and reflects subjectively rated engagement in the movie. In sum, a data-driven decoding of brain states reveals the distinct reshaping of functional network expression and reliable state transitions that accompany the switch from resting state to perceptual immersion in an ecologically valid sensory experience.

### Movie viewing elicits rich and reliable brain state dynamics [^bf49a005]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

The basic premise of the HMM is that dynamic fluctuations in BOLD-inferred neural activity within brain regions comprising the 14 canonical BNs can be decomposed into a sequence of discrete hidden brain states that switch and recur over time according to a time-invariant transition probability. Therefore, each time point can be classified as belonging to a single brain state, which represents a whole-brain configuration of average fMRI signal across the 14 BNs.

For each of the 14 BNs, time series were obtained by: (i) calculating the mean signal within the ROIs comprising the network; (ii) removing time series associated to the first five volumes; (iii) demeaning the signal; and (iv) scaling the resulting time series by its standard deviation. Thus, network-averaged fMRI time series of zero mean and unit standard deviation were calculated for each participant and session (two movies and two resting-state conditions). Next, each participant's time series were temporally concatenated to a time × BNs matrix (14 participants, each with 215 volumes (8 min) of rest A, 530 volumes (20 min) of first movie viewing, 215 volumes (8 min) of rest B, and 530 volumes (20 min) of second movie viewing: 20,860 × 14 matrix). The HMM was then fitted to the temporally concatenated time courses (allowing for covariance between the time series) to yield a single set of 10 model parameters (brain states). This concatenation strategy allows participants to have the same set of brain states across movies and rest periods, maintaining the ability to assess brain state dynamics across conditions. These are assessed in terms of the: (i) total time spent in a state over a longer time period (FO); (ii) time spent by each participant in a given state before switching (dwell time); and (iii) likelihood of switching between specific states (transition probability).

2.8 ISC analyses

In inter‐region correlation analysis, the following procedure was used to define ROIs and independently extract timecourses with only a single run of movie data. First, separate movie ssROIs were defined using just the first half (TRs 1–82) or second half of the run (TRs 86–168; the middle three time points were not analyzed in order to prevent temporal autocorrelation). Second, the timecourse from the first half of the movie was extracted from the second‐half movie ssROIs, and the timecourse from the second half of the movie was extracted from the first‐half movie ssROIs (again excluding the middle three time points). Third, the resultant first‐ and second‐half timecourses were concatenated, yielding an estimate of the full movie timecourse. Fourth, timecourses were averaged across hemispheres (e.g. rFFA and lFFA). Fifth, Pearson correlations were calculated between each subject's movie ssROI timecourse and each mean timecourse from traditional ROIs in adults. Sixth, and finally, the resultant correlations were Fisher z transformed to improve normality for further statistical analysis.

All of the analyses reported in this manuscript should be considered exploratory, not confirmatory, since analyses described here were not chosen prior to data collection, and data collection was not completed with this specific set of analyses in mind. The movie stimulus tested in adults was chosen in order to compare to an existing dataset from children who watched the same movie (rather than based on any particular face, scene, or object content it includes), and we chose analyses based on the stimulus (time series analyses seemed to utilize more data and be more sensitive than previous analysis methods [Jacoby et al.]), and on recent, relevant progress in the field (Richardson et al; Yates et al.).

Relative to rest, movie viewing was characterised by significantly higher FO in brain states 1–4 and 6–8 (Fig. 4b). These states were characterised by high weightings in visual, auditory, and language networks (Figs. 1 and 3). The duration of the brain states was in between the annotations with relatively shorter duration (positive/negative faces: 7.4 +/− 5.6 s; positive/negative valence scenes: 8.2 +/− 7.4 s; language: 14.6 +/− 13.2 s; and changepoints: 4.0 +/− 1.9 s), and scene descriptions with relatively longer duration (Table 1). As noted above, the situation was the opposite in the resting state, with higher occupancy of brain states 5 and 9 and lesser occupancy of brain states 1–4 and 6–8. The inter-subject consistency of the brain state expression was also lower (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6), with each participant displaying a unique brain state progression through time during the rest condition. In addition, qualitatively, brain states 5 and 9 were visited for a longer time (Fig. 4b). Contrary to resting state, movie-induced brain state dynamics showed an overall reduction in time spent visiting each specific brain state. Also, the visited brain states were characterised by strong and specific patterns of fMRI signal in canonical functional networks. In other words, movie viewing induced a higher number of briefer brain state visits compared to rest. These results were replicated in the second Movie viewing and rest sessions (Supplementary Fig. 9; confirmatory analyses are presented in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 5).

### Stable representation of a naturalistic movie emerges from episodic activity with gain variability [^d08b85de]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Visual cortical responses are known to be highly variable across trials within an experimental session. However, the long-term stability of visual cortical responses is poorly understood. Here using chronic imaging of V1 in mice we show that neural responses to repeated natural movie clips are unstable across weeks. Individual neuronal responses consist of sparse episodic activity which are stable in time but unstable in gain across weeks. Further, we find that the individual episode, instead of neuron, serves as the basic unit of the week-to-week fluctuation. To investigate how population activity encodes the stimulus, we extract a stable one-dimensional representation of the time in the natural movie, using an unsupervised method. Most week-to-week fluctuation is perpendicular to the stimulus encoding direction, thus leaving the stimulus representation largely unaffected. We propose that precise episodic activity with coordinated gain changes are keys to maintain a stable stimulus representation in V1.

### Early exposure to movie smoking predicts established smoking by older teens and young adults [^7af38ce3]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Movie smoking exposure is a strong predictor of smoking initiation by adolescents; however, we do not know whether it is a long-term predictor of established smoking. We conducted a prospective study to determine whether movie smoking exposure during early adolescence predicts established smoking in older teens and young adults.

Design

We assessed movie smoking exposure and smoking status through a written school-based survey in 1999, when participants were 10 to 14 years of age. We enrolled 73% (n = 2603) of those who had never tried smoking in a follow-up study. In 2006–2007, we conducted telephone interviews with 69% (n = 1791) of the cohort to ascertain current smoking status. The primary outcome was established smoking, defined as having smoked > 100 cigarettes. Mean age at follow-up was 18.7 years.

Results

Thirteen percent (n = 235) progressed from never smoking to established smoking during the follow-up period. Eighty-nine percent (n = 209) of established smokers smoked during the 30 days before the survey. Even after controlling for a wide range of baseline characteristics, the relative risk for established smoking increased by one third with each successive quartile of movie smoking exposure. Those in the highest quartile for baseline movie smoking exposure were twice as likely to be established smokers at follow-up compared with those in the lowest quartile.

Conclusions

Movie smoking exposure significantly predicted progression to established smoking in long-term follow-up. We estimate that 34.9% of established smoking in this cohort can be attributed to movie smoking exposure.

### Anticipatory eye gaze as a marker of memory [^4b6c3e84]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

We constructed the Memory Episode Gaze Anticipation (MEGA) paradigm with the aim of capturing memory retrieval in its raw form without the additional layer of verbal reports. Participants viewed short (8–23 s) movie clips in two sessions conducted a few hours apart while gaze was monitored using an infrared video-based eye tracking system (see Methods). Each movie contained a surprising event that saliently occurred in an unexpected location and time (e.g. an animal suddenly appearing behind a rock, Fig. 1a; Supplementary Movie 1, 2). We hypothesized that in the first viewing, gaze patterns before the event occurs ('pre-event) would be exploratory, whereas, in the second viewing, after the formation of memory, gaze patterns would anticipate the event and preferentially occur around the event location (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the memory for the surprising event may manifest as a difference between the 1 st and 2 nd viewings at pre-event intervals around the anticipated location of the event (red rectangle and heat maps in Fig. 1b). To test this, the first experiment included 34 participants who viewed 65 movie clips in two viewing sessions separated by a 2-h break (Fig. 1c and see detailed methods). In the 2 nd viewing session, verbal reports and confidence measures were collected after each movie, to allow comparison with standard explicit reports.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^dfe6446a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

The results from this study suggest runners who completed the initial part of the marathon closer to their CS were more likely to experience difficulties later in the race, quantified as a positive relative split (i.e. slowing down in the second half of the race) and also as the percentage of athletes who experienced a significant slowdown in the final stages of the race. The results reported in the current study showed a positive correlation between BS relative to CS and subsequent impairment in performance, irrespective of gender and age category. Adopting an even split has been suggested as the best approach for endurance events, and large-scale studies have already suggested that an even split is optimal for endurance performance. The data presented in the current study suggest that such even pace should be close to, but below, the CS. For example, runners who complete an evenly paced race (defined as a race in which the first-half time is within 2%, faster or slower, than the second-half time) do so by running at a speed that is ~88% of their CS, whereas runners whose pacing falls outside of this range completed their race at ~84% of their CS. The results of the present study suggest that speed in the first half of the marathon should stay within ~94% of CS, or athletes risk having to disproportionately slowdown in the second half of the marathon.

The results also showed that although no differences were observed between younger and older athletes, males experienced a greater slowdown in the second half of the marathon, and severe slowdowns > 25% occurred more frequently compared with females. This is consistent with research showing that female runners tend to pace their marathons more evenly than male runners and that they are less susceptible to severe slowdowns and hitting the wall when compared with male marathoners.

### The default network dominates neural responses to evolving movie stories [^0aa1dfed]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The studyforrest dataset also provides annotation of the physical location in which each scene takes place, its type (interior or exterior), as well as the time of day (day or night). The movie scenes were annotated by two individuals, including a rather with an academic background in filmmaking. For the time of day annotation, a scene was labeled as "day" whenever it was illuminated by sunlight, including twilight, and labeled as "night" when there was no sunlight.

Inter-observer agreement (IOA) time series were then computed for each character and each emotional attribute. To this end, we indicated the proportion of total observers who identified the presence of a given attribute at each point in time. Therefore, IOA time series generally range from 0 to 1. However, IOA time series for the arousal, valence and direction indicators were obtained by subtracting from each other the IOA time series corresponding to the presence of both extremes, for example, IOA for low-arousal was subtracted from the IOA for high-arousal, resulting in an interval of −1 to +1, with two extremes indicating perfect agreement for low and high arousal, respectively. All IOA time series were then binarized using an absolute threshold of 0.5 to segment the movie into emotional episodes for each character. An emotional episode was defined as a period during which at least one emotional attribute exceeded the IOA threshold. Arousal and positive and negative valence values were attributed to each episode by computing their median IOA values across the length of the emotional episode. Here, to ensure a high level of consistency across observers in the annotations under consideration, we used these emotional episodes detected by the majority of observers to generate time series reflecting the presence of specific emotional expression features. For arousal and positive and negative valence, aggregate IOA time series were generated by assigning the maximal IOA value to each timepoint (2-s windows between the fMRI acquisitions) across all emotional episodes and characters. For all other emotional attributes, binary time series were produced to reflect their presence (0: absent, 1: present) at a given time step across all emotional episodes and characters. Analogously, binary time series were produced to reflect the presence (0: absent, 1: present) of each of the four location annotations (interior, exterior, day, and night) at a given time step in the movie.

### Fragmentation and multithreading of experience in the default-mode network [^1d4b97ce]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Measuring belief updates in state, agent and action models

Our analysis approach is to identify changes in neural activity, patterns and connectivity and assess whether these coincide with subjective markers of internal model updates of movie content in each domain. We first probed when belief updates typically occurred in each domain, during the movie. Participants from three independent groups watched the movie and pressed a button whenever they felt their beliefs changed in one of the three domains (Fig. 1b). Briefly, these were contextual updates(for States; n = 18), belief updates about people (for Agents; n = 21) and belief change due to an action taken, that could affect the trajectory of the movie (for Actions; n = 19) (see Supplementary Table 1 for complete instructions). We assume that people signal a belief update whenever their existing model of the movie mismatches incoming information (i.e. after prediction errors occur). Update time-courses from individual participants were combined and smoothed to give a continuous time-course (Fig. 1c). Higher values indicate a greater proportion of individuals watching the movie marked a belief update at that point. These time courses indicate that the predictions (and the experience) of each domain fluctuate considerably throughout this movie. By collecting these ratings in separate groups of participants to those who provided the fMRI data, we ensured that the fMRI data reflected processing of a fully naturalistic experience, free from instructional, meta-monitoring and responding effects. Group-level ratings were only weakly correlated with one another (States vs Agents, r = 0.31, Agents vs Actions, r = 0.29, Actions vs States, r = 0.28). This indicates that models in different domains were being updated at different times during movie-watching. In addition, we performed mutual information and cross-correlation analysis on the ratings, which indicate only weak associations between different domains (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3). We also conducted a split-half correlation analysis for each rating with the Spearman-Brown correction applied, which indicated generally good levels of agreement between participants in the timing of updates (Fig. 1d) (States r = 0.88, Agents r = 0.65, Actions r = 0.72, see "Methods").

### Prospective monitoring of health problems among recreational runners preparing for a half marathon [^644bd9f0]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Response rate and participants

A total of 327 participants agreed to take part in the study, of whom 287 (87.8%) gave information about age, sex, height, weight, personal bests, weekly mileage and running experience (table 1). Over the course of 13 weeks, 4240 requests to complete the questionnaire were sent to all included participants (n = 327) and 3213 were fully answered. One person withdrew after the second week because participation in the half marathon was cancelled, so that the average weekly number of questionnaires sent out was 326. The average weekly response rate to the OSTRC questionnaire over 13 weeks was 75.8% (95% CI 71.5% to 80.0%), which equals an average number of 247 respondents. The flow of participants and weekly response rates can be found in figure 1.

### Freeware program for converting image sequences to flash movie loops [^3dd6c302]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This article provides a freeware program created for converting image sequences to Flash movie loops.

Conclusion

Although Flash is a useful format for presenting dynamic data sets in PowerPoint compared with other movie clip formats (e.g. AVI), the associated cost of the required Flash application ($699) is a common concern for many academic radiologists. To address this issue, a freeware program for creating simple Flash movie loops from image sequences has been developed for this article.

### The association between changes in weekly running distance and running-related injury: preparing for a half marathon [^a54da258]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudden changes in training load may play a key role in the development of running-related injury (RRI). Because the injury mechanism depends on the runner's musculoskeletal load capacity, the running schedule followed prior to sudden change in training load may influence the amount of change that a runner can tolerate before the runner is at a higher risk of RRI.

Objectives

To investigate the association between change in weekly running distance and RRI, and to examine whether the association may be modified by the running schedule the runner follows.

Methods

Two hundred sixty-one healthy (noninjured) runners were included in this prospective cohort study over a period of 14 weeks. Data on running activity were collected daily and objectively, using a global positioning system watch or smartphone. Instances of RRIs were collected using weekly e-mailed questionnaires. Primary exposure was defined as changes in weekly running distance. Data were analyzed with time-to-event models that produced cumulative risk difference as the measure of association.

Results

A total of 56 participants (21.5%) sustained an RRI during the 14-week study period. Twenty-one days into the study period, significantly more runners were injured when they increased their weekly running distance by 20% to 60% compared with those who increased their distance by less than 20% (risk difference, 22.6%; 95% confidence interval: 0.9%, 44.3%; P = 0.041). No significant difference was found after 56 and 98 days. No significant effect-measure modification by running schedule was found.

Conclusion

Significantly more runners were injured 21 days into the study period when they increased their weekly running distances by 20% to 60% compared with those who increased their distances by less than 20%.

### Boston marathon athlete performance outcomes and intra-event medical encounter risk associated with low energy availability indicators [^1b93346d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-race injury and illness prevalence

For both female and male participants, LEA-I athletes had higher odds of pre-race overload injury involving bone or soft tissue (female: OR: 14.22, 95% CI: 8.59 to 23.54, p < 0.001; male: OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.24 to 3.19, p = 0.004) and illness (female: OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.85, p < 0.001; male: OR: 8.57, 95% CI: 5.12 to 14.30, p < 0.001) causing lost/modified training days within the past 6 months, and specifically BSI within the past 12 months (female: OR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.33 to 5.37, p = 0.006; male: OR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.76 to 6.83, p < 0.001) compared with non-LEA-I athletes (table 2).

Marathon performance

Overall MANCOVA models were significant for both females and males (p < 0.001); LEA-I was a significant predictor for race performance such that study participants with LEA-I demonstrated worse finish times compared with their non-LEA-I counterparts with moderate-to-large effect (females: d = 0.33, males: d = 0.53) when covarying for demographic/anthropomorphic data, training history and marathon experience (table 3). For both females and males, age, number of previous marathons, weekly running distance and illnesses causing time away from training within the last 6 months were significant covariates. Training and performance tierwas a significant covariate for males, but not female participants. Sudden onset traumatic injuries with time away from training during the last 6 months was a significant covariate for female participants, but not for males. No other covariates were significantly associated with performance. Of the 1030 starters in the cohort, 9 (0.9%) did not finish, all due to medical reasons (table 4).

### Can marathon running improve knee damage of middle-aged adults? A prospective cohort study [^8771cad9]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Participant self-assessment questionnaire

The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used as a self-reported questionnaire of the knee condition and associated injuries that can result in osteoarthritis. The assessment is divided into five categories: pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, knee-related quality of life and function in sport and recreation. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire both before and after the marathon to assess their perceived knee joint health. Each question was provided with five potential answers and marked from zero to four. The sum of the scores from each category was converted into a 0–100 scale, with zero indicating extreme knee problems and 100 indicating no knee problems.

Magnetic resonance imaging

An MRI was performed on each participant 6 months before the marathon (and therefore before the standardised training programme), and then half a month after the marathon. Both knees of marathon runners were analysed using a 3.0 T MR scanner (Prisma, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and dedicated knee coil. The imaging protocol included proton density-weighted fat suppressed (PD FS) sequences in axial [repetition time (TR) msec/echo time (TE) msec; 4630/37], sagittal (4200/41 ms) and coronal planes (5240/41 ms). All slices were 3 mm thick, with an image size/acquisition matrix of 320×320 pixels. The total acquisition time per bilateral scans was 25 min.

Radiological reporting/image analysis

All MR images were reviewed using a picture archiving and communications system workstation by a musculoskeletal radiologist (AF) with 10 years experience at consultant level. 30% of the cohort (92 MRI scans from two time points of 46 knees from 23 volunteers; randomly-selected) were additionally and independently evaluated, by a second fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologist with 9 years experience at consultant level (AHir). The two examiners were blinded to the baseline characteristics of the volunteers. Images of both time points were separately analysed.

In case of discrepancies between the radiologists' evaluation, consensus scores were achieved after consultation.

Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.
2. 3 Induction Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence, the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence. It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. The dosing on the initial day of treatment may be given in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period. In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 2.

From Day 3 onward, patients received either Buprenorphine Sublingual Film or Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3–4 days, depending on the target dose. Ideally, patients should be seen at reasonable intervals based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress. If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.

### Effect of viewing smoking in movies on adolescent smoking initiation: a cohort study [^9a9d9a6f]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Exposure to smoking in movies has been linked with adolescent smoking initiation in cross-sectional studies. We undertook a prospective study to ascertain whether exposure to smoking in movies predicts smoking initiation.

Method

We assessed exposure to smoking shown in movies in 3547 adolescents, aged 10–14 years, who reported in a baseline survey that they had never tried smoking. Exposure to smoking in movies was estimated for individual respondents on the basis of the number of smoking occurrences viewed in unique samples of 50 movies, which were randomly selected from a larger sample pool of popular contemporary movies. We successfully re-contacted 2603 (73%) students 13–26 months later for a follow-up interview to determine whether they had initiated smoking.

Findings

Overall, 10% (n = 259) of students initiated smoking during the follow-up period. In the highest quartile of exposure to movie smoking, 17% (107) of students had initiated smoking, compared with only 3% (22) in the lowest quartile. After controlling for baseline characteristics, adolescents in the highest quartile of exposure to movie smoking were 2.71 (95% CI 1.73–4.25) times more likely to initiate smoking compared with those in the lowest quartile. The effect of exposure to movie smoking was stronger in adolescents with non-smoking parents than in those whose parent smoked. In this cohort, 52.2% (30.0–67.3) of smoking initiation can be attributed to exposure to smoking in movies.

Interpretation

Our results provide strong evidence that viewing smoking in movies promotes smoking initiation among adolescents.

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^0d0b15d3]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Marathon pacing relative to CS

Runners completed their marathon at an average speed that corresponded to 84.8% ± 13.6% of their CS (Fig. 2). Relative to CS, females completed the marathon slightly (~1%), but significantly, faster than males (85.5% ± 23.2% CS vs 84.6% ± 7.8%; t = −2.94, P = 0.003). Specifically, females run relatively faster (i.e. closer to CS) than males for MT from 170 to 360 min, inclusive (Fig. 3; P < 0.01). There were no differences in relative MS in both age categories (Fig. 2), with younger runners competing at 84.8% ± 17.4% of their CS and older runners at 84.9% ± 7.7% of their CS (t = −0.79, P = 0.42).

FIGURE 2
Distributions of relative MS (Rel MS), defined as CS relative to MS, for male and female (A) and younger and older (B) runners.

FIGURE 3
Relative MS (Rel MS), defined as CS relative to MS, of runners versus finish time. Results are presented based on gender (A) and age category (B). The shaded regions in panel A indicates finish times associated with relative MS differences between male and female runners that were found to be significant (P < 0.01) based on a one-tailed Welch's t -test.

Faster runners completed the marathon at speeds closer to CS compared with slower runners, as denoted by the negative relationship between MS relative to CS (relative MS), and overall marathon performance (Fig. 3, all P < 0.01). This held true irrespective of gender (R² of 0.99 and 0.98 for males and females, respectively) and age (R² = 0.98 for both age-groups). Irrespective of gender or age, runners with finishing times of ~150 min completed the marathon at 93.0% of their CS, whereas runners with finishing times > 300 min completed the marathon at 78.9% of their CS (Fig. 3).

### Effect of marathon running on total and free serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations [^005063e6]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Context

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an important tumor marker for the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States. A major limitation of this marker is falsely elevated results in patients who are found not to have prostate cancer. The effects of vigorous physical exertion on PSA concentrations are controversial.

Objective

To determine the effects of marathon running on PSA levels.

Design

Measurement of total and free PSA levels in the sera of participants in a marathon before and within 4 and 24 hours after the race.

Results

None of the participants had elevated total PSA levels before the race. Although we found no statistically significant changes in average total or free PSA concentrations at either time point, after the marathon, 2 (11%) of 18 runners had total PSA concentrations outside the standard reference range. Changes in total PSA levels did not correlate with age or prerace PSA concentrations. Free PSA levels were not statistically significantly changed after the race and did not allow a reliable determination of exercise-induced PSA elevations.

Conclusions

Although it may not be necessary for men to abstain from exercise involving running before blood draws for PSA analysis, elevated PSA concentrations may be observed in some individuals after participation in a major sporting event. In these cases, repeat measurements should be considered at a time significantly removed from such exercise.

### Movie viewing elicits rich and reliable brain state dynamics [^d38e4834]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Movie viewing hence imposes a faster overall turnaround of brain states, primarily due to less occupancy of brain states 5 and 9 that have longer dwell times in the resting state data. To further understand this observation, we calculated state transition probabilities (Fig. 5). Significant differences between brain state transitions at rest and during movie viewing were identified using Network-Based Statistics (p FWE < 0.05, Methods). These analyses revealed a significant increase in the likelihood of transitions from state 9 to state 5 in the resting state compared to movie viewing (Fig. 5e). The reverse contrast (movie > rest) revealed a higher number of transitions between a number of specific brain states associated with movie viewing, particularly among states 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 (Fig. 5f). These findings were also replicated across the two scanning sessions (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Fig. 5
Brain state transition probabilities during rest and movie viewing.

Left column: Group averaged transition probability matrices for rest (a) and movie viewing (b). Diagonal elements are omitted for clarity. Middle column: Top 20% state transitions during rest (c) and movie viewing (d). Arrow thickness corresponds to the group-averaged probability of that transition. Right column: State transitions with a significantly higher probability of occurring during rest than during movie viewing (e) and vice versa (f) as identified by the Network-Based Statistics (p FWE < 0.05). Each of the colour circles represents a state according to the colour scheme used in Fig. 1. The diameter is scaled according to that state's fractional occupancy (Fig. 4a). Each arrow represents a transition.

We also explored quantitative similarities between the time-locked individual state-paths across participants — that is, the detailed sequence of states and the precise timing of individual transitions. Although such a sequence is a relatively complex path unfolding on a high-dimensional manifold, the (Jaccard) dissimilarity index for all subject pairs ranged from 0.72 to 0.88, a moderate level of agreement. That is, despite the misalignment in the precise timing of the state transition times, there is still a meaningful commonality of state paths across participants.

### Using child-friendly movie stimuli to study the development of face, place, and object regions from age 3 to 12 years [^d3ea9849]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Scanning young children while they watch short, engaging, commercially-produced movies has emerged as a promising approach for increasing data retention and quality. Movie stimuli also evoke a richer variety of cognitive processes than traditional experiments, allowing the study of multiple aspects of brain development simultaneously. However, because these stimuli are uncontrolled, it is unclear how effectively distinct profiles of brain activity can be distinguished from the resulting data. Here we develop an approach for identifying multiple distinct subject-specific Regions of Interest (ssROIs) using fMRI data collected during movie-viewing. We focused on the test case of higher-level visual regions selective for faces, scenes, and objects. Adults (N = 13) were scanned while viewing a 5.6-min child-friendly movie, as well as a traditional localizer experiment with blocks of faces, scenes, and objects. We found that just 2.7min of movie data could identify subject-specific face, scene, and object regions. While successful, movie-defined ssROIS still showed weaker domain selectivity than traditional ssROIs. Having validated our approach in adults, we then used the same methods on movie data collected from 3 to 12-year-old children (N = 122). Movie response timecourses in 3-year-old children's face, scene, and object regions were already significantly and specifically predicted by timecourses from the corresponding regions in adults. We also found evidence of continued developmental change, particularly in the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus. Taken together, our results reveal both early maturity and functional change in face, scene, and object regions, and more broadly highlight the promise of short, child-friendly movies for developmental cognitive neuroscience.

### Effect of aging on the stride pattern of veteran marathon runners [^2960f152]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the stride pattern of different age groups of veteran runners in a marathon road race.

Methods

This kinematic study investigated the stride pattern (stride length, stride period, velocity, stance time, and non-stance time) for 151 runners (78 men aged up to 75–80, 73 women aged up to 60–64) at the 7 mile point.

Results

Significant declines for men with aging were found for mean stride length (from 2.4 m at age 40–49 to 2.0 m at age 60+), velocity, and non-stance time (p < 0.05), whereas stride period changed little. The findings indicate that the lower velocities of older runners are associated with shorter strides whereas cadence changes little. However, when a statistical adjustment was made for the variation in runners' velocity, it was found that older runners did not have a significantly shorter stride length at any given velocity.

Conclusion

Although a shorter stride is the mechanical route by which older runners lose velocity, the shorter stride may not be the fundamental cause of the velocity reduction with age. This has implications for researchers and coaches when investigating and training veteran distance runners.

### Slow cortical dynamics and the accumulation of information over long timescales [^a95b3b84]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Making sense of the world requires us to process information over multiple timescales. We sought to identify brain regions that accumulate information over short and long timescales and to characterize the distinguishing features of their dynamics. We recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from individuals watching intact and scrambled movies. Within sensory regions, fluctuations of high-frequency (64–200 Hz) power reliably tracked instantaneous low-level properties of the intact and scrambled movies. Within higher order regions, the power fluctuations were more reliable for the intact movie than the scrambled movie, indicating that these regions accumulate information over relatively long time periods (several seconds or longer). Slow (< 0.1 Hz) fluctuations of high-frequency power with time courses locked to the movies were observed throughout the cortex. Slow fluctuations were relatively larger in regions that accumulated information over longer time periods, suggesting a connection between slow neuronal population dynamics and temporally extended information processing.

### Visual timing-tuned responses in human association cortices and response dynamics in early visual cortex [^5914f681]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Each event timing was repeated in a 2100 ms time frame, such that an entire TR (= 2100 ms) contained the same event duration and period. The number of events presented within the 2100 ms between timing changes varied with event period and increments in event period sometimes fell slightly before or after 2100 ms. The maximum drift of event onset timing was only 300 ms, and the increments in event period were only 50 ms, so this deviation was not perceptible. The presented event timing was used for analysis.

To distinguish responses to specific event timings from responses to other stimulus parameters, we used four conditions where event duration and period were related in different ways (Supplementary Movie 1). First, the constant luminance condition, in which event duration and period were equal and both changed together (50–1000 ms, 50 ms steps) (Fig. 1b, d, black points). Second, the constant duration condition, in which event period changed (50–1000 ms, 50 ms steps), while event duration remained 50 ms (Fig. 1b, d, blue points). Third, the constant period condition, in which the event duration changed (50–1000 ms, 50 ms steps), while the period always remained 1000 ms (Fig. 1b, d, red points). In all the aforementioned conditions, increasing progressions of event duration and/or period were followed by a 16.8 s interval of events with a 2100 ms period. The event duration was 50 ms in the constant duration condition and 2000 ms in the other two conditions. These extreme timings help to distinguish very small response functions (which would respond briefly and with low amplitude in the 50–1000 ms range) and very large response functions (which respond continuously and with high amplitude) in fMRI responses. Furthermore, these long event durations and periods produce little response from neural populations preferring sub-second timing. Conversely, populations whose response monotonically increases with duration, period, or mean luminance should respond most strongly to these stimuli. After this, the same event timings were presented in a decreasing order, followed by another 16.8 s interval of events with a 50 or 2000 ms duration and a 2100 ms period. We used a single model to capture responses to both increasing and decreasing event duration and/or period progressions. Including responses to both increasing and decreasing timings in the same model counterbalanced adaptation effects with stimuli that give both higher and lower responses preceding presentation of any timing.

### Running technique is an important component of running economy and performance [^d7505eae]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Participants

Ninety-seven healthy endurance runners volunteered and provided written informed consent before their participation in this study, which was approved by the NHS National Research Ethics Service and the Loughborough University Ethics Committee. All participants were regular runners (two times or more per week) and considered running to be their primary sport or physical activity. Runners of a wide range of performance standards were recruited (Table 1) according to their best running performance in the previous 12 months (season's best [SB] time), specifically their highest International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) points score for distances between 1500 m and the marathon in UK Athletics–sanctioned track and road races. All SB times were converted to an equivalent 10 km time using IAAF points scores. The cohort included 29 elite runners (males, SB time < 31 min, n = 15; females < 35 min, n = 14) and 68 recreational runners (males ≤ 52 min, n = 35; females ≤ 57 min, n = 33). All participants were required to have a body mass index of < 24 kg·m −2 and be free from moderate (previous 3 months) and minor (previous 1 month) musculoskeletal injury. Individual training history (typical training volume as kilometers and sessions per week) and SB time were collected by questionnaire, with the latter verified via official event results.

### Delays in emergency care and mortality during major U.S. marathons [^a6bbbd63]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Large marathons frequently involve widespread road closures and infrastructure disruptions, which may create delays in emergency care for nonparticipants with acute medical conditions who live in proximity to marathon routes.

Methods

We analyzed Medicare data on hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest among Medicare beneficiaries (≥ 65 years of age) in 11 U.S. cities that were hosting major marathons during the period from 2002 through 2012 and compared 30-day mortality among the beneficiaries who were hospitalized on the date of a marathon, those who were hospitalized on the same day of the week as the day of the marathon in the 5 weeks before or the 5 weeks after the marathon, and those who were hospitalized on the same day as the marathon but in surrounding ZIP Code areas unaffected by the marathon. We also analyzed data from a national registry of ambulance transports and investigated whether ambulance transports occurring before noon in marathon-affected areas (when road closures are likely) had longer scene-to-hospital transport times than on nonmarathon dates. We also compared transport times on marathon dates with those on nonmarathon dates in these same areas during evenings (when roads were reopened) and in areas unaffected by the marathon.

Results

The daily frequency of hospitalizations was similar on marathon and nonmarathon dates (mean number of hospitalizations per city, 10.6 and 10.5, respectively; P = 0.71); the characteristics of the beneficiaries hospitalized on marathon and nonmarathon dates were also similar. Unadjusted 30-day mortality in marathon-affected areas on marathon dates was 28.2% (323 deaths in 1145 hospitalizations) as compared with 24.9% (2757 deaths in 11,074 hospitalizations) on nonmarathon dates (absolute risk difference, 3.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 6.0; P = 0.01; relative risk difference, 13.3%). This pattern persisted after adjustment for covariates and in an analysis that included beneficiaries who had five or more chronic medical conditions (a group that is unlikely to be hospitalized because of marathon participation). No significant differences were found with respect to where patients were hospitalized or the treatments they received in the hospital. Ambulance scene-to-hospital transport times for pickups before noon were 4.4 minutes longer on marathon dates than on nonmarathon dates (relative difference, 32.1%; P = 0.005). No delays were found in evenings or in marathon-unaffected areas.

Conclusions

Medicare beneficiaries who were admitted to marathon-affected hospitals with acute myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest on marathon dates had longer ambulance transport times before noon (4.4 minutes longer) and higher 30-day mortality than beneficiaries who were hospitalized on nonmarathon dates.

### Movie viewing elicits rich and reliable brain state dynamics [^0475bf76]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Consistency of state paths over participants and sessions

In order to calculate the consistency between participants of each brain state's path over time (Fig. 2), we used a sliding window of nine consecutive BOLD volumes (19.8 s). Within this window, for each of the 10 brain states, we counted the number of participants that had this state expressed at least once and identified the most frequently expressed state. This information is displayed in the bottom trace of Fig. 2. We then contrasted the states expressed during movie watching with those of the resting-state scans. Even though there were fewer states expressed during resting state, the consistency count was markedly lower (only reaching 50–65%, i.e. 7–9 out of 14 participants, at certain times). However, during movie viewing, the count reached 100% multiple times (Table 1).

In order to calculate the consistency of brain states over sessions, for each state and each participant, we constructed a binary vector of 0 (brain state not expressed) and 1 (brain state is expressed) for each time-point during movie viewing (530 scans) and rest (215 scans) for both session A and session B. To assess the consistency over sessions (A and B), we calculated the Jaccard Overlap index between the binary vectors for each brain state and averaged them. A paired t -test was performed on these values to test whether Movie viewing has more consistent brain-state overlaps than resting state.

Comparison of state dynamics between rest and movie viewing

In order to assess brain state dynamics between rest and movie viewing, we compared the dynamic metrics (FO and state dwell time) for each brain state. Significant differences between these conditions were assessed with paired t -tests and marked in the figures with an asterisk. We also compared the state transition probabilities (averaged over participants) between the conditions in Fig. 5. A threshold of 20% was applied to identify the most frequent transitions (middle column, Fig. 5c, d). Finally, the Network-Based Statistics toolbox (version 1.2) was used to reveal the network of state transitions that are significantly more expressed during movie watching compared to rest, and conversely during resting state compared to movie viewing (right column).

### Calculation of critical speed from raw training data in recreational marathon runners [^92a47122]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Critical speed (CS) represents the highest intensity at which a physiological steady state may be reached. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether estimations of CS obtained from raw training data can predict performance and pacing in marathons.

Methods

We investigated running activities logged into an online fitness platform by > 25,000 recreational athletes before big-city marathons. Each activity contained time, distance, and elevation every 100 m. We computed grade-adjusted pacing and the fastest pace recorded for a set of target distances (400, 800, 1000, 1500, 3000, and 5000 m). CS was determined as the slope of the distance-time relationship using all combinations of, at least, three target distances.

Results

The relationship between distance and time was linear, irrespective of the target distances used (pooled mean ± SD: R = 0.9999 ± 0.0001). The estimated values of CS from all models were not different (3.74 ± 0.08 m·s), and all models correlated with marathon performance (R = 0.672 ± 0.036, error = 8.01% ± 0.51%). CS from the model including 400, 800, and 5000 m best predicted performance (R = 0.695, error = 7.67%) and was used in further analysis. Runners completed the marathon at 84.8% ± 13.6% CS, with faster runners competing at speeds closer to CS (93.0% CS for 150 min marathon times vs 78.9% CS for 360 min marathon times). Runners who completed the first half of the marathon at > 94% of their CS, and particularly faster than CS, were more likely to slowdown by more than 25% in the second half of race.

Conclusion

This study suggests that estimations of CS from raw training data can successfully predict marathon performance and provide useful pacing information.

### Two-peaked increase of serum myosin heavy chain-α after triathlon suggests heart muscle cell death [^79bfbd88]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponins after exercise

Long-term consequences of endurance sports have only been discussed for the heart. And here the question of a possible pathophysiological sequence — repeated myocardial injury as demonstrated by troponin release leads to patchy areas of myocardial fibrosis which, in turn leads to electrical instability and mainly atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Obviously, not every athlete gets atrial fibrillation in the long run and, as shown in the present and in earlier investigations, the spectrum of cTnT rise in connection to the race is rather large. The maximum cTnT in the present investigation differed by a factor of 36 while one 37-year-old man participant only went from 4 at baseline to 12 directly after the race and back to 6 the next day (all ng/L). A lot of work has been done on the question of determinants of troponin rise after exercise; however, the results concerning parameters such as exercise intensity, age, absolute racing time, body mass, training status and maximal oxygen uptake were heterogeneous. The newest publication found that cTnT rise was related to exercise intensity relative to ventilatory threshold and maximal oxygen uptake in participants of the Brighton Marathon. In our own material, aerobic capacity was not related to cTnT rise (paper submitted). The percentage of athletes with cTnT values above the cut-off value for myocardial infarction was even higher than in some earlier publications; however, it seems that the newer and the more sensitive the assay used the higher this percentage. Richardson et al, using the same fifth generation cTnT assay as we did, reported 100% values above the myocardial infarction cut-off value in 52 marathon runners. Very little work has been done on individual data using serial measurements in athletes during repeated races. Cardiac troponins are elevated in a number of acute and chronic conditions and acute coronary syndrome is only one of them. However, the mechanism of cTn elevation in conditions like systemic hypertension or post-tachycardia is poorly understood as it is in endurance exercise. White suggested six potential mechanisms for cTn increase in the blood stream: myocyte necrosis (as in myocardial infarction), apoptosis, normal myocyte turnover, cellular release of proteolytic degradation products, increased cell wall permeability and the formation and release of membranous blebs. Especially, the increased cell wall permeability hypothesis has gained popularity among researchers who see the release of unbound cTn in connection with exercise as a benign phenomenon with no irreversible cell death. However, this hypothesis has never been proven and has been deemed unlikely by others. Even if the mechanism is related to increased myocardial strain than to ischaemic conditions, it appears likely that irreversible cell death is a prerequisite for cTn entering the circulation in higher than baseline amounts.

### On the paradox of exercise: coronary atherosclerosis in an apparently healthy marathon runner [^c1117861]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

An asymptomatic and apparently healthy 64-year-old marathon runner underwent comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment as part of a prospective study on calcified coronary plaque burden in master marathon runners. His profile suggested a low 10-year cardiovascular risk.

Investigations

Conventional risk-factor assessment, coronary artery calcium quantification, bicycle stress test, echocardiography, coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasonography, including virtual histology, and intracoronary Doppler ultrasonography.

Diagnosis

Severe coronary atherosclerosis of the left anterior descending, mid left circumflex, and left main arteries.

Management

Stenting of the left anterior descending artery, CABG surgery, and intensive risk-factor modification. The patient was also advised against participating in future marathon competitions.

### Determining a "do not start" temperature for a marathon on the basis of adverse outcomes [^28f6f8bf]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Marathon races faced with unexpectedly hot conditions must make a decision to start or not to start. The current race cancellation parameters may not reflect the safety profile of an individual race, and a universal temperature may not work an individual race.

Methods

A retrospective review of the number of starters, finishers, and finish line medical encounters was used to calculate the rate of "unsuccessful" marathon starters from race records, where unsuccessful is defined as medical encounters seen for any reason in the finish medical area plus marathon starters who did not finish. Unsuccessful marathon starters were plotted against the race start wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), and the WBGT level at which a mass casualty incident (MCI) occurred was used to calculate a "do not start" WBGT.

Results

A start WBGT of > 21 degrees C resulted in MCI or midrace cancellation in several races. Twin Cities Marathon data show a rapid increase in the rate of unsuccessful marathoner starters above a start WBGT of 13 degrees C. The event experienced an area-wide MCI at a start WBGT of 22 degrees C with an unsuccessful starter rate of 160 per 1000 finishers.

Conclusions

Marathons in northern latitudes (> 40 degrees) held in "unexpectedly" hot conditions when the participants are not acclimatized and the start WBGT is > 21 degrees C often end in either race cancellation or an MCI. It would seem prudent not to start these races in similar conditions. The rate of unsuccessful marathon starters per 1000 marathon finishers plotted against start WBGT generates a curve that can be used to estimate a do not start level. The do not start WBGT for Twin Cities Marathon is 20.5 degrees C on the basis of this model.

### Movie viewing elicits rich and reliable brain state dynamics [^a1e49bb6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Brain states differently expressed in movie compared to rest

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were analyzed for 18 healthy participants who were scanned during 8 min of resting-state followed by 20 min of movie viewing. HR and PD were also recorded. All participants completed a questionnaire immediately following the first neuroimaging session. Fourteen of these participants repeated this experimental session after 3 months.

Brain states occurring at rest and during movie viewing were estimated using the HMM, a method which posits that the observed data arise from a small number of hidden states and their transitions. To allow for a direct comparison between the states during the different experimental conditions (baseline rest and movie viewing, plus 3-month follow-up rest and movie viewing), we estimated brain states using concatenated time series of 14 participants who completed both experimental sessions (Methods). This allowed obtaining a group estimation of brain states for each experimental condition and session. The inversion of the HMM from these data yielded ten distinct states (Fig. 1). Confirmatory analyses were performed on 8 min of rest and 8 min of movie data, with HMM inversions performed on concatenated data as well as performed separately (i.e. movie and rest independently; Supplementary Figs 2–5). To understand the functional expression of these states, we coded their respective loadings onto each of 14 widely studied canonical brain networks (BNs)(Supplementary Fig. 1). The expression of network activity was normalised so that zero corresponds to the average activity of that network across the movies and rest periods. The variability was also scaled according to that network's standard deviation, allowing insights into the balanced representation of changes in fMRI signal magnitude across canonical BNs in time. Each network was normalised separately (Methods). Each brain state represents structured, recurring patterns of activity, loading distinctly across these fourteen canonical BNs at any specific timepoint.

### Personal best marathon performance is associated with performance in a 24-h run and not anthropometry or training volume [^e1885ab4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

In this study, the influence of anthropometric and training parameters on race performance in ultra-endurance runners in a 24-h run was investigated.

Design

Descriptive field study.

Setting

24-h run in Basel 2007.

Participants

15 male Caucasian ultra-runners (mean (SD) 46.7 (5.8 years), 71.1 (6.8 kg), 1.76 (0.07 m), body mass index 23.1 (1.84 kg/m(2))).

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Age, body mass, body height, length of lower limbs, skin-fold thicknesses, circumference of extremities, skeletal muscle mass, body mass, percentage of body fat, and training volume in 15 successful finishers were determined to correlate anthropometric and training parameters with race performance.

Results

No significant association (p > 0.05) was found between the reached distance and the anthropometric properties. There was also no significant association between the reached distance with the weekly training hours, running years, the number of finished marathons and the number of finished 24-h runs. The reached distance was significantly (p < 0.05) positively correlated with the personal best marathon performance (r² = 0.40) and the personal best 24-h run distance (r² = 0.58). Furthermore, the personal best marathon performance was significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01) with the best personal 24-h run distance (r² = 0.76).

Conclusions

Anthropometry and training volume does not seem to have a major effect on race performance in a 24-h run. Instead, a fast personal best marathon time seems to be the only positive association with race performance in a 24-h run.

### Acute impact of an endurance race on biventricular and biatrial myocardial strain in competitive male and female triathletes evaluated by feature-tracking CMR [^88dacbdf]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alterations in left ventricular strain after an endurance race

Stewart et al observed in a recent study that LV GLS decreased in 10 recreationally active men after a 90-min high-intensity cycling exercise, but not after a 120-min moderate-intensity cycling. Vitiello et al reported that LV GLS and GCS decreased in a cohort of 16 young men following a 180-min strenuous cycling exercise, but not GRS. Further, Aengevaeren et al used CMR to investigate the influence of a marathon run on myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte integrity in highly trained males, and reported that LV GCS was attenuated post-marathon and did not recover within 2 weeks. In concordance with another recent study by Cavigli et al, we also observed a post-race tendency of LV GLS reduction in triathletes and constant LVEF. Conversely, LV GCS and GRS were increased. There might be several explanations for this discrepancy. First, the acquisition time point of post-race CMR in our study was 2.3 h (range 1–5) and thus later than in the aforementioned echocardiographic studies, which might have provided a longer recovery period. Second, the duration and components of exercise were different. Stewart et al and Vitiello et al used a cycle ergometer in a strictly controlled in-door environment. Further, a marathon is an utterly strenuous and extended duration continuous exercise, while our triathletes participated in open-air races with varied distances and presumably less cardiac load. Third, strain parameters are not only a measure of intrinsic myocardial contractility, but are also influenced by cardiac load (i.e. end-systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LV volume) and structure. It is worth noting that a recent study aimed to compare the accuracy and reproducibility of FT-CMR and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE).

in endurance athletes. The authors concluded that biventricular longitudinal strain values were lower when assessed by FT-CMR compared to STE and both methods were statistically comparable and concordant when measuring LV strain, but not RV strain. Thus, while comparing strain studies, the potential influence of different imaging techniques needs to be considered. The increase in LV GCS and GRS in the current study might be a compensatory mechanism for the loss of longitudinal mechanical function, as observed in early stages of progressive myocardial disease.

### Specialized transendothelial dendritic cells mediate thymic T-cell selection against blood-borne macromolecules [^261b53c5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Image analysis

T series were converted into movies using Volocity (Perkin Elmer) and Imaris (Bitplane) software. Motility parameters such as three-dimensional instantaneous velocities, mean velocities per track, mean displacement plots, meandering indices, and motility coefficients were determined by semi-automated cell tracking with Imaris and Volocity Software and computational analysis by MatLab (Mathworks), Excel (Microsoft Office), or Prism (GraphPad). The meandering index is a measure for the directionality of cell migration; it represents the ratio of the displacement over the total path length of the track. The motility coefficient measures a cell's propensity to move away from its point of origin, analogous to the diffusion coefficient of Brownian motion.

### Haptic contents of a movie dynamically engage the spectator's sensorimotor cortex [^d23b5b49]. Human Brain Mapping (2016). Low credibility.

Observation of another person's actions and feelings activates brain areas that support similar functions in the observer, thereby facilitating inferences about the other's mental and bodily states. In real life, events eliciting this kind of vicarious brain activations are intermingled with other complex, ever-changing stimuli in the environment. One practical approach to study the neural underpinnings of real-life vicarious perception is to image brain activity during movie viewing. Here the goal was to find out how observed haptic events in a silent movie would affect the spectator's sensorimotor cortex. The functional state of the sensorimotor cortex was monitored by analyzing, in 16 healthy subjects, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to tactile finger stimuli that were presented once per second throughout the session. Using canonical correlation analysis and spatial filtering, consistent single-trial responses across subjects were uncovered, and their waveform changes throughout the movie were quantified. The long-latency (85–175 ms) parts of the responses were modulated in concordance with the participants' average moment-by-moment ratings of own engagement in the haptic content of the movie (correlation r = 0.49; ratings collected after the MEG session). The results, obtained by using novel signal-analysis approaches, demonstrate that the functional state of the human sensorimotor cortex fluctuates in a fine-grained manner even during passive observation of temporally varying haptic events.

### Long-term marathon running is associated with low coronary plaque formation in women [^b2e1c5e8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Marathon running is presumed to improve cardiovascular risk, but health benefits of high volume running are unknown. High-resolution coronary computed tomography angiography and cardiac risk factor assessment were completed in women with long-term marathon running histories to compare to sedentary women with similar risk factors.

Methods

Women who had run at least one marathon per year for 10–25 yr underwent coronary computed tomography angiography, 12-lead ECG, blood pressure and heart rate measurement, lipid panel, and a demographic/health risk factor survey. Sedentary matched controls were derived from a contemporaneous clinical study database. CT scans were analyzed for calcified and noncalcified plaque prevalence, volume, stenosis severity, and calcium score.

Results

Women marathon runners (n = 26), age 42–82 yr, with combined 1217 marathons (average 47) exhibited significantly lower coronary plaque prevalence and less calcific plaque volume. The marathon runners also had less risk factors (smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia); significantly lower resting heart rate, body weight, body mass index, and triglyceride levels; and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with controls (n = 28). The five women runners with coronary plaque had run marathons for more years and were on average 12 yr older (65 vs 53) than the runners without plaque.

Conclusion

Women marathon runners had minimal coronary artery calcium counts, lower coronary artery plaque prevalence, and less calcified plaque volume compared with sedentary women. Developing coronary artery plaque in long-term women marathon runners appears related to older age and more cardiac risk factors, although the runners with coronary artery plaque had accumulated significantly more years running marathons.

### Fifty men, 3510 marathons, cardiac risk factors, and coronary artery calcium scores [^9632924a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction/Purpose

Many male marathon runners have elevated coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores despite high physical activity. We examined the association between CAC scores, cardiovascular risk factors, and lifestyle habits in long-term marathoners.

Methods

We recruited men who had run one or more marathons annually for 25 consecutive years. CAC was assessed using coronary computed tomography angiography. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors were measured with a 12-lead ECG, serum lipid panel, height, weight, resting blood pressure and heart rate, and a risk factor questionnaire.

Results

Fifty males, mean age 59 ± 0.9 yr with a combined total of 3510 marathons (median = 58.5, range = 27–171), had a mean BMI of 22.44 ± 0.4 kg·m, HDL and LDL cholesterols of 58 ± 1.6 and 112 ± 3.7 mg·dL, and CAC scores from 0 to 3153. CAC scores varied from 0 in 16 runners to 1–100 in 12, 101–400 in 12, and > 400 in 10. There was no statistical difference in the number of marathons run between the four groups. Compared with marathoners with no CAC, marathoners with moderate and extensive CAC were older (P = 0.002), started running at an older age (P = 0.003), were older when they ran their first marathon (P = 0.006), and had more CAD risk factors (P = 0.005), and marathoners with more CAC had higher rates of previous tobacco use (P = 0.002) and prevalence of hyperlipidemia (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Among experienced males who have run marathons for 26–34 yr and completed between 27 and 171 marathons, CAC score is related to CAD risk factors and not the number of marathons run or years of running. This suggests that among long-term marathoners, more endurance exercise is not associated with an increased risk of CAC.

### Movie-watching evokes ripple-like activity within events and at event boundaries [^e0485090]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For each ripple, we extracted its peak time as the time point at which the band-pass signal was highest; the ripple duration as the time difference between the start and end time of a given ripple; and the inter-ripple interval (IRI) as the time difference between the onset of two consecutive ripples. To depict the time-domain signal, we extracted the raw LFP traces and the time-frequency-domain power spectrum (using Morlet wavelets with 7 cycles at 30 logarithmically spaced frequencies between 1 and 200 Hz), within −100 to 100 ms around each ripple.

Ripple phase locking to ongoing neural oscillations at the slow band

To investigate whether ripples were locked to particular phases of slow oscillations (0.5 to 4 Hz) we filtered the signal using a two-pass Butterworth filter and extracted the instantaneous phase using the Hilbert transform at the onsets of each ripple. To assess phase consistency across ripples we computed inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) values across ripples for each participant. ITPC spans from 0 to 1, with 1 corresponding to a perfect inter-trial coherence (i.e. the same phase on each trial onset).

To assess the statistical significance of ripple-phase coupling, we compared the empirical values against 1000 surrogate values computed by permuting the inter-ripple interval distribution (i.e. permuting the time differences between the onset of two consecutive ripples), for each participant. Then we computed a group-level p -value of the empirical average ITPC z -value in comparison to the surrogate ITPC z -values as the fraction of surrogate values that were larger than the empirical value, with an alpha of 0.05.

### Myocardial adaptations to recreational marathon training among middle-aged men [^324c34b0]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Myocardial adaptations to exercise have been well documented among competitive athletes. To what degree cardiac remodeling occurs among recreational exercisers is unknown. We sought to evaluate the effect of recreational marathon training on myocardial structure and function comprehensively.

Methods and Results

Male runners (n = 45; age, 48 ± 7 years; 64% with ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factor) participated in a structured marathon-training program. Echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and laboratory evaluation were performed pre and post training to quantify changes in myocardial structure and function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and traditional cardiac risk parameters. Completion of an 18-week running program (25 ± 9 miles/wk) led to increased cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption, 44.6 ± 5.2 versus 46.3 ± 5.4 mL/kg per minute; P < 0.001). In this setting, there was a significant structural cardiac remodeling characterized by dilation of the left ventricle (end-diastolic volume, 156 ± 26 versus 172 ± 28 mL, P < 0.001), right ventricle (end-diastolic area = 27.0 ± 4.8 versus 28.6 ± 4.3 cm(2); P = 0.02), and left atrium (end-diastolic volume, 65 ± 19 versus 72 ± 19; P = 0.02). Functional adaptations included increases in both early (E' = 12.4 ± 2.5 versus 13.2 ± 2.0 cm/s; P = 0.007) and late (A' = 11.5 ± 1.9 versus 12.2 ± 2.1 cm/s; P = 0.02) left ventricular diastolic velocities. Myocardial remodeling was accompanied by beneficial changes in cardiovascular risk factors, including body mass index (27.0 ± 2.7 versus 26.7 ± 2.6 kg/m(2); P < 0.001), total cholesterol (199 ± 33 versus 192 ± 29 mg/dL; P = 0.01), low-density lipoprotein (120 ± 29 versus 114 ± 26 mg/dL; P = 0.01), and triglycerides (100 ± 52 versus 85 ± 36 mg/dL; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Among middle-aged men, recreational marathon training is associated with biventricular dilation, enhanced left ventricular diastolic function, and favorable changes in nonmyocardial determinants of cardiovascular risk. Recreational marathon training may, therefore, serve as an effective strategy for decreasing incident cardiovascular disease.

### 2018 ACC / HRS / NASCI / SCAI / SCCT expert consensus document on optimal use of ionizing radiation in Cardiovascular imaging: best Practices for safety and effectiveness: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on expert consensus decision pathways [^e747a5e0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Determinants of total dose for an exposure — the total dose is the product of dose per pulse and the total number of pulses; thus, 3 parameters — dose per pulse (in nGy per pulse), pulse rate (in pulses per second), and exposure duration (in seconds) — combine to determine total dose. In fluoroscopy mode, current units provide 3 tableside‑selectable detector dose‑per‑frame levels with tableside fluoroscopy pulse rates ranging from 4 to 30 pulses/s. In cine mode, the detector dose per pulse is set by the service engineer, while the operator can select among multiple pulse rates and is responsible for determining operating parameters that balance spatial and temporal resolution with dose.

### Three-dimensional entertainment as a novel cause of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^fdf3c467]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is an uncommon entity. It is known to occur in the setting of extreme catecholamine release and results in left ventricular dysfunction without evidence of angiographically definable coronary artery disease. There have been no published reports of TC occurring with visual stimuli, specifically 3-dimensional (3D) entertainment. We present a 55-year-old woman who presented to her primary care physician's office with extreme palpitations, nausea, vomiting, and malaise < 48 hours after watching a 3D action movie at her local theater. Her electrocardiogram demonstrated ST elevations in aVL and V1, prolonged QTc interval, and T-wave inversions in leads I, II, aVL, and V2-V6. Coronary angiography revealed angiographically normal vessels, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, and decreased ejection fraction with a pattern of apical ballooning. The presumed final diagnosis was TC, likely due to visual-auditory-triggered catecholamine release causing impaired coronary microcirculation.

### Inverse relationship between percentage body weight change and finishing time in 643 forty-two-kilometre marathon runners [^06c5add4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between athletic performance and the change in body weight (BW) during a 42 km marathon in a large cohort of runners.

Methods

The study took place during the 2009 Mont Saint-Michel Marathon (France). 643 marathon finishers (560 males and 83 females) were studied. The change in BW during the race was calculated from measurements of each runner's BW immediately before and after the race.

Results

BW loss was 2.3 ± 2.2% (mean ± SEM) (p < 0.01). BW loss was -3.1 ± 1.9% for runners finishing the marathon in less than 3 h; -2.5 ± 2.1% for runners finishing between 3 and 4 h; and -1.8 ± 2.4% for runners who required more than 4 h to complete the marathon. The degree of BW loss was linearly related to 42 km race finishing time (p < 0.0000001). Neither age nor gender influenced BW loss during the race.

Conclusions

BW loss during the marathon was inversely related to race finishing time in 643 marathon runners and was > 3% in runners completing the race in less than 3 h. These data are not compatible with laboratory-derived data suggesting that BW loss greater than 2% during exercise impairs athletic performance. They match an extensive body of evidence showing that the most successful athletes in marathon and ultra-marathon running and triathlon events are frequently those who lose substantially more than 3–4% BW during competition.

### Cardiac arrest during long-distance running races [^d534b827]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 29 million participants completed marathons and half-marathons in the US between 2010–2023, approximately 3 times the number from 2000–2009. Contemporary long-distance race-related cardiac arrest incidence and outcomes are unknown.

Objective

To determine the incidence and outcomes of cardiac arrests during US marathons and half-marathons between 2010–2023 from a record of race finishers and a comprehensive review of cases from media reports, direct contact with race directors, USA Track & Field claims, and interviews with survivors or next of kin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational case series from the Race Associated Cardiac Event Registry; cohort data from US marathon and half-marathon runners from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2023. Case profiles were reviewed to determine etiology and factors associated with survival. Incidence and etiology data were compared with historical reference standards (2000–2009).

Exposure

Recreational long-distance running (marathon and half-marathon distance).

Main Outcomes

Incidence proportions of sudden cardiac arrest and death.

Results

Among 29 311 597 race finishers, 176 cardiac arrests (127 men, 19 women, 30 sex unknown) occurred during US long-distance running races. Compared with 2000–2009, cardiac arrest incidence remained unchanged (incidence rate, 0.54 per 100 000 participants [95% CI, 0.41–0.70] vs 0.60 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.52–0.70], respectively). However, there were significant declines in cardiac death incidence (0.20 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.15–0.26] vs 0.39 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.28–0.52]) and case fatality rate (34% vs 71%). Cardiac arrests remained more common among men (1.12 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.95–1.32]) than women (0.19 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.13–0.27]) and during the marathon (1.04 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.82–1.32]), compared with the half-marathon (0.47 per 100 000 [95% CI, 0.38–0.57]). Among runners for which a definitive cause of cardiac arrest could be determined (n = 67/128 [52%]), coronary artery disease rather than hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the most common etiology. Decreased cardiopulmonary resuscitation time and an initial ventricular tachyarrhythmia rhythm were associated with survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite increased participation in US long distance running races, cardiac arrest incidence remains stable. There has been a marked decline in cardiac arrest mortality, and coronary artery disease was the most common etiology among cases with sufficient cause-related data. Effective emergency action planning with immediate access to defibrillation may explain the improvement in survival.

### Impact of movie and video game elements on tic manifestation in children [^00897951]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

To test our hypotheses, we used three types of media content: (i) an excerpt from the film Up (2009) with its dramatic climax, (ii) short clips featuring affective bodily cues of positive and negative valence, and (iii) an in‐house designed game called ZenithX (Figure 1a–c) involving three types of anticipatory events: dice roll, battle, and card regain. Given the evidence on striatal dopaminergic responsiveness to cued expectations, we specifically investigated whether tic frequency varied between two anticipation modes: (i) anticipation with a cue indicating the pending reward and invoking value expectations and (ii) anticipation without such a cue.

FIGURE 1
The ZenithX game and the experimental setup. We designed the ZenithX game as a combination of the card game War and the board game Ladders and Snakes. (a1) In each game round, participants compete in a race to the top with three opponents (out of four potential opponents including one allegedly human, played by the experimenter, and three bots). The first opponent arriving at the top is granted the highest score, whereas the rest lose points according to their distance from the top. The opponents differ in color, indicating their strength (their success rates in battles). A virtual dice roll determines the number of forward steps for each player in each round. (a2) When two players occupy the same slot, a combat is initiated. The combat includes the following phases as follows. (i) Card selection: the participant selects one of three cards from their hand; the cards are numbered from 1 to 9, where 9 is the strongest card. (ii) Battle: The selected card competes with the opponent's card. The winner advances, and the loser retreats a number of steps equal to the difference between the competing cards' numbers. (iii) Card retrieval (a3): an animation of three chests appears on the screen. The chests differ in color, indicating the strength of the cards they contain (i.e. the chests differ in card number probabilities). During the anticipation phase, three chests were presented, and one of them started shaking, indicating that the retrieved card would be drawn from it. The duration of the chest presentation and shaking animation was randomly set to 0.5, 4.5, 9, or 13.5 s, with a total duration of 14 s for the entire phase. Finally, the chest opened, and the participant retrieved and exposed a card. In Experiment 2, the motionless chest appeared on the screen for 3 s, followed by shaking for 3–4 s. Each participant attended a 3‐h session at the Immersive lab, which was conducted by a trained research assistant. The participants provided their consent for video and audio recording of the session using two Logitech Brio 4K webcams. One of the webcams was placed in front of the participant for video recording, whereas the other was placed on a small stool next to them for sound recording. (b1) The participants were seated on a student chair (represented schematically due to confidentiality issues), equipped with a computer mouse and a pair of on‐ear headphones (Audio‐Technica ATH‐M20X), facing a projector screen (b2). They were instructed to tic as much or as little as they needed throughout the entire session without suppressing tics. (c) User engagement scores (n = 22) in four different subscales (upper panel) and on average (lower panel).
