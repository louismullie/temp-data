## Question

Treatment for sepsis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of sepsis, preserving natural self-verification and any initial missteps with corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate recognition and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the timing and selection of empiric antimicrobials. Next, I will examine source control, followed by hemodynamic resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors. After that, I need to check supportive care, including respiratory, renal, hematologic, and metabolic management. I will then review antimicrobial stewardship and de-escalation, consider special populations and settings, and finally address goals of care, discharge planning, and quality improvement, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment and risk stratification framework. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock is a subset with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction that substantially increases mortality, so I need to ensure I am using Sepsis-3 definitions and screening tools like qSOFA and SOFA to identify organ dysfunction early and guide urgency of therapy [^1115wEis] [^1115wEis]. Hold on, I should verify the timing of recognition and treatment initiation; the SSC 2021 emphasizes that sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment and resuscitation, which means I should not wait for full confirmation before starting life-saving measures in high-likelihood cases [^115quWZb].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial timing and selection, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Initially, I thought "immediate antibiotics for all suspected sepsis within 1 hour", but wait, let me verify the nuance here. The SSC 2021 strongly recommends antimicrobials within 1 hour for suspected septic shock and for confirmed or very likely sepsis, while for possible sepsis without shock, it recommends a rapid assessment of infectious versus noninfectious causes and administration within about 3 hours if concern persists, which corrects my earlier blanket statement and aligns with stewardship principles [^117TtP7Y] [^1159AV5J] [^1111oLvH]. I should double-check the evidence signal: delays in appropriate therapy are consistently associated with higher mortality, especially in septic shock, supporting the urgency in that subgroup, whereas the benefit of immediate antibiotics is less certain in nonshock presentations and must be balanced against overtreatment risks [^115k16Na] [^116tRBaf].

> I will now examine empiric antimicrobial selection. Let me think about likely sources, local antibiograms, and patient-specific resistance risks. For high risk of multidrug-resistant organisms, the SSC suggests two gram-negative agents initially, whereas for low risk, a single gram-negative agent is reasonable; once susceptibilities return, double coverage should be discontinued, and MRSA coverage should be added when risk factors or local epidemiology warrant it, with antifungal coverage reserved for appropriate hosts and suspected fungal sources [^114jogr7] [^114h6N1R]. Hold on, I should verify that obtaining cultures before antibiotics is prioritized when it does not cause a harmful delay; this remains a best practice to enable de-escalation and improve diagnostic clarity [^114zHw6V].

> Source control is the next critical step, and I need to ensure it is not overlooked. Source control should be pursued as soon as medically and logistically feasible, ideally within 6 to 12 hours, using the least invasive effective approach; prolonged attempts at medical stabilization without source control in septic shock are discouraged, and surgical exploration is indicated when less invasive options are inadequate or when diagnostic uncertainty persists [^114tWm4Z] [^114WmUw9]. Let me reconsider whether delays for optimization are justified; the balance generally favors early source control once initial resuscitation is underway, particularly in shock states [^114tWm4Z].

> Now, I should confirm hemodynamic resuscitation principles. For adults with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, an initial 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus is reasonable, with dynamic measures guiding further fluid responsiveness rather than static parameters alone; balanced crystalloids are preferred over saline when available, and albumin can be considered if substantial crystalloid has been given and vasopressor requirements remain high [^1145gRY3] [^115WgDpQ] [^1142X2co] [^114zHw6V]. Wait, let me verify the vasopressor strategy: norepinephrine is first-line to target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, vasopressin can be added to reduce norepinephrine dose, and epinephrine is reasonable if additional agent is needed; inotropes like dobutamine are reserved for myocardial dysfunction with low cardiac output despite adequate volume and MAP [^114zHw6V] [^notfound].

> Supportive care must be comprehensive, and I need to ensure I cover organ support. For respiratory failure, use lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and limit plateau pressures, apply at least minimal PEEP, and consider prone positioning for severe ARDS; avoid routine neuromuscular blockade except for early severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia, and minimize sedation with daily interruption protocols when feasible [^114zHw6V] [^1123c9fG]. For renal replacement, continuous and intermittent modalities are generally equivalent in sepsis-associated AKI, and for hematologic support, transfuse to hemoglobin 7–9 g/dL unless tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic heart disease, or acute hemorrhage are present; for glycemic control, start insulin when glucose exceeds 180 mg/dL and target ≤ 180 mg/dL, while providing DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis and early enteral nutrition when tolerated [^114zHw6V] [^1123c9fG].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial stewardship and de-escalation, and I need to ensure this is embedded from day 1. Daily reassessment for de-escalation and narrowing therapy based on cultures and clinical response is recommended, and when source control is adequate, shorter courses are favored over longer ones; procalcitonin combined with clinical evaluation can help decide when to stop therapy when duration is unclear, though this is a weak recommendation and should be interpreted in context [^111mfgHu] [^1122xiuH] [^113JyKUf]. Hold on, I should verify that stewardship is not an afterthought; the IDSA and contemporary reviews caution that overly rigid time-to-antibiotic mandates can drive overtreatment in patients with possible but unconfirmed infection, reinforcing the need for individualized risk assessment and timely de-escalation [^116Nh8HK] [^116tRBaf].

> I will now consider special populations and settings, and I need to ensure I adapt to context. In pediatrics, use 20 mL/kg crystalloid boluses, dopamine historically as a first-line vasoactive in some settings though norepinephrine is increasingly used, and restrict hydrocortisone to suspected absolute adrenal insufficiency; in pregnancy, prioritize early antibiotics and source control with a low threshold for ICU admission; in the immunocompromised, broaden empiric coverage early and escalate diagnostics for atypical pathogens; in older adults, anticipate atypical presentations and maintain a high index of suspicion while avoiding unnecessary delays in therapy [^114zHw6V] [^112KV6nH]. But wait, what if resources are limited? In resource-limited settings, emphasize early recognition, simple diagnostics, and timely antimicrobials adapted to local epidemiology, with consensus statements supporting context-specific adaptations and pragmatic stewardship [^114stj1t] [^111JLomj].

> Goals of care and discharge planning should be addressed early, and I should confirm timing. The SSC recommends discussing goals of care and prognosis with patients and families, ideally within 72 hours of ICU admission, and integrating palliative care principles when appropriate; discharge summaries should document the ICU course, sepsis-related diagnoses, treatments, and common post-sepsis impairments, and patients and families should receive education on sepsis, recovery, and warning signs before discharge [^117GHbkz] [^117LhFrm] [^116SYJg3] [^112t7MVC]. Hold on, I should verify that these discussions are not delayed unnecessarily, as early alignment improves care coherence and family satisfaction [^117GHbkz].

> Finally, I need to ensure quality improvement and system-level supports are in place. Performance improvement programs with sepsis screening and standardized operating procedures are associated with reduced mortality, yet real-world adherence to sepsis bundles remains suboptimal due to workload and staffing constraints, underscoring the need for leadership, staffing, and training investments; diagnostic stewardship and rapid diagnostics can reduce time-to-effective therapy while curbing unnecessary broad-spectrum use, and future research priorities include precision approaches, individualized fluid and vasopressor strategies, and better screening tools [^112vFMAx] [^115e5HSK] [^1159S4PV] [^111j6k7T]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge that many guideline recommendations rest on low or very low certainty evidence, so continuous learning, local validation, and iterative feedback loops are essential to close evidence gaps and improve outcomes [^11469E94].

Sepsis treatment centers on **early recognition and rapid intervention** to prevent progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure [^114vEDrH]. The core elements are **immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics** (within 1 hour of recognition) [^117TtP7Y], **aggressive fluid resuscitation** (30 mL/kg crystalloids) [^1145gRY3], and **early source control** (drainage or debridement) [^114WmUw9]. Vasopressors (norepinephrine first-line) are started if hypotension persists after fluids [^114zHw6V], and adjunctive measures include corticosteroids for refractory shock, lung-protective ventilation, and tight glucose control [^1123c9fG]. Daily reassessment enables **antibiotic de-escalation** and timely discontinuation to limit resistance and toxicity [^111mfgHu] [^114NZQDr]. Early, protocolized care reduces mortality, but therapy must be individualized to patient factors and local epidemiology [^112vFMAx] [^111c3qx8].

---

## Early recognition and diagnosis

Early recognition relies on clinical suspicion plus **SOFA/qSOFA** to detect organ dysfunction and risk stratify [^1123c9fG]. Prompt diagnostics include blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible, CBC, lactate, renal and hepatic panels, and imaging to identify the source [^114zHw6V].

---

## Antimicrobial therapy

- **Immediate empiric antibiotics**: Start within 1 hour of recognition; tailor to likely source, local resistance, and patient risk factors [^112RX5uz] [^111W8GHj].

- **Broad-spectrum coverage**: Cover gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including MRSA and Pseudomonas when indicated [^113qkY3D].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider two gram-negative agents if MDR risk is high; de-escalate to single agent once susceptibilities are known [^114jogr7].

- **Duration**: 7–10 days if source control is adequate; shorter courses are acceptable with good clinical response and source control [^1122xiuH].

- **Stewardship**: Reassess daily for de-escalation or discontinuation if infection is excluded [^111mfgHu] [^111NPCkz].

---

## Hemodynamic support

### Fluid resuscitation

Use **crystalloids as first-line** (30 mL/kg within 3 hours) [^1145gRY3] and reassess for response using dynamic measures (e.g. passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) [^115WgDpQ]. Consider albumin when large crystalloid volumes are required or in specific contexts (e.g. cirrhosis, ARDS) [^114zHw6V].

---

### Vasopressors and inotropes

- **First-line vasopressor**: Norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^114zHw6V].

- **Second-line agents**: Add vasopressin or epinephrine if MAP remains inadequate [^114qFyMu].

- **Inotropes**: Use dobutamine for myocardial dysfunction with low cardiac output despite adequate volume and vasopressors [^114zHw6V].

---

## Source control

Identify and intervene early — drain abscesses, remove infected devices, or perform surgical debridement — ideally **within 6–12 hours** after diagnosis [^114WmUw9] [^114tWm4Z].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Corticosteroids**: Hydrocortisone 200 mg/day for refractory shock persisting after fluids and vasopressors [^notfound].

- **Glucose control**: Target 140–180 mg/dL with insulin [^notfound].

- **Ventilation**: Lung-protective strategy (tidal volume 6 mL/kg, plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H₂O) for ARDS [^notfound].

- **Renal support**: Initiate dialysis for severe AKI or metabolic derangements [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring should track **vital signs, urine output, lactate, and mental status** to guide ongoing therapy. Daily reassessment should evaluate antibiotic spectrum, fluid balance, and organ function to enable timely de-escalation and adjustments [^111mfgHu].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broader empiric coverage and early antifungal therapy when indicated [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: Weight-based fluid resuscitation (20 mL/kg) and age-appropriate antibiotic dosing [^114zHw6V].

- **Resource-limited settings**: Adapt protocols to local resources and antimicrobial availability [^114stj1t].

---

## Outcomes and complications

Mortality remains high (**20–50%**) and rises with delayed antibiotics, inadequate source control, and pre-existing comorbidities. Common complications include ARDS, AKI, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and secondary infections [^113a4ft4] [^111GiBm6] [^114tWm4Z] [^114qFyMu].

---

## Recent advances and controversies

- **Rapid diagnostics**: PCR and mass spectrometry enable faster pathogen identification and resistance profiling, supporting earlier de-escalation [^1159S4PV].

- **Personalized medicine**: Efforts focus on biomarkers and phenotypes to tailor therapy, though evidence remains limited [^111j6k7T].

- **Fluid strategy**: Debate continues on restrictive vs liberal fluids; dynamic assessment is emphasized to individualize resuscitation [^1145gRY3].

---

Effective sepsis care requires **rapid recognition, early antibiotics, aggressive fluids, source control, and vigilant supportive care**, with therapy individualized to patient and local context to optimize outcomes [^112eJYYS].

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

Conclusions

The last few decades of sepsis research have helped clinicians better understand the importance of identifying sepsis early and treating aggressively. Nonetheless, there is still much debate about how to identify these patients and which criteria are most predictive for the development of sepsis and septic shock. The recent updates, particularly the recommendations regarding SOFA and qSOFA scores, operationalize the definitions of sepsis into a clinically useful model that can be used by clinicians to identify the patients most at risk of deterioration. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

### Sepsis: a roadmap for future research [^112eJYYS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common and lethal syndrome: although outcomes have improved, mortality remains high. No specific anti-sepsis treatments exist; as such, management of patients relies mainly on early recognition allowing correct therapeutic measures to be started rapidly, including administration of appropriate antibiotics, source control measures when necessary, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs when needed. Although substantial developments have been made in the understanding of the basic pathogenesis of sepsis and the complex interplay of host, pathogen, and environment that affect the incidence and course of the disease, sepsis has stubbornly resisted all efforts to successfully develop and then deploy new and improved treatments. Existing models of clinical research seem increasingly unlikely to produce new therapies that will result in a step change in clinical outcomes. In this Commission, we set out our understanding of the clinical epidemiology and management of sepsis and then ask how the present approaches might be challenged to develop a new roadmap for future research.

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^115LHQs5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

### Diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis [^113WL7Uc]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The burden of infection in industrialized countries has prompted considerable effort to improve the outcomes of patients with sepsis. This has been formalized through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 'bundles', derived from the recommendations of 11 professional societies, which have promoted global improvement in those practices whose primary goal it is to reduce sepsis-related death. However, difficulties remain in implementing all of the procedures recommended by the experts, despite the apparent pragmatism of those procedures. We summarize the main proposals made by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and focus on the difficulties associated with making a proper diagnosis and supplying adequate treatment promptly to septic patients.

### The management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^117V5QDr]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is a complex and dynamic process. Newer evidence-based interventions are constantly being developed and implemented with the purpose of improving morbidity and mortality. Current investigations are being performed in hospital environments to determine the change in behaviors and clinical impact with the most recent recommendations. The use of standardized treatment protocols in addition to newer diagnostic and treatment modalities in patients who have severe sepsis and septic shock can continue to improve patient-related outcomes and the damaging effect of these diseases on society.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114m6UYR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 deaths in the United States each year. The in-hospital mortality approaches 30% despite advances in critical care during the last several decades. The direct health care costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars annually and continue to escalate each year especially as the population ages. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published their initial clinical practice guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2016 following the convening of the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In addition to using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to more rapidly identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score. To date, the largest reductions in mortality have been associated with early identification of sepsis, initiation of a 3-hour care bundle and rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial, and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Pitfalls in the treatment of sepsis [^111uunSK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a challenging, dynamic, pathophysiology requiring expertise in diagnosis and management. Controversy exists as to the most sensitive early indicators of sepsis and sepsis severity. Patients presenting to the emergency department often lack complete history or clinical data that would point to optimal management. Awareness of these potential knowledge gaps is important for the emergency provider managing the septic patient. Specific areas of management including the initiation and management of mechanical ventilation, the appropriate disposition of the patient, and consideration of transfer to higher levels of care are reviewed.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^111NPCkz]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — diagnosis of infection and antimicrobial reassessment: For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock but unconfirmed infection, we recommend continuously re-evaluating and searching for alternative diagnoses and discontinuing empiric antimicrobials if an alternative cause of illness is demonstrated or strongly suspected (Best practice statement). The guideline further states that it did not identify any direct or indirect evidence on this issue and that clinicians are strongly encouraged to discontinue antimicrobials if a non-infectious syndrome (or an infectious syndrome that does not benefit from antimicrobials) is demonstrated or strongly suspected.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — duration of antibiotics: For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence. As rationale, the guideline states that for adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest a shorter course of antibiotics, as this is less costly, has fewer undesirable effects without impacting adversely on outcomes.

### Revising sepsis definitions to better target and tailor sepsis care [^112HH8jE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

How we define sepsis has significant implications for clinical care, quality improvement, and regulatory policies. Current sepsis criteria identify heterogenous patients that vary widely in their clinical syndromes, triggering pathogens, and prognoses; one-third have viral or non-infectious processes and crude mortality rates vary 30-fold. Nonetheless, clinicians have been trained to treat all patients with possible sepsis immediately, aggressively, and uniformly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evidence continues to mount, however, that immediate antibiotics are critical for patients with septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction but short delays can safely be tolerated by patients with single organ dysfunction without shock. This allows time to clarify whether these patients are infected or not. We suggest modifying sepsis operational definitions to flag just those patients in whom short antibiotic delays are associated with worse outcomes. This will help focus sepsis care where it is needed, aid antibiotic stewardship, and increase the validity of sepsis quality measures.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^111j6k7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Equilibrating SSC guidelines with individualized care [^111c3qx8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a major cause of death worldwide, not least because complex interventions need to be provided within a short window of opportunity. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of sepsis are therefore welcome, providing a common ground for all clinicians involved in decision-making regardless of their expertise. Such guidelines should therefore serve as an overarching reference document. As previously stated, ' Guidelines are the product of an explicit, systematic approach to the evaluation and synthesis of available information on a particular clinical topic. They are not a compilation of truths, but are a summary of what is accepted by the authors as the best available evidence at that time '.

As the evidence base evolves over time, the new Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines are timely and important. We appreciate the tremendous amount of time invested by the experts who formulated the new guidelines to provide the intensive care community with a clear and comprehensive manuscript. We also recognize the challenge of providing evidence-based guidelines when the strength of evidence available to direct recommendations is limited. Indeed, the large majority of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) performed over the last three decades in intensive care medicine, including those in sepsis, have shown no significant beneficial effect of the tested intervention on outcomes. At face value, this may simply suggest that the myriad of interventions that have been tested are all ineffective. However, it is more likely that subsets of patients who benefit from specific treatments have yet to be identified. The often broad patient inclusion criteria could easily lead to dilution of positive findings by non-responders, or to positive effects in some patients being offset by harm in others. This treatment effect heterogeneity has been clearly indicated in many trials (for example).

### Sepsis: personalization V protocolization? [^113eBJMS]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The founding tenet of evidence-based medicine is to combine best evidence with clinical expertise. As David Sackett opined 'Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence'. Rigid protocols and mandates, based on an inconclusive and low-level evidence base, cannot suit the physiological, biochemical and biological heterogeneity displayed by the individual septic patient. Indeed, clear proof of outcome benefit through adoption of an inflexible management approach is lacking and will certainly be detrimental to some. Therapy thus needs to be tailored to meet the individual patient's needs. The same principle should be applied to clinical trials; the continued disappointments of multiple investigational strategies trialled over three decades, despite (often) a sound biological rationale, suggest a repeated methodological failure that does not account for the marked heterogeneity within the septic patient's biological phenotype and thus marked variation in their host response. The increasing availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostics and theranostics should facilitate better patient selection and titrated optimization of the therapeutic intervention.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^117TtP7Y]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — antimicrobial timing: In all patients with potential septic shock, the panel issued a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately, and within one hour; for patients with confirmed/very likely sepsis, antimicrobials be administered immediately. For patients with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious etiologies should be undertaken to determine, within 3 hours, whether antibiotics should be administered or deferred while monitoring closely. Administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition; perform rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness; and administer antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern for infection persists.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1143BM5N]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The exact number of patients suffering from sepsis is difficult to capture, but it is estimated to affect at least 1–1.5 million persons each year in the United States.and 19 million patients worldwide. Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 USA deaths per yearand an in-hospital mortality upward of 30% despite advances in critical care. During the last several decades, the mortality rates have decreased, but the incidence is rising. The condition affects all ages, however, among those with sepsis, 49% are between the ages of 65–84 years old. It also commonly affects those with compromised immune systems, chronic disease, infants and those suffering traumatic injury. The direct healthcare costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars per yearand rises on average more than 11% per year in cost. Sepsis remains in the top 10 leading causes of death despite plentiful investigative attention toward new therapies and adjuncts to mitigate poor outcome.

The newest developments in our understanding of sepsis reflect revisions to the definitions of the terms sepsis, septic shock and severe sepsis. Since 1991 there have been three consensus conferences convened (in 1991, 2001 and 2014) to adjudicate the definition of sepsis. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force published the 'The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)". This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. These new definitions were followed shortly by the 'Assessment of Clinical Criteria for Sepsis For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)'. The aim of this publication was to evaluate and recommend clinical criteria that could help identify patients at risk of developing sepsis.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111uSmjV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and life-threatening illness in the ICU, requiring timely and effective antimicrobial therapy. The aims of this review are to identify the most common sites of sepsis, the likely pathogens, and the optimal approach to antimicrobial therapy. Effective therapy must be balanced by the need to avoid overuse of broad spectrum agents and thus must be accompanied by a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship. Using experts in this topic, we reviewed the literature relevant to antimicrobial management of sepsis and recommend key principles for management.

### Deep reinforcement learning extracts the optimal sepsis treatment policy from treatment records [^112awgoP]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis, one of the most life-threatening medical conditions induced by infection, is a leading cause of death that makes it difficult to decide the optimal treatment strategy –. Even though there were improvements in the treatment of sepsis, the mortality rate for sepsis still remains relatively high at 30%. Furthermore, it could sharply worsen the mortality rate due to multiple organ failures if proper treatment is not provided.

Although numerous clinical tests have been conducted to determine the optimal sepsis treatment, deciding the optimal strategies for septic patients is still difficult –. For instance, the "sepsis campaign" has updated evidence-based sepsis treatment guidelines over 20 years and is still changing due to new evidence. Because if different medical trial results have been reported for a similar treatment strategy due to the different patient group conditions, their findings tend to be less reliable. In this case, large-scale experiments with varied cohorts are required to ensure the reliability of the evidence. However, applying unstable treatments to large-scale patient groups is unethical because clinical trials must be conducted safely only for an inevitably small group of patients.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of emergency department discharge among patients with sepsis [^1126e2f6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Current sepsis treatment guidelines and quality metrics presume that emergency department (ED) patients with sepsis syndrome (defined as organ failure from a dysregulated host response to infection) will be admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Most studies of sepsis to date have focused on patients who were admitted to the hospital (likely more than 1.7 million annually in the US) or the subset of patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit. However, 1 study that applied objective clinical criteria for identifying patients with sepsis in the ED noted incidentally that a substantial fraction of such patients may be discharged from the ED for outpatient treatment.

Unlike for pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, validated risk scores, clinical trials, and guidelines are not available to guide outpatient disposition decisions for ED patients with sepsis. To our knowledge, the epidemiology of patients with sepsis who were discharged from the ED has not been previously investigated systematically. Consequently, the extent to which such discharges from the ED of patients with clinical sepsis reflect missed diagnoses, improper treatment judgments, patient preferences, or appropriate triage of low-risk patients to outpatient management is unclear. It is also unclear whether ED sepsis disposition is subject to disparities in patient sex or race and ethnicity or affected by nonclinical factors, such as ED busyness or physician practice style.

In the present study, we therefore investigated the prevalence, risk factors, practice variation, and outcomes for discharge to outpatient treatment among ED patients with sepsis. Specifically, we identified patient, clinician, and system factors that were associated with outpatient disposition and compared risk-adjusted 30-day mortality after the initial inpatient vs outpatient treatment assignment from the ED.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Insights into severe sepsis in older patients: from epidemiology to evidence-based management [^112KV6nH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 60% of patients who develop severe sepsis in the United States are ≥ 65 years of age, and the incidence of sepsis in this population is steadily increasing. Elderly individuals have an increased risk of developing sepsis, compared with younger patients, because of frequent comorbidities, institutionalization, declining performance status, and altered immune function. The clinical presentation of older patients with sepsis is often atypical, leading to a difficult and delayed diagnosis. Although increasing age appears to confer a high risk of death due to severe sepsis, recent evidence shows that many older patients respond well to selected interventions when the interventions are initiated in a timely fashion. Newly published clinical practice guidelines outline key recommendations regarding the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Clinicians must be aware of the level of evidence in support of various interventions and must keenly screen older survivors for ongoing deficits that will limit their functional recovery.

### Sepsis: frontiers in diagnosis, resuscitation and antibiotic therapy [^111DfKM6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a major growing global burden and a major challenge to intensive care clinicians, researchers, guideline committee members and policy makers, because of its high and increasing incidence and great pathophysiological, molecular, genetic and clinical complexity. In spite of recent progress, short-term mortality remains high and there is growing evidence of long-term morbidity and increased long-term mortality in survivors of sepsis both in developed and developing countries. Further improvement in the care of patients with sepsis will impact upon global health. In this narrative review, invited experts describe the expected challenges and progress to be made in the near future. We focus on diagnosis, resuscitation (fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, blood transfusion and hemodynamic targets) and infection (antibiotics and infection biomarkers), as these areas are key, if initial management and subsequent outcomes are to be improved in patients with sepsis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^1123c9fG]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

Design

A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.

Conclusions

Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117UUHPH]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D636) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: 1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times? 2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated? 3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice? 4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock? 5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality? and 6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — empiric and targeted gram-negative coverage in adults with sepsis or septic shock: For high risk for multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, "we suggest using two antimicrobials with gram-negative coverage for empiric treatment over one gram-negative agent" (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence); for low risk for MDR organisms, "we suggest against using two gram-negative agents for empiric treatment, compared with one gram-negative agent" (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence); once pathogen and susceptibilities are known, "we suggest against using double gram-negative coverage" (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Rationale notes that "the initial use of multidrug therapy is often required to ensure the empiric regimen includes at least one effective agent that is active against the offending organism", and that in the empiric phase choice depends on "the local prevalence of resistant organisms, patient risk factors for resistant organisms, and the severity of illness".

### Sepsis: an update in management [^116m6dEG]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hospitalists are a critical link in providing evidence-based care for patients with sepsis across the disease spectrum, from early recognition to recovery. The past decade of sepsis research has led to significant findings that will change clinical practice for hospital medicine practitioners. Although the incidence of severe sepsis in the United States has continued to rise, in-hospital mortality has declined. Management of the spectrum of sepsis disorders is no longer restricted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This review article will provide an update in the management of sepsis for hospitalists based on recently published pivotal studies. The expanding evidence base in sepsis includes early goal-directed therapy/clinical endpoints/sepsis bundles, antibiotics and source control, volume resuscitation, ICU considerations (including the use of insulin and corticosteroids), mortality/complications, and the newly recognized condition of "sepsis survivorship".

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^111Dk1ff]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis antimicrobials — timing and spectrum: We support early antibiotics once sepsis is diagnosed or deemed likely, with the strongest support for initial intravenous antibiotics in those with suspected diagnosis of septic shock — that is, patients with infection and any hypotension or hypoperfusion; shorter time to antibiotics is preferred, but the precise time frame to optimally support outcomes remains to be defined, and antivirals are less clearly time sensitive in the earliest phases of disease. For sepsis patients without an identified pathogen, we recommend initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria according to local susceptibility patterns. Most sepsis patients receive initial doses of antimicrobials in the ED prior to the availability of culture results, and clinicians should base the initial selection of antimicrobials on the most likely and most harmful potential pathogens rather than targeting a specific pathogen, unless the clinical presentation directs such a focused approach; narrow-spectrum therapy is uncommon and should not be anticipated in usual practice. Whereas some data suggest that an earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with better survival, other data suggest that small variations in the timing of a first dose of antibiotics are not associated with mortality differences; we agree that once the diagnosis of sepsis is established, rapid and comprehensive therapy — not just antibiotic administration — is optimal, but the current data do not recommend a singular time.

### Prehospital treatment of sepsis: what really makes the "golden hour" golden? [^117D3DGK]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The early recognition of severe sepsis is important; however, early identification of severe sepsis can be challenging, especially in the prehospital setting. As previous research has shown, advanced notification of time-sensitive disease states by prehospital personnel can improve outcomes and time to initiation of treatments. Prehospital personnel can potentially impact outcomes in sepsis through early identification and treatment implementations, improving processes of care and transition of care. Further research is needed for a full evaluation of prehospital treatment effects of identification of sepsis and treatment by prehospital personnel and the impact on outcomes.

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Management of sepsis in hospitalized patients [^112onkXQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is the leading cause of death worldwide. Mortality has improved in the past few decades but remains high, and survivors frequently have long-term complications. Initial diagnostic evaluation focuses on risk stratification and source and pathogen identification. Treatment includes intravenous fluids, vasopressors, steroids if shock is present, antimicrobial therapy targeting the most likely source of infection, and source control. Patients with shock or high-risk organ failure syndromes should be admitted early to an intensive care unit. After initial antimicrobials and resuscitation, care should focus on antimicrobial deescalation, volume management, and high-quality supportive care. Shared decision making about goals of care and transitions is important to support survivors after discharge.

### The need for change in generating evidence for the critically ill [^11469E94]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Critical illness often represents a turning point in patients' journeys. Sepsis, one of the main drivers of critical illness, is the leading cause of death worldwide. The last edition of the sepsis management international guidelines has 93 statements, most recommendations having low or very low quality of evidence. Randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for evidence generation, but the costs, time, and resources needed to test all the recommendations using traditional trials could take decades and cost billions of dollars.

### Surviving sepsis in low-income and middle-income countries: new directions for care and research [^116YrY1d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a disorder characterised by systemic inflammation secondary to infection. Despite recent progress in the understanding and treatment of sepsis, no data or recommendations exist that detail effective approaches to sepsis care in resource-limited low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although few data exist on the burden of sepsis in LMICs, the prevalence of HIV and other comorbid conditions in some LMICs suggest that sepsis is a substantial contributor to mortality in these regions. In well-resourced countries, sepsis management relies on protocols and complex invasive technologies not widely available in most LMICs. However, the key concepts and components of sepsis management are potentially translatable to resource-limited environments. Health personnel in LMICs should be educated in the recognition of sepsis and the importance of early and appropriate antibiotic use. Simple and low-cost standardised laboratory testing should be emphasised to allow accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment response. Evidence-based interventions and treatment algorithms tailored to LMIC ecology and resources should thus be developed and validated.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

### A systematic review of the effect of delayed appropriate antibiotic treatment on the outcomes of patients with severe bacterial infections [^115k16Na]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with severe bacterial infections often experience delay in receiving appropriate treatment. Consolidated evidence of the impact of delayed appropriate treatment is needed to guide treatment and improve outcomes.

Research Question

What is the impact of delayed appropriate antibacterial therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with severe bacterial infections?

Study Design and Methods

Literature searches of MEDLINE and Embase, conducted on July 24, 2018, identified studies published after 2007 reporting the impact of delayed appropriate therapy on clinical outcomes for hospitalized adult patients with bacterial infections. Where appropriate, results were pooled and analyzed with delayed therapy modeled three ways: delay vs no delay in receiving appropriate therapy; duration of delay; and inappropriate vs appropriate initial therapy. This article reports meta-analyses on the effect of delay and duration of delay.

Results

The eligibility criteria were met by 145 studies, of which 37 contributed data to analyses of effect of delay. Mortality was significantly lower in patients receiving appropriate therapy without delay compared with those experiencing delay (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.72). Mortality was also lower in the no-delay group compared with the delay group in subgroups of studies reporting mortality at 20 to 30 days, during ICU stay, or in patients with bacteremia (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.43–0.76]; OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.27–0.80]; and OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.40–0.75], respectively). No difference was found in time to appropriate therapy between those who died and those who survived (P = 0.09), but heterogeneity between studies was high.

Interpretation

Avoiding delayed appropriate therapy is essential to reduce mortality in patients with severe bacterial infections.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America position paper: recommended revisions to the national severe sepsis and septic shock early management bundle (SEP-1) sepsis quality measure [^116Nh8HK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure has appropriately established sepsis as a national priority. However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA and five additional endorsing societies) is concerned about SEP-1's potential to drive antibiotic overuse because it does not account for the high rate of sepsis overdiagnosis and encourages aggressive antibiotics for all patients with possible sepsis, regardless of the certainty of diagnosis or severity of illness. IDSA is also concerned that SEP-1's complex "time zero" definition is not evidence-based and is prone to inter-observer variation. In this position paper, IDSA outlines several recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of unintended consequences of SEP-1 while maintaining focus on its evidence-based elements. IDSA's core recommendation is to limit SEP-1 to septic shock, for which the evidence supporting the benefit of immediate antibiotics is greatest. Prompt empiric antibiotics are often appropriate for suspected sepsis without shock, but IDSA believes there is too much heterogeneity and difficulty defining this population, uncertainty about the presence of infection, and insufficient data on the necessity of immediate antibiotics to support a mandatory treatment standard for all patients in this category. IDSA believes guidance on managing possible sepsis without shock is more appropriate for guidelines that can delineate the strengths and limitations of supporting evidence and allow clinicians discretion in applying specific recommendations to individual patients. Removing sepsis without shock from SEP-1 will mitigate the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for noninfectious syndromes, simplify data abstraction, increase measure reliability, and focus attention on the population most likely to benefit from immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^1115wEis]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

New research results

Appropriate antibiotic therapy

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Paul and colleagues found a pooled odds ratio of appropriate antibiotic therapy during the first 48 hours for all-cause mortality of 1.60 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.86), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 10 (95% CI 8 to 15). Kumar and colleagues found a time-dependent mortality with a 7.6% decrease in survival for each hour of antibiotic delay in patients with sepsis.

Timing of antimicrobial therapy

Some recently published investigations supported the findings by Kumar and colleagues (Table 3). Ferrer and colleagues presented a retrospective analysis of a large dataset collected prospectively. In total, 28,150 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock from 165 ICUs in Europe, the US, and South America were included. Of them, 17,990 patients received antibiotics after identification of sepsis, and the in-hospital mortality was 29.7%. After 1 hour, hospital mortality steadily increased with a delay in antibiotic timing. The adjusted hospital mortality odds ratios steadily increased from 1.00 to 1.52 as time to antibiotic administration increased from 0 to greater than 6 hours where 0 to 1 hour was the reference group. The probability of mortality increased from 24.6% to 33.1% (P < 0.001). However, critics stated that, owing to a lack of information on antibiotic appropriateness and focus control, this study was limited.

### Association of registered nurse staffing with mortality risk of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis [^111EfkQy]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis develops when the body's response to an infection becomes dysregulated and organ dysfunction ensues. Sepsis is a major health problem in the US, and there are more than 1.7 million cases of sepsis diagnosed annually. In addition, sepsis is a leading cause of death, and it has been identified as one of the most expensive conditions treated by hospitals nationwide. Among Medicare beneficiaries, sepsis-related mortality and the costs associated with the inpatient and outpatient treatment of sepsis continue to escalate.

The treatment of sepsis has evolved substantially during the last 20 years. The first standard treatment for sepsis resulted in what has been termed early goal-directed therapy. With the increase in evidence-based treatment strategies for sepsis, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign was launched, which represented a collaborative effort between the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, Society of Critical Care Medicine, International Sepsis Forum, and Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Since its inception, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has published and updated clinical practice guidelines, including bundles of care that outline actions to be completed within a specific period after a patient receives a diagnosis of sepsis.

### Practical considerations in sepsis resuscitation [^115d89JC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department, and the majority of patients respond to resuscitation measures, including antibiotics and i.v. fluids. However, a proportion of patients will fail to respond to standard treatment.

Objective

This review elucidates practical considerations for management of sepsis in patients who fail to respond to standard treatment.

Discussion

Early goal-directed therapy revolutionized sepsis management. However, there is a paucity of literature that provides a well-defined treatment algorithm for patients who fail to improve with therapy. Refractory shock can be defined as continued patient hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure, ≤ 65 mm Hg, lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, altered mental status) after adequate fluid loading (at least 30 mL/kg i.v.), the use of two vasopressors (with one as norepinephrine), and provision of antibiotics. When a lack of improvement is evident in the early stages of resuscitation, systematically considering source control, appropriate volume resuscitation, adequate antimicrobial coverage, vasopressor selection, presence of metabolic pathology, and complications of resuscitation, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure, allow emergency physicians to address the entire clinical scenario.

Conclusions

The care of sepsis has experienced many changes in recent years. Care of the patient with sepsis who is not responding appropriately to initial resuscitation is troublesome for emergency physicians. This review provides practical considerations for resuscitation of the patient with septic shock. When a septic patient is refractory to standard therapy, systematically evaluating the patient and clinical course may lead to improved outcomes.

### Factors and outcomes associated with under-and overdiagnosis of sepsis in the first hour of emergency department care [^1115sEoR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Sepsis is a life‐threatening, heterogeneous syndrome with a significant medical burden. As the third leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals, sepsis impacts around 1.7 million people annually. Hospitalizations for sepsis are alarmingly common and deadly, with incidences ranging from 28.9 to 121.3 per 1000 hospitalizationsand an estimated mortality rate of 26.7%. As the most expensive inpatient condition in the United States, sepsis not only affects patients but also places a substantial burden on health care resources.

The diagnosis of sepsis is challenging due to its complex and often nonspecific clinical presentation. Certain groups experience disparities in sepsis management and outcomes. Furthermore, sepsis misdiagnosis may be influenced by various clinical characteristics. Diagnostic errors in sepsis, including both under‐ and overdiagnosis, can lead to delayed treatment or unnecessary interventions, adversely affecting patient outcomes. Timely recognition and accurate diagnosis of sepsis are crucial, as studies show a substantial increase in mortality with each hour of delay in administration of antibiotics, potentially as high as 7% per hour, starting as soon as 1 h after recognizing sepsis. Practically, however, "sepsis recognition" remains a loose and poorly defined term, often defined retrospectively based on the decision to order blood cultures or antibiotics. The lack of a clear definition impedes progress toward improving time to antibiotic administration in the patients who need it most. The risks of diagnostic delays, however, must be weighed against both antibiotic stewardship and logistic considerations, which have been incompletely addressed to date.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^114rakAt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built upon a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along 5 levels to create recommendation grades from A-E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Participants

Participants included 44 critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations.

Results

A total of 46 recommendations plus pediatric management considerations.

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that will hopefully translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually, and even more rapidly when some important new knowledge becomes available.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

Antimicrobial clinical guidance for managing sepsis in resource-limited settings should recognize that

When there is a high likelihood of sepsis or septic shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within one hour.
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, where investigations (such as laboratory or imaging) to exclude a non–infectious cause of acute illness are not readily available and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered without delay.
Administration of antiparasitic agents should not be delayed in patients with suspicion of sepsis of parasitic origin.
In patients with sepsis and where the source has been adequately controlled, clinical improvement with an improving trend in white blood cell count can be used to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Providing appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is central to improving outcomes. However, in resource-limited settings, achieving this goal must be balanced against providing other aspects of care, especially to the sickest patients. Providing timely antimicrobial therapy should also be balanced with concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance where infections are commonly caused by resistant organisms and empiric therapy is likely to include broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the World Health Assembly recognises the need to promote 'judicious use of antimicrobials' in sepsis management, how best to do this in patients with sepsis is unclear and likely will need significant improvements in both diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. The WHO's global research agenda for antimicrobial resistance includes research priorities of context-specific optimization of antimicrobial stewardship and empiric antimicrobial regimens and new rapid point-of-care diagnostics which would be of great value in addressing this complex issue.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — source control timing and approach in sepsis and septic shock specifies that source control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation. Smaller studies suggest that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous, and studies generally show reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to show benefit with source control implemented in less than 6 hours may be a consequence of the limited number of patients and the heterogeneity of the intervention. Any required source control intervention should ideally be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the diagnosis is made, and prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised. In general, the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control should be pursued; open surgical intervention should be considered when other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion; surgical exploration may also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists; and logistic factors unique to each institution may also play a role in the decision.

### Appropriate antibiotic therapy [^116SMsfR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics is an essential component of initial therapy in sepsis. Early antibiotics are an important component of therapy, but speed of administration should not overshadow the patient-specific characteristics that determine the optimal breadth of antimicrobial therapy. Cultures should be drawn before antibiotic therapy if it does not significantly delay administration. Combination antibiotic therapy against gram-negative infections is not routinely required, and combination therapy involving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is associated with an increase in acute kidney injury. Emergency practitioners should be aware of special considerations in the administration and dosing of antibiotics in order to deliver optimal care to septic patients.

### The prognostic utility of protein C as a biomarker for adult sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115psTom]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rationale

Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. With 48.9 million sepsis cases and 11 million sepsis-related deaths in 2017, the disease has a mortality rate of approximately 22% and represents 19.7% of deaths worldwide. To address the high mortality rate, the Surviving Sepsis campaign emphasizes the importance of early therapeutic interventions and improved screening for high-risk patients.

Diagnosing early-stage sepsis and identifying those at high-risk for mortality remain a challenge due to the disease's heterogeneous presentation. Sepsis presentation and outcome are affected by multiple factors, including patient characteristics, the causative microorganism and the site of infection. While the current Sepsis-3 definition uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale to diagnose patients, the use of a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarker could aid timely and appropriate treatment. In addition, the use of SOFA and quick SOFA (qSOFA), as risk stratification models, is limited by low specificity, and the sensitivity and specificity of qSOFA have been shown to vary widely across studies. These limitations drive the need for a new rapid and sensitive diagnostic and prognostic test.

### Sepsis: pathophysiology and clinical management [^114vEDrH]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock represent increasingly severe systemic inflammatory responses to infection. Sepsis is common in the aging population, and it disproportionately affects patients with cancer and underlying immunosuppression. In its most severe form, sepsis causes multiple organ dysfunction that can produce a state of chronic critical illness characterized by severe immune dysfunction and catabolism. Much has been learnt about the pathogenesis of sepsis at the molecular, cell, and intact organ level. Despite uncertainties in hemodynamic management and several treatments that have failed in clinical trials, investigational therapies increasingly target sepsis induced organ and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in sepsis have greatly improved overall, probably because of an enhanced focus on early diagnosis and fluid resuscitation, the rapid delivery of effective antibiotics, and other improvements in supportive care for critically ill patients. These improvements include lung protective ventilation, more judicious use of blood products, and strategies to reduce nosocomial infections.

### Hospital-onset sepsis warrants expanded investigation and consideration as a unique clinical entity [^111hfjGV]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis causes more than a quarter million deaths among hospitalized adults in the United States each year. Although most cases of sepsis are present on admission, up to one-quarter of patients with sepsis develop this highly morbid and mortal condition while hospitalized. Compared with patients with community-onset sepsis (COS), patients with hospital-onset sepsis (HOS) are twice as likely to require mechanical ventilation and ICU admission, have more than two times longer ICU and hospital length of stay, accrue five times higher hospital costs, and are twice as likely to die. Patients with HOS differ from those with COS with respect to underlying comorbidities, admitting diagnosis, clinical manifestations of infection, and severity of illness. Despite the differences between these patient populations, patients with HOS sepsis are understudied and warrant expanded investigation. Here, we outline important knowledge gaps in the recognition and management of HOS in adults and propose associated research priorities for investigators. Of particular importance are questions regarding standardization of research and clinical case identification, understanding of clinical heterogeneity among patients with HOS, development of tailored management recommendations, identification of impactful prevention strategies, optimization of care delivery and quality metrics, identification and correction of disparities in care and outcomes, and how to ensure goal-concordant care for patients with HOS.

Initial empiric treatment and combination therapy

Given the high prevalence of sepsis and septic shock, intensivists frequently face the decision of initiating antibiotic therapy and selecting the appropriate regimen. Empiric therapy is started when an infection is suspected before microbiology results are available. Once the pathogen has been identified and susceptibility testing performed, the empiric regimen can be tailored to directed or definitive therapy. Concordant therapy refers to an antibiotic choice that is active against the isolated bacterium(a) based on in vitro susceptibility testing. In the ICU, recognizing an infectious process is crucial. No absolute constellation of signs and symptoms or tests can unequivocally diagnose sepsis, thus clinicians must rely on the available clinical information and decide under uncertainty if empiric antibiotics will be beneficial or harmful. Typical symptoms can suggest an infectious syndrome, but older patients with multiple comorbidities often present ambiguously, with a wider differential diagnosis and higher mortality absent appropriate treatment. Up to a third of patients with presumed sepsis may ultimately have a sepsis mimic and potentially experience harm from broad-spectrum antibiotics. Critically ill patients have higher sepsis prevalence than non-ICU patients, therefore increasing the pretest probability of life-threatening infection.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) SEP-1 measures recommend immediate antibiotics — typically broad spectrum with MRSA and pseudomonal coverage — within 1 to 3 hours of sepsis recognition. Kumar et al described that each hour of delay in starting antibiotics led to a 7.6% decrease in survival for patients with septic shock. Other studies, examining timely antibiotic administration alone or as part of a sepsis care bundle, supported these findings, with the greatest benefit of early antibiotic initiation in patients with septic shock. Seymour et al.'s study of 50,000 patients treated for sepsis found that the 7% increased hourly risk of death was not present in those not requiring vasopressors. This differentiation led IDSA to caution against blanket recommendations for Rapid antibiotics in all sepsis cases, favoring a Rapid evaluation within the first 3−5 hours. This way, uninfected patients may be protected from the side effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Even in critically ill patients suspected of having a hospital-acquired infection, too rapid initiation of antibiotics in the absence of shock can result in adverse consequences, including higher mortality.

### Impact of the timeliness of antibiotic therapy on the outcome of patients with sepsis and septic shock [^1179S4Jw]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review the impact of the timeliness of antibiotic therapy on the outcome of patients with sepsis or septic shock.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Open-SIGLE databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials on July 27, 2020 for relevant studies on the timing of antibiotic therapy in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock. The primary outcome measure was all-cause crude or adjusted mortality at reported time points.

Results

We included 35 sepsis studies involving 154,330 patients. Nineteen studies (54%) provided information on the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy in 20,062 patients of whom 16,652 patients (83%) received appropriate antibiotics. Twenty-four studies (68.6%) reported an association between time-to-antibiotics and mortality. Time thresholds associated with patient's outcome varied considerably between studies consisting of a wide range of time cutoffs (1 h, 125 min, 3 h or 6 h) in 14 studies, hourly delays (derived from the analyses of time intervals ranging from to 1 to 24 h) in 8 studies or time-to-antibiotic in 2 studies. Analyses of subsets of studies that focused on patients with septic shock (11 studies, 12,756 patients) or with sepsis (6 studies, 24,281 patients) yielded similar results.

Conclusions

While two-thirds of sepsis studies reported an association between early administration of antibiotic therapy and patient outcome, the time-to-antibitiocs metrics varied significantly across studies and no robust time thresholds emerged.

Conclusion

Using a Delphi method, experts reached consensus for 30 statements from which 23 expert clinical practice statements were derived for the management of sepsis in resource-limited settings. These addressed important clinical decisions for patient management worldwide, in areas where evidence is lacking. These clinical practice statements complement current global guidelines by providing additional guidance for management of a critically ill patient with sepsis while awaiting an ICU bed, safe patient transfer and specific considerations related to the type of infection seen in some resource-limited settings. Future research is needed to assess the feasibility, adoption and effects of these practice statements and address the remaining uncertainties.

### Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU [^111GiBm6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Timing of appropriate therapy — septic shock

Although controversy persists regarding many aspects of care for septic patients, nearly all agree that timely and appropriate antibiotic treatment is a necessary first step to insure good outcomes (Fig. 2). Interest in the issue of appropriate antibiotic treatment arose over two decades ago. For example, Kumar and colleagues documented that for each hour delay in the administration of appropriate antibiotic(s) the patient's risk for death increased substantially. These authors demonstrated that for every hour's delay until appropriate antibiotic administration led to a more than 10% increase in crude mortality. Specifically, if one did not begin appropriate therapy within 1 h of shock, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality increased from 1.67 in hour 2 to 92.54 with delays > 36 h. Subsequent analyses examining the value of care bundles in sepsis confirmed the crucial importance of timely antimicrobials and source control. A review of over 1000 patients with septic shock arising from Gram-negative pathogens revealed that inappropriate antibiotic therapy (identified based on the failure to administer an in vitro active antibiotic within six hours) independently increased the risk for mortality nearly fourfold.

### Survey of adherence to sepsis care bundles in six European countries shows low adherence and possible patient risk [^115e5HSK]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which globally claims more lives than cancer. A set of evidence-based clinical practices (sepsis bundles) have been developed to guide early diagnosis and rapid intervention, which are vital to patient survival; however, their use is not widely adopted. A cross-sectional survey was administered in June-July 2022 to understand healthcare practitioner (HCP) knowledge of and adherence to sepsis bundles and identify key barriers to adherence in the UK, France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark and Norway; a total of n = 368 HCPs ultimately participated. The results showed that among HCPs, overall awareness of sepsis and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment is high. However, there are indications that adherence to sepsis bundles is well below the standard of care: when asked which steps providers carry out to treat sepsis, only 44% report carrying out all steps in the bundle; and 66% of providers agreed that delays in sepsis diagnosis occur sometimes where they work. This survey also highlighted the possible barriers which are impeding the implementation of optimal sepsis care: particularly high patient caseload and staff shortages. This research highlights important gaps and obstacles in reaching optimal care of sepsis in the surveyed countries. There is a need for healthcare leaders and policy-makers alike to advocate for increased funding for more staff and training to address existing knowledge gaps and improve patient outcomes.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^114XrJKL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2017, sepsis was estimated to be responsible for 49 million cases with 11 million associated deaths globally. Eighty-five percent of sepsis cases and resultant deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) particularly in Africa, Asia and South America. Many cases occur in vulnerable and underserved populations. Improving detection and appropriate management of sepsis in such settings are high priorities to reduce the global burden of sepsis.

The World Health Assembly Resolution (70.7) on 'Improving the Diagnosis and Management of Sepsis' specifically recommends that Member States should establish guidelines and capability for effective sepsis diagnosis and management. The most widely used guidelines globally are focussed primarily on high-income settings. A 2019 survey in the Asia Pacific Region showed over 80% of middle-income countries in the region used the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines. However, multiple studies highlight the difficulties in implementing non-contextualised guidelines in resource-limited settings.

Limited resources may be a significant factor impeding the implementation of sepsis guidelines in LMICs, but there may also be other important contextual factors that restrict applicability of international guidelines. For example, there are differences in disease aetiology, comorbidities and case-mix of sepsis populations, necessitating different management strategies. Additionally, international guidelines do not address the safe management of critically ill patients with sepsis in the absence of an intensives care unit (ICU) beds, when factors such as the location for management, minimum monitoring, triggers for escalation of care and safe transport are important.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is aiming to use the best available evidence to generate recommendations for management of sepsis which can support national programs around the world. However, high quality research on sepsis management in resource-limited settings is lacking. Therefore, to complement existing guidelines, we conducted a Delphi study among global experts in sepsis management representing diverse geographical and income settings, with the aim of generating consensus on strategies for management of sepsis in resource-limited settings where barriers to the effective implementation of current international guidelines exist or where guidance for specific sepsis management issues relevant in these settings is lacking.

### Sepsis: personalization V protocolization? [^113H2WS4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Crucially, every prospective study specifically addressing the question of antibiotic delay and outcome fails to show a temporal relationship between early antibiotics and improved survival. What support there is derives from heavily adjusted retrospective analyses of incomplete databases usually collected for other reasons. Even then, the findings are inconsistent. Reasons for delay in delivering antibiotic treatment have also not been ascertained and may be highly pertinent. For example, Filbin et al. recently reported that a third of patients presenting to an emergency department with septic shock had vague symptoms not specific to infection and this represents a previously unrecognized confounder. Notably, a recent paper surveying deaths in six US hospitals found sepsis was present in half the cases and a direct cause of death in a third, yet only 3.7% of the sepsis-associated deaths were adjudged definitely or moderately preventable.

There are other examples of a rigid, protocolized approach not yielding outcome dividends. Patients in three prospective multicentre studies assessing the Rivers Early Goal-Directed Therapy strategy failed to show any benefit over standard-of-care. Multicentre trials in African adults and children with sepsis showed worse outcomes when applying a Western-based protocolized approach to management, perhaps related to a logistic inability to deal with iatrogenic complications induced by the approach.

In summary, guidelines are valuable as an aide memoire, but the evidence that strict protocols that demand homogenized management result in outcome benefit is weak at best. Excessive delay is not warranted and, perhaps analogous to managing haemorrhage, the speed of response in an individual septic patient is likely best dictated by their severity. Logically, treatment should be tailored to meet the individual's needs and underlying comorbidities.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112R6UXA]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Insights and Implications — In summary, when sepsis is definite or probable and regardless of the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. In a patient with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should also be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. If sepsis is possible and shock is absent, then the patient should be rapidly assessed for an infectious versus a noninfectious cause of acute illness, including obtaining a history and physical examination, testing for infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness, and treating acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Ideally, assessment should be completed within 3 hours of presentation and antimicrobials should be administered within that time if the likelihood of infection is thought to be high.

### Role of rapid diagnostics in diagnosis and management of patients with sepsis [^1159S4PV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Delayed administration of active anti-infective therapy is associated with increased rates of adverse events, mortality, and costs among sepsis patients. Inherent limitations of conventional culture identification methods and the lengthy turnaround time of antimicrobial susceptibility testing are significant barriers to the timely delivery of life-saving therapy, particularly among antibiotic-resistant infections. Culture-independent diagnostic techniques that detect pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes within clinical samples present a tremendous benefit to timely diagnosis and management of patients. Improved outcomes for rapid intervention with rapid diagnostics have been documented and include decreased mortality rates, decreased health care delivery costs, and faster delivery of appropriate therapeutics.

The panel supports that these guidelines should constitute a general scheme of "best practice", but translation to treatment algorithms or bundles and standards of care will need to account for variation in the availability of local healthcare resources, and the panel acknowledges the need for future research to test adaptation to locally available resources.

### Management of septic shock: current concepts, with a particular emphasis on the role of source control, and future perspectives [^114Z56bd]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Sepsis is an infection-induced syndrome characterized by a generalized inflammatory state. The normal reaction to infection involves a series of complex immunological processes. A potent, complex immunological cascade ensures a prompt protective response to microbial invasion in human beings. Although activation of the immune system during microbial invasion is generally protective, septic shock develops in a number of patients as a consequence of excessive or poorly regulated immune response to the offending organism. This unbalanced reaction may harm the host through a maladaptive release of endogenously generated inflammatory compounds. Early recognition of the syndrome is of key importance to promptly start appropriate management. Timely, aggressive resuscitation to preserve organ function remains a fundamental principle in the care of septic patients. The specific treatment is directed at identifying and treating the underlying disorder. The physician should investigate diligently for the presence of active infection using modern imaging methods and other diagnostic studies to localize the site of infection and to obtain adequate culture specimens from potential infective sources. Early administration of appropriate, effective antibiotic therapy is important in the management of septic patients. Infected fluid collections and/or infected necrotic tissues should be drained or debrided without delay. Adequate nutritional support is indicated in the management of the septic patient. A number of adjuvant therapies, aimed at blunting/downregulating the host immune response to bacterial infection are currently under intensive investigation; however, the complexity of immunological defences and the potential for complementary interaction of the different components of the inflammatory cascade make the development of these pharmacological interventions difficult.

### Non-antibiotic strategies for sepsis [^113a4ft4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock remain a considerable therapeutic challenge. Despite significant advances in supportive care and the availability of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics, the overall mortality due to sepsis is still approximately 35%, and this increases to 60% if patients develop septic shock. Antibiotics constitute a necessary part of the treatment of sepsis, and there is probably considerable scope to improve the way in which they are used. Nevertheless, antibiotics alone, even used optimally, are probably not sufficient to substantially reduce the mortality that accompanies the multiorgan failure that occurs in septic patients. For this reason, considerable efforts have been expended in developing non-antibiotic (or so-called adjunctive) forms of treatment, and here the general approaches to these types of treatment are reviewed. There are three main categories: improvements in supportive care, treatments aimed at bacterial virulence factors, and treatments aimed at host mediators. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review, but rather to provide examples in each category to illustrate the general principles-and the hurdles-that have characterized these approaches to therapy.

Reducing risk You can take specific steps to reduce your risk of sepsis. Keep ReadingPreventing Infections That Can Lead to Sepsis. Diagnosis Sepsis is diagnosed through a medical assessment performed by a healthcare provider. They diagnose sepsis using physical findings, such as:

- Fever
- Increased heart rate
- Low blood pressure
- Trouble breathing Healthcare providers also perform tests that check for signs of infection or organ damage. Some of these tests are used to identify the germ that caused the infection that led to sepsis. This testing might include blood cultures looking for bacterial infections, fungal infections, or tests for viral infections, like influenza. Healthcare providers should immediately evaluate and treat people who might have sepsis.

Treatment Research shows that rapid, effective sepsis treatment includes:

- Giving appropriate treatment, including antibiotics, as soon as possible
- Maintaining blood flow to organs Sometimes surgery is required to remove tissue damaged by the infection. Healthcare providers should treat sepsis as soon as possible. What to know about antibiotics Antimicrobial resistance Antibiotics are critical tools for treating infections, including those that can lead to sepsis. However, anytime antibiotics are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs, like bacteria and fungi, develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant germs can be difficult, or impossible to treat.

Antibiotic stewardship Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to improve antibiotic use so that antibiotics are prescribed and used when they provide a clear benefit. Improving the way healthcare providers prescribe antibiotics and the way we take antibiotics helps keep us healthy, fights antimicrobial resistance, and ensures that these life-saving drugs will work when they are needed most, such as for treating infections that can lead to sepsis.

### About sepsis… [^112c9Xy6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Research shows that rapid, effective sepsis treatment includes:

- Giving appropriate treatment, including antibiotics, as soon as possible
- Maintaining blood flow to organs Sometimes surgery is required to remove tissue damaged by the infection. Healthcare providers should treat sepsis as soon as possible. What to know about antibiotics Antimicrobial resistance Antibiotics are critical tools for treating infections, including those that can lead to sepsis. However, anytime antibiotics are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs, like bacteria and fungi, develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant germs can be difficult, or impossible to treat.

Side effects Antibiotic side effects range from minor, such as rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea and yeast infections, to very severe health problems, such as life-threatening allergic reactions or C. difficile infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to colon damage or death. However, when antibiotics are needed, the benefits outweigh the risks of side effects or antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic stewardship Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to improve antibiotic use so that antibiotics are prescribed and used when they provide a clear benefit. Improving the way healthcare providers prescribe antibiotics and the way we take antibiotics helps keep us healthy, fights antimicrobial resistance, and ensures that these life-saving drugs will work when they are needed most, such as for treating infections that can lead to sepsis.
