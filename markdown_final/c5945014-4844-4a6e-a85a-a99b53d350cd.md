## Question

What does positive ANA titer with nuclear dense fine speckled mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a positive ANA with a dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the DFS pattern on HEp-2 immunofluorescence actually represents. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies and how often they occur in health versus disease. Next, I will consider how titer modifies interpretation. After that, I need to check for confounders and mixed patterns that could change the meaning. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise clinical approach and synthesize a bottom-line interpretation with appropriate counseling and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the pattern biology. The dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern on HEp-2 indirect immunofluorescence corresponds to antibodies against DFS70, also known as LEDGF (lens epithelium-derived growth factor), and is typically reported as an AC-2 pattern in ICAP nomenclature, which helps standardize pattern recognition across laboratories [^117QHf2V] [^114L966E] [^112Rf9s5].

> Now, I should review the clinical significance. Wait, let me verify the key point: isolated anti-DFS70 is generally a low-specificity finding that is more common in healthy individuals than in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD), and its presence tends to reduce the likelihood of SARD when no other disease-specific autoantibodies are present. Multiple studies show anti-DFS70 in roughly 2–22% of healthy ANA-positive individuals but in less than 1% of SARD patients when monospecific, supporting a negative association with SARD and a role in avoiding overdiagnosis and unnecessary workups [^117QHf2V] [^115dcECm] [^114hCWHV].

> Hold on, I should verify how titer influences interpretation. High titers alone do not convert DFS into a disease-specific signal; even titers ≥ 1:640 are frequently seen in individuals without SARD, so titer height by itself should not be over-weighted when the pattern is DFS and no other specific autoantibodies are detected. In children, the positive predictive value of ANA for autoimmune disease rises with higher titers overall, but the DFS pattern remains comparatively low in predictive value compared with homogeneous or speckled patterns, reinforcing caution in overinterpreting DFS even at higher titers [^114L966E] [^113nzsFy].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing confounders. Let me consider exceptions: anti-DFS70 can occasionally coexist with SARD-specific antibodies (for example, anti-SSA or anti-dsDNA), in which case the DFS pattern does not "exclude" disease; it simply means the DFS finding itself is nonspecific and must be interpreted in the context of the full autoantibody profile. Also, DFS positivity has been reported in settings of immune activation such as COVID-19 and in some malignancies, so clinical context matters and mixed patterns should prompt careful review rather than premature closure [^117QHf2V] [^1167Jnrj].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical approach. First, confirm the DFS pattern visually or with appropriate automated systems and document the titer. Then, reflex to a targeted ENA panel and dsDNA testing to look for disease-specific antibodies; if the ENA/dsDNA screen is negative and the clinical picture is low suspicion, the likelihood of SARD is low and further invasive testing is usually unnecessary. If clinical suspicion remains high despite isolated DFS, consider anti-DFS70 monospecific confirmation and, if needed, immunoadsorption to clarify whether other specificities are masked. In children, given the higher background ANA positivity, avoid overtesting unless there are clear rheumatic features, and remember that DFS in pediatrics still carries relatively low diagnostic yield for SARD [^116ANVmX] [^117QHf2V] [^113nzsFy].

> But wait, what if the ANA was ordered for nonspecific symptoms like fatigue or arthralgia without inflammatory signs? I should double-check pretest probability because ANA positivity — including DFS — is not rare in healthy individuals and in nonrheumatic conditions, so indiscriminate testing can generate false positives and cascade harm. Guidelines emphasize not ordering ANA in the absence of clinical indicators of connective tissue disease and avoiding broad subserology panels unless guided by specific diagnostic hypotheses, which is especially pertinent when DFS appears in isolation [^113MEpFB] [^116WjkLc].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. A positive ANA with a DFS pattern most often reflects anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies that are typically nonspecific and frequently seen in healthy individuals; when isolated (no other SARD-specific autoantibodies), they substantially lower the probability of SARD and can help avert unnecessary referrals and treatments. High titer alone does not override this interpretation, and the key next step is to check for coexisting specific autoantibodies and correlate with the clinical picture before labeling the result as "positive for autoimmunity" or pursuing invasive diagnostics [^117QHf2V] [^114L966E] [^113nzsFy].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling and follow-up. I would explain to the patient that this DFS pattern is a common, low-specificity finding that usually does not indicate lupus or similar diseases when no other specific antibodies are present, and I would avoid implying disease without supportive clinical features. If the ENA/dsDNA screen is negative and the patient remains well, routine follow-up is reasonable; if new symptoms emerge, reassess clinically and repeat targeted testing rather than repeating ANA alone, since pattern and titer stability do not reliably track disease activity or evolution in the way that specific autoantibodies can [^117QHf2V] [^1145NKGp].

---

A positive ANA with a dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern most often reflects **anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies** [^117QHf2V] and is common in healthy individuals [^115dcECm]; it is typically a **low-specificity finding** [^113nzsFy] and not specific for systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) [^114hCWHV]. Isolated anti-DFS70 **reduces the likelihood of SARD** [^117QHf2V] and is especially useful in excluding autoimmune disease when no other specific autoantibodies are present [^114hCWHV]. Clinical correlation is essential; if symptoms or other autoantibodies are present, pursue targeted testing [^112PGT1D]; if isolated, avoid overtesting or overtreatment [^117QHf2V].

## Clinical significance of dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern

- **Anti-DFS70 antibodies**: The DFS pattern is most often due to anti-DFS70 (LEDGF) antibodies [^117QHf2V], which are common in healthy individuals and in ANA-positive people without SARD [^114L966E].

- **Low specificity for SARD**: Isolated anti-DFS70 is rarely seen in SARD [^117QHf2V] and is considered a low-specificity marker; its presence lowers the post-test probability of SARD [^117QHf2V].

- **Common in healthy individuals**: Anti-DFS70 is found in 2–22% of healthy ANA-positive individuals, versus < 1% in SARD, indicating a negative association with SARD [^117QHf2V] [^115dcECm].

- **Clinical utility**: Isolated anti-DFS70 can help exclude autoimmune disease in ANA-positive patients with nonspecific symptoms, reducing unnecessary testing and treatment [^117QHf2V] [^117UjdiD].

---

## Clinical associations and implications

- **Autoimmune thyroid disease**: Anti-DFS70 is more frequent in autoimmune thyroiditis and may coexist with thyroid autoantibodies [^114L966E] [^115dcECm].

- **Interstitial cystitis and other conditions**: Anti-DFS70 has been reported in interstitial cystitis, asthma, and some malignancies, but these links are not specific [^115dcECm].

- **Medication-induced ANA**: Certain drugs (e.g. procainamide) can induce ANA with various patterns, including DFS, so medication history is important [^114d6TCG].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

- **Confirm DFS pattern**: Use a specific anti-DFS70 assay (ELISA, chemiluminescence, or immunoadsorption) to confirm the pattern and exclude mixed specificities [^114hCWHV].

- **Clinical correlation**: Interpret results in the clinical context; isolated anti-DFS70 with no SARD features supports no further autoimmune workup [^117QHf2V].

- **Avoid unnecessary testing**: Do not order broad autoantibody panels if anti-DFS70 is isolated and symptoms are absent or nonspecific [^117QHf2V] [^117WDZbc].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess if new symptoms arise or if other autoantibodies appear, as isolated anti-DFS70 may evolve into mixed profiles in rare cases [^113MEpFB].

## Clinical significance of DFS pattern

| **Clinical context** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Isolated anti-DFS70, no SARD symptoms | Low likelihood of SARD | No further testing; reassure |
| Anti-DFS70 with other specific autoantibodies (e.g. dsDNA, SSA, RNP) | Possible SARD | Targeted testing and rheumatology referral |
| Anti-DFS70 with autoimmune thyroid disease | Common association | Monitor thyroid function |
| Medication-induced ANA | Review medications | Consider discontinuation if clinically indicated |

---

A positive ANA with a DFS pattern usually reflects anti-DFS70 and is **typically benign** [^117QHf2V]; isolated positivity should prompt reassurance rather than extensive autoimmune testing. Clinical correlation and selective testing are key to avoiding overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^113MEpFB].

### The clinical spectrum of antinuclear antibodies associated with the nuclear dense fine speckled immunofluorescence pattern [^114L966E]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Autoantibodies to lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) depict a distinctive nuclear dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern in the indirect immunofluorescence antinuclear antibody assay (IIF-ANA). Definition of the clinical spectrum associated with anti-LEDGF antibodies has been evolving over the last decade. We investigated the frequency, clinical spectrum, and immunologic specificity of the DFS pattern in a general clinical laboratory routine. METHODS. All serum samples entered for IIF-ANA determination within a 2 year period were examined for the DFS pattern. Positive samples with consistent clinical information were studied further by IIF with isotype-specific conjugate and immunoblot analysis.

Results

Among 13,641 ANA-positive samples, 5081 (37%) presented the DFS pattern. Within a 6 month nested period, there were 650 samples with DFS pattern, and consistent clinical data were available for 81 of these. DFS reactivity was mainly due to IgG. Most samples (86%) presented titer ≥ 1/640. Eighty of the 81 DFS samples reacted with a 75 kDa band that comigrated with the band elicited by the standard anti-LEDGF serum. Antibodies that were affinity-purified from the 75 kDa band reproduced the DFS pattern on IIF-ANA. The clinical spectrum associated with DFS reactivity included autoimmune diseases (39%) and an array of nonautoimmune conditions (61%). Among the autoimmune patients, over half presented evidence of autoimmune thyroiditis.

Conclusion

Anti-LEDGF/p75 antibodies are a common finding among ANA-positive individuals with no evidence of rheumatic autoimmune disease, and should be regarded as a low specificity finding even when in moderate or high titer.

### Differences in the clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies according to titers and patterns in children [^113nzsFy]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the differences in the clinical significance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) according to their titers and patterns in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases (AiD) in pediatric patients. Of the 2442 children who had undergone an ANA test, 473 (19.4%) were positive for ANA, of whom 33 (7.0%) were diagnosed with significant AiD. The positive predictive value (PPV) for significant AiD was considerably high on application of an ANA titer of ≥ 1:640, and the PPV of a dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern was significantly lower compared with those of speckled and homogenous patterns. The diagnostic value of ANA positivity for AiD is limited, and the clinical significance of the DFS pattern is relatively lower compared with that of other patterns, such as homogenous and speckled patterns, in children. It is necessary to approach the significance of ANA in children individually depending on titers and patterns.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of rare antinuclear antibody patterns [^115Exf9s]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

While some of the more frequent antinuclear (auto)antibodies (ANA) patterns such as homogenous nuclear staining have been extensively studied, the prevalence and clinical significance of rare antinuclear antibody patterns are not well understood. For the purpose of this review, we defined rare patterns as patterns occurring in less than 1% of patients that test positive on indirect immunofluorescence. The prevalence of different ANA patterns was determined in 68,128 consecutive patients who attended the outpatient clinic or were hospitalized at the University Hospitals Leuven over a 14-year period (1998–2011). To avoid bias, we only included the first sample for each patient and patients who tested positive in the period 1980–1997 were excluded. There were 9268 patients who tested positive for ANA. With the exception of the clinical association of anti-multiple nuclear dots (at higher titers) and anti-nuclear envelope autoantibodies with autoimmune liver disease, there was no good clinical association of rare ANA patterns with the diagnosis of auto-immune disorders. The most important non-autoimmune cause of rare ANA patterns was carcinoma, particularly in patients with rare cell-cycle related ANAs.

### The clinical relevance of anti-DFS70 autoantibodies [^117QHf2V]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite all the progress in the establishment of specific autoantibody assays, screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells for quality-oriented laboratory diagnosis of ANA associated rheumatic diseases (AARD) remains indispensable but is not without limitations. Recent data on the relevance of the dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern and anti-DFS70 antibodies disclosed novel possibilities to optimize the serological stepwise diagnostics of AARD. The DFS pattern on HEp-2 cells is well differentiated from the classic "homogeneous" ANA pattern associated with dsDNA antibodies. This is the most frequent pattern in high titer ANA-positive healthy persons. The most characteristic ANA specificity associated with DFS pattern is the anti-DFS70 antibody (synonym LEDGF antibody). The prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in AARD patients is significantly lower compared with the prevalence in ANA-positive healthy persons. There is a negative association between anti-DFS70 antibodies and AARD, especially if no concomitant AARD-specific autoantibodies are found. Isolated anti-DFS70 antibodies are detectable in less than 1% of AARD but are detectable in 2–22% of healthy persons. In the presence of an isolated anti-DFS70 antibody, the posttest probability for AARD is reduced significantly. The significance of anti-DFS70 antibodies as a criterion that helps to exclude AARD is also confirmed by follow-up studies on anti-DFS70 antibodies of positive, healthy individuals, who did not develop any AARD during a 4 year observation period. Consequently, anti-DFS70 antibodies are valuable novel biomarkers for better interpretation of positive ANA in cases of negative AARD-associated autoantibodies and should be integrated in modified test algorithms to avoid unnecessary referrals and examinations of ANA-positive persons.

### From ANA to ENA: how to proceed? [^116ANVmX]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), as detected by indirect immuno-fluorescence, are hallmarks of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. Identification of the specificity for extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) is warranted because this may further differentiate between the distinct types of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. In recent years several different ENA, as recognized by ANA, have been identified and the knowledge of the molecular structure has been expanded. Together with technical developments this has enabled the introduction of several new anti-ENA antibody detection systems. In this review we will discuss the main logistic aspects of anti-ENA antibody testing that have to be solved in order to come to a consensus in order to deal with new developments in this field. We conclude that: 1. a positive ANA test should, depending on the titre and pattern, be followed by an anti-ENA antibody assay, 2: to fully appreciate the value of the new anti-ENA antibody detection systems a large, multicenter clinical evaluation is required, and 3: proper interpretation of reported test results requires that the clinician is aware of the way anti-ENA antibodies are detected and reported.

### Importance of the dense fine speckled pattern on HEp-2 cells and anti-DFS70 antibodies for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases [^115zCppv]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) is a hallmark of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD). The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay on HEp-2 cells is a commonly used test for the detection of ANA and was recently recommended as the screening test of choice by a task force of the American College of Rheumatology. However, up to 20% of serum samples from healthy individuals (HI) have been reported to have a positive ANA test, the majority of which are directed to the dense fine speckles 70 (DFS70) antigen. Even more important, the DFS IIF pattern has been reported in 33% of ANA positive HI, but not in ANA positive SARD sera. Since the intended use of the ANA HEp-2 test is to aid in the diagnosis of SARD, the reporting of anti-DFS70 antibodies and their associated pattern (DFS) as a positive test, significantly reduces the specificity and the positive likelihood of the ANA test. This has significant implications for diagnostic algorithms involving the detection of ANA. We summarize the current knowledge of anti-DFS70 antibodies and their impact on ANA testing. We also suggest a test algorithm which considers the DFS pattern and the presence of anti-DFS70 antibodies. In addition, we describe a novel method based on immunoadsorption of anti-DFS70 antibodies, which increases the specificity of the ANA HEp-2 test for SARD and which has the potential to overcome a significant limitation of the ANA HEp-2 assay.

### Uncommon types of autoantibodies-detection and clinical associations [^11138uKU]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunofluorescence is a basic method for detection of autoantibodies in serum. It is used as screening for people with symptoms suggesting autoimmune process and disease. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) assay detecting antibodies against nuclear proteins used commonly for diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease, although antibodies against cytoplasmic components and mitotic structures are usable in clinic. The majority of ANA nuclear patterns have been comprehensively studied with increasing data. However, the cytoplasmic and mitotic patterns are underestimated and still require further assessment. In this review the clinical associations and significance of uncommon types of autoantibodies are presented and discussed.

### Diagnosing renal involvement in connective tissue disease: interpretation of anti-nuclear autoantibody tests [^116u5SK3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

How are ANA and ENA assays performed?

ANAs are directed towards components of the cell nucleus. They are detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) cell line. HEp-2 cells, with large nuclei containing many autoantigens, are well suited for the detection of autoantibodies. Patient serum is incubated with the cells before a fluorescent antibody to human immunoglobulin is added. Samples are tested first at a screening dilution (e.g. 1:80) and, if positive, are sequentially diluted until fewer than half the cells are positively stained. This dilution is reported to reflect the strength of ANA binding present in the serum.

Weakly positive ANA titres are common and are often not clinically significant. In addition to the titre, most laboratories report the staining pattern of the antibody, for example, homogeneous, speckled, centromere or nucleolar. This reflects different nuclear proteins to which the antibody has bound (Table 1).

Table 1
Prevalence and associations of antinuclear autoantibodies in CTDs

Specific nuclear antigens are associated with different CTDs. Such antigens were historically removed from the nucleus using salt extraction, giving the name ENAs, but are now commonly measured using a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. These include Sjögren's syndrome–related antigen A (SSA; also known as Ro), Sjögren's syndrome–related antigen B (SSB; also known as La), Smith (Sm), topoisomerase 1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase III, Jo-1 and U1 ribonucleic protein (U1RNP). The antigen panel used for an ENA screen varies between laboratories. For specific clinical questions or in the case of diagnostic uncertainty, it can be helpful to discuss extended screening with a local immunologist.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: serum autoantibodies in clinical practice [^1169D1Cx]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Anti-Nuclear Antibody

Historically, ANA is the first autoantibody that has been associated to AIH, therefore suggesting an autoimmune origin of the disease, at that time named "chronic hypergammaglobulinemic hepatitis".

ANA should be tested by IIF, since nuclear target antigens in AIH are unknown in at least one third of the patients, leading to false negative results with potentially severe clinical consequences if only molecular-based tests are used (Fig. 1). According to the recommendations issued by the IAIHG, HEp2 cells should not be used to investigate ANA at a screening level, since this substrate leads to potential false positive results, as low-titre positivity can be found in health. Nevertheless, this recommendation, which relates to the clinical context of liver diseases, is nowadays rarely followed by clinical laboratories, and HEp2 cells are widely used for ANA testing. Therefore, HEp2 cells are used as a screening substrate also in the context of liver diseases, with a suggested higher positivity cut-off ≥ 1:160. The clinical performance of this approach needs to be validated in further studies. As mentioned above, HEp2 cells should be used to characterize the nuclear staining pattern of positive sera (Fig. 2). Some three quarters of AIH patients show a homogeneous nuclear staining pattern on HEp2 cells, the remainder displaying a speckled or nucleolar pattern (Fig. 2). Reported nuclear target antigens in AIH are listed in Table 1; among them, it should be mentioned that a strong association between anti-Ro52 and anti-SLA has been reported: therefore, anti-SLA should be tested in anti-Ro52-positive patients with liver disease. Neither nuclear IIF patterns nor target antigens have been associated with specific clinical phenotypes to date.

### COVID-19-associated autoimmunity as a feature of acute respiratory failure [^113z3V3u]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has similarities to systemic autoimmune conditions, including an association with increased incidence of autoantibodies, including those directed toward cytokines. However, reports to date lack longitudinal assessments and have inadequate controls (i.e. comparison to different severities within COVID-19 or to healthy individuals). Moreover, previous studies reported the emergence of autoantibodies in severe respiratory and infectious disease.

We performed an observational cohort study in which we prospectively enrolled adults with suspected COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were classified based on SARS-CoV-2 testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primary clinical outcome was death in ICU within 3 months; secondary outcomes included in-hospital death and disease severity. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), antigen-specific autoantibodies (sp-AAB), myositis-related autoantibodies and anti-cytokine autoantibodies (aC-AAB) were measured longitudinally. Patients did not receive any COVID-19-specific therapies since recruitment occurred before any were considered standard of care.

The 22 COVID + and 20 COVID − patients had similar baseline characteristics (Supplement): 69% males, median age 60.5 years, mean APACHE II score 25.3. Sixty-four percent had ANA, 38% had sp-AAB, 31% had myositis-related autoantibodies, and 38% aC-AAB. Cytoplasmic dense and fine speckled ANA immunofluorescence patterns (AC20 and/or AC19) were significantly associated with worse clinical severity scores (Supplement). Although for some aC-AAB there were large absolute differences between the COVID + and COVID −, overall, there were no statistically significant differences between the two cohorts for any of the autoantibodies (including anti-interferon autoantibodies), their titers, staining patterns or their temporal development (Fisher's exact test and ANOVA, false discovery rate q = 0.05; Fig. 1 and Supplement).

### Expression and clinical significance of antinuclear antibody in hepatitis C virus infection [^111XCpcK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) has been documented in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We attempted to determine the titer and to characterize the patterns and clinical significance of ANA in HCV infection.

Study

Forty-eight consecutive patients with positive anti-HCV antibody and positive HCV RNA were included in this study. Sera from patients were tested for ANA and anti-smooth muscle antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. Serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and cryoglobulin levels also were determined.

Results

Eleven (23%) of 48 HCV-infected patients were positive for ANA. Antinuclear antibody revealed speckled pattern in 10 (91%) of the 11 ANA-positive HCV-infected patients. Twenty (54%) of 37 ANA-negative HCV-infected patients had detectable pattern with equivocal titer (titer < 1.5). The ANA pattern was speckled in all 20 patients. Hepatitis C virus-infected patients with positive ANA were older than the HCV-infected patients with negative ANA (62.90 ± 11.05 years vs. 56.46 ± 14.94 years, respectively; p < 0.1). Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (39.36 ± 14.98 IU/L vs. 30.70 ± 23.15 IU/L, p < 0.05), alkaline phosphatase (189.00 ± 75.63 IU/L vs. 122.41 ± 40.88 IU/L, p < 0.01), and alpha-fetoprotein (47.72 ± 80.47 pg/dL vs. 7.00 ± 8.28 pg/dL, p < 0.01) were higher in ANA-positive HCV-infected patients than in ANA-negative HCV-infected patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in gender, alanine aminotransferase, anti-smooth muscle antibody, or cryoglobulin between the two groups.

Conclusions

Antinuclear antibody was present in 11 (23%) of 48 patients with HCV infection in our study. Speckled pattern is the major expression pattern of ANA in HCV infection. Antinuclear antibody-positive HCV-infected patients have significantly higher serum aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and alpha-fetoprotein levels than ANA-negative HCV-infected patients.

### Speckled antinuclear antibodies in keratinocytes – what does it mean? [^1177TVLu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Epidermal in vivo nuclear staining is occasionally noted in the lupus band test (LBT) in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD). The exact clinical significance of this finding remains unelucidated, especially in association with a positive LBT We have reviewed the clinical and serological characteristics of patients with in vivo-bound antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in keratinocytes.

Methods

Between 1990–1999 speckled IgG staining in keratinocyte nuclei was observed in 31 LBT specimens. We had detailed clinical and laboratory data for 22/31 patients. The present study comprises 22 patients with in vivo-bound ANA (8 cases with mixed CTD (MCTD), 10 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 with Sjögren's syndrome (SS), one with undefined CTD and one clinically healthy mother of a child with neonatal lupus erythematosus), and 22 consecutive CTD patients (2 MCTD, 15 SLE, 5 SS) without in vivo-bound ANA. Antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) antibodies were determined using indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA methods.

Results

A significant difference (p < 0.01) in anti-RNP antibodies between patients with and without in vivo-bound ANA was observed. Consequently, there was a strong association of in vivo-bound ANA and anti-RNP antibodies (p < 0.01). In SLE patients with in vivo-bound ANA the incidence of nephropathy was significantly lower (p < 0.01), regardless of LBT positivity. In SLE patients there were no differences in LBT positivity, anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement consumption between groups.

Conclusion

Our study implies that the presence of speckled ANA in keratinocytes in LBT may be useful in the diagnosis of MCTD and in the prognosis of renal involvement, especially in SLE patients.

### Antinuclear antibody testing-misunderstood or misbegotten? [^115Mm26w]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are a diverse group of autoantibodies that recognize nuclear macromolecules and their complexes. ANAs represent key biomarkers in the evaluation of rheumatic diseases, most prominently systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ANA testing is commonly performed in the clinical setting. In addition, ANA testing is now used to assess eligibility for participation in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents for SLE. ANAs can be assayed by various techniques, with the fluorescent ANA assay often viewed as the gold standard. Whereas a positive ANA test represents a classification criterion for SLE, up to 20–30% of the healthy population, depending on the assay used, is positive for an ANA, complicating the use of this test for diagnosis or the detection of preclinical autoimmunity. Furthermore, ANAs might be expressed in SLE less commonly than often thought. This Perspectives article discusses important questions about the use of ANA testing in both the clinical and research settings.

### Antinuclear antibody testing for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113bfRPo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition that may involve multiple organ systems. Although the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in nearly every case of SLE, it is not specific for this disease and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Key features that warrant ANA testing include unexplained multisystem inflammatory disease, symmetric joint pain with inflammatory features, photosensitive rash, and cytopenias. ANA staining patterns and more specific autoantibody testing may be helpful in diagnosis of suspected SLE or ANA-associated disease. For patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue, ANA testing is of limited value.

### How should a district general hospital immunology service screen for anti-nuclear antibodies? An' in-the-field'audit [^1165hQWZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing assists in the diagnosis of several immune-mediated disorders. The gold standard method for detection of these antibodies is by indirect immunofluorescence testing on human epidermoid laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells. However, many laboratories test for these antibodies using solid-phase assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which allows for higher throughput testing at reduced cost. In this study, we have audited the performance of a previously established ELISA assay to screen for ANA, making comparison with the gold standard HEp-2 immunofluorescence test. A prospective and unselected sample of 89 consecutive ANA test requests by consultant rheumatologists were evaluated in parallel over a period of 10 months using both tests. ELISA and HEp-2 screening assays yielded 40 (45%) and 72 (81%) positive test results, respectively, demonstrating lack of concordance between test methods. Using standard and clinical samples, it was demonstrated that the ELISA method did not detect several ANA with nucleolar, homogeneous and speckled immunofluorescence patterns. None of these ELISA(NEG) HEp-2(POS) ANA were reactive with a panel of six extractable nuclear antigens or with double-stranded DNA. Nonetheless, 13 of these samples (15%) originated from patients with recognized ANA-associated disease (n = 7) or Raynaud's phenomenon (n = 6). We conclude that ELISA screening may fail to detect clinically relevant ANA that lack defined specificity for antigen.

ANA, coupled with SMA, defines AIH-1, being positive in about two thirds of the patients, associated with SMA in half of the cases. Seronegative AIH is rare, > 95% of the cases being positive for ANA and/or SMA, provided that autoantibodies are tested according to recommended cut-offs. The clinician should be aware that ANA lacks disease specificity, being detected also in liver diseases different from AIH-1, particularly viral hepatitis B, C, D, and E, drug-induced liver injury, Wilson disease, alcohol-induced liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A variety of extrahepatic organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases are also typically associated with ANA-positivity, such as lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto thyroiditis, systemic sclerosis, or celiac disease, which may coexist with AIH. Moreover, ANA may be positive even in healthy individuals, with frequency and titres increasing with age.

Two ANA nuclear staining patterns are of particular clinical importance in the context of liver disease, i.e. the rim-like (also referred to as membranous) and the multiple-nuclear dot patterns (Fig. 2 D, E), which, in association with a cholestatic biochemical profile, are characteristic of PBC, being particularly helpful in the diagnosis of AMA-negative PBC. The main target antigen of the latter reactivity is sp100, whereas the anti-rim like antibody targets mainly gp210; molecular tests are available using these antigens, which however are not the only targets of the rim-like and multiple nuclear dot ANA, since both the nuclear membrane and the nuclear bodies, stained by the anti-rim-like and the anti-multiple nuclear dots, respectively, are complex structures.

### Anti-DFS70 autoantibodies in undifferentiated connective tissue diseases subjects: what's on the horizon? [^116a8dA6]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The main objective was to determine the prevalence of anti-dense fine speckled (DFS70) antibodies in a stable population of undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) to better define their potential role.

Methods

Immunological and clinical records of 91 long-standing UCTD patients were studied. DFS pattern was determined using the IIF ANA test on HEp-2 cells and anti-DFS70 antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence assay and by DFS70 line immunoassay.

Results

Twelve (13.2%) of 91 serum samples were positive for anti-DFS70 antibodies by chemiluminescence assay and line immunoassay. There was no statistical significance between the prevalence of anti-ENA and anti-DNA autoantibodies in patients with and without anti-DFS70 antibodies. No differences were found in the clinical characteristics of both groups. The presence of the anti-DFS70 antibodies was related to the younger age class.

Conclusion

The high prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in the UCTD patients suggested the potential role of these autoantibodies as a marker in the evolution of UCTD to CTD.

### Automated evaluation of ANA under real-life conditions [^116URmLM]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Of note, out of the strongly positive sera samples with a titre of 1:320 or higher, 165 of 166 were correctly classified as positive by both IIF processors. The discrepant serum sample was visually re-evaluated and classified as negative. In fact, 100% of strongly positive sera samples were correctly classified as positive by both IIF processors. Within the subgroup of DC, all 12 sera samples from patients with CTD were accurately identified as positive by both IIF processors.

The ROC curve (figure 1) confirmed Aklides to be a proper method for positive/negative discrimination of ANA with a good diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.851, p < 0.001).

Figure 1
Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of Aklides.

Concordance of automated and visual pattern recognition was analysed within n = 118 randomly selected patients with known diagnosis. However, Aklides correctly assessed only 43% of the fluorescence patterns of ANA-positive samples. Pattern recognition ability was as follows: 1/1 centromere, 0/1 nuclear envelope, 15/39 fine speckled, 7/15 homogeneous, 4/7 nucleolar.

There was a good correlation between obtained light intensity values by Aklides and visually determined end point titres (Spearman's ρ: 0.680, p < 0.001), allowing an estimation of the titre.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^1164ge1K]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by Friou in 1957, ordering an ANA appears to have become a reflexive response to the question "could this patient have a rheumatic disease?" What is the evidence that ordering such tests is of any value, and what should be done with a positive test?

### New-onset IgG autoantibodies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^114rj5uM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are produced by one in four hospitalized COVID-19 patients

To determine if hospitalized patients with COVID-19 produce autoantibodies against prototypical autoantigens associated with systemic autoimmunity, we measured ANA using an indirect immunofluorescence assay in one of our cohorts (University of Pennsylvania). We found that ten out of 73 patients (14%) were positive at a dilution of 1:160, six were positive at 1:320, three were positive at 1:640, and one was positive with greater than 1:1280 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). ANA positive samples were further diluted at 1:320, 1:640, and 1:1280 to determine titers. A variety of ANA patterns were observed including diffuse, speckled, and nucleolar (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Table 1). Three patients exhibited cytoplasmic staining but were negative for nuclear staining at 1:160. Given the finding of positive and weakly positive ANAs, we measured dsDNA antibodies. Only one individual out of 73 tested was positive for dsDNA antibodies at a dilution of 1:270, and this individual also was ANA positive with a speckled pattern (Supplementary Fig. 2). Since several patients who were severely or critically ill had thromboembolic and vascular events, we also analyzed the same 73 patients for Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies, as these antibodies are associated with autoimmune vasculitis. Only one individual tested positive for PR3 antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 2). The levels of positivity in these clinical-grade assays are in line with those of one of the authors (J.J.) who reported that 17 of 113 (15.8%) patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 serology had serum autoantibodies and/or antiphospholipid antibodies. These findings prompted us to "cast a wider net" for autoantibodies using additional patients and assays that detected larger numbers of not only common, but also unusual autoantigens.

### Anti-DFS70 antibodies: a useful biomarker in a pediatric case with suspected autoimmune disease [^1116vG1T]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Antidense fine speckles 70 (anti-DFS70) antibodies, a peculiar antinuclear antibody (ANA) pattern by indirect immunofluorescence, is frequently observed in ANA-positive individuals with no evidence of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease. They may be found in many different inflammatory conditions and in healthy individuals. We herein report a case of an 8-year-old girl presenting with generalized edema, hypertension, hepatomegaly, and a history of pharyngitis, which occurred 3 weeks earlier. Laboratory analysis revealed low complement C3 (6 mg/dL), microhematuria, and proteinuria. A diagnosis of acute glomerulonephritis was made. Anti-dsDNA, antiextractable nuclear antigens, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. However, a highly positive (1:640) ANA immunofluorescence test with dense fine speckles pattern was found. The presence of anti-DFS70 immunoglobulin G antibodies was confirmed by a specific immunoassay. In conclusion, the presence of isolated anti-DFS70 antibodies may be useful to exclude an autoimmune pathogenesis in those children with a positive ANA test and a clinical picture possibly attributable to systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease. This will avoid further unnecessary investigation with the potential for incorrect diagnosis and possibly harmful treatment.

Comparison of the available ANA automated reading systems

Although comparable performance between automated and conventional ANA IIF analysis for the interpretation of negative and positive samples has been reported, discrepancies between patterns have been found, especially when systems are able to detect basic patterns only, or when mixed fluorescent patterns are present in the samples.

Some automated IIF systems present misinterpretation difficulties when antibodies react with a limited and specific cell component, such as Golgi apparatus, nuclear dots, or nuclear membrane. Such misinterpretation may have implications in clinical settings, emphasizing the need and importance of visual validation (Table 3).

a Modified from Agmon-Levin et al.

Such IIF assays have identifed more than 50 autoantibodies against 30 different nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. The use of large cultured cells with high rates of mitosis enables adequate pattern recognition by evaluation of the fluorescence distribution during different phases of the cell cycle. In fact, identification of cell cycle dynamics (for example, interphase, mitosis) is crucial both for defining different patterns (such as the fine or large speckled patterns within a speckled staining pattern, the centromere patterns and the PCNA patterns) and for distinguishing between different patterns (for example anti-nuclear membrane from the homogeneous pattern).

Correct identification of different IIF patterns is sometimes diagnostic (for example, the centromere pattern and the PCNA pattern) or may suggest the occurrence of autoantibodies to specific antigens (Table 3). Many sera contain more than one antibody; in such cases, accurate analysis of the different patterns often requires direct evaluation of the slides to enable exact definition of the autoantibody profile in a given patient.

ANA immunofluorescent staining

As our laboratory also provided information on the patterns of immunofluorescent staining, we have also been able to evaluate what further use this information might provide (previously unpublished data). Of 1369 individual patients sera tested, 445 were ANA positive in children with a known diagnosis. Of these children, 135 had a rheumatic disease (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) (now known as JIA-the terms are used interchangeably here), SLE, MCTD, or juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) but 310 had no convincing evidence of having a rheumatic disease.

Homogeneous, mitotic staining patterns were seen much more commonly in children with a rheumatic disease than those without (p = 0.001). Interestingly, a nucleolar pattern of staining was seen more commonly in children without a rheumatic disease (p = 0.03). This lack of an association of the nucleolar pattern in children with scleroderma specifically, and rheumatic disease in general has been commented on previously.

Serology

ANA positivity was seen significantly more often present in the SRP group compared to the PRP group; 66.7% of the SRP patients and 14.1% of the PRP patients showed ANA positivity (p < 0.001). All PRP patients with a positive ANA had a titer of 1:160 or lower. Of the SRP patients with a positive ANA titer 7 (58%) had a titer of 1:640, 1 (8%) had a titer of 1:320, 3 (25%) had a titer of 1:160 and 1 (8%) had a titer of 1:80. In most patients a coarse speckled pattern was seen. Other patterns that were seen less frequently are fine speckled, nucleolar and homogeneous patterns. Anti-ENA antibodies were also seen significantly more often in the SRP group compared to the PRP group: 50.0% of the SRP patients and 4.8% of the PRP patients showed anti-ENA antibodies (p = 0.001) (Table 1). PRP patients had a mean anti-ENA titer of 1.37 ± 5.71 and SRP patients had a mean anti-ENA titer of 12.79 ± 14.99.

### Longitudinal anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) seroconversion in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective study of Swedish cases with recent-onset disease [^1145NKGp]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy remains a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Whether or not IF-ANA status varies over time is controversial. We therefore designed a prospective study with longitudinal follow-up of patients with recent-onset SLE. The study population consisted of 54 recently diagnosed SLE cases, all meeting the 1982 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and/or the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. Clinical follow-up data, including disease activity, organ damage and sera, were collected from clinical onset of SLE and onwards, in most cases yearly (0–96 months). IF-ANA was analysed on human epithelial cells-2 (HEp-2) cells and categorized regarding staining patterns. Using an addressable laser bead assay (FIDIS™ Connective profile), we measured IgG-ANA fine specificities against Ro52/SSA, Ro60/SSA, Sjögren's syndrome type B antigen (La/SSB), Smith antigen (Sm), Smith antigen/ribonucleoprotein (Sm/RNP), U1 RNP (U1RNP), dsDNA, ribosomal-P protein and histone. At baseline, all patients were judged ANA-positive at an abnormal titre corresponding to the 95th percentile of healthy blood donors, but seven of 54 patients (13%) lost ANA-positivity over time. Homogeneous (AC-1; 46%) and speckled (AC-4 or 5; 31%) were the most frequently observed patterns at inclusion, whereas 7% switched pattern at least once during follow-up. Established associations between ANA fine specificities and clinical data were confirmed. Levels of anti-Sm/RNP, but not of anti-dsDNA, correlated with clinical disease activity [modified SLE disease activity 2000 (mSLEDAI-2K)]. Our data indicate that a considerable proportion of Swedish patients with SLE lose ANA-positivity over time, whereas consistent staining patterns were frequent. The clinical and mechanistic relevance of ANA seroconversion remains uncertain. Further prospective evaluations in larger SLE populations with more diverse ethnicities are warranted.

### Next-generation autoantibody testing by combination of screening and confirmation-the cytoBead® technology [^115hEmwb]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

The fully automated interpretation system AKLIDES® was the first platform which performance was evaluated in clinical studies successfully. Egerer et al. published the first clinical evaluation in 2010 by comparing the use of the new technology for ANA assessment of 1222 sera in the routine laboratory environment of both a university and a private referral laboratory. An agreement of 93.0% (859/924) and of 90.6% (270/298) between automated AKLIDES® interpretation and classical ANA reading in the university and the private laboratory were reported, respectively. Remarkably, end-titer analysis based on quantitative fluorescence reading was shown for the first time, which overcomes a crucial shortcoming of IIF and levels it with other quantitative assay techniques established in routine clinical laboratories. Thus, the application range of the novel interpretation systems (AKLIDES®, Europattern®, NovaView®) was enlarged by adding ANCA and anti-dsDNA autoAb testing on human neutrophils and Crithidia luciliae, respectively.

In summary, the intriguing development of these novel automated IIF interpretation systems strengthened the position of IIF as screening technique within the two-tier strategy for ANA and ANCA analyses. Thus, the demand of even large laboratories in terms of automated autoAb testing by IIF with modern data management could be addressed adequately. Tozzoli et al. concluded that a new technological era in the routine autoimmune laboratory was reached by the introduction of fully automated IIF in 2009. Furthermore, this technology may also stimulate clinical research regarding larger population studies, e.g. the prevalence of the dense-fine speckled (DFS) pattern, and hence, of the DFS70 autoAbs, in different apparently healthy and diseased populations.

### Systemic sclerosis-specific antibodies: novel and classical biomarkers [^113uTVFe]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

IIF

Despite the well-known limitations of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), such as to be time-consuming method with the need of expertise for result interpretation, it is currently recommended as the gold-standard method for ANA screening and is still the preferred screening immunoassay for detection of the majority of clinically relevant SSc autoantibodies. The International Consensus on ANA pattern (ICAP) has established the use of human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells, originating from human laryngeal cancer, as substrate for IIF, in order to obtain information on the staining pattern and the antibody titer, with the advantage of high sensitivity. To overcome labor-intensive and time-consuming clinical work-up procedures and to minimize the variation of pattern and titer estimates, automated reading systems have been proposed. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated agreement with conventional IIF interpretation in some cases with a hit rate close to 100% in samples with a clearly negative or positive ANA tests result. However, automated pattern recognition is limited to a few main IIF patterns, to date, and not used in routine practice.

The most typical SSc pattern recognized by IIF is ACA, very specific for SSc, as well as two other patterns that may be suggestive for SSc: the nucleolar pattern, usually indicative of anti-U3 RNP, anti-Th/To, anti-NOR 90, and anti-PM/Scl antibodies, and the speckled pattern that may be related to the presence of anti-TopoI, anti-RNAP3, or other less-frequently reported antibodies such as anti-U11/U12 RNP, anti-Ku, anti-U1 RNP, and anti-RuvBL1/2, characterized by peculiar nucleolar, nuclear, and metaphase staining). Recently, an observational retrospective study including 608 patients with a confirmed rare ANA pattern detected by IIF on HEp-2 cells showed that rare cytoplasmic patterns were frequently associated to SSc as a unique finding with no SSc-specific antibodies, confirming that the IIF technique remains a valid tool to identify SSc cases.

When ANA patterns are identified in SSc patients, they need to be further characterized by using different techniques, mostly represented by ELISA and IB in most laboratories worldwide, together with chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA), fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA), and Multiplex immunoassay, since IP is available only in a few centers worldwide.

### Hand swelling and other non-Raynaud phenomenon symptoms as the initial presentation of systemic sclerosis: prevalence and clinical associations in two US cohorts [^1165LRRy]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

An additional challenge in early SSc diagnosis is the lack of a published consensus on the optimal ANA testing approach to screen patients for SSc. HEp‐2 immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is positive in > 90% of patients with SSc, with a diversity of staining patterns, including speckled, centromere, or nucleolar depending on the patient's specific autoantibody. Indeed, several specific autoantibodies have been identified in association with SSc, typically mutually exclusive and associated with distinct disease trajectories and complications. Testing for SSc‐associated specific autoantibodies is available to US clinicians via commercial laboratories. However, most of these autoantibodies are not included in some of the multiplex autoantibody panels that are often used as ANA screening tools in clinical practice.

To achieve the goal of recognition of SSc at its earliest stages, it is important to understand the full spectrum of presenting manifestations and to use an ANA testing approach with high sensitivity. With this context in mind, we describe the initial clinical manifestations and ANA profiles of two independent US cohorts of patients with early SSc, with a focus on those whose initial manifestation was not RP.

### A new diagnostic algorithm for pattern-oriented autoantibody testing according to the ICAP nomenclature: a pilot study [^112Rf9s5]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The commercial tests currently available as second-level tests to detect ANA sub-specificities are generally used independently from the ANA immunofluorescence (IIF) pattern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the use of a customizable pattern-oriented antigenic panel by immunoblot (IB) using the International Consensus on ANA Patterns (ICAP) classification scheme, in order to introduce a novel and updated autoimmune diagnostic flowchart. 710 sera referred for routine ANA testing were selected on the basis of the ANA pattern according to the ICAP nomenclature (nuclear speckled AC-2,4,5; nucleolar AC-8,9,10,29; cytoplasmic speckled AC-18,19,20) and on an IIF titer ≥ 1:320. They were then assayed by three experimental IB assays using a panel of selected antigens. ICAP-oriented IB detected 515 antibody reactivities vs. 457 of traditional anti-ENA in the nuclear speckled pattern group, 108 vs. 28 in the nucleolar pattern group, and 43 vs. 34 in the cytoplasmic speckled pattern. This pilot study may lead the way for a new approach introducing an ICAP pattern-oriented follow up testing as a valid alternative to the existing standard panels, thus enabling more patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease to be accurately diagnosed.

### Clinical significance of antinucleolar antibodies: biomarkers for autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and others [^114rmwrn]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nucleolar staining is one of the standard patterns in immunofluorescence antinuclear antibodies (ANA), seen in 5–9% of ANA in various conditions. Antinucleolar antibodies (ANoA) are classified into 3 patterns in the International Consensus on ANA Patterns (ICAP) classification; AC-8 homogeneous pattern, AC-9 clumpy pattern, and AC-10 punctate pattern. Specificities known to show AC-8 include anti-Th/To, -PM-Scl, -nucleophosmin/B23, -nucleolin/C23, -No55, and others. AC-9 is seen by anti-fibrillarin/U3RNP and AC-10 by anti-RNA polymerase I and hUBF/NOR-90. ANoA has been classically known to be associated with scleroderma (SSc) and the characterization of nucleolar antigens identified several autoantigens recognized by SSc autoantibodies. The clinical association of anti-Th/To, PM-Scl, fibrillarin/U3RNP, and RNA polymerase I with SSc or SSc-overlap syndrome is well established, and commercial assays are developed. Anti-hUBF/NOR90, nucleophosmin/B23, and nucleolin/C23 are known for decades and reported in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs), malignancies, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and others; however, their clinical significance remains to be established.

### Recognising the spectrum of scleromyositis: HEp-2 ANA patterns allow identification of a novel clinical subset with anti-SMN autoantibodies [^114Np3c5]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe systemic sclerosis (SSc) with myopathy in patients without classic SSc-specific and SSc-overlap autoantibodies (aAbs), referred to as seronegative scleromyositis.

Methods

Twenty patients with seronegative scleromyositis diagnosed by expert opinion were analysed retrospectively for SSc features at myositis diagnosis and follow-up, and stratified based on HEp-2 nuclear patterns by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) according to International Consensus of Autoantibody Patterns. Specificities were analysed by protein A-assisted immunoprecipitation. Myopathy was considered an organ involvement of SSc.

Results

SSc sine scleroderma was a frequent presentation (45%) at myositis diagnosis. Myositis was the most common first non-Raynaud manifestation of SSc (55%). Lower oesophagal dysmotility was present in 10 of 11 (91%) investigated patients. At follow-up, 80% of the patients met the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR SSc classification criteria. Two-thirds of patients had a positive HEp-2 IIF nuclear pattern (all with titers ≥ 1/320), defining three novel scleromyositis subsets. First, antinuclear antibody (ANA)-negative scleromyositis was associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and renal crisis. Second, a speckled pattern uncovered multiple rare SSc-specific aAbs. Third, the nuclear dots pattern was associated with aAbs to survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex and a novel scleromyositis subset characteriszed by calcinosis but infrequent ILD and renal crisis.

Conclusions

SSc skin involvement is often absent in early seronegative scleromyositis. ANA positivity, Raynaud phenomenon, SSc-type capillaroscopy and/or lower oesophagal dysmotility may be clues for scleromyositis. Using HEp-2 IIF patterns, three novel clinicoserological subsets of scleromyositis emerged, notably (1) ANA-negative, (2) ANA-positive with a speckled pattern and (3) ANA-positive with nuclear dots and anti-SMN aAbs.

Using HEp-2 IIF patterns to subset clinically scleromyositis

When HEp-2 IIF patterns are analysed in seronegative scleromyositis, three clinically relevant subsets emerge: ANA-negative scleromyositis, ANA-positive scleromyositis with a speckled nuclear pattern (AC-4 or AC-5) and ANA-positive scleromyositis with nuclear dots (AC-6 or AC-7).

Although uncommon, HEp-2 IIF-negative scleromyositis was seen in 33% of the patients in this study. All patients had an abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy, ILD was frequent and, importantly, these patients were at high risk for scleroderma renal crisis, a feared complication of corticosteroid therapy in SSc, yet considered standard therapy in the treatment of myositis. Indeed, in the present study, two of the three HEp-2 IIF-negative patients who developed scleroderma renal crisis did so while treated with corticosteroids for their myositis.

### Economic analysis of the use of anti-DFS70 antibody test in patients with undifferentiated systemic autoimmune disease symptoms [^117UjdiD]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In patients with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and undifferentiated features of systemic autoimmune disease, the coexistence of monospecific anti-dense fine speckled 70 (anti-DFS70) antibodies is associated with a lower risk of progression to overt disease. Therefore, they might help in correctly classifying ANA- positive patients and avoiding unnecessary followup diagnostic procedures. The aim of this study was to analyze the economic effect of the introduction of the anti-DFS70 antibody test in a hospital setting.

Methods

A case-control study was performed to detect monospecific anti-DFS70 antibodies in ANA-positive subjects with undifferentiated features (cases, n = 124) and with a defined systemic autoimmune disease (controls, n = 290). Based on current clinical practice, a decision tree was developed to represent the disease course of patients with undifferentiated features in the subsequent 3 years. A budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed to estimate the effect of implementing the screening for anti-DFS70 antibodies in the case group on the total costs. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to calculate the effect of the uncertainty of the input variables on the results.

Results

Among the 124 patients in the case group, 5 (4.0%) tested positive for anti-DFS70 antibodies versus 4/290 (1.4%) in the control group (p = not significant). The mean cost per patient under the current clinical practice decreased from €3274 to €3192 in our scenario. The BIA reports cost savings of €10,128.

Conclusion

The introduction of anti-DFS70 antibody test would avoid unnecessary followup diagnostic procedures and minimize the use of health resources generated by suspicion of a potential systemic autoimmune disease.

### Historical perspective on antinuclear antibody testing [^1144ZAj9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum factors binding to cell nuclei were first described in the 1940s, and the antibodies responsible for the binding to self (autoantibodies) were discovered in the late 1950s. Routine standardized testing using a cell line (HEp-2) started in the 1980s and continues to evolve. In addition to the classic immunofluorescence assay (IFA), various immunochemical techniques have been developed for the measurement of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The complexity of ANA IFA pattern reading and the varying sensitivities, specificities, and overall clinical performance of the alternative methods have often generated controversies and sometimes even confusion among healthcare providers and laboratorians. A better understanding of the historical roots of ANA testing can aid in understanding these controversies and assist with selecting the best-performing methods. In this review, we present historic and contemporary ANA testing methods, highlighting the pros and cons of each. We also provide an overview of the current practice of ANA testing based on several recent large laboratory surveys. For optimal patient care, it is critical that clinicians and laboratorians using ANA testing understand the performance and limitations of the methods used by their institutions, as well as the meaning of the test results. Recently published surveys and standardization efforts initiated by several stakeholder scientific organizations will likely lead to new ANA diagnostic guidelines, to be followed by an improvement in testing practices, management, and outcomes for patients with autoimmune disorders.

HEp-2 IIF patterns uncover novel aAbs in seronegative scleromyositis

Sixty-five per cent of the patients with seronegative scleromyositis presented with a positive HEp-2 IIF (titers ≥ 1/320) while 35% were IIF-negative (table 1). When the patients were stratified according to their HEp-2 IIF status, three clinically relevant subsets emerged (figure 2 and online supplemental table 2).

ANA-negative scleromyositis

All seven patients with HEp-2 IIF-negative scleromyositis had an abnormal SSc-type nailfold capillaroscopy, and ILD was present in five patients (71%). Most patients (71%) had serum CK ≤ 1000 IU/L and their CK levels were significantly lower than in patients with ANA-positive scleromyositis (p = 0.039, online supplemental table 2). Patients wih ANA-negative scleromyositis were also at significantly higher risk for scleroderma renal crisis compared to ANA-positive scleromyositis patients (n = 3/7 vs n = 0/13, p = 0.03).

ANA-positive scleromyositis

Speckled IIF patterns: sera from five patients with ANA-positive scleromyositis displayed a speckled nuclear pattern (AC-4 or AC-5 ICAP pattern). Interestingly, by immunoprecipitation, rare SSc-specific aAbs were found in four of these five (80%) patients: anti-RuvBL1/2 (n = 2), anti-U4/U6RNP (n = 1) and anti-U5RNP (n = 1) (figure 2). At last follow-up, SSc small-bowel involvement (60%) and SSc sine scleroderma (40%) were key findings in these five patients.

Detection of antinuclear and anti-Ku, anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and other autoantibodies

The detection of autoantibodies was performed in four hospital's immunology departments. ANA were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on Hep2 cells. All patients had ANA titres ≥ 1/160, which was the threshold of positivity considered in our study. Screening for anti-Ku antibodies was performed when the fluorescence pattern was suggestive of anti-Ku, which corresponds to a fine dense granular pattern with nucleoli and perimitotic staining; or requested by the clinician in patients with ANA positivity and clinical manifestations of SSc or IM. The search for anti-Ku positivity is not isolated and is always associated with screening for other autoantibodies that are included in the same dot blot. Here, anti-Ku specificity was soaked by dot-blot immunoassay using two different suppliers. The first one allows the detection of IgG antibodies in human sera against Jo1, PL-7, PL-12, Mi-2, Ku, PM-Scl, Scl-70 and signal recognition particle (SRP) antigens (Polymyositis/Scleroderma 8, Dtek, Mons, Belgium). The second one is Euroline Systemic Sclerosis profile (nucleoli) (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) which includes the search for Scl-70, centromeric protein (CENP) A, CENP B, RP11, RP155, fibrillarin, NOR90, Th/To, PM-Scl100, PM-Scl75 and Ku. Patients were considered positive for anti-Ku antibodies regardless of the time of screening, as not all patients were screened at diagnosis. Since these anti-Ku antibodies do persist over time. Details regarding the detection of other autoantibodies are described in online supplemental appendix 1. Patients were considered positive for anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, myositis-specific antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor and/or anticitrullinated antibodies, if the related autoantibody was detected at least one time during the follow-up. This screening could be performed multiple times during the follow-up.

### Genome-wide association studies of specific antinuclear autoantibody subphenotypes in primary biliary cholangitis [^115ixiRP]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Other than AMA, autoantibodies to glycoprotein 210 (gp210) and speckled 100 kDa (sp100), the two subtypes of anti‐nuclear antibodies (ANA), are also highly specific to PBC and can be detected in 10%‐40% of PBC patients. 8, 9, 10 Anti‐gp210 and sp100‐positive serum samples present typical rim and multinuclear dot staining patterns, respectively. Anti‐gp210 antibody recognizes a single epitope containing 25 amino acids (AAs) in the C‐terminal tail of nuclear pore gp210 protein. 11 Several studies have indicated that autoantibody to gp210 can serve as an indicator of poor prognosis. Muratori et al. found that anti‐gp210 positivity was associated with higher serum cholestatic parameters including ALP, GGT, and bilirubin. 8 Unfavorable clinical outcome, more rapid disease progression, and significantly higher hepatic failure were found in anti‐gp210‐positive patients. 11, 12, 13 Recently, Yang et al. found that anti‐gp210 positivity is associated with more severe forms of PBC in Chinese patients with prognostic value. 14, 15 Sp100 is a component of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and sp100‐containing nuclear bodies. Anti‐sp100 antibodies in PBC patients recognize multiple epitopes in sp100. 16 Studies on the clinical significance of anti‐sp100 antibody have thus far generated mixed results. 17, 18, 19, 20 A few early studies indicated that the anti‐sp100‐positive patient group tended to have earlier disease onset and more frequently had cirrhosis compared to anti‐sp100‐negative patients. Studies by Nakamura et al. 12 and Yang et al. 14 found no correlation of anti‐sp100 positivity with disease prognosis, but neither study investigated the subtypes of autoantibodies. Two semiquantitative analyses of anti‐sp100 antibody titers during the course of the treatment found a correlation of anti‐sp100 titers with Mayo risk score, an indicator of disease severity. 17, 19 Because sp100 autoantibodies recognized multiple epitopes on sp100, an earlier study found a change of some anti‐sp100 epitopes during the course of disease progression and ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment in some PBC patients, but the overall anti‐sp100 status remained unchanged. 21 Unfortunately, no subsequent follow‐up or replication studies were reported by other researchers. Therefore, it remains undetermined whether any anti‐sp100 immunoglobulin subtypes or titers can serve as indicators of disease progression.

### Autoantibody-based subgroups and longitudinal seroconversion in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^116yTspe]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

ANA staining patterns

All patients fulfilled the ACR-1997 criteriawith IF-ANA positive at diagnosis (n = 87, 100%). The distribution of staining patterns was detailed according to the International Consensus on ANA Patterns nomenclature. There were homogeneous (H, AC-1) (n = 41, 47.13%), speckled (S, AC-4) (n = 40, 45.98%), homogeneous/speckled (AC-1/4) (n = 6, 6.90%) at diagnosis.

The majority of patients (n = 75, 86.21%) kept their type of staining pattern during follow-up. The switched pattern was all found in subgroup 1. Twelve cases with H (13.79%) switched patterns at least once. Among them, nine cases with H switched to S and three cases with H switched to a dense, fine-speckled pattern (AC-2).

Decreasing IF-ANA titres were found in 55 cases (63.22%). Increasing IF-ANA titres were found in 15 cases (17.24%). Titres remained in 17 cases (19.54%).

Two patients in subgroup 1 (2 of 31, 6.45%) lost ANA positivity over time. The initial ANA titres of these two cases were in the range of 320. One had LN (International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society: IV+V), and the other had macrophage activation syndrome at diagnosis. Both were prescribed antimalarials, steroid and cyclophosphamide, one in combination with rituximab. At month 8, when data from two cases were available, they were IF-ANA negative and stayed negative during the follow-up.

### Autoimmune thyroiditis in antinuclear antibody positive children without rheumatologic disease [^117Q1CZe]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Children are commonly referred to a pediatric rheumatology center for the laboratory finding of an Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) of undetermined significance. Previous studies regarding adult rheumatology patients have supported an association between ANA and anti-thyroid antibodies, with the prevalence of thyroid antibodies being significantly higher in patients referred to a rheumatology center for an ANA without evidence of connective tissue disease compared to the general population. The purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of thyroid antibodies in children referred to a pediatric rheumatology center for a positive ANA without evidence of a connective tissue disease.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on children who were referred to our pediatric rheumatology center between August 2003 and March 2007 for positive ANA with concurrent thyroid antibody and thyroid function tests performed who did not fulfill criteria for a specific connective tissue disease. Laboratory and clinical features were recorded and analyzed. Mean and standard deviation were used to describe continuous data. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare proportions between variables.

Results

One-hundred and four ANA-positive patients with concurrent thyroid studies were evaluated (88% female, 93% Caucasian, mean age 11.9 ± 4.0 years). Half of patients had an ANA titer ≥ 1:320. The ANA pattern was speckled in 60% of the patients. Thyroid antibodies were detected in 30% of the patients. Anti-Thyroglobulin (ATG) was detected in 29% and Anti-thyroid peroxidase (ATPO) in 21% of the patients; of these children, 14% had hypothyroidism. ANA pattern and titer were not associated with anti-thyroid antibody positivity.

Conclusion

Thyroid antibodies associated with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, ATG and ATPO, were detected significantly higher in ANA-positive children without a rheumatologic condition (30%) as compared to the general pediatric population (1.3–3.4%). ANA titer and pattern did not help predict the presence or absence of thyroid antibodies. Given the high frequency of thyroid antibodies and increased risk of developing hypothyroidism over time, routine evaluation of ATG and ATPO with thyroid function tests in ANA-positive children is recommended.

### Anti-nuclear antibodies in patients with breast cancer [^1167Jnrj]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

To study the prevalence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) in breast cancer patients and its association with tumour characteristics. Ninety-one patients with breast mass detected by image studies and assigned to conduct diagnostic biopsy and eventual surgical treatment were studied for demographical, tumour data and presence of ANA. Serum of positive ANA patients was screened for the extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) profile. As comparison, 91 healthy individuals matched for age and from the same geographical area were included. In this sample 72 of 91 (79.1%) had malignant lesions (83% ductal infiltrative carcinoma). ANA was positive in 44.4% of patients with malignant tumour and in 15.7% of those with benign lesions (malignant versus benign with P = 0.03). Controls had ANA positivity in 5.4%, and when compared with tumour samples showed P < 0.0001. The most common immunofluorescence pattern was a fine dense speckled pattern. In the ANA-positive patients with malignant lesions, seven had positivity for ENA profile (three for anti-RNP and anti-Sm, one for just anti-RNP, two for anti-Ro and anti-La e two for just anti-La). It was not possible to associate ANA positivity with tumour histological characteristics or staging or with patient's age. A negative association of ANA with hormonal (oestrogen or oestrogen plus progesterone) receptor status was found (P = 0.01). In this sample, there was a high prevalence of ANA positivity in breast cancer patients with a negative association with the presence of hormonal receptors. More studies are needed to understand the real value of this finding.

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^1177DqUQ]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) represents a paradigmatic example of an autoimmune disease that is characterized by the occurrence of ANA in virtually all patients, but for which interpretation of the patterns is complesx. In fact, SSc ANA are mainly represented by four mutually exclusive specificities: anti-centromere (ACA), anti-topoisomerase I, anti-nucleolar, and anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies. Anti-PM-Scl, U1-RNP and anti-Ku are usually detected in overlap syndromes. About 60% of patients with SSc have ACA or anti-topoisomerase I antibodies as disease markers. Many other ANA that are present in SSc (for example, anti-RNA polymerase III, anti-Th/To, anti-PM/Scl, anti-Ku, anti-fibrillarin) are directed against different proteins localized in the nucleus and nucleolus. These antigen-antibody systems identify SSc subgroups with different evolution, organ involvement, and survival prognosis. The use of IIF for detection of ANA is mandatory for SSc diagnosis, displaying a sensitivity of 85%. ACA and anti-topoisomerase I negative sera show strong anti-nuclear staining, featuring speckled or nucleolar (homogeneous, clumpy or speckled) patterns (Box 1). Therefore, the definition of the single nucleolar staining could address the suspect of specific autoantibodies, relevant for the diagnosis of SSc. A nucleolar ANA associated with new onset of Raynaud's phenomenon could be helpful in identifying a patient with early disease, sometimes associated with severe organ involvement. It is essential that ANA results are confirmed by more specific methods such as western blotting or immunoprecipitation assays.

### Antinuclear antibodies: marker of diagnosis and evolution in autoimmune diseases [^116oFZtM]. Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are autoantibodies that attack self-proteins within cell nucleus structures; their presence in serum may indicate an autoimmune disease. Also, positive ANA test results have been obtained in chronic infectious diseases, cancers, medication-related adverse events, and even healthy individuals. As a result, a correct interpretation of the presence of ANAs is needed. Identification of ANAs subtypes is an important part of clinical immunology. The presence of ANAs in patient blood specimens is detected using a cell-line substrate from human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2 cells). On this substrate, ANAs will bind specific antigens, which will lead to a suggestive fluorescent emission. The fluorescence patterns visualized under the fluorescence microscope can be correlated with certain subtypes of ANA and certain autoimmune diseases. Depending on the subtype of ANA present in the serum and the targeted antigen, several staining patterns are reported, namely, nuclear patterns, nucleolar patterns, cell cycle patterns, or cytoplasmatic patterns. Identification of a certain pattern can lead to diagnosis of a certain autoimmune disease.

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^112GgiJ8]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Current evidence from preliminary study results indicates that there is good correlation between manual and automated interpretation of ANA IIF assays, at least in the ability to discriminate between positive and negative results and in recognizing the main IIF patterns. Such systems will therefore speed up routine performance of these tests and help to harmonize interpretation of the results across laboratories. However, there is a need to have their clinical diagnostic power validated by clinical studies, in addition to the analytical studies that have already been published. In addition, these new systems could be further improved if they were better able to recognize mixed fluorescent or less common fluorescent patterns.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^116X4xDp]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In our lab, no combination of ANA titer, or staining pattern was specific for any particular rheumatic disease. The test combinations with the best positive predictive values for a rheumatic disease were: a) a titer ≥ 1:640 with mitotic positive staining or b) a titer ≥ 1:640 with a homogenous and mitotic staining pattern. These tests had positive predictive values of 77% and 72% respectively. Yet these results were only slightly higher than the positive predictive value of 69% obtained with a titer of ≥ 1:640 alone, ignoring the pattern of staining. Although the addition of patterns somewhat increases the specificity and positive predictive value of the ANA test for a rheumatic disease, it does so at the expense of both the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the test using titers alone.

The pattern of staining also does not appear to be helpful in distinguishing between rheumatic diseases. For example, although high titer homogenous, mitotic positive staining was the most common combination seen in children with SLE, it was actually found in only 27.3% of ANA positive lupus patients. This combination was also found in 12.5% of ANA positive JRA and 5.4% of ANA positive JDM patients. This lack of specificity of the ANA immunofluorescent pattern has been recognized previously, both for adults and children. A study by Parker et al. evaluated the usefulness of combining ANA titer and pattern. Although they felt that knowledge of both titer and pattern was helpful, they did not calculate specific test characteristics, and in fact no combination was restricted to any single rheumatic disease. Our assessment of these data is that the addition of information about patterns of immunofluorescence does not appear to significantly improve the utility of the ANA test.

Autoimmune markers in patients with AHA and controls

ANA were detected by HEp-2 immunofluorescence in 64% and 30% of AHA and control patients, respectively (Table 3). The difference corresponded to an OR of 4.02 (95% CI, 1.98–8.18) and was highly statistically significant.

### The reliability of immunoassays to detect autoantibodies in patients with myositis is dependent on autoantibody specificity [^116CfrzV]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

For healthy control samples, which were largely ANA negative, IIF was less likely to be consistent with the MSA identified by the commercial assay. For healthy control samples 'false positive' for at least one MSAA by line blot, no samples had an ANA pattern that could further support this result. For samples 'false positive' for at least one MSAA by dot blot, 25% of samples had an ANA pattern that could be consistent with this result (all had a non-specific fine speckle nuclear staining pattern).

Anti-TIF1γ

Immunoprecipitation blotting was performed on 16 samples reported as containing anti-TIF1γ by immunoprecipitation but negative on other assays. For 11 (69%) of these samples, a prototype anti-TIF1γ serum or commercial anti-TIF1γ was able to detect the immunoprecipitated antigen by blotting, confirming the presence of the anti-TIF1γ in the original sample. However, these 11 samples did not identify antigen immunoprecipitated by the prototype anti-TIF1γ serum or commercial anti-TIF1γ, suggesting that they target conformational epitopes that are not recognized in a denatured state (see Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online).

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^1127AMjG]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

All these points underline the importance of correct interpretation of a given fluorescence pattern, and the need for standardization of analysis in automated systems.

There is one other important point about using automated systems for ANA reading. The ANA test was originally ordered predominantly by rheumatologists and clinical immunologists, but nowadays a broader range of clinical disciplines (including primary care, dermatology, nephrology, gastroenterology, neurology, oncology, hematology, obstetrics, gynecology, cardiology) are currently ordering the test. This change in test referral patterns affects the post-test probability for a given disease, as screening tests with limited specificity (such as IIF ANA) are strongly affected when the pre-test probability in a given population decreases. A positive ANA test obtained outside of the rheumatologic setting displays poor predictive value for future development of a rheumatic disease, but it represents a significant risk factor for SLE. Taking into account that the prevalence of SLE is 1 in 2000 (0.05%), the observed frequency of 2.5% in individuals with a 1/80 positive ANA test represents a 50-fold relative risk for development of the disease. Thus, ANA testing is a useful tool for SLE diagnosis.

### Prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in patients with and without systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^114hCWHV]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Autoantibodies to the dense fine speckled 70 (DFS70) antigen are common among antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive healthy individuals (HI). We assessed the prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in patients with and without ANA-associated rheumatic diseases (AARDs) by two methods: chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) and an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay based on immunoadsorption for DFS70.

Methods

Fifty-one ANA-positive sera samples from patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis of AARD, 92 samples from HI and 85 samples submitted to a reference laboratory for routine ANA testing were evaluated for the presence of anti-DFS70 antibodies. The samples were evaluated by QUANTA Flash DFS70 CIA using BIO-FLASH instrument and by NOVA Lite selected HEp-2 kit on NOVA View - an automated IIF system. Sera with DFS positive pattern were pre-absorbed with highly purified human DFS70 antigen, and then tested again.

Results

Twenty-four samples (10.5%) tested by QUANTA Flash DFS70 CIA were positive for anti-DFS70 antibodies. The prevalence of monospecific anti-DFS70 antibodies was significantly higher in healthy subjects than in patients with AARDs (10.9% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.02). The frequency of anti-DFS70 antibodies in samples submitted for routine ANA testing was 15.2%. A very good agreement was found between CIA and the DFS pattern identified by the automated HEp-2 IIF (kappa = 0.97). In 80% of the samples obtained from patients without AARDs, immunoadsorption effectively inhibited the anti-DFS70 antibodies.

Conclusions

The data confirm that mono-specific anti-DFS70 antibodies are a strong discriminator between ANA positive HI and AARD patients, and their evaluation should be included in ANA testing algorithms.

Anti-SLA/LP antibodies carry very high specificity for AIH diagnosis, albeit low sensitivity, but they do not characterize a specific subgroup of patients with AIH (Table 3). Patients with anti-SLA/LP may need permanent immunosuppression, as many of them relapse after treatment withdrawal. A specific characteristic of anti-SLA/LP is its concurrence with autoantibodies against the ribonucleoprotein 52kDa/Sjögren's syndrome A antigen in almost all anti-SLA/LP-positive European and North American patients.

Anti-LKM1 and anti-LC1 often coexist in patients with AIH-2, but they are not specific, as they can be observed in patients with HCV (the anti-LKM3 in chronic hepatitis D). Apart from IFA, anti-LKM1, anti-LKM3 and anti-LC1 antibodies can also be detected by other validated techniques (ELISAs or immunoblotting). In case of diagnostic problems between anti-LKM1/3 and AMA by IFA, complementary specific ELISAs or immunoblot are recommended.

A perinuclear pattern of anti-neutrophil nuclear antibodies (pANNA), also known as "atypical" perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, is detected frequently by IFA almost exclusively in AIH-1 patients. However, very few patients with AIH-1 have isolated pANNA and therefore, it should only be performed in patients who have tested negative for ANA, SMA, and anti-SLA/LP.

Negative results, besides clinical suspicion, justify additional specific investigation and repeated testing, preferably in a reference laboratory, as the titers may vary during the disease course (Fig. 1).

In adults, clinically significant titers for ANA, SMA, anti-LKM1 and anti-LC1 are ≥ 1:40 (≥ 1:20 for ANA or SMA and ≥ 1:10 for anti-LKM1 or anti-LC1 in children). Monitoring of autoantibody titers is not recommended in adults, but might be of clinical significance in children and adolescents.

The routine laboratories should comply with the guidelines in reporting the techniques and cutoffs for positivity. This information should be clearly given to physicians in order to assist them in the interpretation of the results. It is also pivotal that the laboratory report should provide all patterns of renal reactivity of SMA, as SMA of VG or VGT patterns have the highest diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of AIH.

### Reflecting on a decade of the international consensus on ANA patterns (ICAP): accomplishments and challenges from the perspective of the 7th ICAP workshop [^114sEhdi]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The International Consensus on ANA Patterns (ICAP) is an ongoing international initiative dedicated to harmonizing technical and interpretation aspects of the HEp-2 IFA test. Comprised of internationally recognized experts in autoimmunity and HEp-2 IFA testing, ICAP has operated for the last 10 years by promoting accurate reading, interpretation, and reporting of HEp-2 IFA images by professionals involved in various areas related to autoimmune diseases, such as clinical diagnostic laboratories, academic research, IVD industry, and patient care. ICAP operates through continuous information exchange with the international community and encourages the participation of younger experts from all over the world. The 7th ICAP workshop has addressed several aspects that originated from this interaction with the international community and has effectively established objective goals and tasks to be delivered over the next two years. Some of these are outlined in this article, including the planning of three audio-visual educational modules to be posted at the www.anapattern.org website, the classification of two novel HEp-2 IFA patterns, the implementation of a project dedicated to continuously updating the information on the clinical and immunologic relevance of the HEp-2 IFA patterns, and the launch of two additional branches of the HEp-2 Clinical and Immunological (HEp-2 CIC) project.

### Automated antinuclear immunofluorescence antibody screening: a comparative study of six computer-aided diagnostic systems [^114bW72p]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) plays an important role in immunological assays for detecting and measuring autoantibodies. However, the method is burdened by some unfavorable features: the need for expert morphologists, the subjectivity of interpretation, and a low degree of standardization and automation. Following the recent statement by the American College of Rheumatology that the IIF technique should be considered as the standard screening method for the detection of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), the biomedical industry has developed technological solutions which might significantly improve automation of the procedure, not only in the preparation of substrates and slides, but also in microscope reading.

Methods

We collected 104 ANA-positive sera from patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of autoimmune disease and 40 ANA-negative sera from healthy blood donors. One aliquot of each serum, without information about pattern and titer, was sent to six laboratories of our group, where the sera were tested with the IIF manual method provided by each of the six manufacturers of automatic systems. Assignment of result (pos/neg), of pattern and titer was made by consensus at a meeting attended by all members of the research team. Result was assigned if consensus for pos/neg was reached by at least four of six certifiers, while for the pattern and for the titer, the value observed with higher frequency (mode) was adopted. Seventeen ANA-positive sera and six ANA-negative sera were excluded. Therefore, the study with the following automatic instrumentation was conducted on 92 ANA-positive sera and on 34 ANA-negative sera: Aklides, EUROPattern, G-Sight (I-Sight-IFA), Helios, Image Navigator, and Nova View. Analytical imprecision was measured in five aliquots of the same serum, randomly added to the sample series.

Results

Overall sensitivity of the six automated systems was 96.7% and overall specificity was 89.2%. Most false negatives were recorded for cytoplasmic patterns, whereas among nuclear patterns those with a low level of fluorescence (i.e., multiple nuclear dots, midbody, nuclear rim) were sometimes missed. The intensity values of the light signal of various instruments showed a good correlation with the titer obtained by manual reading (Spearman's rho between 0.672 and 0.839; P < 0.0001 for all the systems). Imprecision ranged from 1.99% to 25.2% and, for all the systems, it was lower than that obtained by the manual IIF test (39.1%). The accuracy of pattern recognition, which is for now restricted to the most typical patterns (homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, centromere, multiple nuclear dots and cytoplasmic) was limited, ranging from 52% to 79%.

Conclusions

This study, which is the first to compare the diagnostic accuracy of six systems for automated ANA-IIF reading on the same series of sera, showed that all systems are able to perform very well the task for which they were created. Indeed, cumulative automatic discrimination between positive and negative samples had 95% accuracy. All the manufacturers are actively continuing the development of new and more sophisticated software for a better definition in automatic recognition of patterns and light signal conversion in end-point titer. In the future, this may avert the need for serum dilution for titration, which will be a great advantage in economic terms and time-saving.

### Open questions in autoimmunity: discussions from the 2013 controversies in rheumatology and autoimmunity meeting [^114jLJET]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tools in rheumatology

Serum autoantibodies are the main laboratory biomarker for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases and ANA identified by indirect immunofluorescence have high sensitivity and specificity rates, albeit remaining largely dependent on operator expertise. Meroni et al. describe the recent findings in automated ANA detection and the strengths and limitations of this approach in clinical practice, as discussed in a recent consensus study and extensively during the CORA congress. In fact, traditional indirect immunofluorescence is time and labor consuming, and is based on the recognition of specific patterns by a skilled operator. To overcome these limitations, new automated systems have been developed by several companies to allow the recognition of ANA positive or negative samples that can be further characterized by their specific pattern and titer. The advantages of these automated systems are obvious and include the reduction of time and cost for indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), and the increased number of samples that can be reliably tested, but problems have been also identified. For example, automated IIF for ANA detection fails to describe accurately mixed patterns, cytoplasmic staining or rare patterns. These limits can be a serious problem for the use of ANA in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, a disease characterized by the presence of rare and complex ANA patterns at indirect immunofluorescence that cannot be easily identified by current automated systems. Meroni and colleagues state that despite several advantages, automated ANA IIF assays need further study and improvement before replacing standard IIF for ANA detection.

Beside ANA, other autoantibodies are very important for the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases, as in the case of anti-citrullinated peptides antibodies (ACPA) in RA. In the present issue, Senolt et al. describe the recent finding of new autoantibodies, the anti-carbamylated antigens (anti-CarP), peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4) and v raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF). Their role is to improve the early diagnosis of RA, along with the classical and most sensitive (albeit poorly specific) autoantibodies detected in RA, such as the rheumatoid factor. The authors describe these serological biomarkers to underline their predictive and prognostic value, and they also suggest a role in therapy monitoring through the autoantibody titer fluctuation, but this needs further investigation.

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^1144Br8C]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) assay is a screening test used for almost all autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and in a number of these cases, it is a diagnostic/classification parameter. In addition, ANA is also a useful test for additional autoimmune disorders. The indirect immunofluorescence technique on monolayers of cultured epithelial cells is the current recommended method because it has higher sensitivity than solid phase assays. However, the technique is time-consuming and requires skilled operators. Automated ANA reading systems have recently been developed, which offer the advantage of faster and much easier performance as well as better harmonization in the interpretation of the results. Preliminary validation studies of these systems have given promising results in terms of analytical specificity and reproducibility. However, these techniques require further validation in clinical studies and need improvement in their recognition of mixed or less common staining patterns.

### Anti-DFS70 / LEDGF antibodies are more prevalent in healthy individuals compared to patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^115dcECm]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are a serological hallmark of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While a number of ANA patterns detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) have diagnostic significance, autoantibodies producing the dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern have been reported to be more prevalent in healthy individuals than in SARD.

Methods

Sequential samples submitted for ANA testing were screened for anti-DFS antibodies by IIF (n = 3263). Samples with the DFS pattern were tested for anti-DFS70/lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) antibodies by ELISA and by a novel chemiluminescence assay (CIA, Quanta Flash DFS70). Sera from patients with various diseases and healthy individuals were tested for anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies by CIA. A cohort of 251 patients with SLE was used to analyze serological and clinical associations of anti-DFS70 antibodies.

Results

The frequency of anti-DFS antibodies by IIF was 1.62%. The prevalence of anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies as detected by CIA in the different cohorts was 8.9% in healthy individuals, 2.8% in SLE, 2.6% in rheumatoid arthritis, 4.0% in asthma, 5.0% in interstitial cystitis, 1.7% in Graves' disease, and 6.0% in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Of note, the prevalence of anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies was significantly higher in healthy individuals compared to patients with SARD (p = 0.00085). In SLE results, anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies were not significantly associated with clinical features or other autoantibodies typically found in SLE. Only 1/7 SLE sera showed anti-DFS70/LEDGF, but no other autoantibody reactivity.

Conclusion

"Monospecific" anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies may represent a biomarker for differentiating SARD from non-SARD individuals, but there is a need for a reliable assay to ensure reactivity to DFS70.

### Antinuclear antibody-negative systemic lupus erythematosus in an international inception cohort [^1159nru1]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The spectrum of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) is changing to include both nuclear staining as well as cytoplasmic and mitotic cell patterns (CMPs) and accordingly a change is occurring in terminology to anticellular antibodies. This study examined the prevalence of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) anticellular antibody staining using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics inception cohort.

Methods

Anticellular antibodies were detected by IIF on HEp-2000 substrate using the baseline serum. Three serologic subsets were examined: ANA positive (presence of either nuclear or mixed nuclear/CMP staining), anticellular antibody negative (absence of any intracellular staining), and isolated CMP staining. The odds of being anticellular antibody negative versus ANA or isolated CMP positive was assessed by multivariable analysis.

Results

A total of 1,137 patients were included; 1,049 (92.3%) were ANA positive, 71 (6.2%) were anticellular antibody negative, and 17 (1.5%) had an isolated CMP. The isolated CMP-positive group did not differ from the ANA-positive or anticellular antibody-negative groups in clinical, demographic, or serologic features. Patients who were older (odds ratio [OR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00, 1.04]), of white race/ethnicity (OR 3.53 [95% CI 1.77, 7.03]), or receiving high-dose glucocorticoids at or prior to enrollment (OR 2.39 [95% CI 1.39, 4.12]) were more likely to be anticellular antibody negative. Patients on immunosuppressants (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.19, 0.64]) or with anti-SSA/Ro 60 (OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.23, 0.74]) or anti-U1 RNP (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.20, 0.93]) were less likely to be anticellular antibody negative.

Conclusion

In newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus, 6.2% of patients were anticellular antibody negative, and 1.5% had an isolated CMP. The prevalence of anticellular antibody-negative systemic lupus erythematosus will likely decrease as emerging nomenclature guidelines recommend that non-nuclear patterns should also be reported as a positive ANA.

### Autoantibody-based subgroups and longitudinal seroconversion in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^114dznkL]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Accurate assessment of disease status is important for the management of JSLE. Through analysis of autoantibody-based subgroups and longitudinal seroconversion, a deeper understanding of JSLE can be attained. We found differences existed in clinical manifestations and disease activity in the subdivision of JSLE based on autoantibodies. Seroconversion overtime was common in JSLE. Negative seroconversion rates were rather frequent for anti-DNA antibodies, while anti-Ro/La antibodies were relatively persistent. Positive seroconversion existed and may be followed by flare.

IF-ANA has a capital role and serves as an entry criterion in the 2019 SLE classification criteria from the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology and ACR, but data on switched patterns and titre fluctuation were scarce. The distribution in the present study was dominated by homogeneous (H, AC-1) (n = 41, 47.13%) and speckled (S, AC-4) (n = 40, 45.98%) at diagnosis, similar to that found in previous SLE cohorts. The switched pattern from H to S was found and decreasing IF-ANA titres were observed during follow-up. According to the previous study, anti-DNA and anti-nucleosome antibodies produced by plasmablasts lead to the H staining, whereas anti-RNP antibodies generated by long-lived plasma cells, less susceptible to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, lead to the S pattern. We also found that negative seroconversion rate was rather frequent for anti-nucleosome and anti-dsDNA. Thus, it seems that the switched pattern from H to S during treatment may be related to the easier elimination of the plasmablasts than the long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. However, the staining pattern was stable overtime in the majority of our cases (84.21%). Furthermore, both the pattern and titres were not correlated with SLEDAI scores, in agreement with prior studies. This finding may be related to the impact of various autoantibodies on ANA staining patterns and titres. Thus, evaluating IF-ANA staining patterns and titres may not be helpful during follow-up and could not be applied to evaluate the disease activity of JSLE. It seems that the analysis of ANA fine specificities is an essential complement to the IF-ANA study.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^116WjkLc]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and other novel antigen testing?

Studies (see Table 1) estimate the sensitivity of ANA as 58–85% and specificity as 50–97%. ANA is commonly used as a screening antibody but because of its frequency and low specificity, should not be measured in the absence of clinical indicators.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in SD and various CTDs

Studies (see Table 2) estimate the sensitivity of ENA as 89–92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) in SD

None of the 'novel' autoantibodies out-perform anti-Ro antibody and are not recommended outside a research setting.

Recommendation

Do not measure ANA in the absence of clinical indicators of SD or other CTD (1, C) SOA 94.6%.

Use ANA as a screening antibody where there is a clinical suspicion of CTD (1, C) SOA 93.9%.

Measure ENA even if the ANA is negative if there is a high index of suspicion of SD (1, C) SOA 96.7%.

2a. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland (SG) ultrasound scanning (USS)?

Multiple studies have confirmed the utility of SG USS in the diagnosis of SD in both adults and children, although it may not differentiate between SS and sarcoid or other connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and does not form part of the classification criteria.

Recommendation

USS of the salivary glands can provide useful additional information to support either the presence of or lack of evidence for SD (1, A) SOA 95.2%.

USS does not currently replace either antibody testing or histological analysis in adult SD classification criteria (1, A) SOA 96.4%.

2b. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of other imaging modalities?

Reviews of imaging modalities in SD have concluded that further studies are needed to establish the role of PET, CT and MRI. None of the imaging modalities are included in the most recent classification criteria.

### Autoantibodies to dense fine speckles in pediatric diseases and controls [^116Nb9rX]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Autoantibodies to the dense fine speckled 70 kDa antigen (DFS70) are reported to be more common in individuals who do not have an antinuclear antibody (ANA)-associated rheumatic disease (AARD) than in patients with AARD. The frequency of anti-DFS70 antibodies has been thoroughly studied in adult but not in pediatric populations. The primary objective of this observational study was to determine the frequency of anti-DFS70 in pediatric AARD and reference cohorts.

Methods

Sera from 743 children with AARD and related conditions, and 345 samples from reference cohorts (healthy children and those being investigated for AARD) were studied for anti-DFS70 autoantibodies as measured by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. A de-identified administrative database was used to retrieve demographic, serologic, and clinical data.

Results

Anti-DFS70 antibodies were seen in 2.1% of healthy children and in 4.5% of sera from pediatric individuals referred for ANA testing. The frequency of anti-DFS70 was highest in juvenile localized scleroderma (LS; 4/29, 13.8%), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM; 2/11, 18.2%), childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE; 19/331, 5.7%), diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (1/22, 4.5%), celiac disease (2/49, 4.1%), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; 5/202, 2.5%). Of note, anti-DFS70 antibodies were observed in 3/26 children (11.5%) with uveitis and JIA-associated uveitis.

Conclusion

The frequency of anti-DFS70 autoantibodies in healthy pediatric subjects is within the lower range of that reported in adults. Anti-DFS70 antibodies can be found in childhood SSc and cSLE, but has a remarkably high frequency in children with LS, JDM, and uveitis.

### New-onset IgG autoantibodies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^1141NiCV]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

ANA and imaging

ANAs were performed by indirect immunofluorescence using fixed and permeabilized Hep-2 cells affixed to glass slides (Inova Diagnostics, Cat # 708100). ANAs were detected using a FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody following vendor instructions. Samples were screened in a blinded fashion at a dilution of 1:80 with ultraviolet (UV) microscopy by clinical laboratory staff (A.G. and J.G.) who have extensive experience in the interpretation of ANA patterns. Positive and weak positive samples (with evidence of either nuclear or cytoplasmic or mixed staining patterns) were tested further at 1:160 (the dilution at which ANAs are considered to be positive in the clinical lab assay, which uses the same assay kit) and if still positive at 1:160, further titrations were performed at 1:320, 1:640, and 1:1280. In addition to the kit positive and negative controls (which were included on every slide), de-identified clinical samples from patients with known clinically detectable ANAs were used.

For ANA image analysis, all images were collected with a Nikon Eclipse Ti with widefield illumination equipped with a Nikon Plan Apo VC 60 × 1.4 oil objective. FITC and Evans Blue fluorescence images were collected with a Chroma dichroic/beamsplitter (part no 89402) and a Chroma quadset CoolLED300 light source, using FITC 480/30× excitation and 519/26 m emission filters, as well as Cy5 640/30× excitation and 697/60 m emission filters. Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER B&W CCD Digital Camera controlled with Metamorph V7.10.3.390 software and 1 × 1 camera binning. Multiple stage positions were collected using a Ludl XY linear encoded stage and Z motor. Minimum and maximum pixel values all set to the same level on a 12-bit camera (4096 gray levels- FITC 500 min, 2500 max, and Cy5 300 min, 1300 max), gamma set to 1, with acquisition times and light source intensities consistent for all images for comparison purposes.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^117PUFUZ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of having SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of ANA, ENA and other novel antigen testing?

A total of 518 publications were identified in the initial clinical evidence review for this section. Following initial screening 417 records were removed. This left 101 full-text articles of which a further 81 were excluded for a variety of reasons. The remaining 20 studies were included in the meta-analysis for this section.

Given the evolution of the classification criteria over time direct comparisons between publications can be difficult.

Six studies were identified exploring the diagnostic accuracy of ANA in SD, all but one included a wider population than suspected SD. See Table 1 for details. Five of these studies were retrospective cohort studies. The quality of the studies were graded from very low to moderate. Overall, these studies estimated the sensitivity of ANA as between 58% and 85% and the specificity as between 50% and 97%. The only study that confined itself to people with suspected SD (all had sicca) and scored moderate on GRADE found a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 50%. Median ages for subjects in these studies ranged from 39 to 60 years. No correlation was reported between age and ANA positivity.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of ANA in SD and various CTDs

Three studies were identified exploring the diagnostic accuracy of ENA — although none was specific for SD. See Table 2 for details. The studies were graded as low quality due to risk of bias. Results showed that the estimated sensitivity for ENA ranged between 89% and 92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of ENA in SD

All three studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of ENA in patients with a variety of underlying CTD including SD. The ENA panels used varied between 6-, 7-, 9- and 14-test ENA panels, and also included one multiplex bead–based immunoassay (MPBI). One study used two different tests which between them included testing for dsDNA, U1RNP, Sm, Ro/SSA60 and 52, La/SSB, Scl-70, Pm-scl, Jo-1, CENP, PCNA, nucleosomes, histones, ribosomal-P and AMA-M2. Only 19 of the patients had clinical SD.

### Automated evaluation of ANA under real-life conditions [^115cMR4x]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Consecutive serum samples of n = 1008 patients with a suspected autoimmune rheumatic disease (RD) were collected at the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and tested for ANA at the routine laboratory. Every serum sample was tested by visual IIF and two automated IIF processors, Aklides and Helios. The technicians were not blinded for the respective test results. The study was conducted with the approval of the local ethics committee (EA/193/10).

The majority of the patients were women (62%); their average age was 50.2 years (± 19.5) with a range between 1 and 91 years.

Laboratories are not always informed about the final diagnosis. To analyse the relationship between correct diagnosis and obtained laboratory results, a selection of n = 118 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis from the Department of Rheumatology/Immunology at Charité was taken. These patients were divided into three subgroups by their respective diagnoses: non-RD with n = 19, RD with n = 99, including disease with ANA as diagnosis or classification criteria (DC) with n = 12. The results of the two automated IIF processors were compared with the results obtained by visual IIF, which was defined as the current gold standard test.

ANA assessment by visual IIF

ANA were determined by visual IIF on the HEp-2 cell with commercial test kits (Generic Assays GmbH Dahlewitz/Berlin, Germany) according to the producer's instructions. For visual pattern recognition, a fluorescence microscope (Olympus AX70, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used by trained experts. To exclude clinically irrelevant samples, titres with 1:160 were counted as positive, and those with 1:320 or higher were counted as strongly positive. According to the nomenclature of the International Consensus on ANA Patterns, only AC1–14 patterns with nuclear staining were considered positive. These patterns are also named by ICAP as 'true ANA patterns' in contrast to cytoplasmic or mitotic patterns.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^114wcbuh]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — Anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) — ANAs are important ancillary diagnostic markers of PBC, which are detectable by IIF in up to 50% of PBC patients. Patterns highly specific for PBC include rim-like membranous and multiple nuclear dot patterns, with major autoantigens gp210 and sp100. In general, anti-gp210 and anti-sp100 have a low sensitivity (15–40%), but a high specificity (better greater than 95%) for AMA-negative PBC. In a large study with more than 4000 tested sera, simultaneous positivity for both anti-sp100 and anti-gp210 had a 100% positive predictive value for PBC irrespective of the AMA status. Recently, antibodies against kelch-like 12 (KLHL12) and hexokinase 1 were found in 35% and 22% of AMA-negative PBC patients, respectively.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of isotype specific antinuclear antibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis [^116eLL6W]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) giving a rim-like/membranous (RL/M) or a multiple nuclear dot (MND) pattern are highly specific for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Aim and

Subjects

To assess the prevalence of PBC specific ANAs, their Ig isotype, and their clinical significance in 90 PBC patients from Greece and Spain. Twenty eight patients with chronic hepatitis C, 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 17 healthy subjects were studied as controls.

Methods

PBC specific ANA reactivity was tested by indirect immunofluorescence using HEp2 cells as substrate and individual Ig class (IgG, IgA, IgM) and IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) specific antisera as revealing reagents.

Results

Fourteen of 90 (15.6%) PBC patients had PBC specific ANA reactivity when an anti-IgG (total) antiserum was used as the revealing reagent while 58 (64.4%) were positive when specific antisera to each of the four IgG isotypes were used. The prevailing isotype was IgG3 for MND and IgG1 for RL/M. PBC patients with specific ANA, in particular of the IgG3 isotype, had significantly more severe biochemical and histological disease compared with those who were seronegative. None of the controls was positive.

Conclusions

Disease specific ANA are present in the majority of patients with PBC when investigated at the level of immunoglobulin isotype. PBC specific ANA, in particular of the IgG3 isotype, are associated with a more severe disease course, possibly reflecting the peculiar ability of this isotype to engage mediators of damage.

### Antisynthetase syndrome during anti-TNF-alpha therapy: report of two cases [^114aSATd]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

In October 2021, corticoids were discontinued and adalimumab was reintroduced as joint pain reoccurred. He was later hospitalized in our department for insufficient pain control and his lung condition was reassessed. Chest-CT scan showed stable lung damage, however his PFT worsened. Immunological tests revealed positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) at 1:80, detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFI Hep-2000, EuroBio Scientific, France), with a cytoplasmic dense fine speckled pattern (ICAP AC-19), together with positive anti-PL7 antibodies (immunoblot, EuroImmun, Germany).

Looking back at the patient's chest-CT history to determine the onset of his interstitial lung disease (ILD), we understood that it appeared in August 2020 when he was misdiagnosed as having COVID pneumonia. We concluded in an anti-PL7 ASyS with isolated lung involvement, which first manifestations occurred eleven months after adalimumab's introduction. Interestingly, we were able to test ANA and anti-PL7 antibodies on the patient's serum before adalimumab's introduction: they were negative, showing a seroconversion during adalimumab treatment. Adalimumab was discontinued and a treatment with oral methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg was reintroduced. On his latest evaluation, his PFT showed no amelioration, with a progression to pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. 1 F): rituximab was recently introduced.

### Application of machine learning in assessing disease activity in SLE [^115N9CW1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory results

Table 2 presents the basic ANA results. For patients with SLE, there is no significant difference in the most common nuclear patterns, namely speckled (AC-4, AC-5) and homogeneous (AC-1), between the active and inactive groups. However, within the active group, there is a significantly higher positivity rate for anti-ds-DNA antibodies, indicating a correlation between the presence of these antibodies and disease activity. Analysis of the ANA profile results reveals that the active group exhibits a significantly higher level of anti-chromatin antibodies compared with the inactive group, and anti-ribosomal protein antibodies are also found to be elevated. The remaining antibody results do not demonstrate any significant differences between the two groups.

Table 2
Results of ANA characteristics

To evaluate the immune status of patients with SLE with varying degrees of disease activity, we conducted an analysis of lymphocyte subsets. The results showed no significant differences in the percentages and absolute counts of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells and B cells between the inactive and active groups. Conversely, a notable reduction was observed in the percentage and absolute number of NK cells, as depicted in figure 1.

Figure 1

Our experiments further observed the results of routine blood and biochemical tests (online supplemental table 2). The routine blood test revealed no significant differences in the counts of white cell count, red cell count and platelets between the two groups. However, a marked decrease was noted in the absolute neutrophil count within the active group. The biochemical routine test results showed an increase in globulins in the active group, and immunoglobulin IgA was also significantly elevated. Complement C3 and C4 were also significantly reduced in the active group.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^114pAt8o]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results: The study included 50 patients (Female: n = 35 (68.6%)). The mean age at diagnosis was 8.73 ± 4.58 years. Of the patients, 78% (n = 39) had oligoarticular JIA, 12% (n = 6) had enthesitis-associated arthritis (ERA), 2% (n = 1) had psoriatic arthritis, 6% (n = 3) had Rheumatoid Factor (RF) negative polyatricular JIA and 2% (n = 1) had RF positive polyarticular JIA. The most common ANA nuclear staining patterns were AC-1 (n = 32, 64%), AC-4/5 (n = 11, 22%) and AC-2 (n = 5, 10%). ANA cytoplasmic staining pattern (AC-15–17) was detected in only 2 (4%) patients. In the oligoarticular JIA subtype, the most common staining pattern was AC-1 (87.5%) and in the ERA subtype, the most common staining pattern was AC-4/5 (66.7%) (p = 0.019). AC-1 staining pattern was significantly higher in patients with a younger age at diagnosis (p = 0.003). When ANA staining titer was compared with JIA subtypes it was shown that while the patients with oligoarticular JIA tend to have a titer of 1/100–1/320, a titer of ≥ 1/1000 was significantly higher in the patients with ERA (p = 0.009).

Conclusion: Our unique findnigs show that while oligoarticular JIA subtype was associated with AC-1 staining pattern, low-intermediate ANA titer and younger age at diagnosis, ERA subtype was associated with AC-4/5 staining pattern, higher ANA titer and older age at diagnosis. It was concluded that staining pattern and titer levels may be associated with JIA subtypes.

### High titers of autoantibodies in patients with sickle-cell disease [^115i4F3S]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Frequency and titers of autoantibodies in patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) have been reported as relatively high. In a prospective study of 88 patients, we examined this "hyper-autoreactivity" and its clinical consequences.

Methods

For 1 year, patients with SCD were screened for the presence in their serum of antinuclear, anti-double-stranded DNA, antiextractible nuclear antigens, anticardiolipin antibodies, and rheumatoid factors. A population of 85 sex-matched individuals of similar ethnic origin served as controls.

Results

Whereas prevalence of autoantibodies did not differ between the 2 groups, the type and rate of antinuclear antibodies were different. Autoantibodies from the SCD patients showed various immunofluorescence patterns, whereas only speckled patterns at low titers were present in controls. No antibody specificity was found in either group. SCD patients and controls displayed similar rates of anticardiolipin antibodies, but the SCD patients tended to be more frequently positive for rheumatoid factors. Six-year followup of the SCD patients did not provide any clinical evidence for onset of an autoimmune disease, except for 1 patient who developed rheumatoid arthritis, with increasing antinuclear antibodies followed by emergence of specific markers 5 years later.

Conclusion

Patients with SCD displayed high titers of autoantibodies. This observation may be due only to immune activation and/or dysfunction in SCD, as neither pathogenic specificity of autoantibodies nor autoimmune clinical signs appeared in the majority of cases in our study.

### Recognising the spectrum of scleromyositis: HEp-2 ANA patterns allow identification of a novel clinical subset with anti-SMN autoantibodies [^116PsoC2]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There is a paucity of evidence on scleromyositis without classic SSc-specific and SSc-overlap aAbs. Only 10 such patients were included in a recent clinico-sero-pathological study of 37 patients with scleromyositis. In the present study, we describe in-depth 20 patients with seronegative scleromyositis that were identified from a cohort of 340 carefully phenotyped patients with AIM.

SSc skin involvement is often absent in early scleromyositis

Knowledge of SSc features included in the 2013 ACR/EULAR SSc classification criteria is a step towards the early identification of SSc in patients with suspected AIM. However, these criteria put emphasis on the presence of SSc skin involvement, yet this feature was initially absent in almost half (45%) of our scleromyositis patients. The present study therefore explores serological, myological and non ACR/EULAR SSc features that led to an early diagnosis of scleromyositis by expert opinion.

Current definitions of scleromyositis are insensitive

In the absence of a gold standard defining scleromyositis, meeting the classification criteria of both IIM and SSc is often used in practice. However, defining scleromyositis as the fulfilment of these classification criteria lacks sensitivity, as only two patients (10%) in this study met this definition at myositis diagnosis. Interestingly, myositis was the first non-Raynaud manifestation of SSc in 11 patients (55%), also making the case for clinicians to recognise myositis as a potential feature of early SSc.

SSc sine scleroderma as a clue to early identification of scleromyositis in seronegative patients

Only 55% of our patients presented SSc skin involvement at myositis diagnosis, and the remaining patients presented with SSc sine scleroderma. Interestingly, most of them (89%) presented, singly or in combination, high titer HEp-2 IIF positivity, new onset Raynaud phenomenon, SSc-type capillaroscopy and/or lower oesophagal dysmotility, which are thus important clues to the early identification of scleromyositis in seronegative patients.

Interestingly, SSc sine scleroderma is a common presentation in patients with anti-Th-/To-positive SScand, as shown herein, appears as a common presentation of seronegative scleromyositis. With the benefit of a median follow-up of 6.7 years, five of nine additional patients (total n = 16/20, 80%) ultimately met the 2013 ACR/EULAR SSc classification criteria.

### Next-generation autoantibody testing by combination of screening and confirmation-the cytoBead® technology [^113WAriN]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Connective Tissue Disease-Specific Autoantibodies

The loss of immune tolerance characteristic for connective tissue diseases (CTDs) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), poly/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) brings about the generation of various nonorgan-specific autoantibodies (autoAbs). Although the triggering factors for the occurrence of autoAbs and their role in the pathogenesis of CTD are still not entirely understood, autoAbs are widely used as diagnostic markers in clinical routine nowadays. The L.E. cell phenomenon described by Hargraves in the late 1940 in patients suffering from SLE proved to be a result of autoAb binding to nuclear material of polymorphs and marked the beginning of a rapidly evolving autoAb era in clinical diagnostics. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was the first assay technique employed to reveal autoAbs in patients with CTD. The groundbreaking works of Holborow and Friou et al. led to the discovery of so-called antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) as marker autoAbs of CTD like SLE. In the following years, clinicians made tremendous efforts to understand the clinical significance of autoAbs and their potential use for the serological diagnosis of CTD and beyond. This process was greatly driven by novel emerging assay techniques used for autoAb testing and their respective assay performance characteristics (Fig. 1; Table 1). The ensuing discourse has led to the definition of various diagnostic strategies for the serological diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and continues to date. Of note, ANA detected by IIF was included into the diagnostic criteria of SLE and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) later. In this context, the discovery of autoAbs to extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) apart from autoAbs to dsDNA or histones in the search for disease-specific autoAbs provides an intriguing example for the change in the understanding of the clinical meaning of autoAbs as diagnostic markers. Thus, the seminal paper of E.M. Tan and H.G. Kunkel on the identification of Sm as an autoantigenic target of SLE and the use of double radial immunodiffusion (DRID; Ouchterlony technique) for its detection ushered in a new era in autoAb diagnostics and its clinical application. Although ANA turned out to be a sensitive marker for SARD as a whole disease group, its specificity for distinct SARD entities was not satisfactory despite being defined as a diagnostic marker for SLE. Thus, the clinical need for more specific "ANA" was met by the pioneering work of H.G. Kunkel, E.M. Tan, and others discovering more and more novel autoAbs to ENA with clinical significance. However, not all ENAs identified as targets for CTD-specific autoAbs could be isolated by the saline extraction technique reported previously and should not be termed ENA. Furthermore, apart from autoAbs recognizing nuclear autoantigens, anticytoplasmic autoAbs (ACyA) have been introduced into the autoAb panel for SARD serology. Thus, the anti-SjS antigen A (SS-A) autoAbs also termed Ro have been shown to interact with its respective target in the cytoplasm. As a fact, the progress in proteomics enabled the identification of cytoplasmic autoantigenic targets interacting with for instance myositis-specific autoAbs like anti-histidyl tRNAse autoAbs (Jo-1) or SLE specific autoAb against ribosomal proteins. Obviously, this created confusion among clinical and laboratory experts and called for clarification. In terms of ANA testing, the introduction of human epidermoid laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells as improved autoantigenic substrate in IIF has encouraged the reporting of CTD-specific cytoplasmic patterns over the years. This contradiction in terminology was addressed by a recent consensus recommending the use of anticellular antibodies instead of ANA. Notwithstanding, the use of ANA and ENA is well established particularly among clinicians and it remains to be seen how this issue will be solved adequately in the years to come. In summary, autoAb testing is an integral part in the serological diagnosis of CTD and may also assist in the prognosis, subclassification, as well as monitoring of disease activity.

### The association of antinuclear antibodies with organ involvement and survival in systemic sclerosis [^112W4GfV]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the frequency and specificity of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and their association with internal organ involvement and survival in systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods

Sera from 276 SSc patients were analysed by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) technique with HEp-2 cells as a substrate to categorize centromeric (ACA), nucleolar, speckled and homogeneous nuclear IIF patterns. Specific ANA were determined as follows: anti-DNA topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) by double immunodiffusion, anti-U1 RNP by passive haemagglutination, anti-RNA polymerase I, II and III (anti-RNAP) and anti-histone (AHA) antibodies by enzyme immunoassays. During the follow-up of 7.0 ± 4.5 (mean ± S.D.) yr the occurrence of clinical manifestations and internal organ involvement was registered.

Results

ANA were present in 84% of the patients. The most common patterns of the IIF were speckled (41%), homogeneous (25%), nucleolar (24%) and centromeric (18%). A nucleolar pattern was associated with pulmonary fibrosis (P < 0.01) and cardiomegaly (P < 0.05). ACA were related to organic vasculopathy (P < 0.05) and renal involvement (P < 0.01), but not to pulmonary fibrosis (P < 0.01). Anti-topo I were present in 9.4%, anti-U1 RNP in 21%, anti-RNAP in 22% and AHA in 16% of the patients. Pulmonary involvement was more common in patients with anti-topo I (P < 0.05), whereas AHA-positive patients were characterized by cardiac (P < 0.05), pulmonary (P < 0.05) and renal (P < 0.05) involvement. A nucleolar IIF pattern and AHA were both associated with a decreased survival [relative risk of death 1.71 (P < 0.05) and 2.36 (P < 0.01), respectively].

Conclusions

AHA and a nucleolar HEp-2 cell pattern may indicate critical organ involvement and predict a reduced survival in SSc patients.

### Redefining the scl-70 indirect immunofluorescence pattern: autoantibodies to DNA topoisomerase I yield a specific compound immunofluorescence pattern [^1168z4sY]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we originally demonstrated that anti-DNA topo I antibodies present a compound IF pattern encompassing the nucleus, nucleolus, NOR, metaphase chromosome plate and the cytoplasm. This compound pattern was consistently observed in different cellular substrates and with different fixation protocols. The Scl-70 pattern proved to be specific for anti-DNA topo I antibodies, since 81 sequentially selected Scl-70-pattern serum samples were shown to be reactive with DNA topo I in double ID and western blot. In addition, all tested SSc serum samples with known reactivity to DNA topo I presented the ANA-HEp-2 Scl-70 pattern. Finally, affinity-purified anti-DNA topo I antibody preparations could reproduce the Scl-70 pattern.

The recognition of such specific compound IF pattern has important implications from the clinical point of view. The Scl-70 pattern herein characterized belongs to the group of compound IF patterns that hold strong autoantibody specificity association, such as those observed with CENP-F and NuMA-1 autoantibodies. The identification of such specific compound patterns in a given sample at the routine ANA-HEp-2 IIF screening leads to the implementation of specific tests for the definitive identification of the respective autoantibody. The HEp-2 cell IF pattern traditionally associated with anti-DNA topo I antibodies refers solely to a fine speckled staining of the nucleus, nucleolus and metaphase plate, which is not exclusively associated with this autoantibody specificity. The Scl-70 pattern herein reported has two additional features (the cytoplasm dot/reticular in interphase cells and the NOR at mitotic cells) that contribute to its specific association with anti-DNA topo I antibodies. The cytoplasmic component of the Scl-70 pattern has never been previously reported and the presence of DNA topo I at the NOR has been previously reported in PtK2 cells but not in HEp-2 cells.

### Suspected aripiprazole-induced neutropenia in a geriatric patient: a case report [^1155fAc3]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first descriptive case report of suspected aripiprazole-induced neutropenia in a geriatric patient. While a few cases of aripiprazole-induced neutropenia have been documented in the literature for younger age groups, the true incidence of this adverse reaction is not known as regular monitoring of CBC with aripiprazole use is not the current standard of care. There is potential for concern, as neutropenia can be a life-threatening condition, especially in specific populations such as an elderly patient who may already be suffering from comorbid conditions and/or immunosuppression. Lab work to monitor for metabolic changes (fasting blood glucose and lipids) when starting atypical antipsychotics is the standard of care. We recommend adding CBC to routine monitoring, as it is an inexpensive yet widely accessible test.

The diagnostic approach to neutropenia in an elderly patient is most efficiently investigated with a bone marrow biopsy, however, this may not always be clinically indicated if an etiology is able to be explained by patient history and/or basic laboratory panels. A history of hereditary blood dyscrasias, and chronic infections should be inquired. Basic laboratory studies such as vitamin B12, folate, albumin, ANA, HIV screening, hepatitis panel should be obtained upon initial evaluation. If neutropenia is still unable to be explained, the first specific action should be discontinuation of all drugs not necessary for maintenance of vital functions. If still unable to be explained, a bone marrow biopsy should be obtained. In this case, the patient had no history of blood dyscrasias, chronic infections and basic laboratory panels were unrevealing. The patient did have a positive ANA with nucleolar pattern; therefore, it is possible that there was an autoimmune component to the patient's neutropenia. However, the patient had no clinical correlation to the symptoms of the autoimmune diseases typically associated with a nuclear pattern (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma and systemic sclerosis, Raynaud phenomenon). Further, the interpretation of ANA patterns and titers is largely controversial when there is no clinical correlation, as healthy individuals (including the elderly) have been shown to have a positive ANA with various patterns and at various titers.

### Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening then indirect immunofluorescence confirmation of antinuclear antibodies: a statistical analysis [^112q1Se3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to analyze antinuclear antibody (ANA) screening by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing to confirm and characterize the pattern and titer of the antibody. We evaluated 4 ANA ELISAs and 1 HEp-2 IFA substrate in 224 clinically defined serum samples consisting of 30 from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases, 94 from rheumatoid arthritis cases, and 100 from healthy donors plus 495 serum samples submitted for routine ANA testing and 12 reference serum samples distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. IFA tests were read independently by 2 certified medical technologists. ELISA sensitivities ranged from 90% to 97% compared with 80% by IFA in the SLE serum samples. The ELISAs had specificities of 36% to 94%, whereas the IFA had 99% specificity. Overall, ELISAs for ANA assays demonstrated better sensitivity and good specificity, suggesting ELISA is a more cost-effective alternative to IFA testing for initial ANA screening. Samples positive by ANA ELISA should be tested on HEp-2 to determine the titer and pattern.

### Positive direct immunofluorescence and autoantibody profiles in psoriasis patients [^115kat2v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus are common, but their coexistence is thought to be infrequent. Each of these diseases has a broad clinical spectrum, so that diagnosis may not be straightforward. This study aimed to investigate the following immunological parameters in psoriasis patients: (i) direct immunofluorescence (DIF); (ii) antinuclear antibody; (iii) anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA); (iv) anti-Ro; and (v) anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein (nRNP). Of 300 cases, comprising 189 men (62.9%) and 111 women (37.1%), 17 (5.7%; 10 men, seven women) were positive for at least one immunological parameter. Nine of 300 (3%; seven male, two female) biopsy specimens from sun-exposed psoriatic lesions demonstrated bright continuous bands of granular IF along the dermoepidermal junction with immunoreactant immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, C3 and fibrinogen. The intensity of IF at the dermoepidermal junction was graded 3+ and 2+. Three cases demonstrated IgM, two had IgG, two fibrinogen and six cases showed C3. Three cases demonstrated more than one immunoreactant. One case demonstrated C3 at the vessels. No specimen demonstrated IgA deposition. Three hundred sera were obtained from patients with psoriasis, of which five demonstrated elevated antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer; dilution titer varied from 1:80–640. Three had a homogeneous pattern and two had a speckled pattern. None had a peripheral pattern. Five (1.7%) of 300 demonstrated anti-Ro, two had negative ANA, and three were positive ANA, two of which were speckled and the other homogenous. Anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm and anti-nRNP were not detected. Ten patients had positive DIF but negative ANA, while five had positive ANA; all had negative DIF results. Thus, the incidence of psoriasis and lupus erythematosus coexistence is low and a baseline immunological screening test for psoriasis might not prove worthwhile.

### PML nuclear body component Sp140 is a novel autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis [^1124SuuG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Some patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) have antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). These ANAs include the "multiple nuclear dots" (MND) staining pattern, targeting promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear body (NB) components, such as "speckled 100-kD" protein (Sp100) and PML. A new PML NB protein, designated as Sp140, was identified using serum from a PBC patient. The aim of this study was to analyze the immune response against Sp140 protein in PBC patients.

Methods

We studied 135 PBC patients and 157 pathological controls with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. We used indirect immunofluorescence and a neuroblastoma cell line expressing Sp140 for detecting anti-Sp140 antibodies, and a commercially available immunoblot for detecting anti-Sp100 and anti-PML antibodies.

Results

Anti-Sp140 antibodies were present in 20 (15%) PBC patients but not in control samples, with a higher frequency in antimitochondrial antibody (AMA)-negative cases (53 vs. 9%, P < 0.0001). Anti-Sp140 antibodies were found together with anti-Sp100 antibodies in all but one case (19 of 20, 90%) and with anti-PML antibodies in 12 (60%) cases. Anti-Sp140 positivity was not associated with a specific clinical feature of PBC.

Conclusions

Our study identifies Sp140 as a new, highly specific autoantigen in PBC for the first time. The very frequent coexistence of anti-Sp140, anti-Sp100 and anti-PML antibodies suggests that the NB is a multiantigenic complex in PBC and enhances the diagnostic significance of these reactivities, which are particularly useful in AMA-negative cases.

### Recognising the spectrum of scleromyositis: HEp-2 ANA patterns allow identification of a novel clinical subset with anti-SMN autoantibodies [^117EpEup]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Serology

Baseline immunological studies were performed at CHUM and HSCM as previously described. ANAs were determined by IIF on HEp-2 cells and the threshold value for positivity was > 1:160. An anti-ENA panel was used to detect aAbs to centromere protein B, topoisomerase I and U1RNP. A commercial line blot assay (Myositis Profile 3 or 4, Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany) was used to detect SSc-overlap anti-PM-Scl and anti-Ku aAbs.

Sera from patients without SSc-specific and SSc-overlap aAbs were collected and sent to Mitogen Diagnostics Laboratory, University of Calgary, where aliquots were biobanked at −80°C until needed. Samples were tested by IIF on HEp-2 substrate (Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA) and read by technologists with > 15 years of experience. HEp-2 IIF patterns were classified according to the ICAP standardised nomenclature. Anti-centromere aAbs were identified based on a discrete speckled nuclear pattern (AC-3).aAbs against centromere autoantigens CENP-A and CENP-B, topoisomerase I, RNA polymerase III (RP11 and RP155), PM-Scl (PM75 and PM100), Ro52/TRIM21, PDGFR, Ku, Th/To, NOR90/hUBF and U3RNP (fibrillarin) were detected by an SSc profile line immunoassay (Euroimmun AG). Overall, classic SSc-specific aAbs detected included aAbs to centromere proteins, topoisomerase I, RNA polymerase III, Th/To and U3RNP (fibrillarin) whereas SSc-overlap aAbs included aAbs to U1RNP, PM-Scl (75 and 100) and Ku. In the presence of an unexplained nucleolar IIF pattern, testing for anti-Th/To aAbs was also done, as previously described.

### Redefining the scl-70 indirect immunofluorescence pattern: autoantibodies to DNA topoisomerase I yield a specific compound immunofluorescence pattern [^115pERDb]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The standard method of screening for ANAs has been the IIF assay on HEp-2 cells (ANA-HEp-2 IIF). In addition to its usefulness as a screening tool, the ANA-HEp-2 IIF assay is also able to provide hints for the autoantibody specificity in a given sample. HEp-2 cell line (American Type Culture Collection CCL23, Rockville, MD, USA) is derived from human epithelial carcinoma and grows in monolayers of widely spread cells that nicely display a well-organized array of cell domains. Each cell domain is enriched with a distinct set of antigens. Therefore, the IF pattern depicted with a given serum is a function of the topographic distribution of the antigens recognized by the antibodies present in that serum. In fact, it has been broadly recognized that some IF patterns are associated with certain autoantibodies. For example, the nuclear coarse speckled pattern is strongly associated with anti-Smith (anti-Sm) and anti-snRNP antibodies, and the nuclear homogeneous pattern is associated with antibodies to native DNA, nucleosome and histones.

Since cell domains contain several molecular components that may be target of autoantibodies, a given IF pattern is usually associated with more than one autoantibody specificity. For example, the IF pattern associated with the Golgi complex may be elicited by autoantibodies to several of the Golgi constituents, such as giantin/macrogolgin/GCP372, golgin-245/p230, GMAP-210, golgin-160/GCP170, golgin-95/GM130 and golgin-97. The IF pattern associated with the nucleolus may be elicited by autoantibodies to several nucleolar constituents, such as Th/To, fibrillarin, NOR90 (nucleolar organizing region-90), RNA polymerase I and nucleolin, involved in various stages of ribosomal biosynthesis and processing. Therefore, the ANA-HEp-2 IF pattern may provide hints on the autoantibody specificity, but in general additional tests are required for the definite autoantibody identification.

### Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis detected by indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA [^115sHXt8]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the analytical performance of an ELISA for the detection of anti-RNA polymerase III antibody (ARA) and to assess IIF as a method for identifying this antibody.

Methods

A commercially available ELISA was used to assess the presence of ARA in sera from 1018 SSc patients. The sera had been divided into sub-populations based on the presence of specific autoantibodies, ANA pattern or the absence of both. Patients with ARA (n = 209) had been identified by characteristic ANA pattern by IIF on HEp-2 cell substrate [and additionally by radio-immunoprecipitation (IP) in 157/209 cases]. The remaining 809 SSc patients acted as a control group.

Results

Of 157 patients in whom ARA had been confirmed by IP, 150 were positive by ELISA providing a sensitivity of 96%. In the group where ARA had only been assessed by IIF, 100% (52/52) were ELISA positive. The ANA patterns indicating the presence of ARA were a fine-speckled nucleoplasmic stain with additional occasional bright dots, with or without concurrent punctate nucleolar staining. In the SSc control group, the ELISA attained a specificity of 98%, ARA being detected in 17/809 patients.

Conclusions

We report the outcome of a study on a large population of SSc patients that shows the ARA ELISA to be of high analytical sensitivity and specificity. We confirm that there is minimal overlap between ARA and other SSc-specific autoantibodies. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the presence of ARA correlates with identifiable patterns by IIF on HEp-2 cell substrate.

### Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis detected by indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA [^113khJue]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The literature suggests that ARA do not produce a specific pattern by IIF on HEp-2 cell substrate; however, we contend that discrete patterns of fluorescence can be used to identify this antibody. There was 100% concordance between IIF and the ELISA method when testing 52 sera with suspected ARA. This demonstrates that the patterns can be reliably identified by experienced observers and suggests that recognition should be within the capability of most laboratory scientists with appropriate training.

To confirm that the distinct patterns observed on HEp-2 cell substrate were not specific to the slides routinely used in our laboratory we tested ARA-positive sera on substrate cells from six different manufacturers. Staining was found to be consistent on all slides tested. The fine-speckled staining produced by ARA is different to that produced by Ro antibodies and the punctate nucleolar staining can be readily distinguished from other patterns of nucleolar fluorescence such as the homogeneous nucleolar staining seen with anti-PmScl antibodies and the clumpy nucleolar staining associated with AFA. Recently, two groups have assessed IIF as a means of detecting ARA, but principally with a focus on nucleolar patterns of fluorescence. They both concluded that although present in a subset of patients, nucleolar IIF was not a sensitive marker for ARA and that it could not be used to screen for these antibodies. Our results are entirely consistent with these conclusions and in line with previous findings we estimate nucleolar fluorescence to be present in only 30% of ARA-positive sera. It is not the presence of nucleolar staining but that of the typical fine-speckled nucleoplasmic pattern that is the distinctive finding on IIF. Consistent with our observation, Yamasaki et al. reported the presence of the nucleoplasmic pattern in all of their tested ARA-positive patients.

The availability of an ELISA method has made it possible to quantify ARA for the first time, an advance that may provide further correlations to clinical manifestations of disease. Preliminary evidence has suggested that ARA levels may change over the course of disease. The majority of patients in the ARA-IP group had long-standing disease whilst those identified by IIF (and subsequently confirmed by ELISA) were predominantly newly diagnosed. Although we found no statistically significant difference in antibody levels for the two ARA-positive groups, the median titre of ARA in the ARA-IF group was observed to be higher than that for the ARA-IP group (median 90.5 U/ml vs 73 U/ml). Further work with serial samples is needed to identify any relationship between ARA titre and both disease progression and organ involvement.

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^1126CNaf]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-nuclear antibody assay (ANA) is the screening test of choice for diagnosis of almost all systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) because of its greater sensitivity compared with other assays, even though its specificity is much lower (Box 1). The gold standard method for ANA detection is still indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on human epithelial (HEp-2) cells, as the alternative tests cannot display comparable sensitivity. However, the technique is time-consuming and requires skilled operators. This fact together with the widespread increase in ANA requests and the reduction of laboratory facilities because of the budget constriction generated a strong need for advanced automated platforms as in other branches of the laboratory medicine.

ANA automated reading systems

Currently, at least six commercial systems for the automated reading of ANA IIF are available: Aklides (Medipan, Dahlewitz, Germany), EUROPattern (Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany), Helios (Aesku Diagnostics, Wendelsheim, Germany), Image Navigator (ImmunoConcepts, Sacramento, CA), NOVA View (Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA), and Zenit G-Sight (A. Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy).

These systems are based on a composition of different hardware modules combined with mathematical pattern-recognition software algorithms, enabling fully automated image acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of IIF ANA tests.

Samples can be classified as positive or negative and the main IIF pattern recognized (Table 1). In addition, quantitative fluorescence intensity value (equivalent to the end-point titer) can be obtained. To date, 13 studies have been published assessing the reliability of automated IIF analysis as a standardized alternative for the conventional manual visual approach (Table 2).

Table 1
Types of indirect immunofluorescence pattern identified by the currently available automated systems for anti-nuclear antibody assay

Table 2
Automated/manual positive–negative agreement (PNA) for each anti-nuclear antibody indirect immunofluorescence reading system, based on 13 published studies

The reported advantages of these systems include reduction in intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory variability, improvement in correlation between staining patterns with corresponding autoantibody reactivities, higher throughput in laboratory workflows, no requirement for a darkroom, integrated file storage, and easy retrieval of scanned wells.

P134 Diagnostic significance of nailfold videocapillaroscopy in the early detection of oligosymptomatic juvenile dermatomyositis

N. Yudkina, A. Volkov, I. Nikishina

V. A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology, Moscow, Russian Federation

Correspondence: I. Nikishina

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): P134

Introduction: Establishing the diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis (jDM) in pediatric patients is particularly challenging in the absence of classical manifestations such as Gottron's papules or erythema, heliotrope rash, proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase (CK), or disease-specific autoantibodies. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) is not currently included in international diagnostic criteria for jDM but may prove useful in clinically ambiguous or atypical presentations.

Objectives: To evaluate the role of NVC within the diagnostic workup of children with suspected onset of a systemic connective tissue disease.

Methods: We present two unrelated female patients aged 2 and 4 years, referred to pediatric rheumatology following dermatological evaluation for persistent facial erythema of unclear origin. Initial working diagnoses included contact or allergic dermatitis. Screening tests revealed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), raising suspicion of a systemic connective tissue disease, prompting referral to rheumatology. Both patients underwent comprehensive laboratory and instrumental evaluation, including NVC.

Results: Clinical examination revealed persistent, slightly elevated, non-pruritic, non-scaling facial erythema in both cases. Classic cutaneous and muscular features of jDM (Gottron's papules/erythema, heliotrope rash, periorbital edema, proximal muscle weakness) were absent. ANA titers exceeded 1:640 in both patients. Immunoblot testing for anti-dsDNA, Sm, RNP, Ro, La, nucleosomes, Scl-70, and centromere antibodies was negative. Complement levels (C3, C4), CBC, urinalysis, ESR, and CRP were within normal ranges. The older patient had mildly elevated CK-MB and LDH, with normal total CK, ALT, and AST. NVC was performed as an additional diagnostic tool. In both cases, capillaroscopic findings showed a non-specific but characteristic pattern frequently seen in inflammatory myopathies, particularly dermatomyositis. Key features included altered loop morphology, reduced capillary density, disorganization, microhemorrhages, giant and bushy capillaries. These findings supported a presumptive diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis and guided further clinical management.

### Frequency and clinical utility of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigen in the setting of a negative antinuclear antibody test [^112PGT1D]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Simultaneous antibody testing during screening for autoimmune conditions is discouraged. The incidence of positive extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) in the setting of a negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) has been reported as low. Our objective was to characterize the frequency of diagnosis of new ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD) in the setting of a negative ANA with a positive ENA.

Methods

This was a 7-year retrospective study from a multicenter tertiary health network in Australia. Clinical information was sought on patients over 18years old who had a negative ANA but positive ENA test result. Results were extracted from hospital computer systems.

Results

From March 19, 2011, to July 23, 2018, ENA testing was ordered simultaneously with an ANA test on 4,248 occasions in 3,484 patients. ANA was positive in 2,520 patients (59.3%) and ENA was positive in 1,980 patients (46.6%). Among positive ANA patients, ENA was positive in 1,563 patients (62.0%). Among 1,728 negative ANA tests, ENA was positive in 417 (24.1%) (P < 0.001). A total of 328 patients with discordant ANA/ENA results had data available for further analysis, of whom 279 had no pre-established rheumatologic condition. A new AARD was diagnosed in 17 of 279 patients, yielding a positive predictive value of 6.09% (95% confidence interval 3.59–9.58).

Conclusion

Despite the higher-than-expected incidence of positive ENA in the setting of a negative ANA, the yield of newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was low. Our findings support the stepwise addition of ENA requests when an ANA test result is positive and clinical suspicion of an AARD is high.

### Automated evaluation of ANA under real-life conditions [^111iiTXa]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTD) are a heterogeneous group of systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). These diseases are characterised by their specific autoantibody (AAB) profiles. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) play a significant role and can be used for diagnosis, exclusion and monitoring of disease. ANA is a collective term for a large and heterogeneous group of circulating AAB. Reflecting their clinical importance, ANA are diagnostic or classification criteria for SLE, SSc, SjS, MCTD and UCTD.

For the determination of ANA, a two-step approach has been established using visual indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on human epithelial-2 (HEp-2) cells as an initial screening test and another specific immunoassay as a confirmatory test.

The main advantages of ANA testing by IIF are the wide range of detectable antibodies, the high sensitivity and the possibility of simultaneously determining reactivity, titre and immunofluorescence pattern. Nevertheless, visual IIF has some substantial disadvantages. These assays require reading by experts, which is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Also, the correct pattern recognition depends on the individual qualification and experience of the investigator. Therefore, visual IIF is expensive and prone to interlaboratory and intralaboratory variability. There were intermediate intentions to substitute IIF with solid phase assays, such as ELISA, to reduce the burden of this process; however, these plans were abolished when unsatisfactory sensitivity was reported. Consequently, IIF has recently been confirmed by the American College of Rheumatology as the gold standard for ANA screening. As a result of this decision and an increased demand for ANA testing, automated IIF processors have been developed by the biomedical industry. Their intention is to offer standardised, cost-efficient and reliable IIF assays.

F. 1.
ANA patterns by IIF on HEp-2 cell substrate. (A) Fine-speckled nucleoplasmic stain with additional occasional bright dots: ARA. (B) Fine-speckled nucleoplasmic stain with additional occasional bright dots accompanied by punctate (speckled) nucleolar staining: ARA. (C) Fine-speckled nucleoplasmic stain: anti-Ro. (D) Clumpy nucleolar stain: AFA. (E) Homogenous (very fine speckled) nucleoplasmic with homogenous nucleolar stain: anti-PmScl.

Eight hundred and nine disease control sera (SSc patient sera characterized for autoantibody and not exhibiting either of the characteristic staining patterns of ARA) were subsequently tested for the presence of ARA by ELISA. Out of these, 792 were negative for ARA, providing a specificity of 98%. The median level of ARA in each of the control antibody groups was between 5 and 6 U/ml compared with the overall median for the combined ARA group, 77 U/ml (Fig. 2). Statistically significant negative associations with the presence of ARA were obtained for the ACA, ATA, AFA, anti-Pm-Scl, anti-U1-RNP, NDA, and FSNU groups (P < 0.001 by Fisher's exact test). ARA was detected in 17 of 809 control samples with 10 having only low levels of reactivity (20–30 U/ml). None of these showed any evidence of the characteristic ANA patterns associated with ARA. IP results were available for the single ELISA positives in the anti-AATS and anti-Ku groups. Neither was positive for ARA by this method.

F. 2.
ARA detected by ELISA in 1018 SSc patients divided into groups based on autoantibody profile. Boxes show interquartile ranges, lines within the boxes indicate median values and lines outside the boxes indicate maximum and minimum values excluding outliers (represented by dots). Numbers in each group are shown on the figure. The line represents the 20 U/ml cut-off suggested by the manufacturer.

2.2 Case 2

A 22‐year‐old female patient, who was healthy except for hypothyroidism, was referred to the emergency department with abrupt onset of itchy and painful annular erythematous lesions of extensor surfaces including hands and feet (Figure 1g). Other symptoms included joint pain, fatigue, and vomiting but no fever. Ten days earlier she had received the first dose of mRNA‐1273 (Moderna) without any localized ADR except for muscle pain. Her family history included neither skin nor rheumatic diseases. Laboratory investigations were normal except for low titers of speckled ANA (1:80) and a strongly positive blot for anti‐DFS70 antibodies. Negativity for anti‐SSA/SSB antibodies was identified via immunoblot. Histopathological examination of a representative lesion from her foot showed slight interface dermatitis and marked periadnexal inflammatory infiltrates (Figure 1h–j). MxA was only partly expressed by the epithelium but strongly by the lymphocytic infiltrate around eccrine sweat glands (Figure 1i). DIF displayed slight granular deposits of C3 along the basal membrane in absence of immunoglobulins (Figure 1k). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded, and the presence of DFS70 antibodies argued against genuine SCLE. Not all three major criteria of RS were met and we diagnosed drug‐induced SCLE mimicking RS, accordingly. A short pulse of prednisolone 1 mg/kg bodyweight p.o. in combination with ibuprofen and topical corticosteroids led to prompt improvement of all symptoms. As the patient experienced recurrent immobilizing joint pain in the following weeks, the second dose of the vaccine was adjourned and she is currently treated with etoricoxib.

### Isolated anti-SS-B (La) antibodies: rare occurrence and lack of diagnostic value [^11458swW]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We conducted a retrospective study across three hospitals of the Assistance Publique — Hôpitaux de Paris from 1 June 2016 to 30 April 2024.

To ensure consistency of the immunological results, the positivity of anti-SS-B was standardised. First, SS-B positivity was assessed by ELISA or addressable laser beam immunoassay (ALBIA) with a threshold positivity of 1 in the antibody ratio or Antibody Index (AI) respectively. Patients presenting with associated anti-SS-A were excluded from the study. Then a positive anti-SS-B result was retained only if confirmed by immunodot. ALBIA identification was performed using the Bioplex 2200 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA), ELISA and immunodot identification using the extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) profile plus and Euroline ANA Profile 3 plus DFS70 (IgG) (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), targeting ENA. Clinical and biological data and diagnoses were collected from computerised patient records.

Qualitative data are presented as numbers and percentages; quantitative data as medians, means and IQRs. Comparisons of the mean values of the anti-SS-B titres were carried out using an unpaired t-test to assess statistical significance.

### Diffuse erythema with "angel wings" sign in Belgian patients with antismall ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme antibody-associated dermatomyositis [^113zBpG2]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old man (case 1) presented with diffuse pruritic erythema that persisted for months. Dermatological examination revealed Gottron's papules, shawl- and V-sign, heliotrope edema and erythema, Gottron's sign on the elbows and knees, and diffuse erythema on the back with central sparing, consistent with the "angel wings" sign (Fig 1, A). Skin histopathology demonstrated a lichenoid junctional inflammatory infiltrate. The patient exhibited proximal muscle weakness without dysphagia, normal serum creatine kinase levels, but aberrant electromyography findings (smaller and polyphasic motor unit potentials in the iliopsoas and deltoideus muscles). Pulmonary function tests and thoracic computed tomography findings were normal. Antinuclear antibody testing was positive with a nuclear fine speckled pattern at a titer of 1/80, and anti-SAE1/2 antibodies were detected (D-tek immunodot assay, Belgium). Initial treatment with topical betamethasone dipropionate and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was insufficient, necessitating adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (initiated at 2 g/kg over 3 days, followed by 1 g/kg/month) and methotrexate (17.5 mg/week). At present, cutaneous disease activity is decreasing, but the "angel wings" sign persists.

### Autoantibody-positive healthy individuals display unique immune profiles that may regulate autoimmunity [^115XJMU8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are detected in almost one‐fifth of the general population, yet few individuals are diagnosed as having an autoimmune disease 1, 2. Thus, a substantial percentage of the population carries detectable levels of circulating autoantibodies without developing clinical symptoms. Autoantibodies are also present in the sera of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), many years before clinical disease onset 3, 4. Although some ANA‐positive healthy individuals eventually develop clinical autoimmunity, many do not. The transition to clinical SLE has been correlated with autoantibody profiles combined with female sex, but other risk factors, including age, ANA titer, number of autoantibody specificities, and type I interferon (IFN) signature, do not definitively identify ANA‐positive healthy individuals in whom autoimmune disease develops eventually 5, 6, 7, 8. Comparing ANA‐positive healthy individuals with SLE patients and ANA‐negative healthy controls provides a unique perspective in the dissection of pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmunity and may reveal the means to provide regulatory control.

A delicate balance of inflammatory and regulatory immune cells is required to control infection without promoting autoreactivity. Evolving work has suggested that interactions between both the adaptive and innate immune systems are critical for autoimmune disease pathogenesis 9, 10, 11, 12. For example, IFN‐associated gene signatures are elevated in peripheral blood of SLE patients and correlate with increased disease activity 13, 14, 15, 16. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) are a primary source of type I IFN in SLE 17, 18 and produce type I IFN upon Toll‐like receptor (TLR) stimulation, particularly TLR‐7 and TLR‐9. These receptors may be activated by immune complexes containing double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) and/or RNA‐associated binding proteins in SLE 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. The IFN signature in SLE is detected in leukocytes involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, such as B cells, T cells, neutrophils, and myeloid cells. However, whether ANA‐positive healthy individuals have a heightened IFN response remains unknown 15, 16.

### Anti-DFS70 antibodies: a useful biomarker in a pediatric case with suspected autoimmune disease… [^112uMVSa]. publications.aap.org (2014). Low credibility.

Antidense fine speckles 70 antibodies, a peculiar antinuclear antibody pattern by indirect immunofluorescence, is frequently observed in ANA-positive individuals with no evidence of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease. They may be found in many different inflammatory conditions and in healthy individuals. We herein report a case of an 8-year-old girl presenting with generalized edema, hypertension, hepatomegaly, and a history of pharyngitis, which occurred 3 weeks earlier. Laboratory analysis revealed low complement C3, microhematuria, and proteinuria. A diagnosis of acute glomerulonephritis was made. Anti-dsDNA, antiextractable nuclear antigens, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. However, a highly positive ANA immunofluorescence test with dense fine speckles pattern was found. The presence of anti-DFS70 immunoglobulin G antibodies was confirmed by a specific immunoassay.

In conclusion, the presence of isolated anti-DFS70 antibodies may be useful to exclude an autoimmune pathogenesis in those children with a positive ANA test and a clinical picture possibly attributable to systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease. This will avoid further unnecessary investigation with the potential for incorrect diagnosis and possibly harmful treatment.

### Don't test antinuclear antibodies (ANA) subserologies… [^117WDZbc]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Tests for ANA subserologies are usually negative if the ANA is negative. Exceptions include anti-Jo1, which can be positive in some forms of myositis, or occasionally, anti-SSA, in the setting of lupus or Sjögren syndrome. Broad testing of autoantibodies should be avoided; instead, the choice of autoantibodies should be guided by the specific disease under consideration.

### Don't order antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear… [^113MEpFB]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Testing for antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen should be avoided in the investigation of widespread pain or fatigue alone. Instead, testing should be performed only in patients suspected to have a diagnosis of a connective tissue disease. ANA positivity can be as high as 20% in patients with nonrheumatic conditions and healthy individuals. For this reason, proper pretest probability is important, and false-positive results may lead to further unnecessary testing. Repeat testing is also not recommended unless the clinical picture changes significantly.
