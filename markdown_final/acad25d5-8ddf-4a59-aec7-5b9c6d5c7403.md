## Question

how to manage hb below 7 in a patient in blast crisis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a hemoglobin below 7 g/dL in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and transfusion thresholds in this high-risk hematologic emergency. Then, I should verify disease-directed therapy to achieve a second chronic phase and prepare for transplant. Next, I will review supportive care, including leukostasis risk and coagulopathy. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidity adjustments. Finally, I will outline monitoring, reassessment, and documentation points to ensure safe, guideline-concordant care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why Hb < 7 g/dL matters here. CML blast crisis is an acute leukemia state with high tumor burden, marrow failure, and frequent cytopenias; profound anemia at Hb < 7 g/dL worsens tissue hypoxia and can precipitate cardiac ischemia, neurologic compromise, and decompensation, so I need to act promptly while planning definitive therapy [^114mzWkY] [^112gz4GK].

> I should confirm the transfusion threshold before jumping to conclusions. The AABB 2023 guideline supports a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy and explicitly allows a threshold of < 7 g/dL in hospitalized adults with hematologic and oncologic disorders, which fits this scenario; NCCN AML guidance similarly uses 7–8 g/dL thresholds in stable, nonbleeding patients, reinforcing a restrictive approach here [^111tGvjU] [^112JvVec]. Wait, let me verify the caveat: if the patient is actively bleeding, hemodynamically unstable, or has significant cardiopulmonary comorbidity, a higher threshold and more liberal strategy may be warranted, so I need to check vitals, ECG, and symptoms before finalizing the trigger [^113JjGta] [^112gz4GK].

> Next, I should review product selection and modifications. I need to ensure leukocyte-reduced, CMV-safe RBCs, and if the patient is a potential transplant candidate, I should request irradiated products to mitigate transfusion-related GVHD risk. I should also anticipate alloimmunization risk with repeated exposures and plan antigen matching if transfusion burden rises [^112JvVec] [^114wwmZG]. Hold on, I should verify that CMV serostatus is known; if CMV-negative and a transplant candidate, CMV-negative units are preferred, but if unavailable, leukoreduced CMV-safe units are acceptable in many centers [^114wwmZG].

> I will now examine the transfusion execution details. Single-unit transfusions with reassessment of symptoms and Hb after each unit help avoid overtransfusion; in a stable, nonbleeding inpatient with Hb < 7 g/dL, I would transfuse 1 unit, then recheck Hb and symptoms, targeting roughly 7–9 g/dL rather than normalizing Hb, and I should document pre- and post-transfusion assessments to track response and tolerability [^116vkp5R] [^113JjGta]. But wait, what if the patient is profoundly volume depleted from bleeding? In that case, I should prioritize hemostatic resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization alongside RBC support, adjusting thresholds accordingly [^111bZAbe].

> Let me consider adjuncts to transfusion while definitive therapy proceeds. I should double-check for reversible contributors to anemia: iron, B12, and folate deficiencies are common in blast crisis and should be corrected; however, ESAs are not recommended in myeloid malignancies like CML due to limited benefit and increased thrombotic risk, so I should avoid ESAs here and rely on transfusions for support [^115mtAtf] [^115Ffinn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost considered an ESA out of habit for cancer-associated anemia; that would be a mistake in CML blast crisis, so I will stick to transfusions and nutrient repletion only [^115mtAtf].

> Now, I need to ensure disease-directed therapy is initiated in parallel because transfusion alone is temporizing. I should confirm BCR-ABL mutation status and start an appropriate TKI, often a second-generation agent such as dasatinib, with or without chemotherapy depending on myeloid versus lymphoid phenotype, to achieve a second chronic phase and enable allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which remains the only curative option in blast crisis [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA] [^114mzWkY]. Hold on, I should verify that transplant logistics are in motion early; guidelines emphasize urgent transplant evaluation and proceeding to allo-SCT as soon as feasible after cytoreduction [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA].

> I will now examine supportive care priorities that intersect with anemia management. Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis can worsen hypoxemia and organ dysfunction; if WBC is very high with symptoms, cytoreduction with hydroxyurea, leukapheresis, or even a single dose of cytarabine may be indicated while definitive therapy is arranged, and I should monitor for TLS and DIC as disease control proceeds [^112hEmS2] [^114wW1hZ]. I need to ensure platelet thresholds are respected for bleeding risk; in non-APL acute leukemia without active bleeding, a platelet transfusion threshold around 10 × 10^9/L is standard, with a higher threshold if bleeding or procedures are present [^115vTE2P] [^111jiqBh].

> Let me think about special populations and comorbidity adjustments. In older adults or those with coronary artery disease, I should consider a slightly more liberal transfusion threshold, often around 8 g/dL, to balance myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Conversely, in younger, stable patients without cardiopulmonary disease, adhering to < 7 g/dL is reasonable if they remain asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable [^111tGvjU] [^111zj53d]. For pediatric patients, I should confirm pediatric-specific pathways and transplant timelines, recognizing that lymphoid-predominant blast crisis in children requires tailored induction and early allo-SCT planning, with transfusion support adapted to age and symptoms [^117T9XHJ] [^114jmyri].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment cadence. After each RBC unit, I will check Hb, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and symptom burden. I should also trend lactate if tissue hypoperfusion is suspected and obtain serial ECGs if ischemia is a concern at low Hb levels [^111iu7p9]. I need to ensure daily CBC with differential to track response to TKI and chemotherapy, and I should reassess transfusion needs dynamically as disease control improves or worsens, documenting transfusion indications and outcomes each time [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with overarching principles. The core steps are: stabilize with restrictive RBC transfusion using a < 7 g/dL trigger in stable, nonbleeding patients; correct reversible causes of anemia; avoid ESAs in myeloid malignancy; initiate mutation-informed TKI ± chemotherapy to achieve a second chronic phase; and expedite allo-SCT referral as the curative pathway, with supportive care for leukostasis and cytopenias throughout [^111tGvjU] [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA] [^115mtAtf]. I need to ensure that transfusion decisions remain individualized by symptoms, comorbidities, and bleeding risk, and that I document the rationale each time to maintain clarity during this high-acuity course [^111iu7p9] [^112JvVec].

In blast crisis, **Hb < 7 g/dL warrants immediate transfusion** with a single RBC unit, reassessing symptoms and hemodynamics after each unit to avoid overtransfusion [^111tGvjU] [^117QbNoA]. Use **irradiated, leukoreduced, CMV-seronegative units** for transplant candidates, and transfuse to a target of 7–8 g/dL in stable patients, or 8–9 g/dL if symptomatic or with cardiovascular disease [^111zj53d] [^112JvVec]. Concurrently, initiate **TKI-based induction** (e.g. dasatinib or ponatinib) with or without chemotherapy to achieve a second chronic phase and proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation as soon as possible [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA]. Avoid **ESAs** due to limited efficacy and increased thrombotic risk in myeloid malignancies [^115mtAtf].

---

## Indications for red blood cell transfusion

Transfusion decisions in blast crisis should be individualized, balancing **symptom relief**, **oxygen delivery**, and **risks of transfusion-related complications**. General indications include:

- **Symptomatic anemia**: Fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, or chest pain attributable to anemia.

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Tachycardia, hypotension, or signs of tissue hypoxia.

- **Active bleeding**: Ongoing hemorrhage or procedural needs.

- **Severe anemia**: Hb < 7 g/dL in stable patients without active bleeding or significant comorbidities [^111tGvjU].

---

## Recommended transfusion thresholds and targets

Evidence-based transfusion thresholds and targets for patients with hematologic malignancies, including blast crisis, are summarized below:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Transfusion threshold** | **Target hemoglobin** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable, asymptomatic patient | Hb < 7 g/dL | 7–8 g/dL [^112yp9s2] |
| Symptomatic patient or cardiovascular disease | Hb < 8 g/dL | 8–9 g/dL [^notfound] |
| Active bleeding or procedural need | Higher threshold based on clinical judgment | ≥ 10 g/dL |

---

## Special considerations in blast crisis

Blast crisis presents unique challenges that necessitate **tailored transfusion strategies**:

- **Leukostasis risk**: Hyperleukocytosis can cause leukostasis, worsening tissue hypoxia. Leukapheresis or hydroxyurea may be required to reduce blast burden before or alongside transfusion [^112hEmS2] [^114wW1hZ].

- **Coagulopathy**: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is common. Transfuse platelets and cryoprecipitate as indicated, maintaining platelets > 50×10⁹/L in active bleeding or invasive procedures [^notfound].

- **Transfusion reactions**: Alloimmunization and febrile reactions are more frequent. Use leukoreduced, irradiated blood products, especially in transplant candidates [^114wwmZG].

---

## Risks and benefits of transfusion in blast crisis

Balancing risks and benefits is essential; **benefits** include improved oxygen delivery, reduced symptoms, enhanced quality of life, and better tolerance of induction therapy, whereas **risks** include transfusion reactions, alloimmunization, iron overload, volume overload, and infection transmission.

---

## Alternative therapies and supportive measures

While transfusion is the mainstay for acute management of severe anemia in blast crisis, **additional supportive measures** should be considered:

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: Generally not recommended in myeloid malignancies due to limited efficacy and increased thrombotic risk [^115mtAtf].

- **Iron chelation**: Consider in patients with repeated transfusions to prevent iron overload.

- **Nutritional support**: Correct deficiencies (iron, B12, folate) to optimize erythropoiesis.

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Patients require **close monitoring** during transfusion:

- **Vital signs**: Monitor for transfusion reactions and hemodynamic instability.

- **Symptom assessment**: Reassess fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness after each unit.

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation parameters as indicated.

- **Iron status**: Monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation to guide chelation therapy.

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

Long-term management focuses on **disease control** and **preventing recurrence of severe anemia**:

- **Disease control**: Achieve a second chronic phase with TKI therapy (e.g. dasatinib, ponatinib) with or without chemotherapy, and proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) as the only curative option [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA].

- **Supportive care**: Continue transfusion support as needed, with iron chelation to prevent overload.

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor for relapse, progression, and complications of transfusion therapy.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Immediate transfusion**: Single RBC unit, reassess symptoms and hemodynamics after each unit [^111iu7p9].

- **Transfusion targets**: 7–8 g/dL in stable patients; 8–9 g/dL if symptomatic or with cardiovascular disease [^111zj53d] [^117QbNoA].

- **Special considerations**: Address leukostasis, coagulopathy, and transfusion reactions proactively [^112hEmS2] [^114jWtWX].

- **Long-term management**: Achieve second chronic phase with TKI therapy and proceed to allo-SCT; avoid ESAs [^114p9Goa] [^115mtAtf].

---

Managing Hb < 7 g/dL in blast crisis requires a **restrictive transfusion strategy** with careful monitoring, balancing symptom relief and oxygen delivery against transfusion risks, while concurrently pursuing definitive disease control and curative transplantation.

### Educational session: managing chronic myeloid leukemia as a chronic disease [^117ERz5N]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Elucidation of the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has transformed this disease from being invariably fatal to being the type of leukemia with the best prognosis. Median survival associated with CML is estimated at > 20 years. Nevertheless, blast crisis occurs at an incidence of 1%-2% per year, and once this has occurred, treatment options are limited and survival is short. Due to the overall therapeutic success, the prevalence of CML is gradually increasing. The optimal management of this disease includes access to modern therapies and standardized surveillance methods for all patients, which will certainly create challenges. Furthermore, all available TKIs show mild but frequent side effects that may require symptomatic therapy. Adherence to therapy is the key prerequisite for efficacy of the drugs and for long-term success. Comprehensive information on the nature of the disease and the need for the continuous treatment using the appropriate dosages and timely information on efficacy data are key factors for optimal compliance. Standardized laboratory methods are required to provide optimal surveillance according to current recommendations. CML occurs in all age groups. Despite a median age of 55–60 years, particular challenges are the management of the disease in children, young women with the wish to get pregnant, and older patients. The main challenges in the long-term management of CML patients are discussed in this review.

Acute myeloid leukemia — post–first-cycle actions by blast percentage and count recovery: If there is no morphologic remission (blasts are ≥ 5%) at first cycle response assessment but evidence of efficacy exists, a second cycle should proceed without interruption with the goal of achieving morphologic remission, and a repeat BM biopsy should be performed on days 21 to 28 of this cycle or subsequent cycles until morphologic remission is achieved. If blasts are < 5% at first cycle response assessment and counts have recovered (CR), a second cycle can proceed. If blasts are < 5% at first cycle response assessment and cytopenias are present (morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS] or CRi), all treatment should be held and the following measures should be considered: growth factor support, if indicated; and a treatment-free interval for up to 14 days, and longer delays may also be considered. When counts have recovered to a clinically significant threshold (ANC > 0.5 x 10^9/L and platelets > 50 x 10^9/L), the next cycle of treatment can begin, and if counts have not recovered to a clinically significant threshold, consider repeating the BM biopsy.

### Shifting ground and gaps in transfusion support of patients with hematological malignancies [^116vkp5R]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

The transfusion support of hematological malignancies considers 2 dimensions: the quantity of what we order (in terms of triggers, doses, targets, and intervals), and the special qualities thereof (with respect to depths of matching and appropriate product modifications). Meanwhile, transfusion-related enhancements in the quantity and quality of life may not be dose dependent but rather tempered by unintended patient harms and system strains from overexposure. Evidence and guidelines concur in endorsing clinically noninferior conservative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion care strategies (eg, triggering at hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL and in single-unit doses for stable, nonbleeding inpatients). However, the unique subpopulation of patients with hematological malignancies who are increasingly managed on an outpatient basis, and striving at least as much for quality of life as quantity of life, is left on the edges of these recommendations, with more questions than answers. If a sufficiently specific future wave of evidence can satisfy the concerns (and contest the assumptions) of the remaining proponents of liberalism, and if conservatism is broadly adopted, savings may be potentially immense. These savings can then be reinvested to address other gaps and inconsistencies in RBC transfusion care, such as the best achievable degrees of prophylactic antigen matching that can minimize alloimmunization-related service delays and reactions.

### Pathobiology of lymphoid and myeloid blast crisis and management issues [^111AnPFN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Despite recent improvements in the treatment of early-stage disease, the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains a therapeutic challenge. For imatinib-naïve patients, imatinib provided encouraging hematologic and cytogenetic benefits; however, the vast majority of CML blast crisis cases today arise in patients already on imatinib-based therapy. Clonal evolution and duplication of the Philadelphia chromosome continue to be associated with blastic phase transformation, but recent studies have identified BCR/ABL kinase domain mutations in 30%-40% of blast crisis patients. This implies that BCR-ABL-targeted therapy might have influenced the molecular road map to blastic transformation. In this review, we will examine the effect of imatinib on primitive CML progenitors and how this might influence the pathophysiology of blast crisis. A rational framework for deciding how best to integrate stem cell transplantation, traditional chemotherapy, imatinib, and other BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in the care of blast crisis patients will also be discussed.

### Prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia presenting in advanced phase is defined mainly by blast count, but also by age, chromosomal aberrations and hemoglobin [^111LrfUV]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is usually diagnosed in chronic phase, yet there is a small percentage of patients that is diagnosed in accelerated phase or blast crisis. Due to this rarity, little is known about the prognosis of these patients. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors for this cohort. We identified 283 patients in the EUTOS population-based and out-study registries that were diagnosed in advanced phase. Nearly all patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Median survival in this heterogeneous cohort was 8.2years. When comparing patients with more than 30% blasts to those with 20–29% blasts, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.32 (95%-confidence interval (CI): [0.7–2.6]). Patients with 20–29% blasts had a significantly higher risk than patients with less than 20% blasts (HR: 2.24, 95%-CI: [1.2–4.0], P = 0.008). We found that the blast count was the most important prognostic factor; however, age, hemoglobin, basophils and other chromosomal aberrations should be considered as well. The ELTS score was able to define two groups (high risk vs non-high risk) with an HR of 3.01 (95%-CI: [1.81–5.00], P < .001). Regarding the contrasting definitions of blast crisis, our data clearly supported the 20% cut-off over the 30% cut-off in this cohort. Based on our results, we conclude that a one-phase rather than a two-phase categorization of de novo advanced phase CML patients is appropriate.

### Transfusion strategy [^111iu7p9]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

As is often the case in medicine, the risk to benefit ratio of blood transfusion requires careful examination. The decision to transfuse a patient cannot be based only on the haemoglobin or the haematocrit concentration. In a given clinical situation, tolerance to anaemia will depend on the ability of the patient to recruit his compensatory mechanisms in accordance with his metabolic demand. Maintenance of circulating volume is of paramount importance. In the absence of a universal transfusion trigger, decision to transfuse a patient with an haemoglobin concentration between 7.0 and 10.0 g dL-1 depends primarily on clinical judgement. With the exception of emergency situations, blood transfusion will be realized on a unit-by-unit basis, and the efficacy of treatment should be evaluated after each transfused unit.

### Management of children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase: international pediatric CML expert panel recommendations [^117T9XHJ]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast phase (CML-BP) is characterized by clinical, phenotypic, and genetic features of acute leukemia. CML-BP can occur as an initial presentation of CML (de novo CML-BP) or as a progression from the chronic (CP) or accelerated (AP) phases of CML (secondary CML-BP).

After the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the annual rate of progression from CML-CP to AP or BP dramatically decreased to 1–1.5% from more than 20%. However, the prognosis for adult patients with de novo or secondary CML-BP remains poor; median survival is less than 1 year. The low incidence of CML in pediatric patients (1–2.2 cases per million per year, with 7–10% being diagnosed with BP) and the lack of specific clinical trials mean that there is minimal evidence to inform the optimal management of CML-BP in children and adolescents. In contrast to adult patients, children and adolescents with CML-BP present with a distinct predominance of the lymphoid phenotype (70–80% vs. 20–30% in adults) and a varying landscape of chromosomal aberrations differing from the classical major route additional cytogenetic aberrations in advanced phase adult CML. Those leukemic features also complicate the distinction between pediatric de novo lymphoblastic CML-BP and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph +) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), confronting treating physicians with further therapeutic uncertainty.

Thus, the treatment of CML-BP remains one of the major challenges in the management of patients with CML. Although the overall prognosis in CML-BP seems to be better in children than adults, consistent data regarding the optimal management of CML-BP in children and adolescents are lacking given small case numbers. Published evaluations of various cohorts are highly heterogeneous in their treatment regimens for de novo and secondary CML-BP in children.

The practical recommendation aims to reduce variability in the management of pediatric patients diagnosed with CML-BP, with particular focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of this challenging disease stage. Efforts to standardize the approach may provide more consistent data and, potentially, a platform for future clinical studies.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^112Nuqmt]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative approach for CMML. However, the long‐term outcome is worse compared to myelodysplastic syndromes, primarily due to a higher relapse rate. Nevertheless, it is justified to perform allogeneic stem cell transplantation in selected patients. Comprehensive recommendations have been put together by an international expert group summing up what is known in the field. A careful 'holistic' assessment of patient fitness and prognosis is mandatory to select those patients who can tolerate the transplantation and to meet the challenges in the post‐transplantation period. Age and comorbidities reflected by different scores as well as the wish of the patient must be taken into account. Regarding disease biology, high‐risk disease according to CPSSmol should prompt transplantation planning without delay. Early transplantation should also be considered if a CPSSmol 'intermediate 2' risk is accompanied by additional risk factors such as high medullary and/or peripheral blast count, symptomatic haematopoietic insufficiency leading to transfusion need, constitutional symptoms, presence of high‐risk somatic mutations that are not included in the CPSSmol, a considerable number of somatic mutations and relapse after or refractoriness to prior therapy. CPSSmol 'intermediate 1' and 'low‐risk' disease should entail a regular reassessment of disease biology in order to detect progression as early as possible, potentially considering transplantation during the course of the disease. It is debatable if pretransplantation debulking using induction chemotherapy or HMA can improve the outcome. Debulking may be necessary if the malignant cells are highly proliferative, and in patients for whom a donor is not easily available. If a timely transplantation with a suitable donor is possible, pretransplant treatment is not recommended, in order to avoid selection of therapy‐resistant CMML clones. The type of donor (matched related, matched unrelated, haploidentical donor or unrelated cord blood) bears no detectable impact on treatment success, neither is the stem cell source. The choice of conditioning intensity should be based on individual circumstances, taking into account disease biology, patient fitness and donor availability. Predictive factors on OS and leukaemia‐free survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been investigated in a multicentre study by Zhou et al. The authors discovered high marrow blast count (> 10%), higher age (> 60 years), low haemoglobin (< 10 g/dL) and non‐ TET2 mutations as being independently associated with poor outcome. These results are not surprising as they represent CMML2, haematopoietic insufficiency, poor genetics and older age as universal high‐risk parameters in the context of myeloid malignancies. This means that exactly those parameters that identify a patient to be at high risk are the same that identify the patient to have a worse chance of cure.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^115uDH2j]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end‐organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease‐modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100 g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole‐blood viscosity‐related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.

### Do liberal thresholds for red cell transfusion result in improved quality of life for patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia? A randomized crossover feasibility study [^114jfUmY]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety and other secondary outcomes are reported in Table 2. Numerically higher numbers of culture-verified infections, thrombotic events and grade 3 or 4 bleeding were seen during liberal cycles, although numbers are small.

We have previously identified the need for further trials to identify optimal transfusion support for patients with AML. In our study, we have successfully recruited patients with AML to follow liberal or restrictive transfusion strategies and demonstrated feasibility of a randomized crossover trial. Only two earlier small randomized trials to date have explored the impact of transfusion thresholds on outcomes in AML. A feasibility trial of patients with acute leukemia compared thresholds of 80 g/L versus 120 g/L, but no QoL measures were compared, and the liberal thresholds would be considered high by current standards. Another small study compared 70 g/L versus 80 g/L, but the hemoglobin differences between arms appeared too small to generate separation between arms. The TRIST study examined hemoglobin thresholds of 70 g/L versus 90 g/L in 300 patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, but the findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with AML.

### Management of children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase: international pediatric CML expert panel recommendations [^114jmyri]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia has improved significantly with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and treatment guidelines based on numerous clinical trials are available for chronic phase disease. However for CML in the blast phase (CML-BP), prognosis remains poor and treatment options are much more limited. The spectrum of treatment strategies for children and adolescents with CML-BP has largely evolved empirically and includes treatment principles derived from adult CML-BP and pediatric acute leukemia. Given this heterogeneity of treatment approaches, we formed an international panel of pediatric CML experts to develop recommendations for consistent therapy in children and adolescents with this high-risk disease based on the current literature and national standards. Recommendations include detailed information on initial diagnosis and treatment monitoring, differentiation from Philadelphia-positive acute leukemia, subtype-specific selection of induction therapy, and combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Given that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation currently remains the primary curative intervention for CML-BP, we also provide recommendations for the timing of transplantation, donor and graft selection, selection of a conditioning regimen and prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease, post-transplant TKI therapy, and management of molecular relapse. Management according to the treatment recommendations presented here is intended to provide the basis for the design of future prospective clinical trials to improve outcomes for this challenging disease.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^112XNCbC]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2022 the WHO revised the classification of disease phase in CML, omitting the concept of AP, and defining BP as the presence of > 20% blasts. Their rationale is persuasive. The distinction of the three phases by arbitrary cut-offs of blast percentages rather than by a better understanding of disease biology is less acceptable in the modern era of genomics. Multiple studies have shown that genetic changes in BP are rarely found in CP but are present in AP, suggesting that CML is a biphasic disease. In practice most patients with either definition of AP at the time of diagnosis are treated with TKI and the majority have responses similar to those in CP, such that the classification does not change patient management. At least one study has shown that patients with blasts between 20% and 30% have an outcome more similar to those with blasts > 30% than those between 10% and 20% and suggests that these patients may be candidates for more aggressive treatment including where possible, alloSCT. The emergence of ACA in Ph+ cells in a patient with pre-existing disease is associated with an increased risk of disease progression, but the prognostic impact of ACA present at diagnosis in a patient with chronic phase disease is less clear and the type of the ACA may also be important. Finally since the key diagnostic criterion for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) changed from ≥ 30% to ≥ 20% blasts in blood or marrow, progression to BP was no longer aligned with other chronic myeloid neoplasms. The WHO definitions recognize that patients can present with high- risk features detailed in Table 2, and that existing patients can develop changes predictive of impending disease progression that may impact treatment choices.

Table 2
Definitions of disease phase: ELN 2013, WHO 2016, ICC 2022, WHO 2022.

The proposed changes are controversial. Counter-arguments include the long-standing acceptance and understanding of the phrase 'acceleration', which might indicate the need for a second generation TKI (2GTKI) from diagnosis, the inability to study AP patients in future clinical trials and difficulties in comparing outcomes of previous studies in all phases of the disease (which largely use the ELN criteria of previous recommendations) with those of future trials. The controversy is reflected in the opinions of our panel such that we cannot fully endorse either classification. However both acknowledge that there are patients who present with features of more advanced disease who may benefit from more potent drugs and closer monitoring, and that evolution of disease in a patient is an indication of progression.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^1171DHZ8]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end-organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease-modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole-blood viscosity-related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.

Pre-transplant cytoreduction and timing — Early referral for transplant evaluation is recommended to allow moving to transplant efficiently. Pre-transplant debulking therapy to reduce marrow blasts to < 5% blasts with the goal of reducing post-transplant relapse is recommended, although the optimum strategy has not been determined. Reducing the disease burden pre-transplant is particularly important in patients who will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, and at some centers, failure to achieve < 5% blasts with cytoreduction did not preclude from proceeding to transplant, as these patients appeared to derive survival benefit from transplant.

Table 4
Diagnostic work-up of relapse after allogeneic HSCT.

Since the use of DLIs was first reported in the 1990s, strategies to treat relapse after HSCT have relied on their use. Historically, the graft-versus-leukemia effect is well described in adult CML, and DLI has been proven to induce durable remission. Nevertheless, data for CML-BP exclusively are sparse, and it is unclear whether the immunologic effects after allogeneic HSCT have a similar impact. Studies in adults have demonstrated synergy when DLIs are combined with TKIs. In a retrospective analysis of 215 CML patients who relapsed post-transplantation, outcomes after treatment with TKI combined with DLI, TKI only, and DLI only were examined. In multivariate analysis, disease status before HSCT was significantly associated with OS, and OS was similar in patients who received only a TKI and in those who received a TKI plus DLI (P = 0.81). The authors concluded i) that despite the use of a TKI before transplantation, TKI salvage therapy provides a significant OS benefit for CML relapse after HSCT, and ii) that adding DLI to a TKI does not appear to improve OS. In another smaller series of 46 adult patients treated between 1993 and 2012 with either DLI (N = 28) or a TKI (N = 18) during a first CML relapse after HSCT (CML-CP, 37; CML-AP, 9), DLI was associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio, 37.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–625.4; P = 0.01), shorter failure-free survival (hazard ratio, 21.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.8–251; P = 0.02), a higher cumulative incidence of failure (hazard ratio, 19.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–236.5; P = 0.02), and an increased incidence of treatment-induced GvHD (68% vs. 6%; P = 0.001). A major concern is that DLI might induce severe GvHD, especially when administered early after HSCT. In a large series of 500 adult patients receiving treatment with DLI for CML relapse after HSCT (16% molecular, 30% cytogenetic, and 54% hematologic), the probability of survival in remission without secondary GvHD was highest (> 50% at 5 years) when DLI was given beyond one year from HSCT for a molecular and/or cytogenetic CML relapse not preceded by chronic GvHD.

Regarding medical management for acute myeloid leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of thrombocytopenia, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to administer empiric platelet transfusion (one standard adult unit) for a daily platelet count < 10×10⁹/L in patients with acute leukemia without active bleeding or coagulopathy. Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.

### Outcomes using lower vs higher hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion [^117QbNoA]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is a lower vs higher hemoglobin threshold best for minimizing both red blood cell use and adverse clinical outcomes when used to trigger red blood cell transfusions in anemic patients in critical care and acute care settings?

Bottom Line

Compared with higher hemoglobin thresholds, a hemoglobin threshold of 7 or 8 g/dL is associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of hospital stay.

### Consensus minimum hemoglobin level above which patients with myelodysplastic syndromes can safely forgo transfusions [^114ehfFA]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2020). Medium credibility.

The anemia of MDS often results in decreased quality of life, which is invoked to justify red cell transfusions; however, there are sparse data regarding the minimum hemoglobin (Hb) at which it is safe to forgo transfusions for patients with no evidence of end-organ damage. This issue is even more important in the COVID-19 era, where decreases in blood donations have stressed the blood supply. In March 2018, using a modified Delphi method, we convened a panel of 13 expert MDS clinicians for three iterative rounds to discuss a minimum safe Hb for this population. While the panel was unable to reach the pre-set consensus of 75% for a specific Hb threshold, there was 100% consensus that it be no greater than 7.5g/dL. Our data suggest that, given no end-organ effects of anemia, patients with MDS can safely forgo transfusions with a Hb of 7.5g/dL or higher.

### Red blood cell transfusion for hematologic disorders [^113xmEQh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have determined, in surgical and critically ill patients, relatively safe hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds of 7–8 g/dL to guide restrictive transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). However, in patients with various hematologic disorders, strong evidence in support of such an approach is sparse and the optimal transfusion practice is yet to be defined. This review focuses on RBC transfusion practice in three hematologic diseases and a treatment strategy, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These entities manifest in a broad spectrum of anemia, acute or chronic, in patients with different comorbidities and degrees of transfusion requirement. Thus the nuances in the indications of RBC transfusion and the goals to achieve in these specific situations may have been underappreciated. The limited data available highlight the importance of titrating RBC transfusion based on the clinical context and patient characteristics. Future RCTs are necessary to firmly establish the Hb thresholds associated with improved outcomes relevant to these specific patient populations, which will facilitate the personalized decision-making in RBC transfusion.

### Management of RBC-transfusion dependence [^112i49Lz]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Strategies for the management of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have evolved following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of three new therapeutics from one of symptom amelioration with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to one of active treatment. Most patients develop transfusion-dependent anemia over the course of their disease, however, and its adverse consequence on the natural history of disease has only recently been appreciated. Although severe anemia contributes to symptoms of fatigue and reduced quality of life, transfusion dependence increases the risk of organ complications from iron overload coupled with an increased risk of leukemia transformation. Among World Health Organization categories without elevation in bone marrow myeloblasts, an incremental rise in RBC transfusion burden is associated with a proportionate reduction in both overall survival and leukemia-free survival, implying that anemia severity is an important variable limiting the otherwise favorable natural history of patients with lower risk disease. Moreover, therapeutic strategies that successfully restore effective erythropoiesis, such as erythropoetic stimulating agents, immunomodulatory agents, immunosuppressive therapies, or hypomethylating agents, may favorably affect the natural history of this disease, creating perhaps a new urgency for the initiation of erythropoietic promoters that have durable clinical benefit. Selection of primary therapy for the management of anemia should consider four response determinants: age, RBC transfusion burden and duration, endogenous erythropoietin production, and karyotype.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification and management [^114c4L26]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, characterized by prominent monocytosis and an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15%-20% over 3–5years).

Diagnosis

Newly revised diagnostic criteria include sustained (> 3months) peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis (≥ 0.5×10 9 /L; monocytes ≥ 10% of leukocyte count), consistent bone marrow (BM) morphology, < 20% BM or PB blasts (including promonocytes), and cytogenetic or molecular evidence of clonality. Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while > 95% harbor somatic mutations: TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), RAS pathway (~30%), and others. The presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact overall survival (ASXL1 WT /TET2 MT genotype being favorable).

Risk Stratification

Several risk models serve similar purposes in identifying high-risk patients that are considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) earlier than later. Risk factors in the Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10×10 9 /L, hemoglobin < 10g/dL, platelet count < 100×10 9 /L, and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells; the resulting 4-tiered risk categorization includes high (≥ 3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors); the corresponding median survivals were 16, 31, 59, and 97months. CMML is also classified as being "myeloproliferative (MP-CMML)" or "myelodysplastic (MD-CMML)", based on the presence or absence of leukocyte count of ≥ 13×10 9 /L.

Treatment

ASCT is the only treatment modality that secures cure or long-term survival and is appropriate for MMM high/intermediate-2 risk disease. Drug therapy is currently not disease-modifying and includes hydroxyurea and hypomethylating agents; a recent phase-3 study (DACOTA) comparing hydroxyurea and decitabine, in high-risk MP-CMML, showed similar overall survival at 23.1 versus 18.4months, respectively, despite response rates being higher for decitabine (56% vs. 31%).

Unique Disease Associations

These include systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, leukemia cutis and lysozyme-induced nephropathy; the latter requires close monitoring of renal function during leukocytosis and is a potential indication for cytoreductive therapy.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112AkPKH]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Supportive care for patients with AML who prefer not to receive blood transfusions — panel considerations: There is no established treatment of AML that does not require use of blood and blood products for supportive care, and with limited data, providing guidelines or recommendations for AML management in this context is challenging, and the Panel believes that in many cases, good outcomes from these strategies are rare. At the outset, it is important to discuss the goals of care with the patient and establish an understanding of the complications that can arise without transfusions, and it will be helpful to ascertain if the patient will accept certain blood products (eg, cryoprecipitate) and stem cells (either autologous or from another donor source). To mobilize peripheral blood stem cells and/or bring up hemoglobin levels prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, some treatment centers have used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), G-CSF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics; however, before using this strategy, the potential risks, benefits, and uncertainties of using these agents in this context should be thoroughly discussed. Consider referring the patient to centers with expertise in bloodless autologous transplant, and for patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses and for this reason refuse blood transfusions, the U.S. branch of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses has Hospital Liaison Committees that may provide helpful information about bloodless medicine. Regarding treatment options, the Panel recommends considering less myelosuppressive induction including dose reduction of anthracyclines and use of nonintensive chemotherapy, and some options may include targeted agents guided by testing for actionable mutations instead of intensive chemotherapy, especially in a noncurative setting; however, the Panel notes that dose reductions in chemotherapy without transfusion support in patients with AML is associated with a lower rate of remission, high mortality by severe anemia, and is unlikely to result in durable remissions.

Results

The hemoglobin thresholds prompting RBC transfusion varied across studies, with a restrictive threshold generally defined as a hemoglobin level of 7 to 8 g/dL and a permissive threshold typically ranging from a hemoglobin level of 8.5 to 10 g/dL (Table 1). Hemodynamic instability typically has been defined as hypotension (mean arterial pressure, < 65 mm Hg, or systolic BP, < 100 mm Hg), tissue hypoperfusion caused by acute bleeding, or both.

### How I treat CML blast crisis [^114mzWkY]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Blast crisis (BC) remains the major challenge in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is now generally accepted that BC is the consequence of continued BCR-ABL activity leading to genetic instability, DNA damage, and impaired DNA repair. Most patients with BC carry multiple mutations, and up to 80% show additional chromosomal aberrations in a nonrandom pattern. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved survival in BC modestly, but most long-term survivors are those who have been transplanted. Patients in BC should be treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to mutation profile, with or without chemotherapy, with the goal of achieving a second chronic phase and proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation as quickly as possible. Although long-term remissions are rare, allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides the best chance of a cure in BC. Investigational agents are not likely to provide an alternative in the near future. In view of these limited options, prevention of BC by a rigorous and early elimination of BCR-ABL is recommended. Early response indicators should be used to select patients for alternative therapies and early transplantation. Every attempt should be made to reduce or eliminate BCR-ABL consistent with good patient care as far as possible.

Myelodysplastic syndromes — use of intensive chemotherapy: For patients eligible for intensive therapy who lack a donor hematopoietic cell source, or when the marrow blast count requires reduction, consideration should be given to the use of intensive induction chemotherapy; although the response rate and durability are lower than for standard acute myeloid leukemia (AML), this treatment, particularly in clinical trials with novel agents, could be beneficial in some patients. For patients with a potential hematopoietic cell donor who require reduction of tumor burden, achievement of even a partial remission may be sufficient to permit the HCT.

Anemia in patients with malignancy is common as a consequence of their disease and treatment. Substantial progress has been made in the management of anemia with red blood cell transfusion in acute conditions, such as bleeding and infection, through the performance of large clinical trials. These trials suggest that transfusion at lower hemoglobin thresholds (restrictive transfusion ∼7–8 g/dL) is safe and in some cases superior to higher transfusion thresholds (liberal transfusion ∼9–10 g/dL). However, additional studies are needed in patients with malignancy to understand best practice in relation to quality of life as well as clinical outcomes.

### Dasatinib (Phyrago) [^11232Gqy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who experienced severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following dose interruption or reduction; permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2% of adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and 5% of adult patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin and Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia were reported in patients with all phases of CML but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML. Elevations in transaminases or bilirubin were usually managed with dose reduction or interruption. Patients developing Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia during dasatinib therapy often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation.

Laboratory abnormalities reported in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML are shown in Table 12. There were no discontinuations of dasatinib therapy in this patient population due to biochemical laboratory parameters.

### Management of children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase: international pediatric CML expert panel recommendations [^1178ko3g]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Composition of the expert panel and the consensus-building process

The panel of experts — 22 members of the pediatric CML working party (pCML-WP) of the International-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) study group and additional national representatives, all with clinical and research expertise in pediatric CML and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) — met annually at the I-BFM plenary meetings and at additional regular online working meetings. Unless otherwise indicated, there was complete consensus for the recommendation after the panel discussion. The panel discussion was based on a systematic search of the English-language literature in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus databases. The search criteria specified studies involving pediatric patients with CML in an advanced phase and treatment with HSCT, using these terms: ("chronic myeloid leukemia" OR "CML") AND ("pediatric" OR "children" OR "adolescents" OR "childhood") AND ("advanced phase" OR "accelerated phase" OR "blast phase"). Searches were conducted on January 18, 2022, and were limited to studies published from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2021. The resulting 104 unique records were screened by title and abstract. Case reports or case series with fewer than 10 patients and studies in adult patients or studies that excluded advanced phases of CML were excluded. The 19 resulting articles underwent a full-text assessment for eligibility, which finally identified 10 studies that provided specific data about HSCT in pediatric patients with CML-BP (Table 1). The resulting recommendation is based on these pediatric studies and, when no such data were available, on recommendations adapted from those for adult patients and from experience in pediatric Ph + ALL. Evidence was graded according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. The grade of recommendation for each statement is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Management of toxicities of TKI therapy — hematologic toxicities: Cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) should be managed with transient interruptions of TKI therapy and dose modifications. Assessment of reticulocyte count, ferritin, iron saturation, vitamin B12, and folate and correction of nutritional deficiencies if present is recommended for patients with grade 3–4 anemia. Red blood cell transfusions are indicated in symptomatic patients, and growth factor support can be used in combination with TKI therapy for the management of persistent cytopenias. Bone marrow evaluation should be considered to rule out disease progression to AP-CML or BP-CML or the emergence of other myeloid neoplasms after TKI therapy. The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) did not impact survival or cytogenetic response rate, but was associated with a higher thrombosis rate in patients with CP-CML, and the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the FDA do not support the use of ESAs in patients with myeloid malignancies.

### Management and outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era-analysis of the European LeukemiaNet blast phase registry [^112JcpMD]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has become a paradigm of successful targeted treatment for hematologic malignancies. Inhibition of the abnormal tyrosine kinase BCR::ABL1 has transformed this once deadly disease in a controllable entity, with most patients having a normal life expectancy and with some patients being able to successfully stop treatment after having achieved a deep molecular response. Despite the success of CML treatment, progression to blast phase (BP), an aggressive form of acute leukemia associated with unfavorable prognosis, may occur. Prior to the introduction of TKI virtually all patients who did not undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) progressed to BP, with a mortality rate of more than 20% per year in the majority of studies. The implementation of TKI into CML management has dramatically changed this scenario, and nowadays less than 5% of patients develop BP disease. Nevertheless, in contrast to major advances in chronic phase (CP) CML, outcome is still dismal for this important minority of patients. BP can be of myeloid, lymphoid, mixed, or megakaryoblastic phenotype, can evolve from a previous CML, but can also be the disease presentation at diagnosis, the so-called de novo BP. Treatment of BP with TKI monotherapy often leads to short-term remissions, with inevitably almost all patients experiencing a disease relapse if alloSCT is not performed. Due to the rarity of this condition and the lacking of clinical trials most of the available recommendations are based on retrospective analyses and expert consensus. Further, the definition of BP is not homogeneous. The ELN recommendation panel considers a BP when the proportion of blasts in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow is ≥ 30%. Conversely, the WHO define a BP already with a percentage of blasts ≥ 20%. Although the prognosis of patients with 20–29% blasts seems to be similar to the one of patients with ≥ 30% of blasts, definitions should be harmonized, in order to have uniform inclusion criteria into clinical trials and registries. The biology of BP also poses an additional challenge. Although some features of BP are well characterized, it remains unclear how the biology of the disease might have changed after the introduction of TKI. To address these open issues, and to set the basis for the set-up of future clinical trials, an international registry was established with the aim of collecting biological and clinical data on CML in BP to better understand disease characteristics and treatment approaches in the TKI era.

Glucocorticoids (GC)

Glucocorticoids have been the only drugs proven to be of use for ineffective erythropoiesis in DBA. While approximately 80% of patients respond to an initial course of GC treatment, the exact mechanism by which they exert a positive clinical effect is still not well understood (Vlachos et al, 2008). Hypotheses include an anti‐apoptotic effect on early erythroid progenitors, involving p53 (also termed TP53) activity, and improvement of cell‐cycle progression and proliferation of erythroblasts (Von Lindern et al, 1999; Sjogren et al, 2015). Treatment with GC is not recommended in patients less than 1 year old, but can be considered in children for whom venous access for transfusions is a problem. In general, treatment with GC is started in an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/day prednisone for a maximal trial of 4 weeks. It is recommended to start treatment with GC around 2 weeks after transfusion, aiming for Hb levels low enough to prevent suppression of erythropoiesis, and high enough to induce a haematological response (increase of reticulocytes and haemoglobin), which can be expected within a few weeks. After 4 weeks, in case of a response, slow tapering (in particular below doses of 1 mg/kg/day) is indicated to the lowest effective doses. There is a published consensus guideline on tapering GC from 2 mg to 1 mg/kg/day in 8–12 weeks (Vlachos et al, 2008). However, in our experience this is accompanied by considerable steroid toxicity, often necessitating an attempt to taper more rapidly. An adequate response is defined as a Hb level > 90 g/l in combination with transfusion independency. In general doses up to 0·5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg on alternate days are considered acceptable with regards to long term toxicities (Vlachos et al, 2008; Vlachos & Muir, 2010). If transfusions are still needed, the trial is considered a failure. Nevertheless, in selected patients, an acceptable GC dose in combination with erythrocyte transfusions at a very low frequency (a few times per year) can be considered. In patients that do not respond to GC treatment, it is generally recommended to do a second attempt after 12–18 months; a third attempt is not considered to be useful. Some patients require very low maintenance doses of prednisone to keep Hb levels between adequate, and sometimes individually adjusted, levels (mean 80–90 g/l), but cannot stop completely. It is advised to carefully taper low maintenance doses to prevent overshooting the individual minimal effective dose. In patients that are treated long term with GC, physicians should monitor for specific long‐term toxicities, including cataract and osteoporosis, which will be further discussed below. In addition, in specific cases in which higher doses of GC (exceeding 0·5 mg/kg/day) are required for longer periods, appropriate preventive measures for infectious complications, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, should be considered.

Transfusion end points

Most patients with LR-MDS are anemic. As MDS progresses, anemia can worsen leading to RBC transfusion dependency. A low transfusion burden is defined as requiring 3 to 7 units of RBCs within 16 weeks (with a maximum of 3 in 8 weeks), whereas a high transfusion burden entails ≥ 8 units in 16 weeks (or ≥ 4 in 8 weeks). Anemia in MDS and RBC transfusion dependency are associated with worse QoL, increased morbidity, and decreased life expectancy as the RBC transfusion burden increases. Accordingly, transfusion burden reflects disease severity. However, achievement of RBC-TI has not been predictive of improved OS in clinical trials, as evidenced by data from the MEDALIST and IMerge studies. Regardless, minimizing transfusions mitigates risks such as infection, alloimmunization, and iron overload. Drugs that eliminate the need for RBC transfusions have the potential to improve QoL and reduce morbidity, making RBC-TI a meaningful early clinical end point for trials.

To ensure consistency across MDS trials, the group recommended establishing a standard hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7.5 to 8 g/dL. Notably, although this threshold is generally considered "safe", physicians should not dogmatically adhere to it. Some patients may prefer transfusions at higher thresholds to optimize symptoms and functionality. It is important to note that lower transfusion thresholds commonly used for hospitalized patients (eg, < 7 g/dL) are considered too austere for older, active outpatients with MDS. Transfusion density should be assessed over a 16- to 24-week period before study enrollment, when practical, categorizing patients as having either a low or high transfusion burden. The duration of RBC-TI should be assessed for periods ≥ 16 weeks.

Of note, attribution of transfusions to intercurrent illnesses (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding) or drug-induced thrombocytopenia may prove problematic and lead to biases in assessments of RBC-TI. Therefore, the primary analysis of efficacy should be based on raw transfusion data in the intention-to-treat population, followed by sensitivity analyses considering the causality of intermittent transfusion needs. A "time without transfusion reliance" analysismay also capture the cumulative benefit of an intervention. Of note, hemoglobin improvement alone does not suffice as an end point in MDS trials. End points that directly measure clinical benefits in patients with MDS and disease impact on overall health should be used.

### Management of cancer-associated anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: ASCO / ASH clinical practice guideline update [^116rWL33]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Society of Hematology (ASH) recommendations for use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with cancer.

Methods

PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs in patients with cancer published from January 31, 2010, through May 14, 2018. For biosimilar ESAs, the literature search was expanded to include meta-analyses and RCTs in patients with cancer or chronic kidney disease and cohort studies in patients with cancer due to limited RCT evidence in the cancer setting. ASCO and ASH convened an Expert Panel to review the evidence and revise previous recommendations as needed.

Results

The primary literature review included 15 meta-analyses of RCTs and two RCTs. A growing body of evidence suggests that adding iron to treatment with an ESA may improve hematopoietic response and reduce the likelihood of RBC transfusion. The biosimilar literature review suggested that biosimilars of epoetin alfa have similar efficacy and safety to reference products, although evidence in cancer remains limited.

Recommendations

ESAs (including biosimilars) may be offered to patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia whose cancer treatment is not curative in intent and whose hemoglobin has declined to < 10 g/dL. RBC transfusion is also an option. With the exception of selected patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, ESAs should not be offered to most patients with nonchemotherapy-associated anemia. During ESA treatment, hemoglobin may be increased to the lowest concentration needed to avoid transfusions. Iron replacement may be used to improve hemoglobin response and reduce RBC transfusions for patients receiving ESA with or without iron deficiency. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.hematology.org/guidelines.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^112gz4GK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In addition to hemorrhagic shock, the risk of withholding blood replacement therapy during active hemorrhage remains a cogent issue. The measured Hb at the time of hemorrhage fails to accurately reflect true red cell mass or oxygen-carrying capacity. Rather, it is not until the lost red cell mass is replaced with non-RBC replacement solutions (for example, crystalloids and/or colloids) that the decrease in Hb concentration can be accurately measured. Such volume replacement therapy is imperative in a patient with intravascular depletion and carries its own adverse risks. Some of the concerns with regards to the transfusion of RBCs are shared by crystalloid volume replacement – volume overload, electrolyte derangement, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. Replacing shed blood with intravenous fluids/colloids therefore carries increased morbidity and can be life-threatening, and is not a panacea to withholding blood product transfusion. The bridge here, between clear benefit to transfusion versus that of a restrictive algorithm, is in knowing when a patient is at risk for a serious hemorrhage and a consequent severe anemic state (Hb < 6 to 7 g/dl). In circumstances of high risk, or when volume resuscitation is required, the hazard of developing progressive anemia, end-organ ischemia, or fluid overload should be considered, and adherence to restrictive or Hb-based transfusion strategies is not only suboptimal but outside the premise of the guideline.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia — coagulopathy screening and transfusion targets — Because coagulopathy is common in patients with APL, it is important to screen with evaluation of PT, PTT, and fibrinogen during the initial workup and before any invasive procedure. Clinical coagulopathy is managed by aggressive transfusion support to maintain platelet counts of ≥ 50 x 10^9/L, by fibrinogen replacement with cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma to maintain a level > 150 mg/dL, and by maintenance of PT and PTT close to normal values, with daily monitoring until resolution. Given the risks at diagnosis, invasive procedures including leukapheresis and/or central line placement should be avoided, and, if possible, diagnosis may be made using peripheral blood samples to minimize bleeding complications until coagulopathy is adequately controlled.

### Do liberal thresholds for red cell transfusion result in improved quality of life for patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia? A randomized crossover feasibility study [^111GagqC]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on intensive treatment are dependent on red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, but the evidence base defining optimal transfusion threshold support in AML is very weak. We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled feasibility trial in patients transfused below 70 (restrictive, R) or 90g/L (liberal, L) hemoglobin. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of randomizing to two hemoglobin thresholds in the setting of AML and assessing quality of life (QoL) among participants. We incorporated a novel crossover design between cycles of intensive chemotherapy, thus allowing patients to serve as their own control, and assessed QoL at multiple intervals.

Patients were eligible if ≥ 18 years, and treated with curative intent for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML, or myelodysplasia with excess of blasts (MDS-EB). Patients with prior MDS were excluded. Participants were randomized (1:1, web-based service, stratified by center) by day 5 of chemotherapy in cycle 1, to restrictive transfusion (threshold 70 g/L; target 71–80 g/L) or liberal transfusion (threshold 90 g/L, target 91–100 g/L); participants then crossed over to the alternative policy for the second cycle (groups R/L and L/R, respectively). Follow-up was until the end of the second cycle, or 42 days from start of cycle two, whichever was earlier.

NCCN myelodysplastic syndromes — supportive care — The standard of care for MDS management includes supportive care measures in addition to relevant specific care, entailing observation, clinical monitoring, psychosocial support, and quality-of-life (QOL) assessment, and patients should receive support prior to transplant. Supportive care should include red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for symptomatic anemia as needed (CMV-safe [CMV-negative or leukopheresed]) or platelet transfusions for bleeding events; however, platelet transfusions are generally not used routinely in patients with thrombocytopenia in the absence of bleeding. CMV-safe blood products are recommended whenever possible for recipients who are CMV-negative, and both the number of transfusions as well as the number of packed RBCs per transfusion should be kept to a minimum in patients who are classified as non-cardiac and in patients anticipated to be heavily transfused. The Panel agreed that all directed-donor products and transfused products for patients who are potential transplant candidates should be irradiated. Antibiotics are recommended for bacterial infections and prophylaxis may be considered when starting patients on therapy, consistent with local hospital guidelines. Aminocaproic acid or other antifibrinolytic agents may be considered for bleeding episodes refractory to platelet transfusions or for profound thrombocytopenia, and hematopoietic cytokine support should be considered for refractory symptomatic cytopenias.

Lower-risk myelofibrosis (MF) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — patient selection should be individualized with defined triggers for referral. Although outcomes after allogeneic HCT are better for lower-risk MF, high transplantation-related morbidity and mortality mean decisions should be individualized. Allogeneic HCT should be considered for lower-risk MF with refractory, transfusion-dependent anemia, circulating blast cells > 2% in peripheral blood, adverse cytogenetics, or molecular abnormalities. Evaluation for allogeneic HCT is recommended for patients with low platelet counts or complex cytogenetics, and the MTSS can be helpful in predicting post-transplant survival when counseling about transplant.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Updates on accelerated and blast phase myeloproliferative neoplasms: are we making progress? [^113Rt8eZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management approaches for accelerated and blast phase myeloproliferative neoplasms remain challenging for clinicians and patients alike. Despite many therapeutic advances, outcomes for those patients who are not allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant eligible remain, in general, very poor. Estimated survival rates for such blast phase patients is frequently reported as less than 6months. No specific immunological, genomic or clinicopathological signature currently exists that accurately predicts the risk and timing of transformation, which frequently induces a high degree of anxiety among patients and clinicians alike. Within this review article, we provide an up-to-date summary of current understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of accelerated and blast phase disease and discuss current therapeutic approaches and realistic outcomes. Finally, we discuss how the horizon may look with the introduction of more novel agents into the clinical arena.

G4 is Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated with Permanently discontinue ICPi, IV prednisone corticosteroids 1–2 mg/kg/d, consideration of other immunosuppressive drugs if no improvement, and RBC transfusion per existing guidelines with Discuss with blood bank team before transfusions that a patient with possible ICPi SAE is in the hospital. Additional considerations include Monitor hemoglobin levels weekly until the steroid tapering process is complete. Thereafter, less frequent testing is needed.

### Outpatient transfusions for myelodysplastic syndromes [^114RvGVE]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) often need extended periods of red blood cell or platelet transfusion support, with the goal to manage symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, and improve quality of life. Many questions about the optimal approach to transfusion management in MDS, especially in the outpatient setting, remain unanswered, including hemoglobin and platelet thresholds for transfusion. Restrictive transfusion approaches are often practised, but whether these are appropriate for outpatients with MDS, who are often older and may be frail, is not known. Current schedules for transfusion-dependent patients are burdensome, necessitating frequent visits to hospitals for sample collection and blood administration. Questions of optimal schedule and dosage are being explored in clinical trials, including the recently completed REDDS study. Patient-reported outcomes and functional assessments are increasingly being incorporated into research in this area so that we can better understand and improve transfusion support for patients with MDS.

### Association of hemoglobin concentration and mortality in critically ill patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^112YJpn2]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.4 million individuals and accounts for greater than 50,000 deaths annually in the US. It is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, but in recent years, advances resulting in improved outcomes for patients with a TBI have been made in critical care. Despite these advances, questions about the non-operative critical care management of TBI, particularly transfusion practices, remain unanswered.

Preventing secondary ischemic injury to neuronal tissue by ensuring adequate cerebral oxygen delivery is a cornerstone of post-TBI resuscitation, and the management of anemia is paramount in this process. Following TBI, up to 46% of patients have a hemoglobin of less than 90 g/L during the first week of admission, and 76% of these patients require a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Transfusion of RBCs has been shown to increase oxygen delivery and brain tissue oxygenation. However, these benefits in patients with a TBI must be weighed against established and potentially harmful effects of RBC transfusion.

Transfusion practices in the critically ill have been studied extensively. Currently, a hemoglobin concentration of 70 g/L is an accepted transfusion trigger in an overall population of non-bleeding critically ill patients. However, the clinical literature examining transfusion thresholds in patients with a TBI is weak and results are conflicting. Both nadir hemoglobin and anemia (hemoglobin of less than 90 g/L) have been associated with increased mortality following TBI. In contrast, a subgroup analysis of the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial, though underpowered, found no difference in mortality between the restrictive (70 to 90 g/L) and the liberal (100 to 120 g/L) transfusion groups for the TBI patients enrolled in the trial. Not surprisingly, no specific recommendation for optimal hemoglobin thresholds in the Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines remains. Although the Lund concept recommends maintaining a hemoglobin concentration of between 125 and 140 g/L, no substantive evidence supporting this threshold remains. Given this uncertainty, we performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the association of mean 7-day hemoglobin concentration and mortality in patients with a severe TBI in an academic trauma center.

### Therapeutic approaches for the management of higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^111r4yym]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneous nature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) demands a risk-adapted therapeutic approach, and higher risk MDS, characterized by an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia and inferior survival, is typically defined based on an integrated assessment of cytopenias, bone marrow blast percentage, and cytogenetic findings using the revised International Prognostic Scoring System. Incorporating mutational data could further refine the risk assessment and identify those with higher-than-expected disease risk. The principal therapeutic goal in this disease subset is to modify the natural history and prolong survival. Allogeneic stem cell transplant, the only potentially curative treatment, should be offered to eligible patients. Hypomethylating agents are the only approved treatment with unsatisfactory response rates and duration, and patients who failed prior hypomethylating agents unfortunately have dismal outcomes with urgent need of novel therapeutic agents. In this review, we provide the therapeutic landscape in higher risk MDS based on the current evidence and discuss the investigational treatment options under development.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^113B35xZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes — therapy overview: HMA therapy is the standard of care for patients with higher-risk MDS, preferably as a bridge to HCT in eligible patients. Treatment for higher-risk disease is dependent on whether patients are possible candidates for intensive therapy, and clinical features include patient age (including patients up to 75 years of age), performance status, absence of major comorbid conditions, psychosocial status, patient preference, and availability of a suitable donor and caregiver. Patients may be taken immediately to transplant or bridging therapy can be used to decrease marrow blasts to an acceptable level prior to transplant. The patient's personal preference for type of therapy needs particular consideration, and supportive care should be provided for all patients.
