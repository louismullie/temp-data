## Question

Guidelines gunshot to abdomen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for managing gunshot wounds to the abdomen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and triage priorities, especially hemodynamics and peritoneal signs. Then, I should verify absolute indications for immediate laparotomy versus when selective nonoperative management is appropriate. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup, including the role of CT and adjuncts like local wound exploration and laparoscopy. After that, I need to examine organ-specific nuances for liver, spleen, kidney, and bowel injuries. I will then consider special scenarios such as shotgun wounds, pelvic trauma, and the open abdomen strategy. Finally, I should confirm antibiotic prophylaxis, observation protocols, and follow-up, and close with a concise decision algorithm that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure with a focused abdominal exam for peritonitis, evisceration, and impalement, because these findings plus hemodynamic instability mandate immediate laparotomy without delay for imaging or adjuncts, and I should not let CT slow me down in those cases [^532e1451] [^e16e5954] [^46d184f6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nonoperative care; I need to check the strict selection criteria for selective nonoperative management, which requires hemodynamic stability, no peritonitis or evisceration, a reliable clinical examination, and the institutional capacity for serial exams, CT, angiography, and immediate operative access, recognizing that failure of SNOM is uncommon but real and that most failures declare within 24 hours, so observation must be vigilant and protocolized [^c8c1dd9f] [^866fd775] [^168a963b].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup in stable patients; CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast is the cornerstone to define trajectory, identify solid organ injuries, and detect free fluid or bowel wall changes, and I should remember that mandatory abdominopelvic CT is associated with lower SNOM failure than selective CT use, though I must interpret CT in clinical context and not rely on it alone to exclude injury [^3bc6c245] [^866fd775] [^84ee60eb].

> Wait, let me verify the role of preoperative CT when laparotomy is already indicated; a retrospective series suggests preoperative CT rarely alters management in patients with clear operative indications and can miss injuries, so I should avoid delaying surgery for CT in those with hypotension, peritonitis, or evisceration, reserving CT for stable patients with equivocal findings or uncertain trajectory [^9df88645] [^532e1451].

> I will now examine adjuncts when CT is equivocal or peritoneal violation is uncertain; local wound exploration can help determine fascial breach, and diagnostic laparoscopy can visualize peritoneal violation and occult diaphragmatic or bowel injuries, guiding toward operation or continued observation, but I need to ensure these are done expeditiously and by experienced teams [^5d5ae4a5] [^c4874c66] [^aa08795f].

> Let me consider solid organ injuries, starting with the liver; in hemodynamically stable patients without peritonitis, nonoperative management of penetrating liver trauma is acceptable with high organ salvage, but I should watch for biliary fistula and consider angioembolization for arterial blush or ongoing bleeding, and I must remember that concomitant head or spinal cord injury and the need for frequent exams complicate NOM decisions [^4cd5fae3] [^ea57bc96] [^e13a0330].

> For splenic gunshot wounds, I should double-check that evidence is weaker; although some centers report success with NOM, the complication rate is higher than with stab wounds, so I should be cautious and reserve NOM for highly selected, stable patients with minor injuries and excellent monitoring, otherwise favoring operative management when in doubt [^82a5b30a].

> Regarding renal injuries, let me verify that stable patients with grade 1–4 penetrating trauma can be managed nonoperatively, and I should actively look for ureteral injuries with delayed-phase CT urography when the trajectory is near the ureter, because hematuria is unreliable and missed ureteral injuries carry significant morbidity [^b80cfdcf] [^3661e9fa] [^07d5ba95].

> For bowel injuries, I need to ensure I do not miss subtle signs; free fluid without solid organ injury, abnormal bowel wall enhancement, and mesenteric stranding increase suspicion, and if these are present I should lower my threshold for laparotomy, whereas isolated solid organ injury without peritoneal signs may still be observed with close monitoring and a low threshold to operate if the exam worsens [^84ee60eb] [^866fd775].

> But wait, what if the mechanism is shotgun rather than single projectile; shotgun wounds have multiple pellets and unpredictable scatter, and although SNOM is used more frequently in shotgun patients, failure occurs earlier and more often, so I should observe closely and escalate promptly if pain, fever, or leukocytosis develop, recognizing that even failed SNOM in this group may still have better outcomes than immediate laparotomy in some series [^9e5aeb33] [^e16e5954].

> I should confirm pelvic GSW specifics; the yield of CT for significant pelvic injuries is high, and in stable patients without hard signs, CT can safely guide management, with cystography or endoscopy reserved for suspected bladder or rectal injuries when CT is equivocal, which helps avoid unnecessary operations [^9c7550ff].

> Next, I should review the open abdomen strategy; in unstable patients with vascular injuries, severe contamination, or physiologic derangement, damage control with temporary abdominal closure is recommended, with early attempts at closure once the patient stabilizes to mitigate complications, and I need to ensure my team is experienced in OA management and resuscitation endpoints [^abe62251] [^1b6eb66f] [^3fd763e9].

> I need to check antibiotic prophylaxis; a single preoperative dose with broad aerobic and anaerobic coverage is indicated for all penetrating abdominal trauma, and if a hollow viscus injury is found, extending to 24 hours is reasonable, whereas routine prolonged prophylaxis without contamination is not supported [^fe15625b] [^fc108730] [^f88c2682].

> Let me verify observation protocols; patients selected for SNOM require serial abdominal exams, frequent vitals, trending hemoglobin, and a low threshold for repeat CT or operative intervention, and importantly, most failures declare within 24 hours, so a minimum 24-hour observation is prudent before discharge, with clear return precautions and close outpatient follow-up [^168a963b] [^866fd775].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis aligns with contemporary outcomes; meta-analyses show SNOM failure around 7% with very low mortality when protocols are followed, and real-world series demonstrate rising NOM utilization with stable or improved mortality, reinforcing that SNOM is safe and effective in experienced centers with rigorous selection and surveillance [^866fd775] [^339a8a64].

> Finally, let me distill a practical decision algorithm: unstable patients or those with peritonitis, evisceration, or impalement go straight to laparotomy; stable patients without peritoneal signs undergo CT-based evaluation with serial exams, proceeding to operation for positive CT findings, evolving peritoneal signs, or declining hemodynamics; in carefully selected solid organ injuries, NOM with angioembolization as indicated is reasonable; and throughout, I should minimize delays, communicate trajectory and injuries clearly, and ensure rapid access to the operating room if the clinical picture changes [^532e1451] [^3bc6c245] [^c8c1dd9f].

Management of abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs) centers on **immediate laparotomy for unstable patients** or those with peritonitis, evisceration, or impalement [^532e1451] [^46d184f6]. For stable patients without peritonitis, **selective nonoperative management (SNOM)** with contrast-enhanced CT and serial exams is safe and reduces nontherapeutic laparotomies [^866fd775] [^3bc6c245]. CT is the primary imaging modality to define trajectory and injuries; **do not delay surgery for imaging** in unstable patients [^ea815734] [^532e1451]. If SNOM is chosen, observe for 24–48 hours with serial exams and labs, and operate for any deterioration [^168a963b] [^ca33fa21]. Give **broad-spectrum antibiotics** for all penetrating abdominal GSWs, and tailor operative management to injuries found [^fe15625b] [^fc108730].

---

## Initial assessment and resuscitation

- **Primary survey**: Airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure (ABCDE) [^notfound].
- **Hemodynamic stability**: Assess for shock, ongoing bleeding, and resuscitate with blood products [^46d184f6].
- **Focused assessment**: Identify peritonitis, evisceration, impalement, or exit wounds [^532e1451].

---

## Indications for immediate laparotomy

Immediate laparotomy is indicated for any of the following:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic instability | Ongoing hemorrhage requiring surgical control [^46d184f6] |
| Peritonitis | Hollow viscus perforation with contamination [^532e1451] |
| Evisceration | Bowel or omentum protrusion indicating major injury [^532e1451] |
| Impalement | Foreign body traversing peritoneum [^532e1451] |
| Unreliable examination | Head injury, intoxication, spinal injury [^e13a0330] |

---

## Selective nonoperative management (SNOM)

SNOM is appropriate for **hemodynamically stable patients without peritonitis** who have a reliable exam and available resources for close monitoring [^c8c1dd9f] [^866fd775]. Benefits include reduced nontherapeutic laparotomies, shorter length of stay, and lower costs [^53cbe245] [^866fd775]. Risks include delayed recognition of hollow viscus injury and a small failure rate (about 7%) [^866fd775] [^ca33fa21].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **Unstable patients**: Do not delay surgery for imaging [^532e1451].
- **Stable patients**: Contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to define trajectory and injuries [^3bc6c245] [^ea815734].
- **CT findings**: Free fluid without solid organ injury, bowel wall abnormalities, or mesenteric stranding suggest bowel injury [^84ee60eb] [^d73f4bb1].

---

## Operative management

- **Exploration**: Midline laparotomy with systematic evaluation of all quadrants [^notfound].
- **Hemorrhage control**: Packing, direct repair, or shunting for vascular injuries [^abe62251] [^dcf839cc].
- **Bowel injuries**: Resection with primary anastomosis or diversion based on physiology and contamination [^105cc162] [^99222e1f].
- **Solid organs**: Repair, resection, or angioembolization as indicated [^7b5b2742] [^07d5ba95].

---

## Postoperative care and complications

Postoperative care includes **ICU monitoring** for hemodynamic instability, respiratory support, and infection surveillance. Complications include infection, wound dehiscence, bowel obstruction, and delayed hemorrhage [^e8516a8d] [^bb3cea53].

---

## Special considerations

- **Shotgun wounds**: Higher risk of multiple injuries; SNOM is less reliable and failure occurs earlier [^9e5aeb33].
- **Pelvic GSWs**: High risk of vascular and urologic injuries; CT cystography and rectal evaluation are essential [^9c7550ff].
- **Pediatric patients**: Similar principles apply, but nonoperative management is more conservative [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and rehabilitation

Follow-up should include wound care, **physical therapy**, and psychological support. Rehabilitation focuses on restoring function and addressing long-term complications such as chronic pain, bowel dysfunction, and PTSD.

---

Management of abdominal GSWs requires rapid triage, **selective operative versus nonoperative strategies**, and coordinated multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes.

### Nonoperative management of abdominal gunshot wounds [^28c33a76]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Mandatory surgical exploration for gunshot wounds to the abdomen has been a surgical dictum for the greater part of this past century. Although nonoperative management of blunt solid organ injuries and low-energy penetrating injuries such as stab wounds is well established, the same is not true for gunshot wounds. The vast majority of patients who sustain a gunshot injury to the abdomen require immediate laparotomy to control bleeding and contain contamination. Nonoperative treatment of patients with a gunshot injury is gaining acceptance in only a highly selected subset of hemodynamically stable adult patients without peritonitis. Although the physical examination remains the cornerstone in the evaluation of patients with gunshot injury, other techniques such as computed tomography, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, and laparoscopy allow accurate determination of intra-abdominal injury. The ability to exclude internal organ injury nonoperatively avoids the potential complications of unnecessary laparotomy. Clinical data to support selective nonoperative management of certain gunshot injuries to the abdomen are accumulating, but the approach has risks and requires careful collaborative management by emergency physicians and surgeons experienced in the care of penetrating injury.

### Selective nonoperative management of abdominal gunshot wounds: what you need to know [^01eced3c]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Since the 1990s, there has been a slow but steady adoption of selective nonoperative management (SNOM) for abdominal gunshot wounds (GSW). Multiple studies have shown that SNOM is feasible and can be performed safely, even at trauma centers with low penetrating trauma volumes. The principles of SNOM for abdominal GSW consists of (1) careful patient selection, (2) diagnostic workup with CT, and (3) clinical observation. By implementing SNOM, the number of patients undergoing a nontherapeutic laparotomy can significantly be improved to less than 10%. Overall, approximately one third of patients with abdominal GSW can be managed nonoperatively. This review article provides a practical approach to the management of patients with an abdominal GSW.

### Evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^4ba4f203]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This is a recommended management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association addressing the management of adult patients with abdominal stab wounds. Because there is a paucity of published prospective randomized clinical trials that have generated Class I data, these recommendations are based primarily on published observational studies and expert opinion of Western Trauma Association members. The algorithm and accompanying comments represent a safe and sensible approach that can be followed at most trauma centers. We recognize that there will be patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the recommended algorithm. We encourage institutions to use this as a guideline to develop their own local protocols.

### Imaging evaluation of abdominopelvic gunshot trauma [^ea815734]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Firearm-related injuries, or gunshot wounds (GSWs), are among the most important worldwide public health problems, resulting in considerable annual morbidity, disability, and mortality. GSWs to the abdomen and pelvis are associated with substantial injuries to multiple organs and tissues. Imaging plays an important role in identifying these injuries, dictating nonoperative management, and determining imaging and clinical follow-up, as well as helping manage potential long-term complications. CT is the primary imaging modality used to evaluate these injuries and their complications, including use of reconstructed multiplanar volume-rendered images. The authors discuss the ballistics and mechanisms of firearm injury, CT findings, trajectory analysis, and applications of different imaging modalities above and beyond CT in evaluation of GSWs. Imaging findings and classifications of the severity of injuries to solid and hollow organs and vascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems are reviewed. Key complications associated with gunshot injuries to the abdomen and pelvis are presented. The challenges of imaging in the acute trauma setting and potential pitfall mimics at imaging, particularly at CT, are also described. A step-by-step guide for thorough and comprehensive evaluation of GSWs to the abdomen and pelvis is introduced, with tips for optimizing effective communication with the clinical team.

### Selective non-operative management of civilian gunshot wounds to the abdomen: a systematic review of the evidence [^f583c2d3]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Selective non-operative management (SNOM) of penetrating abdominal wounds has become increasingly common in the past two or three decades and is now accepted as routine management for stab wounds. Gunshot wounds are more frequently managed with mandatory laparotomy but recently SNOM has been successfully applied. This review systematically appraises the evidence behind SNOM for civilian abdominal gunshot wounds.

Methods

A Medline search from 1990 to present identified civilian studies examining success rates for SNOM of abdominal gunshot wounds. Case reports, editorials and abstracts were excluded. All other studies meeting the inclusion criteria of reporting the success rate of non-operative management of abdominal gunshot wounds were analysed.

Results

Sixteen prospective and six retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria, including 18,602 patients with abdominal gunshot wounds. 32.2% (n = 6072) of patients were initially managed non-operatively and 15.5% (n = 943) required a delayed laparotomy. The presence of haemodynamic instability, peritonitis, GI bleeding or any co-existing pathology that prevented frequent serial examination of the abdomen from being performed were indications for immediate laparotomy in all studies. Delayed laparotomy results in similar outcomes to those in patients subjected to immediate laparotomy. Implementation of SNOM reduces the rates of negative and non-therapeutic laparotomies and reduces overall length of stay.

Conclusions

SNOM can be safely applied to some civilian patients with abdominal gunshot wounds and reduces the rates of negative or non-therapeutic laparotomy. Patients who require delayed laparotomy have similar rates of morbidity and mortality and similar length of stay to those patients who undergo immediate laparotomy.

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^cd56cf35]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose and use of this guideline

The guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation, based on the evidence. These guidelines present methods for optimal management of open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients. They do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They, however, do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which should be finally determined after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the results, however, rests with the engaging practitioners and not aged therein, and not the consensus group.

### The fallacy of a roadmap computed tomography after an abdominal gunshot wound: a road that leads to nowhere [^9df88645]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2019 Western Trauma Association guidelines recommend an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CTAP) in patients with a question of abdominal penetration after a gunshot wound. However, it is common practice to obtain a CTAP to provide a roadmap for an operation or to potentially alter management even in patients with classic indications for a laparotomy. The hypothesis for this study was that a CTAP for preoperative planning has no value in patients with an abdominal gunshot wound.

Methods

This was a retrospective study from 2017 to 2022 of patients with an abdominal gunshot wound who had a preoperative CTAP. Data collection included clinical characteristics and CTAP and operative findings. Admission hypotension, abdominal pain and/or peritonitis, evisceration, and a transabdominal trajectory were considered clear indications for laparotomy. Computed tomography and operative findings were compared to determine concordance and if computed tomography altered management.

Results

There were 149 patients included in the study, of which 72.5% had a clear indication for laparotomy. The CTAP findings were concordant with operative findings in 57.0% of patients, while additional injuries were found at laparotomy in 36.2% of patients. Based on CTAP, a negative diagnostic angiogram was performed in three patients (2.0%). Three patients (2.0%) underwent a trial of nonoperative management based on CTAP findings. All underwent laparotomy after a clinical change. Six patients (4.0%) had a nontherapeutic operation; all patients had findings suspicious for either a hollow viscous injury or a vascular injury on preoperative imaging.

Conclusion

While a CTAP scan may help to define an intra-abdominal trajectory when the trajectory is unclear, it does not alter management in those with indications for operation. In addition, CTAP missed injuries in a third of patients and contributed to all six nontherapeutic laparotomies. A preoperative CTAP has minimal value in patients who have indications for an operation.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e8516a8d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mandatory laparotomy has been standard of care for patients with abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs) for decades. However, this approach is associated with unnecessary, including non-therapeutic (where intra-abdominal injuries are found that do not require intervention) and negative (where no intra-abdominal injuries are found), laparotomies. Further, mandatory laparotomy in patients with abdominal GSWs has been linked with a 22–41% risk of postoperative complications (e.g. surgical site infections, gastrointestinal ileus, pneumonia, and venous thromboembolism) and a 5- to 9-day length of hospital stay.

Selective nonoperative management (SNOM) is frequently conducted in trauma centers in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma who are hemodynamically stable without signs of diffuse peritonitis or evisceration. Although SNOM has been relatively widely adopted for abdominal stab wounds, the concept has not been as embraced for GSWs given the higher associated incidence of visceral and abdominal vascular injuries and the morbidity and mortality associated with missed injuries. Therefore, the practice of SNOM for abdominal GSWs remains controversial among some surgeons.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^46d184f6]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A number of scoring systems that predict the risk of ongoing bleeding, transfusion requirements and coagulopathy have been introduced, but all of these lack prospective validation. Each scoring system has its unique advantages and disadvantages, and specific aspects of each scoring system may affect widespread applicability and statistical performance.

Immediate intervention

Recommendation 5

We recommend that patients with an obvious bleeding source and those presenting with haemorrhagic shock in extremis and a suspected source of bleeding undergo an immediate bleeding control procedure. (Grade 1C)

Rationale

The patient who presents in extremis is a patient who has already lost a large amount of blood and is in a severe shock. If bleeding continues, death in shock is an imminent risk. The source of bleeding may be immediately obvious, and penetrating injuries are more likely to require surgical bleeding control. In a retrospective study of 106 abdominal vascular injuries, all 41 patients arriving in shock following gunshot wounds were candidates for rapid transfer to the operating theatre for surgical bleeding control. A similar observation in a study of 271 patients undergoing immediate laparotomy for gunshot wounds indicates that these wounds combined with signs of severe hypovolaemic shock specifically require early surgical bleeding control. This observation is true to a lesser extent for abdominal stab wounds. Data on injuries caused by penetrating metal fragments from explosives or gunshot wounds during the Vietnam War confirm the need for early surgical control when patients present in shock. Following blunt trauma, the mechanism of injury can to a certain extent determine whether the patient in haemorrhagic shock will be a candidate for surgical bleeding control. Only a few studies address the relationship between the mechanism of injury and the risk of bleeding, however, and none of these publications describes a randomised prospective trial with high-level evidence. We have found no objective data describing the relationship between the risk of bleeding and the mechanism of injury resulting in skeletal fractures in general or of long-bone fractures in particular.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^e16e5954]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging firearm injuries in penetrating abdominal trauma reiterates, "Do not delay operative management to image patients with peritonitis, hypotension, evisceration, or frank gastrointestinal bleeding. Proceed to laparotomy. However, limited imaging may be useful in some cases", and notes that "In addition to the location of injury, the type of injury (for example, ballistic or gunshot wounds) also influences imaging". It highlights that "Shotguns often use pellets or multiple projectiles, and their injury patterns differ from other firearm injuries", that "Pellets spread out and slow down quickly" and "Often multiple projectiles are spread over a large area", and that "While the indications for emergent operation remain the same, plain radiographs can help determine if multiple body cavities are involved", while "In stable patients, CT can help determine the extent of injury and guide exploration".

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4cd5fae3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Our findings identified that mandatory use of abdominopelvic CT was associated with a failure rate of SNOM that was approximately half of that reported for selective use of CT scanning. Further, the number of unnecessary laparotomies in patients who failed SNOM was higher in studies that used a selective policy of CT scanning. These findings suggest that use of CT may confer a higher degree of confidence to surgeons managing patients with an equivocal clinical exam or concerning bullet trajectory. Whereas CT may be argued to be of minimal help to patients with anterior abdominal GSWs who are clearly hemodynamically stable and have no abdominal tenderness, there are situations in which CT will provide much-needed, additional information to guide surgical decision-making. These include patients with suspected tangential abdominal wounds, back or flank GSWs who may have retroperitoneal injuries, or RUQ GSWs who may have isolated hepatic trauma. These findings may support the level 2 recommendation made by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma in their 2010 guideline that abdominopelvic CT be strongly considered in patients undergoing SNOM of penetrating abdominal wounds (especially those with GSWs to the flank, back, and RUQ).

Common complications of SNOM, as reported across the included studies, were frequently relatively minor and may be divided into those that are thoracic (pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pleural effusion) and abdominal (GSW infection and biliary fistulae in patients with GSWs to the liver). As the risk of complications in patients undergoing mandatory laparotomy has been reported to be as high as 22–41%, the frequency of complications in patients undergoing SNOM in experienced trauma centers (13% across 11 studies) may be similar or even lower than mandatory laparotomy. However, when patients develop complications after SNOM for abdominal GSWs, their mean hospital LOS appears to increase from approximately 2 (in patients without associated extra-abdominal injuries) or 6 (in patients with associated extra-abdominal injuries) to 10 days. In particular, SNOM of liver GSWs was associated with a risk of biliary fistulae (6.3%) and pulmonary complications (15.9%).

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^c7b3b5de]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Radiographs — radiographs can be useful to identify the course or location of the projectile, but they do not definitively rule out violation of the peritoneum; if more specific information is desired, obtain films in two dimensions, though this is not routinely performed and clinicians should not delay operative or other diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to obtain additional films; abdominal radiograph including the pelvis may be useful to locate foreign bodies, obtain chest radiographs in patients with a cephalad abdominal injury or lower chest injury, and mark surface wounds prior to image acquisition because marking can be helpful when the projectile has exited the patient though less helpful with multiple gunshot injuries.

### Management guidelines for penetrating abdominal trauma [^63945c93]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal management of patients with penetrating abdominal injuries has been debated for decades, since mandatory laparotomy (LAP) gave way to the concept of "selective conservatism".

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed and summarized.

Results

A proposed management guideline for patients with penetrating abdominal trauma was created.

Conclusion

Indications for immediate laparotomy (LAP) include hemodynamic instability, evisceration, peritonitis, or impalement. Selective nonoperative management of stable, asymptomatic patients has been demonstrated to be safe. Adjunctive diagnostic testing-ultrasonography, computed tomography, local wound exploration, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy-is often used in an attempt to identify significant injuries requiring operative management. However, prospective studies indicate that these tests frequently lead to nontherapeutic LAP, and are not cost-effective.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^c4874c66]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy for trauma — indications include suspected but unproven intra-abdominal injury after blunt or penetrating trauma; suspected intra-abdominal injury despite negative initial workup after blunt trauma; abdominal stab wounds with proven or equivocal penetration of fascia; abdominal gunshot wounds with doubtful intraperitoneal trajectory; diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury from penetrating trauma to the thoracoabdominal area; and creation of a transdiaphragmatic pericardial window to rule out cardiac injury.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aebef6d8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Protocol

Our methods were pre-specified in a detailed protocol created according to the Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) proposal (see the completed MOOSE checklist in Additional file 1: digital content S1).

Search strategy

With the assistance of a medical librarian/information scientist, we searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to April 1, 2017, without language restrictions. Using a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and Emtree terms and keywords, we created search filters covering the themes SNOM, penetrating injury/GSW, and abdomen. These filters were combined in our final database searches using the Boolean operator "AND". Our complete search strategies are shown in Additional file 2: digital content S2. To identify additional studies, we used the PubMed "related articles" feature, hand-searched references of included original and relevant review articles identified during the search, and wrote several authors who had published on the topic.

Selection criteria

Independently and in duplicate, two investigators (ANAR, FAAH) screened the titles and abstracts of citations identified during the search, reviewed potentially relevant articles in full, and decided on study inclusion. We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) study participants were adult (mean age ≥ 16 years) civilian trauma patients with GSWs to the abdomen; (2) some or all of the included patients underwent SNOM of their abdominal GSWs; (3) reported outcomes included SNOM failure, morbidity, mortality, and/or patient hospital length of stay (LOS); and (4) the study used a cohort design. We distinguished cohort studies from case series using the criteria developed by Dekkers et al. and included controlled (which included a comparable control group of patients without diffuse peritonitis or hemodynamic instability that underwent mandatory laparotomy) and uncontrolled cohort studies in the systematic review. We excluded conference abstracts. Study eligibility disagreements were resolved by consensus. Inter-investigator agreement on article inclusion was assessed using kappa (κ) statistics. When the same data were reported across multiple studies, the study with the larger sample size or that provided the most information on SNOM-associated outcomes was included.

### Non-operative management for penetrating splenic trauma: how far can we go to save splenic function? [^82a5b30a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Gunshot wounds

Given the high complication rates in patients with gunshot injuries, we believe that our study does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend selective NOM for patients with splenic gunshot injuries. According to our univariate analysis, it appears that the mechanism of injury has to be considered as a key predictive factor for morbidity. Patients non-operatively treated for gunshot injuries had significantly more complications than those treated for stab wound injuries. This difference can be explained by the increased number of associated hollow and solid intra-abdominal, as well as thoracic, injuries. Additionally, both ICU stay and hospitalization time were statistically significantly prolonged in patients treated for gunshot injuries. We do not recommend the routine use of NOM for patients suffering from gunshot injuries. These findings are in line with a systematic review performed by Singh and Hardcastle, where they concluded that NOM is feasible for GSW, but it can not be used routinely. More studies should be performed in order to define specific criteria for adequate patient selection. Until these studies are executed, we feel safe to select stable patients with minor gunshot injuries to the spleen and normal mental status for a trial of non-operative management. In our study, a total of 10 patients with gunshot injuries to the spleen were successfully treated without surgical intervention. A key pre-requisite for these guidelines is the availability of decent monitoring facilities and adequately trained staff.

Haemodynamically unstable patients

When a haemodynamically unstable patient with penetrating splenic injury presents to the emergency department, a trial of NOM is not possible. Emergency laparotomy is indicated. However, in contrast to haemodynamically unstable patients with blunt splenic trauma, patients with penetrating injuries have frequently less concomitant foci of blood loss. This diminishes the necessity of a fast splenectomy aimed to reduce crucial operation time in the damage control setting. We opt to utilize an alternative surgical strategy in which the spleen is not routinely and directly taken out, but packed or treated by local haemostatic techniques and then left untouched during the rest of the inspection of the abdomen. In accordance with our treatment guidelines, attempts to preserve splenic function are the preferred treatment for penetrating splenic injuries. In more than half of our patients, we managed to preserve the spleen by this approach.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^dd3bc194]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Immediate intervention

Recommendation 5

We recommend that patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an identified source of bleeding undergo an immediate bleeding control procedure unless initial resuscitation measures are successful. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

The source of bleeding may be immediately obvious, and penetrating injuries are more likely to require surgical bleeding control. In a retrospective study of 106 abdominal vascular injuries, all 41 patients arriving in shock following gunshot wounds were candidates for rapid transfer to the operating theatre for surgical bleeding control. A similar observation in a study of 271 patients undergoing immediate laparotomy for gunshot wounds indicates that these wounds combined with signs of severe hypovolaemic shock specifically require early surgical bleeding control. This observation is true to a lesser extent for abdominal stab wounds. Data on injuries caused by penetrating metal fragments from explosives or gunshot wounds in the Vietnam War confirm the need for early surgical control when patients present in shock. In blunt trauma, the mechanism of injury can to a certain extent determine whether the patient in haemorrhagic shock will be a candidate for surgical bleeding control. Only a few studies address the relationship between the mechanism of injury and the risk of bleeding, however, and none of these publications is a randomised prospective trial of high evidence. We have found no objective data describing the relationship between the risk of bleeding and the mechanism of injury resulting in skeletal fractures in general or of long-bone fractures in particular.

Traffic accidents are the leading cause of pelvic injury. Motor vehicle crashes cause approximately 60% of pelvic fractures followed by falls from great height (23%). Most of the remainder result from motorbike collisions and vehicle-pedestrian accidents. There is a correlation between 'unstable' pelvic fractures and intra-abdominal injuries. An association between major pelvic fractures and severe head injuries, concomitant thoracic, abdominal, urological and skeletal injuries is also well described. High-energy injuries produce greater damage to both the pelvis and organs. Patients with high-energy injuries require more transfusion units, and more than 75% have associated head, thorax, abdominal or genitourinary injuries. It is well documented that 'unstable' pelvic fractures are associated with massive hemorrhage, and hemorrhage is the leading cause of death in patients with major pelvic fractures. Vertical shear pelvic ring fractures with caudal displacement of the hemipelvis may disrupt the pelvic floor and pelvic vasculature far more than standard vertical shear injuries. Inferior displacement of the hemipelvis using X-ray imaging should, therefore, alert the surgeon to the possible presence of severe arterial injuries.

Penetrating abdominal trauma: observation and nonoperative management

Patients with penetrating abdominal trauma can be selected for nonoperative management (NOM) in certain civilian trauma centres. There is no standard generalizable classification; however there have been guidelines and algorithms proposed. If there is no immediate indication for laparotomy a local wound exploration (LWE) is performed to rule out peritoneal violation. The utilisation of local wound exploration is only studied well with respect to anterior abdominal wounds, there is little evidence for gunshot wounds or flank and posterior wounds. The sensitivity of LWE varies with clinician experience, there is a small chance of false negative exploration in smaller stab wounds. If the injury does not breach the anterior fascia the patient can be discharged home (other injuries permitting). If the injury does breach the peritoneum non-operative management can still be utilised, however one should have a higher clinical suspicion for injuries on serial clinical examinations and a lower threshold for intervention. NOM is an option only when all the resources are available for: serial clinical examinations performed by experienced clinicians, vital signs monitoring, prompt access to the operating theatre, and ICU admission if required. Any decrease in haemoglobin concentration < 2 g/dL from baseline, or presumed, without other explanation than the penetrating abdominal wound, worsening vital signs or clinical examination should prompt surgical exploration. If NOM is elected, CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis can be a crucial adjunct. The choice to scan is highly dependent on the mechanism, location, depth, and number of wounds, and is not always required. Stab wounds to the back or flank rely upon CT to determine damage to retroperitoneal organs or the colon where clinical assessment may be challenging. Anterior stab wounds however can be more easily assessed, and CT scans should be less relied upon. A negative CT should not be used as the sole determinant for discharging a patient, unless a tangential and extraperitoneal wound tract is confirmed.

Risk of bias assessment

Table 2 summarizes the risk of bias assessment for all included studies. Most studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. Six (14.6%) studies demonstrated a high risk of bias in at least 1 modified QUIPS tool domain. Thirty-four (82.9%) studies showed a moderate-to-high risk of study attrition bias due to inadequate reporting of information about whether patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty (48.7%) studies demonstrated a moderate-to-high risk of prognostic factors measurement bias because (1) the authors did not report data on the grade of injury suffered by study patients in 18 (43.9%) studies, ISS score of the patients in 15 (36.6%) studies, or age of the patients in 4 (9.8%) studies; (2) there was no standardized policy for SNOM adopted in 9 (22.0%) studies; or (3) patients were managed operatively based on the decision of the attending surgeon rather than a defined protocol or decision algorithm in 3 (7.3%) studies. Thirteen (31.7%) studies showed a moderate-to-high risk of outcome measurement bias because (1) the definition of failure of SNOM was based on the timing from admission to the operating room in 2 (4.9%) studies; (2) failure of SNOM was solely based on CT findings without considering physical examination findings in 3 (7.3%) studies; or (3) a clear definition of failure of SNOM was not provided in 8 (19.5%) studies.

### Trends in the management of abdominal gunshot wounds over the last decade: a South African experience [^6015e151]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to review our decade-long experience with the management of abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs), to document trends in our approach and to develop an evidence base for our contemporary management algorithms in a major trauma in South Africa.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study that included all adult patients with abdominal GSWs between January 2013 and October 2020 managed at a major trauma centre in South Africa.

Result

Five hundred and ninety-six cases were included (87% male, mean age: 32 years). The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 12. 52% (309/596) of cases had indications of immediate laparotomy and proceeded directly to the operating room without any CT imaging. Of this cohort, the laparotomy was positive in 292 and in the remainder (5%) was negative. Of the remaining 287 cases, 209 underwent a CT scan (35%). 78 were managed without any CT imaging. Of the 78 who did not undergo CT scan, all were managed without any operation and discharged home well. Of the 209 who underwent CT scan, 99 were observed and only one case in this group subsequently required a laparotomy. The remaining 110 cases underwent a laparotomy, which was negative in 7. There were correlations with increasing use of CT, as well as a decrease in those proceeding directly to laparotomy. The overall morbidity rate was 8% (47/596). 32% (190/596) require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The overall mortality rate was 8% (67/596).

Conclusions

The management of abdominal GSWs has continued to evolve. There is now a well-defined role for selective non-operative management in this group of patients and relies on accurate CT assessment. CT scan is now an important component in the management of abdominal GSW even in our resource-constrained environment.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ceed064e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The cornerstone of SNOM lies on the principle of serial physical examinations of patients without a reduced level of consciousness by qualified surgeons or experienced surgical residents. Over the last two decades, there has also been an interest in using abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scans as an adjunct when conducting SNOM. Proponents suggest that CT scans may better characterize bullet trajectory and have been reported to detect injuries with a sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90%. Opponents argue that it is associated with false negative and positive test results and lacks accuracy in detecting some (e.g. intestinal and diaphragmatic) injuries.

There have been no randomized controlled trials to date that have evaluated the outcomes of SNOM versus mandatory laparotomy for management of civilian abdominal GSWs. Moreover, results of cohort studies of this injury management strategy have been variable. To evaluate the potential safety of this approach, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize outcomes associated with use of SNOM in cohort studies of civilians with abdominal GSWs. We hypothesized that SNOM of abdominal GSWs would be safe (associated with a small risk of failure, morbidity, and mortality) when conducted in highly experienced trauma centers. We also sought to determine whether variability in reported outcomes of SNOM across cohort studies may be due to differences in study risks of bias, practices of SNOM across trauma centers and countries, or study patient injury patterns (e.g. whether the entry wound of the included patients was predominantly in the anterior abdomen, thoracoabdomen, flank, or back).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® penetrating torso trauma [^e06f11bc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This document assesses the appropriateness of various imaging studies for acute penetrating trauma to the torso. Penetrating trauma most commonly occurs from gunshots and stabbings, although any object can impale the patient. Anatomic location, type of penetrating trauma, and hemodynamic status are among the many important factors when deciding upon if, what, and when imaging is needed to further evaluate the patient. Imaging plays a critical role in the management of these patients. CT, in particular, aids in identifying and predicting internal injuries based upon trajectory of the object. Clinical variants are distinguished by ballistic versus nonballistic injuries, hemodynamic status, and compartment of the body injured. Ballistic trauma trajectory is less predictable, and imaging recommendations are adjusted for this unpredictability. Excluded from this document are penetrating traumatic injuries to pediatric patients and specific recommendations when the genitourinary system is clinically suspected to be injured, the latter of which is more specifically discussed in other Appropriateness Criteria documents. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are documented annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer documented journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer documented literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### The evolution of nonoperative management of abdominal gunshot wounds in the United States [^339a8a64]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical exploration for gunshot wounds to the abdomen has been a surgical standard for the greater part of the past century. Recently, nonoperative management (NOM) has been deemed as a safe option for abdominal gunshot wounds (AGWs). The aim of this analysis was to review the utilization of NOM and mortality after AGWs.

Methods

We performed a 2010–2014 retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality and Improvement Program. We included all adult (aged 18 and older) patients with AGWs. NOM was defined as nonsurgical intervention within the first 6 h. Outcome measures were trends of utilization of NOM and mortality. Cochrane-Armitage trend analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 808,272 trauma patients were identified, and 16,866 patients with AGWs were included. During the study period, the incidence of AGWs increased, whereas the proportion of bowel injury (P = 0.75) and solid organ injury (P = 0.44) did not change. The NOM rate of AGW increased (2010: 19.5% versus 2014: 27%, P < 0.001). This was accompanied by a decrease in mortality rate (11% versus 9.4%, P = 0.01). Likewise, there was an increase in the use of angiography (7.5% versus 27%, P < 0.001) and laparoscopy (0.9% versus 2.6%, P < 0.001). Overall, 9.8% of the patients had failed NOM. There was no difference in mortality in patients who were managed successfully or failed NOM (5% versus 4.6%, P = 0.45).

Conclusions

NOM of AGW is more prevalent and is associated with a decrease in mortality rate. Selective NOM may be practiced safely after AGWs.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^866fd775]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although mandatory laparotomy has been standard of care for patients with abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs) for decades, this approach is associated with non-therapeutic operations, morbidity, and long hospital stays. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to summarize outcomes of selective nonoperative management (SNOM) of civilian abdominal GSWs.

Methods

We searched electronic databases (March 1966–April 1, 2017) and reference lists of articles included in the systematic review for studies reporting outcomes of SNOM of civilian abdominal GSWs. We meta-analyzed the associated risks of SNOM-related failure (defined as laparotomy during hospital admission), mortality, and morbidity across included studies using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed by calculating I² statistics and conducting tests of homogeneity.

Results

Of 7155 citations identified, we included 41 studies [n = 22,847 patients with abdominal GSWs, of whom 6777 (29.7%) underwent SNOM]. The pooled risk of failure of SNOM in hemodynamically stable patients without a reduced level of consciousness or signs of peritonitis was 7.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.9–10.1%; I² = 92.6%, homogeneity p < 0.001] while the pooled mortality associated with use of SNOM in this patient population was 0.4% (95% CI = 0.2–0.6%; I² = 0%, homogeneity p > 0.99). In patients who failed SNOM, the pooled estimate of the risk of therapeutic laparotomy was 68.0% (95% CI = 58.3–77.7%; I² = 91.5%; homogeneity p < 0.001). Risks of failure of SNOM were lowest in studies that evaluated patients with right thoracoabdomen (3.4%; 95% CI = 0–7.0%; I² = 0%; homogeneity p = 0.45), flank (7.0%; 95% CI = 3.9–10.1%), and back (3.1%; 95% CI = 0–6.5%) GSWs and highest in those that evaluated patients with anterior abdomen (13.2%; 95% CI = 6.3–20.1%) GSWs. In patients who underwent mandatory abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT), the pooled risk of failure was 4.1% versus 8.3% in those who underwent selective CT (p = 0.08). The overall sample-size-weighted mean hospital length of stay among patients who underwent SNOM was 6 days versus 10 days if they failed SNOM or developed an in-hospital complication.

Conclusions

SNOM of abdominal GSWs is safe when conducted in hemodynamically stable patients without a reduced level of consciousness or signs of peritonitis. Failure of SNOM may be lower in patients with GSWs to the back, flank, or right thoracoabdomen and be decreased by mandatory use of abdominopelvic CT scans.

Abdominal vascular trauma accounts for a small percentage of military and a moderate percentage of civilian trauma, affecting all age ranges and impacting young adult men most frequently. Penetrating causes are more frequent than blunt in adults, while blunt mechanisms are more common among pediatric populations. High rates of associated injuries, bleeding, and hemorrhagic shock ensure that, despite advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, immediate open surgical repair remains the mainstay of treatment for traumatic abdominal vascular injuries. Because of their devastating nature, abdominal vascular injuries remain a significant source of morbidity and mortality among trauma patients. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in conjunction with the World Society of Emergency Surgery seek to summarize the literature to date and provide guidelines on the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of abdominal vascular injuries.

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^1b6eb66f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients is dramatically effective in facing the deranged physiology of severe injuries or critical illness when no other perceived options exist. Its use remains very controversial and is a matter of great debate, as it is a non-anatomic situation with potential severe side effects and increased resource utilization. Moreover, the lack of definitive data demands carefully tailoring its use to each single patient, taking care to not overuse it. Abdominal closure attempt should be done as soon as the patient can physiologically tolerate it. All possible precautions should be implemented to minimize complications. Results improve proportionate to the clinicians' team's experience with the intricacies of open abdomen management.

### Selective non-operative management of abdominal gunshot wounds: survey of practise [^3e917cdd]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a growing body of evidence attesting to the effectiveness and safety of selective non-operative management (SNOM) of abdominal gunshot wounds. However, much of the research which supports this conclusion has originated from a few centres, and the actual utilisation of SNOM by trauma surgeons is not known. We therefore conducted a survey to assess the acceptance of this strategy and evaluate variations in practise.

Methods

Electronic questionnaire survey of trauma surgeons in the United States of America, Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. Responses were compared using Chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests.

Results

183 replies were received. 105 (57%) respondents practise SNOM of abdominal gunshot wounds, but there are marked regional variations in the acceptance of this strategy (p < 0.01). Respondents who had completed trauma (p < 0.01) or critical care (p < 0.01) fellowships, and those who practise in a higher volume centre (defined as > 50 penetrating abdominal injuries seen per year) (p < 0.01) are more likely to practise SNOM of gunshot wounds. Most surgeons who practise SNOM regard peritonitis, omental and bowel evisceration, and being unable to evaluate a patient as a contraindication to attempting non-operative management. Almost all regard CT as essential. Respondents' preparedness to consider SNOM is related to injury extent.

Conclusions

SNOM of abdominal gunshot wounds is practised by trauma surgeons in all four countries surveyed, but is not universally accepted, and there are variations in how it is practised.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cc36c686]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review of 41 studies involving 22,847 civilians with abdominal GSWs is the first to comprehensively meta-analyze outcomes associated with use of SNOM in this patient population. Our findings suggest that highly experienced trauma centers have safely treated greater than 90% of the patients included in these studies nonoperatively. Importantly, in all studies, only hemodynamically stable patients without a reduced level of consciousness and no signs of peritonitis were selected for SNOM. SNOM may be more successful among patients with GSWs to the right thoracoabdomen, flank, or back than the anterior abdomen and when serial physical examinations are performed by attending trauma surgeons. This practice also appears to be more successful in patients who undergo mandatory abdominopelvic CT scans and in those with injuries proven to involve the kidney on imaging. Although SNOM has been linked with development of atelectasis, GSW infections, and biliary fistulae in patients with GSWs to the liver, these complications are uncommon and appear to be less frequent than that historically reported after mandatory laparotomy in similar patient populations.

As most of the included studies were conducted at high-volume, level 1, academic trauma centers in the USA, our results may not be generalizable to centers without the necessary structures and processes to manage these patients. Many of the centers conducting research on SNOM described dedicated, monitored areas to observe and examine patients with abdominal GSWs in the initial hours after injury (and therefore these systems may be required to assure timely rescue of patients who fail SNOM). Of those who failed SNOM, the most frequent reasons for delayed laparotomy included development of peritonitis or worsening abdominal tenderness, each of which was mostly commonly detected within the first 24–48 h of admission through close clinical monitoring. It is interesting that 28% of patients who failed SNOM across the included studies underwent unnecessary laparotomy, which suggests that success of SNOM may potentially benefit from studies focused on creating appropriate indications for delayed operation during SNOM.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^635ce89a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review has several limitations. First, we identified no controlled studies comparing outcomes of conducting SNOM versus mandatory laparotomy in hemodynamically stable patients with abdominal GSWs without diffuse peritonitis. Second, although we were unable to determine the amount of duplication of included patient outcome data with certainty, a sensitivity analysis excluding the results of studies that reported potentially overlapping data yielded a similar pooled estimate of the failure of SNOM. Third, few studies examined associations between the use of angioembolization/endovascular interventions and SNOM failure or provided details of whether reported complications were directly attributable to a failure of SNOM. Fourth, some studies did not report their methods of conducting SNOM. Thus, the management of each case was ultimately dictated by attending surgeons, which likely introduced unmeasured variability in practice and outcomes. Finally, some studies included patients in the SNOM group that only had tangential and superficial abdominal GSWs without peritoneal breach, which likely improved the reported outcomes of SNOM.

### Selective nonoperative management in 1, 856 patients with abdominal gunshot wounds: should routine laparotomy still be the standard of care? [^53cbe245]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety of a policy of selective nonoperative management (SNOM) in patients with abdominal gunshot wounds.

Summary Background Data

Selective nonoperative management is practiced extensively in stab wounds and blunt abdominal trauma, but routine laparotomy is still the standard of care in abdominal gunshot wounds.

Methods

The authors reviewed the medical records of 1,856 patients with abdominal gunshot wounds (1,405 anterior, 451 posterior) admitted during an 8-year period in a busy academic level 1 trauma center and managed by SNOM. According to this policy, patients who did not have peritonitis, were hemodynamically stable, and had a reliable clinical examination were observed.

Results

Initially, 792 (42%) patients (34% of patients with anterior and 68% with posterior abdominal gunshot wounds) were selected for nonoperative management. During observation 80 (4%) patients developed symptoms and required a delayed laparotomy, which revealed organ injuries requiring repair in 57. Five (0.3%) patients suffered complications potentially related to the delay in laparotomy, which were managed successfully. Seven hundred twelve (38%) patients were successfully managed without an operation. The rate of unnecessary laparotomy was 14% among operated patients (or 9% among all patients). If patients were managed by routine laparotomy, the unnecessary laparotomy rate would have been 47% (39% for anterior and 74% for posterior abdominal gunshot wounds). Compared with patients with unnecessary laparotomy, patients managed without surgery had significantly shorter hospital stays and lower hospital charges. By maintaining a policy of SNOM instead of routine laparotomy, a total of 3,560 hospital days and $9,555,752 in hospital charges were saved over the period of the study.

Conclusion

Selective nonoperative management is a safe method for managing patients with abdominal gunshot wounds in a level 1 trauma center with an in-house trauma team. It reduces significantly the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and hospital charges.

Recommendations for non operative management (NOM) in blunt liver trauma (BLT)

Blunt trauma patients with hemodynamic stability and absence of other internal injuries requiring surgery, should undergo an initial attempt of NOM irrespective of injury grade (GoR 2 A).

NOM is contraindicated in the setting of hemodynamic instability or peritonitis (GoR 2 A).

NOM of moderate or severe liver injuries should be considered only in an environment that provides capability for patient intensive monitoring, angiography, an immediately available OR and immediate access to blood and blood product (GoR 2 A).

In patients being considered for NOM, CT-scan with intravenous contrast should be performed to define the anatomic liver injury and identify associated injuries (GoR 2 A).

Angiography with embolization may be considered the first-line intervention in patients with hemodynamic stability and arterial blush on CT-scan (GoR 2 B).

### Delayed torrential haemorrhage after firearm injury [^b303b853]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 30-year-old man was referred to us after 48 days of gunshot injury to left groin, with torrential bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm of the left external iliac artery. He was successfully managed with a team of specialists involving trauma surgeon, vascular and plastic surgeon, general surgeons and intervention radiologist with the help of critical care specialists. He required judicious debridement, a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap, stenting of the external iliac artery, repair of the external iliac vein and ligation of the bilateral internal iliac artery. He had prolonged intensive care unit stay with open abdomen requiring specialised care. Errors in regular assessment of patient by clinical and radiological examination along with failure in early adequate debridement were responsible for trauma suffered by him. Though it is a rare injury, these devastating complications can occur after any gunshot injury and proper management guidelines must be established.

### Selective non-operative management of solid organ injury following abdominal gunshot wounds [^3cc9dc73]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients sustaining a torso gunshot wound with documented solid organ injury. Our hypothesis was that the non-operative management of isolated solid organ injuries is a safe management option for a select group of patients.

Methods

A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted to identify all patients sustaining a torso gunshot resulting in a solid organ injury undergoing non-operative management over a 5-year period (12/1999–01/2005). Patient demographics, injury details, diagnostic imaging, outcome and follow-up were reviewed.

Results

Of 644 gunshot wounds to the torso, 144 (22%) underwent non-operative management. Thirteen of these patients (9%) had 16 solid organ injuries (10 liver, 4 kidney and 2 spleen). CT characterisation of the isolated solid organ injury ranged from AAST Grade I-IV. One of 13 patients failed non-operative management and subsequently underwent laparotomy, which was non-therapeutic. Clinical follow-up was available in all patients for an average of 101 days (median 27, range 6–473). The organ salvage rate was 100%.

Summary

In select haemodynamically stable patients without peritonitis able to undergo serial clinical examination, solid organ injury is not a contra-indication to non-operative management. In the appropriate setting, non-operative management of solid organ injury after gunshot wounding is associated with a high rate of success and organ salvage.

### The impact of published recommendations on the management of penetrating abdominal injury [^3bbcefbd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with penetrating abdominal injury (PAI), haemodynamic instability and peritonitis are indications for laparotomy, but it remains uncertain whether laparotomy is indicated for evisceration, retained foreign body and pneumoperitoneum. In 1989, a review of 107 patients with PAI revealed a 78.5 per cent laparotomy rate, with 35 per cent considered unnecessary. The aim of this study was to review current practice in the same hospitals.

Methods

A retrospective review included case notes from 224 patients with PAI presenting to three hospitals between 2001 and 2005.

Results

Some 206 patients (92.0 per cent) were male and the mean age was 30.5 years. Aetiologies were stabbing (96.4 per cent), impalement (2.7 per cent) and gunshot wound (0.9 per cent). Laparotomy was performed in 48 patients (21.4 per cent), and was positive in 33 and unnecessary or negative in 15. Haemodynamic instability and peritonitis were strong indicators of positive laparotomy; seven of 13 laparotomies for evisceration alone were negative, as were two of four for retained foreign bodies.

Conclusion

The laparotomy rate fell from 78.5 to 21.4 per cent over 25 years. The rate of unnecessary or negative laparotomy did not change. Isolated evisceration and retained foreign body remain relative indications.

### Liver trauma: WSES 2020 guidelines [^ea57bc96]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Absolute requirements for NOM are hemodynamic stability and absence of other lesions requiring surgery. In hemodynamically stable patients without other associated injuries requiring OM, NOM is considered the standard of care. The concept is valid for both: blunt (BT) and penetrating trauma (PT). Attempting NOM in moderate (WSES II) (AAST-OIS III) and severe (WSES III) (AAST-OIS IV–V) blunt or penetrating injuries requires the ability to diagnose all associated injuries and to provide intensive management (continuous clinical monitoring, serial hemoglobin monitoring, and around-the-clock availability of trained surgeons, CT scanning, angiography, OR, and blood and blood products).

As a general consideration, great attention should be paid in selecting PT for NOM especially in the case of gunshot wound (GSW) and even more if thoraco-abdominal. They should be considered for NOM only in centers with experience in dealing with PT. Even in patients presenting with stable conditions and with no evidence of other intra-abdominal/internal injuries, interval laparoscopy should be always considered in order to confirm the absence of other injuries requiring surgical repair.

In PT, NOM feasibility has been reported with 50% and 85% success rate of NOM for stab wounds (SW) in anterior and posterior abdomen respectively. Similar managing strategy can be applied to GSWs. Necessary distinction between low- and high-energy penetrating trauma however is mandatory when deciding for OM or NOM. Low-energy PT (SW and low-energy GSW) may be safely treated with NOM at first, provided the patient is hemodynamically stable and no other injuries require surgery. In considering NOM, interval laparoscopy should be considered to rule out missed intra-abdominal injuries. High-energy GSW and other ballistic injuries are less amenable to NOM, and in 90% of cases, OM is required. In abdominal GSWs, up to 25% of non-therapeutic laparotomy has been reported, confirming the need to have strict selection criteria for OM or NOM even in the GSW cohort. Associated head and spinal cord injuries (that preclude affordable clinical examination) and significant reduction in hemoglobin requiring > 4 units of blood transfusion in the first 8 h have been suggested as predictive criteria of NOM failure in abdominal GSWs.

### Selective nonoperative management of abdominal stab wounds in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9dbbbfed]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Prior to the 1960s, laparotomy was the standard management approach for all patients who sustained penetrating abdominal trauma. A landmark paper by Shaftan in 1960 in the United States challenged this approach. Shaftan demonstrated that with careful selection and serial clinical observation, it is safe to manage abdominal trauma nonoperatively — with the majority of patients included in his paper suffering abdominal stab wounds (SW). This initial paper was followed by a number of others that further demonstrated the feasibility of this selective nonoperative management (SNOM) approach. The benefits of SNOM for resource‐limited centers with high penetrating trauma burdens have led to it being adopted not only for abdominal SW but also for gunshot wounds (GSW). SNOM can reduce the financial cost of managing abdominal SW and has the advantage of reducing the incidence of unnecessary exploration, thus reducing laparotomy associated complications. The crucial aspect of safe SNOM of abdominal SW is patient selection. It is widely accepted that hemodynamically unstable and/or peritonitic patients should be managed with immediate operative management. However, further selection of patients for SNOM is nuanced, with different centers adopting varied approaches. These include the use of diagnostic modalities such as diagnostic peritoneal lavage, ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) — despite SNOM originally being reliant on clinical examination. The intricacies of using these adjuvant diagnostic modalities are also highly variable among centers. Some institutions perform CT with intravenous contrast exclusively, whereas others use triple‐contrast approaches.

### WSES classification and guidelines for liver trauma [^f90b8bbe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Severe head and spinal cord injuries should be considered as relative indications for OM, given the inability to reliably evaluate the clinical status (GoR 2A).

The most recent published trials demonstrate a high success rate for NOM in 50% of stab wounds (SW) in the anterior abdomen and in about 85% in the posterior abdomen. The same concept has also been applied to gunshot wounds (GSWs). However, a distinction should be made between low and high-energy penetrating trauma in deciding either for OM or NOM. In case of low energy, both SW and GSW, NOM can be safely applied. High energy GSW and other ballistic injuries are less amenable to NOM because of the high-energy transfer, and in 90% of cases an OM is required. Of note, a 25% non-therapeutic laparotomy rate is reported in abdominal GSWs. This confirms that in selective cases NOM could be pursued either in GSWs.

Clinical trials report a high success rate of NOM in penetrating liver injuries (69 to 100%). Absolute requirements for NOM are: hemodynamic stability, absence of peritonitis, and an evaluable abdomen. Evisceration and impalement are other indications for OM. Current guidelines suggest that hemodynamically stable patients presenting with evisceration and/or impalement and/or diffuse peritonitis should be considered candidates to be directly taken to the OR without CT-scan. These findings are particularly important in cases of gunshot injuries. Other suggested predictive criteria of NOM failure in abdominal GSWs according to Navsaria et al. are: associated head and spinal cord injuries (that preclude regular clinical examination) and significant reduction in hemoglobin requiring more than 2–4 units of blood transfusion in 24 h.

### Outcomes of selective nonoperative management of civilian abdominal gunshot wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ca33fa21]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Primary outcome

The pooled estimate of the risk of failure of SNOM for abdominal GSWs across 28 studies that reported data on this outcome was 7.0% (95% CI = 3.9–10.1%) (Fig. 2). There was a high degree of heterogeneity between these studies (I² = 92.6%, homogeneity p < 0.001). In patients who failed SNOM, the pooled estimate of the risk of therapeutic laparotomy was 68.0% (95% CI = 58.3–77.7%; I² = 91.5%; homogeneity p < 0.001) while that of unnecessary laparotomy was 28.1% (95% CI = 19.0–37.1%; I² = 90.6%, homogeneity p < 0.001).

Fig. 2
Pooled risk of failure in civilians undergoing selective nonoperative management of abdominal gunshot wounds

Twenty studies (48.8%) reported the length of time from admission to delayed laparotomy in patients that failed SNOM. The weighted mean and median time between admission and delayed laparotomy in patients selected for a trial of SNOM (n = 16 studies, 39.0%) was 40.6 and 21.2 h, respectively.

Indications for delayed laparotomy (as well as intraoperative findings) in patients who failed SNOM were described in 17 (41.5%) of the included studies and are described in detail in the table in Additional file 3: digital content S3. These most commonly included development of peritonitis (38.8%), worsening abdominal tenderness (35.7%), or fever (11.2%). Less common reasons included development of new tachycardia (8.2%) or hypotension (1.0%). Others included rising WBC counts (6.1%) or falling hematocrit levels (6.1%).

### Abdominal compartment syndrome in burns patients: introduction of an evidence-based management guideline and algorithm [^0bb2d99d]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Abdominal compartment syndrome is a serious potential complication of burn injury, and carries high morbidity and mortality. Although there are generalised published guidelines on managing the condition, to date no management algorithm has yet been published tailored specifically to the burn injury patient. We set out to examine the literature on the subject in order to produce an evidence based management guideline, with the aim of improving outcomes for these patients. The guideline covers early detection and assessment of the condition as well as optimum medical, surgical and postoperative management. We believe that this guideline provides a much needed benchmark for managing burns patients with raised intra-abdominal pressure, as well as providing a template for further research and improvements in care.

### Surgical versus non-surgical management of abdominal injury [^6df34757]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Injury to the abdomen can be blunt or penetrating. Abdominal injury can damage internal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestine. There are controversies about the best approach to manage abdominal injuries.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical and non-surgical interventions in the management of abdominal trauma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, issue 1), MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), and ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) all until January 2012; CINAHL until January 2009. We also searched the reference lists of all eligible studies and the trial registers www.controlled-trials.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov in January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of surgical and non surgical interventions among patients with abdominal injury who are haemodynamically stable and with no signs of peritonitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the search criteria. One study involving participants with penetrating abdominal injury met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two authors using a standard data extraction form.

Main Results

One study including 51 participants with moderate risk of bias was included. Participants were randomised to surgery or an observation protocol. There were no deaths among the participants. Seven participants had complications; 5 (18.5%) in the surgical group and 2 (8.3%) in the non-surgical group; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.42; Fischer's exact). Among the 27 who had surgery six (22.2%) surgeries were negative laparotomies, and 15 (55.6%) were non-therapeutic.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the findings of one study involving 51 participants, which was at moderate risk of bias, there is no evidence to support the use of surgery over observation for people with abdominal trauma.

### Gunshot wounds of the abdomen… [^31292ec4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- During a five-year period from July 1968 through June 1973, 277 abdominal gunshot wounds occurred, the overall fatality of which was 10%. Abdominal exploration was done in all patients. No intra-abdominal injury was found in 40 patients and no death occurred in this group. There were 28 fatalities in 237 patients who had intra-abdominal injuries. Morbidity and mortality were related not only to the number of organs injured, but also to specific organs injured. The leading cause of early death was hypovolemia due to major vessel injuries. Septicemia was the most common cause of death if the patient survived the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Penetrating abdominal stab wounds and gunshot wounds must be considered separately, and mandatory routine abdominal exploration for all penetrating gunshot wounds is advised. In stab wounds to the abdomen, conservative management may be preferable. Dawidson I, Miller E, Litwin MS.

### Prospective evaluation of selective nonoperative management of torso gunshot wounds: when is it safe to discharge? [^168a963b]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Selective nonoperative management (NOM) has been increasingly used for torso gunshot wounds (GSWs). The optimal observation time required to exclude a hollow viscus injury is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the safe period of observation before discharge.

Methods

All patients aged 16 years and older sustaining a torso GSW undergoing a trial of NOM were prospectively enrolled (January 2009 to January 2011). Patient demographics, initial computed tomography (CT) results, time to failure of NOM, operative procedures, and outcomes were collected. Failure of NOM was defined as the need for operation.

Results

A total of 270 patients sustained a GSW to the torso. Of those, 25 patients (9.3%) died in the emergency department and were excluded leaving 245 patients available for the analysis. Mean age was 26.5 years ± 9.9 years (16–62 years), 92.7% (227) were men, and mean Injury Severity Score scale was 13.8 ± 11.3 (1–45). Overall, 115 patients (46.9%) underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy based on clinical criteria (72.2% had peritonitis, 27.8% hypotension, 10.4% unevaluable, and 4.3% evisceration), and 130 patients (53.1%) underwent evaluation with CT for possible NOM. Of those, 39 patients (30.0%) had a positive CT and were subsequently operated on. All had significant intra-abdominal injuries requiring surgical management. A total of 91 patients (70.0%) underwent a trial of NOM (47 had equivocal CT findings and 44 had a negative examination). Of these, 8 patients (8.8%) failed NOM and underwent laparotomy (all had equivocal CT scans). Two patients had a nontherapeutic laparotomy; the remainder had stomach (50.0%), colon (25.5%), and rectal (12.5%) injuries. The mean time from admission to development of clinical or laboratory signs of NOM failure was 2 hours:43 minutes ± 2 hours:23 minutes (0 hour:31 minutes-6 hours:58 minutes). All patients failed within 24 hours of admission.

Conclusion

In the initial evaluation of patients sustaining a GSW to the torso, clinical examination is essential for identifying those who will require emergency operation. For those undergoing a trial of NOM, all failures occurred within 24 hours of hospital admission, setting a minimum required observation period before discharge.

### Selective nonoperative management in 1106 patients with abdominal gunshot wounds: conclusions on safety, efficacy, and the role of selective CT imaging in a prospective single-center study [^7008750e]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary aim of this study was to delineate the role of computed tomography (CT) in patients undergoing NOM for AGSW.

Background

Nonoperative management (NOM) of abdominal gunshot wounds (AGSWs) remains controversial.

Methods

This prospective study included all patients with abdominal gunshot injuries admitted to our trauma center from April 1, 2004 to September 30, 2009. Exclusion criteria included patients with peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, unreliable physical examination, head and spinal cord injury with an AGSW underwent immediate laparotomy. The remaining patients were selected for NOM. Nonperitonitic stable patients with right-sided thoracoabdominal/right upper quadrant gunshots and/or hematuria underwent mandatory CT with intravenous contrast. CT to detect missile trajectory was optional. The primary outcome measure was failure of NOM. Secondary outcomes were unnecessary laparotomy rates and mortality.

Results

A total of 1106 patients with abdominal gunshot injuries were admitted. Of these, 834 (75.4%) underwent immediate laparotomy, whereas 272 (24.6%) were selected for NOM. In the former group, there were 56 (6.7%) deaths and 29 (3.5%) unnecessary laparotomies, whereas in the latter NOM group, 82 (30.1%) patients were managed by serial clinical examination alone, whereas 190 (69.9%) patients underwent abdominal CT scanning, in addition to serial clinical examination. The overall NOM success rate was 95.2%. Of the 13 patients undergoing delayed laparotomy, there were 10 therapeutic, 2 nontherapeutic, and 1 negative laparotomy.

Conclusions

The NOM of appropriately selected patients with AGSW with selective use of CT scanning is feasible, safe, and effective, but largely based on findings from serial clinical examinations.

### A prospective audit of 805 consecutive patients with penetrating abdominal trauma: evolving beyond injury mechanism dictating management [^b7547a53]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Global trends of penetrating abdominal trauma (PAT) have seen a shift toward a selectively conservative management strategy. However, its widespread adoption for gunshot injuries has been sluggish. The purpose of this study is to compare the injury mechanisms of gunshot (GSW) and stab wounds (SW) to the abdomen in presentation, management, and outcomes.

Methods

Prospective cohort study, set in Cape Town, South Africa, over 2 years. All patients presenting to the center with PAT during this time were included. Presentation, management, and outcomes were compared by injury mechanism, with a focus on the operative strategy (operative vs nonoperative).

Results

During the study period, 805 patients (SW 37.6%; GSW 62.4%) with PAT were managed. Immediate laparotomies were performed in 119 (39.3%) SW and 355 (70.7%) GSW, with a therapeutic laparotomy rate of 85.7% and 91.8% for SW and GSW, respectively. Nonoperative management (NOM) was implemented in 184 SW (60.7%) and 147 GSW (29.3%) (P < 0.001), with a 92.9% and 92.5% success rate for SW and GSW, respectively. The therapeutic laparotomy rate for the delayed laparotomies (DOM) was 69.2% for SW, and 90.9% for GSW. The accuracy of clinical assessment (with adjuncts) in determining the need for laparotomy was: GSW-92% and SW-91%. Univariate analysis revealed the mechanism not to be associated with DOM. The overall mortality rate was 7.2%, and nonfatal morbidities 22.2%.

Conclusion

Although GSW is a more morbid and often fatal injury, the general principles of selective conservatism hold true for both GSW and SW, equally.

Ureteral trauma — imaging for suspected ureteral injuries: Clinicians should perform IV contrast enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT with delayed imaging (urogram) for stable trauma patients with suspected ureteral injuries (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Ureteral injuries should be suspected in complex, multisystem abdominopelvic trauma patients, including those with bowel, bladder, or vascular injuries; those with complex pelvic/vertebral fractures; after rapid deceleration injuries; and when the trajectory of the penetrating injury is near the ureter, especially with high velocity gunshot wounds, and absence of hematuria cannot be relied upon to exclude ureteral injury. In stable patients not proceeding directly to exploratory laparotomy, IV contrast enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT with 10 minute delayed images should be obtained to evaluate for ureteral injury; findings suggestive of ureteral injury include contrast extravasation, ipsilateral delayed pyelogram, ipsilateral hydronephrosis, and lack of contrast in the ureter distal to the suspected injury, and if the initial delayed images do not adequately opacify the ureters, further delayed imaging may be necessary if ureteral injury is still suspected.

### Retained bullet in the kidney: imaging and conservative management [^0e3f624d]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal gunshot wounds resulting in a grade IV injury (AAST) should be explored only if they involve the hilum or if there are signs of suspected renal pelvis or ureteral laceration, active hemorrhage, peritonitis, or hemodynamically unstable patients (Kitrey et al, 2017). 1 However, because of the paucity of cases reported in the literature, it is not clear what the best management of patients with a retained bullet is, which have been traditionally treated with surgical retrieval in other organs. We present the radiological findings and a clinical case summary of a patient with grade IV kidney injury and retained bullet managed conservatively.

### The diagnostic yield of commonly used investigations in pelvic gunshot wounds [^9c7550ff]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who sustain pelvic gunshot wounds (GSWs) are at significant risk for injury owing to the density of pelvic structures. Currently, the optimal workup for pelvic GSWs is unclear. The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic yield of tests commonly used in the investigation of pelvic GSWs and to develop a diagnostic algorithm.

Methods

All patients 15 years or older presenting to the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center (January 2008 to February 2015) who sustained one or more pelvic GSWs were retrospectively identified. Patients' demographics, clinical assessment, investigations, procedures, and outcomes were abstracted. The diagnostic yield of computed tomographic (CT) scan, cystogram, gross inspection of the urine, urinalysis, endoscopy, and digital rectal examination (DRE) in the detection of clinically significant injuries to the pelvis were calculated.

Results

Three hundred seventy patients were included. Patients with peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, an unevaluable abdomen, or evisceration were taken to the operating room for immediate laparotomy (n = 138 [37.3%]). All others (n = 232 [62.7%]) underwent CT scan and further investigations as indicated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the investigations were CT scan: 1.00, 0.98, 0.74, and 1.00; cystogram: 1.00 for all parameters; gross inspection of the urine: 1.00 for all parameters; urinalysis: 1.00, 0.71, 0.17, and 1.00; endoscopy: 1.00, 0.82, 0.75, and 1.00; and DRE: 0.77, 0.99, 0.77, and 0.99.

Conclusion

In the workup of pelvic GSWs, patients with hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, evisceration, or an unevaluable abdomen should undergo immediate laparotomy, while all others should undergo CT scan. Computed tomography-positive patients should be managed for their injuries. If the CT is negative, the likelihood of a clinically significant injury is very low. If the CT is equivocal for rectal or bladder injury, endoscopy or cystogram should be used to guide definitive management. There is no role for routine urinalysis or DRE. Further prospective validation of these findings is warranted.

Level Of Evidence

Secondary outcomes

Morbidity and mortality of patients that underwent SNOM

Pooled estimates of the risk of complications associated with SNOM are reported in Table 3. Of these, atelectasis and GSW infections were most common, with pooled risk estimates of 21.2% (95% CI = 7.0–35.4%, I² = 0.0%, homogeneity p = 0.36) and 6.0% (95% CI = 3.1–8.9%, I² = 0%, homogeneity p = 0.71), respectively. The pooled estimate of the risk of any intrathoracic complication (pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, or pleural effusion) was 11.6% (95% CI = 3.5–19.7%; I² = 79.0%; homogeneity p = 0.005). Three studies (7.7%) reported biliary fistula formation after SNOM in patients with liver GSWs, with a pooled risk of 3.5% (95% CI = 1.0–8.0%; I² = 61.8%; homogeneity p = 0.07).

*Intra-thoracic complications included pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, and pleural effusion(s)

† Intra-abdominal collection included abscess, hematoma, urinoma, or biloma

Among 10 (24.4%) studies that reported data on in-hospital mortality, the pooled risk of in-hospital death after SNOM for abdominal GSWs was 0.4% (95% CI = 0.2–0.6%). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in this estimate (I² = 0%; homogeneity p > 0.99) (Fig. 3).

Hospital length of stay

Twenty-nine studies (70.7%) reported the mean hospital LOS among patients who underwent SNOM, which varied from 2 to 20 days. The weighted average hospital LOS was 5.9 days. However, in patients with isolated abdominal GSWs without any associated extra-abdominal injuries, the weighted median hospital LOS was 2.3 days. Conversely, the weighted median hospital LOS in patients who failed SNOM or developed complications was 10.1 days.

### The role of open abdomen in non-trauma patient: WSES consensus paper [^3a74467f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Management of the open abdomen remains a very controversial domain, in which many techniques are still debated. Many important issues remain to be addressed through carefully designed and rigorously conducted studies. Until better data is available, the use of the OA should be carefully tailored to each single patient taking care to not overuse this effective tool. Every effort should be exerted to attempt abdominal closure as soon as the patient can physiologically tolerate it. Finally, all the precautions should be considered to minimize the complication rate.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use in penetrating abdominal trauma: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^f88c2682]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in penetrating abdominal trauma has resulted in decreased infection rates. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) first published its practice management guidelines (PMGs) for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in penetrating abdominal trauma in 1998. During the next decade, several new prospective studies were published on this topic. In addition, the practice of damage control laparotomy became widely used, and additional questions arose as to the role of prophylactic antibiotics in this setting. Thus, the EAST Practice Management Guidelines Committee set out to update the original PMG.

Methods

A search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE databases was performed using PubMed (www.pubmed.gov) and specific key words. The search retrieved English language articles regarding the use of antibiotics in penetrating abdominal trauma published from 1973 to 2011. The topics investigated were the need for perioperative antibiotics, the duration of antibiotic therapy, the dose of antibiotics in patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock, and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy in the setting of damage control laparotomy.

Results

Forty-four articles were identified for inclusion in this review.

Conclusion

There is evidence to support a Level I recommendation that prophylactic antibiotics should only be administered for 24 hours in the presence of a hollow viscus injury. In addition, there are no data to support continuing prophylactic antibiotics longer than 24 hours in damage control laparotomy.

### Kidney and uro-trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^07d5ba95]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal pelvis injury does not contraindicate NOM; however, it may request acute or delayed, endoscopic or open repair, particularly when complete avulsion of the ureteropelvic junction is observed.

Angioembolization of severe injuries allows continuation of NOM if after the procedure patients recovered from a hemodynamic point of view, and when no other indications for laparotomy exists. In fact, In experienced centers with hybrid operating rooms, NOM may be attempted even in cases with a transient response to fluid resuscitation provided that all resources necessary for immediate operative intervention exist.

Isolated penetrating injuries to the kidney are rare; they are often associated with severe injuries, multiorgan involvement, and hemodynamic instability. However, NOM may be an appropriate first-line management option in hemodynamically stable patients without other indications for open surgical exploration (peritonitis, failed embolization, persistent bleeding, expanding or pulsatile hematoma, pielo-ureteral lesions) following penetrating trauma. As for blunt trauma, in deciding the applicability of NOM, institutional factors must be considered. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. It has been demonstrated that the degree of expertise of the trauma center plays a role in the successful rate of NOM. Success rate of NOM is approximately 50% in stab wounds and 40% in gunshot wounds.

Hemodynamically unstable patients with renal trauma not responsive to fluid resuscitation should undergo OM.

No data exist regarding the best management strategy in low resource settings, although it seems rational to use OM in those circumstances. Low resource settings, in a limited sense, could be considered similar to military settings where lack of well-equipped hospital facilities, increased distance from trauma centers, and long transport time to definitive care facilities are the norm.

Other imaging modalities such as intravenous pyelography (less effective than CT in diagnosing significant renal injury), plain radiography, ultrasound (can lead to some significant false negative) should be used to assess hemodynamically stable patients when CT scanning is not available.

Serial physical examination is reliable in detecting significant injuries after penetrating trauma to the abdomen if performed by experienced clinicians and preferably by the same team.

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^ebfe8748]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A computerized search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus by an information scientist/librarian for the time range of January 1980 to August 2017. The terms open abdomen, laparostomy, injuries, trauma, peritonitis, pancreatitis, vascular, ischemia, resuscitation, adult, management, infection, intensive care unit, anastomosis, vasopressors, and follow-up in various combinations with the use of the Boolean operators "AND" and "OR" were used. No search restrictions were imposed. The dates were selected to allow comprehensive published abstracts of clinical trials, consensus conferences, comparative studies, congresses, guidelines, government publications, multicenter studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, large case series, original articles, and randomized controlled trials. Case reports and small case series were excluded. We also analyzed the reference lists of relevant narrative review articles identified during the search to identify any studies that may have been missed.

For each article, we subsequently applied a level of evidence (LE) using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Table 1). The full GRADE process was not used, as this system is difficult to apply when scant evidence exists. A group of experts in the field of OA management, coordinated by a central coordinator, were subsequently convened in order to elicit their evidence-based opinions on certain key clinical questions relating to the OA. Through a Delphi process, the clinical questions were discussed in rounds. The central coordinator assembled the different answers derived from each round. Each version was then revised and improved through iterative evaluation. The final version about which the agreement was reached resulted in the comments and recommendations made in the present guideline. Statements have been summarized in Table 2.

### Selective nonoperative management of gunshot wounds of the anterior abdomen… [^2d71e80e]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To investigate the role of selective nonoperative management of gunshot wounds to the abdomen. Design: A prospective, protocol-guided study including all gunshot wounds of the anterior abdomen. Patients and Methods: The patients were assessed and managed according to a written protocol. Patients with hemodynamic instability or peritonitis or associated spinal cord or head injury or requiring a general anesthetic for an extra-abdominal injury were managed by laparotomy. The rest of the patients were selected for initial nonoperative management with serial physical examinations. Results: During a 16-month period, 309 patients with gunshot wounds of the anterior abdomen were treated. Eighteen patients in extremis underwent an emergency department — performed thoracotomy. Another 185 patients met the criteria for operation and underwent a laparotomy. The incidence of nontherapeutic operations was 2. 2%, and that of negative operations was
8. 6%.

One hundred six patients were selected for observation. Fourteen of the initially observed patients underwent a late operation, but it was therapeutic in only 5. Overall, 92 patients were successfully managed nonoperatively. The overall sensitivity of the initial physical examination was 97. 1%. The estimated bullet trajectory was not reliable in identifying the need for operation because of 224 patients with likely peritoneal penetration only 169 had significant injuries requiring surgical repair. Conclusion: In the appropriate environment, many civilian abdominal gunshot wounds can be managed nonoperatively. Arch Surg 1997; 132: 178–183 Demetriades D, Velmahos G, Cornwell E, et al.

### WSES classification and guidelines for liver trauma [^e13a0330]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Even in penetrating liver trauma, the angioembolization is considered as an "extension" of resuscitation in those patients presenting with ongoing resuscitative needs. However angioembolization can be applied safely only in selected centers. If required it can be safely repeated.

The main reluctance of surgeons to employ NOM in penetrating trauma is related to the fear of missing other abdominal lesions, especially hollow viscus perforation. Published data clearly showed that in patients without peritonitis on admission, no increase in mortality rates with missed hollow viscus perforation has been reported. On the other hand, non-therapeutic laparotomy has been demonstrated to increase the complication rate. Nevertheless OM in penetrating liver injuries has a higher liver-related complication rate (50–52%) than in blunt ones.

Concomitant severe head injuries

The otimal management of concomitant severe head and liver injuries is debated. In patients with severe head injuries hypotension may be deleterious, and OM could be suggested as safer. Recently, a large cohort of 1106 non-operatively managed low-energy gunshot liver injuries, has been published by Navsaria et al. The presence of concomitant liver and severe head injuries has been considered one of the main exclusion criteria to NOM. Authors stated that: "Hemodynamically stable patients with unreliable clinical examinations (head and/or high spinal cord injury) must also undergo an urgent exploratory laparotomy". Another paper analyzing 63 patients by Navsaria et al. suggested as predictive criteria for NOM failure in abdominal low-energy GSWs is the association with head and spinal cord injuries precluding meaningful clinical examination.

Follow-up after successful NOM

Clear and definitive direction for post-injury follow-up and normal activity resumption in those patients who experienced NOM haven't been published yet. General recommendations are to resume usual activity after 3–4 months in patients with an uncomplicated hospital course. This derives from the observation that the majority of liver lesions heal in almost 4 months. If the CT-scan follow-up (in grade III-V lesions) has shown significant healing normal activity can be resumed even after 1 month.

Patients should to be counseled not to remain alone for long periods and to return to the hospital immediately if they experience increasing abdominal pain, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses and meta-regression

Table 4 details results of stratified meta-analyses and meta-regression of variables associated with failure of SNOM for abdominal GSWs. There was no difference in the pooled risk of SNOM failure between prospective and retrospective studies or those conducted in the USA, South Africa, or other countries. Risks of failure of SNOM were lowest in studies that evaluated patients with right thoracoabdomen (3.4%; 95% CI = 0–7.0%; I² = 0%; homogeneity p = 0.45), flank (7.0%; 95% CI = 3.9–10.1%), and back (3.1%; 95% CI = 0–6.5%) GSWs and highest in those that evaluated patients with anterior abdomen (13.2%; 95% CI = 6.3–20.1%) GSWs. Estimates of the pooled risk of failure in studies where serial physical examinations were reportedly done by attending trauma surgeons were approximately one-third that of those reported in studies where physical examinations were done by surgical residents. When studies were divided according to the policy of CT use, the pooled estimate of SNOM failure in studies of patients undergoing selective abdominopelvic CT was approximately double that of the pooled estimate of SNOM failure in studies of patients undergoing mandatory CT.

### Gunshot wound without entrance hole: where is the trick?-a case report and review of the literaturer [^e917c5ea]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Many problems in the interpretation and reconstruction of the trajectory of the bullets have been reported in the Literature; a high index of suspicion should drive the diagnostic work-up, based on knowledge of ballistics and wounding potential of firearms; the goal is to anticipate the severity of a wound and detect earlier occult but severe internal lesions. In many cases, site of entrance and direction of bullet path could help the clinician to determine the potential of severe internal lesion. However, several singular cases have been described. The most frequent situation are atypical gunshot entrance holes, the wandering bullets, the spent bullet aspiration into the trachea-bronchial tree, and the so called "tandem bullet", in which there are 1 only entry point and more than one exit point, meaning tandem projectiles or multiple projectiles entering through the same hole. Kuy et al. report of undetected urinary tract injuries due to a gunshot wound to the buttock and they also review other similar cases of undetected urinary injuries following gunshot. Another atypical gunshot wound is the one reported from Ro et al. where the patient was shot from his left knee and the bullet travelled subcutaneously until the abdominal cavity perforating the left colon. The authors highlight the importance of CT scan to accurate evaluation of bullet trajectory, however in this case the trauma team is helped by the presence of well evident entrance hole.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the absence of an evident entry wound; since the CT scan showed the presence of a retained bullet in the left lung, the search for an entrance hole had been conducted with great attention by the surgeon, the anesthesiologist and the radiologist together. One possible explanation that was proposed was that the bullet had been swallowed and inhaled and then it had taken the path of a segmental bronchu. A second possible explanation was that the pulmonary bullet was fired many times later, during another gunshot assault. Retrospectively reassessing the information available after the first CT scan, the presence of air bubbles and small bone fragments in the extraperitoneal pelvis should have lead to a rectal examination. This was a major missing in the management of the here reported clinical case, even if the absence of indirect signs of bowel perforation was on contrast with the suspicion that the projectile had been shot from the anus and it reached the lung crossing the abdomen.

### WSES guidelines on blunt and penetrating bowel injury: diagnosis, investigations, and treatment [^4c1351d3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma: observation and nonoperative management

The clinical assessment for a patient with suspected intestinal injury begins with the primary survey to assess life-threatening injuries. Patients who are haemodynamically decompensated with a positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) should proceed directly to a trauma laparotomy to stop major abdominal bleeding and, if applicable, other sources of bleeding (e.g. pelvic, or long bone fractures), as well as control spillage of intestinal contents. In circumstances where the degree of haemodynamic decompensation is minor, diagnostic, and therapeutic laparoscopy can be considered. It is important to emphasise that these considerations are time crucial, with every 3 min spent in the emergency department equating to a 1% increased death probability and as a result of such, trauma laparotomies tend to be favoured.

### The open abdomen, indications, management and definitive closure [^3fd763e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The indications for Open Abdomen (OA) are generally all those situations in which is ongoing the development an intra-abdominal hypertension condition (IAH), in order to prevent the development of abdominal compartmental syndrome (ACS). In fact all those involved in care of a critically ill patient should in the first instance think how to prevent IAH and ACS. In case of ACS goal directed therapy to achieve early opening and early closure is the key: paradigm of closure shifts to combination of therapies including negative pressure wound therapy and dynamic closure, in order to reduce complications and avoid incisional hernia. There have been huge studies and progress in survival of critically ill trauma and septic surgical patients: this in part has been through the great work of pioneers, scientific societies and their guidelines; however future studies and continued innovation are needed to better understand optimal treatment strategies and to define more clearly the indications, because OA by itself is still a morbid procedure.

### WSES guidelines updates [^d3f150f2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Main text

The debate about the clinical guideline updating process is very animated with many scientific societies facing this problem. No consensus on update timing is acceptable by all.

No clear agreement exists about the timing and methodology for guideline updates. Some authors advocate updates every 2–5 years, and some advocate an update only when relevant evidences are available or recommendations become outdated.

Generally strong recommendations last longer

Are our recommendations really strong?

The relationship between emergency surgery and evidence-based medicine unfortunately at the moment is a troubled story. Good-quality evidence is frequently lacking in emergency surgery, and the difficulty to conduct randomized trials in emergency settings is well documented.

In this context, the quality of existing evidences is poor and based mainly on retrospective and observational studies; therefore, the strength of recommendations is often weak, based more on the plausibility that even a well-designed study will not change the clinical practice rather than on the results of randomized trials.

Moreover, the development of clinical guidelines is an extremely complex process that involves laborious work and involvement of an international panel of experts and needs months of work of reviewing the literature, mediating several points of view, and experts' opinions. In the absence of solid and strong evidences, like in emergency surgery, this process becomes harder.

At the light of these considerations, and in order to avoid a waste of time in producing duplicate guidelines with similar recommendations, the WSES board has decided to adopt a new policy and recommendations.
WSES requires a good-quality standard for guidelines; the development of guidelines should be performed according to the AGREE II requirements adopting the GRADE methodology for evidence evaluation and grading.
For each guideline topic, WSES will appoint a committee with a coordinator that will be nominated by WSES board who will be in charge of the continuous monitoring of new evidences available about the topic
The nominated committee will be responsible to add, on a dedicated area in the WSES website, all the relevant updates and new studies. The committee will have to notify and propose to the WSES board the need for guideline updating.

WSES will continue to promote a scientific approach to emergency and trauma surgery and to support the advance of clinical studies such the International Register of Open Abdomen (IROA), the International Register of Emergency Surgery (WIRES), and the ongoing COOL study in order to obtain good-quality evidence and the development of a better quality evidence-based approach in the daily practice.

### Delayed laparotomy after selective non-operative management of penetrating abdominal injuries [^05c85dbb]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Main concern during the practice of selective non-operative management (SNOM) for abdominal stab wounds (SW) and gunshot wounds (GSW) is the potential for harm in patients who fail SNOM and receive a delayed laparotomy (DL). The aim of this study is to determine whether such patients suffer adverse sequelae because of delays in diagnosis and treatment when managed under a structured SNOM protocol.

Methods

190 patients underwent laparotomy after an abdominal GSW or SW (5/04–10/12). Patients taken to operation within 120 min of admission were included in the early laparotomy (EL) group (n = 153, 80.5%) and the remaining in the DL group (n = 37, 19.5%). Outcomes included mortality, hospital stay, and postoperative complications.

Results

The median time from hospital arrival to operation was 43 min (range: 17–119) for EL patients and 249 min (range: 122–1,545) for DL patients. The average number and type of injuries were similar among the groups. Mortality and negative laparotomy were observed only in the EL group. There was no significant difference in the hospital stay between the groups. The overall complications were higher in the EL group (44.4 vs. 24.3%, p = 0.026). DL was independently associated with a lower likelihood for complications (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16–0.98, p = 0.045). Individual review of all DL patients did not reveal an incident in which complications could be directly attributed to the delay.

Conclusions

In a structured protocol, patients who fail SNOM and require an operation are recognized and treated promptly. The delay in operation does not cause unnecessary morbidity or mortality.

### Selective nonoperative management of abdominal shotgun wounds [^9e5aeb33]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective nonoperative management (SNOM) of abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs) has not been specifically examined after shotgun injuries. Because of the unpredictable nature of shotgun pellets, it is unclear if SNOM after shotgun wounds is safe. The study objective was to examine outcomes after SNOM for shotgun wounds to the abdomen.

Methods

Patients with isolated abdominal shotgun wounds were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank (2007–2017). Transfers, arrival without signs of life, death in the emergency department, severe (Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3) extra-abdominal injuries, abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scale = 6, and missing data were exclusion criteria. Patients with abdominal handgun wounds (GSWs) were used for comparison. Study groups of shotgun-injured patients were defined by management strategy: operative management (OM) (exploratory laparotomy ≤ 4h) versus SNOM (no exploratory laparotomy ≤ 4h). Outcomes were compared by mechanism of injury (shotgun versus GSW) and management strategy (OM versus SNOM) using univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

After exclusions, 1425 patients injured by abdominal shotgun wounds were included. Shotgun-injured patients underwent SNOM more frequently than GSW patients (42% versus 34%, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, injury by shotgun was independently associated with SNOM (OR 1.443, P = 0.040). Shotgun injuries were significantly more likely to fail SNOM (OR 2.401, P = 0.018). Failure of SNOM occurred earlier among shotgun-than GSW-injured patients (15 versus 24h, P = 0.011). SNOM after shotgun injury was associated with lower mortality than OM, even when patients failed SNOM (P < 0.001). Complications were uniformly higher after OM than SNOM, even when SNOM failed (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

SNOM was utilized more commonly after shotgun wounds than GSWs. However, SNOM was more likely to fail after shotgun injury and tended to occur earlier after admission. SNOM after shotgun injury was associated with improved mortality and decreased complication rates when compared with OM, even when patients failed SNOM. SNOM appears to be a safe and beneficial management strategy after shotgun wounds to the abdomen.

### Reporting of gunshot wounds by doctors in emergency departments: a duty or a right? Some legal and ethical issues surrounding breaking patient confidentiality [^43a393c6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines have been produced advising doctors working in emergency departments that they should report all gunshot injuries to the police (albeit with consent in all but very limited circumstances). This article will discuss some of the legal and ethical issues that surround breaking patient confidentiality in relation to gunshot wounds and other potentially dangerous patients; and looks at some cases from the UK and the USA where such issues have been ruled on. Finally, the issue of whether physicians do, or should, have a duty to warn when they feel that their patient may be dangerous will be discussed.
