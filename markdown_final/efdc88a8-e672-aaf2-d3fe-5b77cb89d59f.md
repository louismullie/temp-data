## Question

how do i diagnose my patient with addisons disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose Addison's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect primary adrenal insufficiency clinically. Then, I should verify the initial screening tests and their pitfalls. Next, I will confirm the gold-standard diagnostic test and its interpretation. After that, I need to determine etiology, especially autoimmune versus other causes. Then, I should assess mineralocorticoid status and associated autoimmune diseases. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check thresholds and exceptions at each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical triggers for suspicion, because Addison's disease is rare and often missed. I should keep a high index of suspicion in patients with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, orthostatic dizziness, salt craving, and hyperpigmentation, especially if symptoms are chronic or refractory to other explanations, and I must remember that hyperpigmentation reflects elevated ACTH and may be subtle or absent early on [^ffc09635] [^71a95861]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these symptoms overlap with many conditions, so I need to correlate with labs and context, and I should also consider that up to half of cases are first recognized at adrenal crisis, which underscores the need for a low threshold in acutely ill patients with hypotension, hyponatremia, or hyperkalemia [^9d595895] [^434743b2].

> Next, I should review the initial screening strategy. Wait, let me verify the timing and thresholds. A morning 8 am plasma cortisol with simultaneous ACTH is a reasonable first step; a cortisol less than about 5 mcg/dL is highly suggestive, whereas a cortisol greater than about 19–20 mcg/dL generally excludes primary adrenal insufficiency, though I should confirm that these cutoffs align with the assay and clinical context, and I must remember that a normal cortisol does not rule out early or partial disease [^434743b2] [^a573eabc]. I should double-check that ACTH is interpreted alongside cortisol: an inappropriately high ACTH with low cortisol supports primary adrenal insufficiency, whereas low or inappropriately normal ACTH suggests secondary causes, and I need to ensure I do not rely on a single random cortisol without ACTH when suspicion is high [^434743b2] [^b99c4e35].

> I will now examine the gold-standard diagnostic test. The short cosyntropin stimulation test using 250 mcg IV/IM with cortisol measured at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes is the first-line confirmatory test; a peak cortisol less than about 18 mcg/dL indicates impaired adrenal responsiveness and confirms primary adrenal insufficiency, provided the test is performed correctly and not confounded by recent exogenous glucocorticoids or assay issues [^434743b2] [^698fb806]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives if the standard test is not feasible; a low-dose 1 mcg test can be considered, particularly for suspected secondary adrenal insufficiency, but it requires careful preparation and is not routinely needed for primary disease, so I need to ensure I choose the right test for the right question [^a573eabc].

> Let me consider etiology next, because confirming autoimmune destruction changes management and counseling. I should confirm 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies with a validated assay; positivity supports autoimmune Addison's disease, which accounts for roughly 70–90% of cases in developed settings, and I need to remember that antibody titers can wane over time, so a negative result does not absolutely exclude autoimmunity, especially in long-standing disease [^434743b2] [^ad0e9af7]. If antibodies are negative, I should review other causes such as infections like tuberculosis or HIV, infiltrative diseases, hemorrhage, genetic syndromes, or drug-induced adrenalitis, and I should tailor imaging and targeted testing accordingly, including adrenal CT when indicated [^e230a2d4] [^434743b2].

> I need to ensure I assess mineralocorticoid deficiency, since aldosterone loss drives hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and volume depletion. Let me check the pattern: low aldosterone with elevated plasma renin activity confirms mineralocorticoid deficiency, and this should prompt fludrocortisone replacement once the patient is stabilized, with dosing adjusted to blood pressure, electrolytes, and renin over time [^434743b2] [^e9e53177]. But wait, what if potassium is normal early on? Hyperkalemia is not universal, and hyponatremia is more consistent, so I should not dismiss the diagnosis solely for normokalemia, especially in early or partially treated disease [^46c3f280].

> Next, I should review associated autoimmune diseases, because clustering is common and influences surveillance. I should confirm screening for autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, vitiligo, celiac disease, and, in women, consider premature ovarian insufficiency and steroidogenic cell antibodies, given their elevated prevalence in autoimmune Addison's disease and the need for lifelong vigilance [^e230a2d4] [^434743b2]. Hold on, I should verify that thyroid testing is interpreted cautiously; TSH may be elevated with untreated adrenal insufficiency and can normalize after glucocorticoid therapy, so I should avoid starting levothyroxine prematurely if adrenal disease is suspected or untreated to avoid precipitating crisis [^3145a79d] [^c1a64946].

> I will now examine special populations and pitfalls. In children, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and X-linked adrenal hypoplasia can mimic Addison's disease, so I should confirm with appropriate hormone profiles and genetic testing when indicated, and I should remember that boys with idiopathic Addison's warrant very-long-chain fatty acid testing to screen for adrenoleukodystrophy [^47728767] [^5dee63d9]. In patients with type 1 diabetes, I should double-check for hypoglycemia or falling insulin requirements as early clues to coexisting Addison's disease, and I should maintain a low threshold to screen for adrenal autoantibodies and function in this high-risk group [^4a7c19d8] [^5336d90e]. In acute presentations with shock or severe electrolyte disturbances, I must not delay life-saving hydrocortisone and fluids for testing; diagnosis can be confirmed after stabilization, and I should document any confounders like etomidate or recent steroids that can transiently suppress the axis [^9d595895] [^f71837a3].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Suspect based on compatible symptoms and signs, screen with morning cortisol and ACTH, confirm with cosyntropin stimulation if cortisol is low or clinical suspicion remains high, determine etiology with 21-hydroxylase antibodies and targeted imaging if negative, assess mineralocorticoid status and start fludrocortisone as indicated, and screen for associated autoimmune diseases with a plan for lifelong surveillance and patient education on stress dosing and emergency management [^434743b2] [^bb79e2f8]. I should double-check that I have emphasized the key takeaway: a high index of suspicion and timely testing prevent delays that too often culminate in adrenal crisis, and a structured approach with the right tests interpreted in the right sequence minimizes missed diagnoses [^9d595895] [^434743b2].

---

To diagnose Addison's disease, **confirm primary adrenal insufficiency** with a **short ACTH stimulation test** (250 mcg cosyntropin; peak cortisol < 18 mcg/dL at 30–60 min indicates failure) [^434743b2] [^698fb806]. If unavailable, use **morning cortisol < 5 mcg/dL** with elevated ACTH as a screening triage [^434743b2] [^a573eabc]. Next, **establish autoimmune etiology** with 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies [^434743b2]; if negative, obtain adrenal CT to evaluate for infection, infiltration, or hemorrhage [^e230a2d4]. Assess mineralocorticoid status with renin and aldosterone, and screen for other autoimmune diseases (thyroid, diabetes, pernicious anemia, vitiligo) [^e230a2d4]. In acute crisis, give hydrocortisone and fluids immediately — do not delay for testing [^9d595895] [^f71837a3].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial evaluation

Addison's disease presents with **nonspecific symptoms** — fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and salt craving [^ffc09635] [^71a95861]. Because symptoms are nonspecific, maintain a **high index of suspicion**, especially in patients with other autoimmune diseases or unexplained hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or hypotension [^434743b2] [^46c3f280].

---

## Biochemical confirmation of adrenal insufficiency

### Step 1: basal morning cortisol and ACTH

- **Morning cortisol**: Obtain an 8 am serum cortisol; < 5 mcg/dL strongly suggests adrenal insufficiency, whereas > 19 mcg/dL generally excludes it [^434743b2] [^a573eabc].
- **ACTH measurement**: Concurrently measure plasma ACTH; elevated ACTH (> 2× upper limit of normal) with low cortisol indicates primary adrenal insufficiency [^434743b2] [^b99c4e35].

---

### Step 2: confirmatory testing

The **short ACTH stimulation test** (250 mcg cosyntropin) is the gold standard [^434743b2]. Measure cortisol at baseline and 30–60 minutes; a peak < 18 mcg/dL confirms primary adrenal insufficiency [^434743b2] [^698fb806]. If the test is unavailable, a low-dose (1 mcg) test can be used, particularly for secondary adrenal insufficiency, but it requires careful preparation and is less standardized [^a573eabc].

---

## Determining the etiology

### Autoimmune etiology

Autoimmune adrenalitis is the **most common cause** in developed countries [^434743b2]. Measure **21-hydroxylase autoantibodies**; their presence confirms autoimmune Addison's disease [^434743b2] [^ad0e9af7].

---

### Non-autoimmune etiologies

If autoantibodies are negative, evaluate for **alternative causes**:

- **Infections**: Tuberculosis, HIV, fungal infections (histoplasmosis, cryptococcus) [^e230a2d4].
- **Infiltrative diseases**: Metastatic cancer, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis [^e230a2d4].
- **Genetic disorders**: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenoleukodystrophy [^47728767].
- **Medications**: Ketoconazole, mitotane, etomidate [^notfound].

Adrenal **CT imaging** is recommended to assess for enlargement, calcifications, or atrophy, which can suggest infectious or infiltrative etiologies [^e230a2d4].

---

## Assessing mineralocorticoid status

Mineralocorticoid deficiency is a hallmark of primary adrenal insufficiency. Measure **plasma renin activity** (elevated) and **serum aldosterone** (low or inappropriately normal) to confirm mineralocorticoid deficiency [^434743b2] [^58e41d12].

---

## Screening for associated autoimmune diseases

Patients with autoimmune Addison's disease have a high risk of other autoimmune diseases. Screen for:

- **Thyroid disease**: Hypo- or hyperthyroidism [^efa1e0cf].
- **Type 1 diabetes mellitus** [^e230a2d4].
- **Pernicious anemia** [^e230a2d4].
- **Vitiligo** [^e230a2d4].
- **Premature ovarian insufficiency** in women [^6786619d].

---

## Special considerations

### Acute adrenal crisis

In acute adrenal crisis, **do not delay treatment** for testing. Administer hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus followed by 200 mg over 24 hours, plus aggressive isotonic saline and dextrose as needed [^9d595895] [^f71837a3].

---

### Pediatric patients

In children, use a **hydrocortisone dose of ~8 mg/m²/day** divided into three doses, and adjust fludrocortisone based on growth, blood pressure, and electrolytes [^434743b2].

---

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **increase hydrocortisone dose by 50%** in the third trimester and during labor, and monitor closely for adrenal crisis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic algorithm

| **Step** | **Test** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Morning cortisol and ACTH | - Cortisol < 5 mcg/dL and elevated ACTH suggest primary adrenal insufficiency [^434743b2] [^a573eabc] |
| 2 | Short ACTH stimulation test | - Peak cortisol < 18 mcg/dL confirms adrenal insufficiency [^434743b2] [^698fb806] |
| 3 | 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies | Positive confirms autoimmune etiology [^434743b2] [^ad0e9af7] |
| 4 | Adrenal CT | Evaluate for infection, infiltration, or hemorrhage if autoantibodies are negative [^e230a2d4] |
| 5 | Renin and aldosterone | Elevated renin and low aldosterone confirm mineralocorticoid deficiency [^434743b2] [^58e41d12] |
| 6 | Screening for associated autoimmune diseases | Identify coexisting autoimmune conditions [^e230a2d4] [^efa1e0cf] |

---

Diagnosing Addison's disease requires a **structured approach**: screen with morning cortisol and ACTH, confirm with an ACTH stimulation test, establish autoimmune etiology with 21-hydroxylase antibodies, and assess mineralocorticoid status and associated autoimmune diseases. In acute crisis, treat immediately and confirm the diagnosis afterward.

### Consensus statement on the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency [^bb79e2f8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), or Addison's disease, is a rare, potentially deadly, but treatable disease. Most cases of PAI are caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex. Consequently, patients with PAI are at higher risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of PAI is often delayed by many months, and most patients present with symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency. Because PAI is rare, even medical specialists in this therapeutic area rarely manage more than a few patients. Currently, the procedures for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of this rare disease vary greatly within Europe. The common autoimmune form of PAI is characterized by the presence of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies; other causes should be sought if no autoantibodies are detected. Acute adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Standard replacement therapy consists of multiple daily doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate combined with fludrocortisone. Annual follow-up by an endocrinologist is recommended with the focus on optimization of replacement therapy and detection of new autoimmune diseases. Patient education to enable self-adjustment of dosages of replacement therapy and crisis prevention is particularly important in this disease. The authors of this document have collaborated within an EU project (Euadrenal) to study the pathogenesis, describe the natural course and improve the treatment for Addison's disease. Based on a synthesis of this research, the available literature, and the views and experiences of the consortium's investigators and key experts, we now attempt to provide a European Expert Consensus Statement for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.

Background

Adrenal insufficiency and its deceiving appearance were originally described by Addison.Addison’s compelling characterisation still persists; the discolouration of the skin, faintness, loss of appetite and extreme debility that the ‘body wastes’ and that ‘the patient at length gradually sinks and expires’ (figure 1).Nevertheless, over one and a half century later, we still struggle to recognise the clinical presentation and still fear the potentially fatal nature.

### The genetics of autoimmune addison disease: past, present and future [^a23bcaf8]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmune Addison disease is an endocrinopathy that is fatal if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Its rarity has hampered unbiased studies of the predisposing genetic factors. A 2021 genome-wide association study, explaining up to 40% of the genetic susceptibility, has revealed new disease loci and reproduced some of the previously reported associations, while failing to reproduce others. Credible risk loci from both candidate gene and genome-wide studies indicate that, like one of its most common comorbidities, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison disease is primarily caused by aberrant T cell behaviour. Here, we review the current understanding of the genetics of autoimmune Addison disease and its position in the wider field of autoimmune disorders. The mechanisms that could underlie the effects on the adrenal cortex are also discussed.

### Addison's disease and its associations [^9e0c4eb9]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Addison's disease is a relatively rare endocrine condition resulting from adrenal insufficiency due to various causes. Weight loss is a common feature; however, patients may be seen by a variety of specialists, even requiring acute admission before the diagnosis is made. Addison's disease is commonly associated with other autoimmune diseases. In some cases such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) types 1 and 2, these associations are more commonly found. We present a case of one such patient who presented to the acute medical team having been referred to the gastrointestinal services in the previous year for persistent vomiting and weight loss. On review of history, the cause of vomiting and weight loss was questioned and combined with subsequent biochemical testing a diagnosis of Addison's disease was made. The patient was also noted to have other associated endocrine and autoimmune conditions.

### Addison disease: early detection and treatment principles [^71a95861]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison disease, has many causes, the most common of which is autoimmune adrenalitis. Autoimmune adrenalitis results from destruction of the adrenal cortex, which leads to deficiencies in glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens. In the United States and Western Europe, the estimated prevalence of Addison disease is one in 20,000 persons; therefore, a high clinical suspicion is needed to avoid misdiagnosing a life-threatening adrenal crisis (i.e., shock, hypotension, and volume depletion). The clinical manifestations before an adrenal crisis are subtle and can include hyperpigmentation, fatigue, anorexia, orthostasis, nausea, muscle and joint pain, and salt craving. Cortisol levels decrease and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels increase. When clinically suspected, patients should undergo a cosyntropin stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency requires replacement of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. During times of stress (e.g., illness, invasive surgical procedures), stress-dose glucocorticoids are required because destruction of the adrenal glands prevents an adequate physiologic response. Management of primary adrenal insufficiency or autoimmune adrenalitis requires vigilance for concomitant autoimmune diseases; up to 50% of patients develop another autoimmune disorder during their lifetime.

Discussion

This case report highlights many important aspects of adrenal insufficiency and crisis. Above all, it illustrates the difficulty to recognise the non-specific insidious symptoms that often develop during several years and the resultant suffering the patient experiences as the diagnosis is delayed. Given the medical history, symptoms and signs may have been present for as many as 10 years; the postural hypotension, syncope, arthralgia, diarrhoea, fatigue and all the psychiatric disorders that notably did not improve by medication, were probably caused by primary adrenal insufficiency all along. The diagnosis adrenal insufficiency is extremely challenging in early stages and can even delude endocrinologists. Morning values of S-cortisol were measured both 6 and 8 years prior to the adrenal crisis, but unfortunately without concomitant assessment of ACTH—supposedly because the cortisol values were mere screening samples and the degree of suspicion was unfortunately low at the time. Since these values were within a possible normal range, it may have led to insufficient consideration and careless, incorrect, discarding of the diagnosis adrenal insufficiency. This shows that interpretation of S-cortisol is difficult and that adrenal insufficiency should not be ruled out with random values.Only higher values within the normal range generally exclude primary adrenal insufficiency (>550 nmol/L),and besides repeated evaluations one should simultaneously measure ACTH, where a morning value of double the reference range’s upper limit suggests adrenal insufficiency and thereto determines the cause as primary. Unless these results are unambiguous, it is recommended to confirm the diagnosis with the gold standard ACTH stimulation test.Current clinical guidelines propose that patients diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency should be evaluated for mineralocorticoid deficiency. However, in cases with an autoimmune origin the zona glomerulosa is often affected first, with consequential increases in plasma renin activity and normal to low serum aldosterone levels then being the earliest signs of the disease. We, therefore, contemplate whether it may be advantageous to assess a possible mineralocorticoid deficiency already in initial stages of suspected primary adrenal insufficiency to earlier approach—but note, not exclude—the diagnosis. Certainly, our patient had long-standing signs and symptoms of mineralocorticoid deficiency presenting as electrolyte disturbances, although initially subtle, as well as postural hypotension related to volume depletion. Either way it is unequivocal that we must above all raise our vigilance, more generously suspect adrenal insufficiency and allow our clinical judgement to guide us to more meticulous evaluation of possible cases.

### Premature mortality in patients with Addison's disease: a population-based study [^57a07aac]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The survival rate of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) undergoing currently accepted replacement therapy is not known, although well-informed patients are considered to have a normal survival rate. In this study, we evaluated the mortality of patients with Addison's disease in Sweden.

Methods

A population-based, retrospective, observational study was performed, using the National Swedish Hospital and Cause of Death Registers, covering the period from 1987-2001. After a diagnosis of Addison's disease, each patient was followed until the end of follow-up or death. Mortality was compared with that of the Swedish background population.

Findings

We identified 1675 patients (995 women and 680 men) diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency. The average follow-up from initial diagnosis was 6.5 yr. Five hundred seven patients died during the study period compared with an expected 199. The risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 2.19 (confidence interval 1.91-2.51) for men and 2.86 (confidence interval 2.54-3.20) for women. The excess mortality in both men and women was attributed to cardiovascular, malignant, and infectious diseases. Concomitant diabetes mellitus was observed in 12% of the patients, but only contributed to the increased mortality to a minor extent.

Interpretation

Compared with the background population, we observed that the risk ratio for death was more than 2-fold higher in patients with Addison's disease. Cardiovascular, malignant, and infectious diseases were responsible for the higher mortality rate.

### Natural history of adrenal steroidogenesis in autoimmune Addison's disease following diagnosis and treatment [^0bb70ac8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune Addison disease (AAD) is a rare endocrinopathy characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex. Without treatment, it is invariably fatal, but once diagnosed health can be maintained with daily glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement tablets. Symptoms of AAD frequently start months or years before the condition is diagnosed, and current thinking is that it progresses to a “point of no return” where complete adrenocortical steroidogenic failure is inevitable and universal. Despite this assumption, several instances showing apparent spontaneous remission of well-characterized AAD have been reported in patients several years after an initial firm diagnosis. In addition, 1 study reported reduction in adrenal autoantibody titer and improved adrenal function in a presymptomatic individual following high-dose prednisolone therapy for coexisting Graves’ orbitopathy. These studies start to suggest that adrenocortical steroidogenesis may exhibit some plasticity both at first presentation of Addison disease, and perhaps persisting postdiagnosis and treatment of AAD. With this in mind, we previously studied 13 patients with established AAD and found that 2 (15%) had detectable steroidogenesis 4 and 8 years postdiagnosis, which was amenable to improvement with high-dose ACTH therapy. One of these individuals remains healthy without steroid medication more than 7 years later, although ACTH remains elevated and adrenal autoantibodies remain detectable.

### Natural history of adrenal steroidogenesis in autoimmune Addison's disease following diagnosis and treatment [^7eb7e280]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

The natural history of adrenal function in autoimmune Addison disease once diagnosed and treated has not been systematically studied, but several case reports of recovery from established adrenal failure suggest it may not be uniform.

Objective

To ascertain steroidogenic function in autoimmune Addison disease immediately following diagnosis and during prolonged treatment.

Design

We studied peak serum cortisol in response to ACTH1-24 in 20 newly diagnosed autoimmune Addison disease patients at first presentation and then again within a month. We also studied 37 patients with established Addison disease (for between 7 months and 44 years) in a medication-free state, measuring peak serum cortisol responses to ACTH1-24 and the urine LC-MS steroid metabolome.

Results

Adrenal steroidogenesis declined rapidly after steroid replacement treatment for newly diagnosed Addison disease was started, with a peak serum cortisol falling from 138±19 nmol/L (SEM) at presentation to 63±13 nmol/L over 4 weeks (P<0.003).Six of 37 participants (16%) with established Addison disease had detectable serum cortisol and urine glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolites during repeat testing, indicating variable degrees of residual adrenal function.

Conclusion

Autoimmune Addison disease is a heterogeneous condition, showing a rapid decline in adrenal steroidogenesis during the first few weeks following diagnosis, but low-level residual function in a minority of patients, which appears to persist for many years.

Results

Adrenal steroidogenesis declined rapidly after steroid replacement treatment for newly diagnosed Addison disease was started, with a peak serum cortisol falling from 138 ± 19 nmol/L (SEM) at presentation to 63 ± 13 nmol/L over 4 weeks (P < 0.003).

Six of 37 participants (16%) with established Addison disease had detectable serum cortisol and urine glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolites during repeat testing, indicating variable degrees of residual adrenal function.

Conclusion

Autoimmune Addison disease is a heterogeneous condition, showing a rapid decline in adrenal steroidogenesis during the first few weeks following diagnosis, but low-level residual function in a minority of patients, which appears to persist for many years.

Patients and Methods

Newly presenting autoimmune Addison disease

In 20 patients, serum cortisol data were captured at first presentation with newly diagnosed Addison disease, followed by a plasma ACTH measurement and a formal short Synacthen (ACTH 1-24 stimulation) test within 4 weeks of the commencement of oral glucocorticoid replacement. These participants were recruited for enrollment into 2 different studies (NCT00753597, ISRCTN20220821) that attempted to improve adrenal function early on in the natural history of the condition. In both studies, participants were diagnosed with Addison disease in local National Health Service hospitals or at our tertiary center and started on oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy. Serum cortisol measurements were captured from the day of their presentation and compared with the peak serum cortisol following Synacthen stimulation 14 to 28 days later when they were assessed during a 36-hour medication-free baseline visit for the intervention study. All participants had plasma ACTH concentrations above the reference range before testing and all but 1 patient had positive serum steroid 21-hydroxylase antibodies; this patient went on to develop Graves’ disease, indicating a likely autoimmune basis for her adrenal failure, too.

### A challenging diagnosis that eventually results in a life-threatening condition: Addison's disease and adrenal crisis [^9d595895]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Besides its perplexing presentation and subtle onset, primary adrenal insufficiency is also rare why it is not uncommon that the diagnosis is delayed or missed. In fact, approximately 50% of all cases are first recognised when the patient eventually presents with a life-threatening adrenal crisis. It is, therefore, important to suspect adrenal crisis in all acutely ill patients with cardiovascular collapse. The therapeutic threshold should be low and parenteral administration of 100 mg hydrocortisone should not be delayed awaiting diagnostic measures.Further treatment with an additional 200 mg hydrocortisone distributed over the coming 24 hours, along with fluid replacement and careful electrolyte correction follows. Although recovery usually is quick and miraculous, improvement can sometimes withstand nearly a week, especially in cases where chronic adrenal insufficiency has gone undetected for a longer period of time and finally presents with an affected level of consciousness.Regarding our patient, both the medical history and the lower, yet significant, titres of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies supports that the disease has existed, but failed to be diagnosed, for a longer period of time.In this specific case, the recovery was extraordinarily slow and even developed into catatonia, which is appreciated to be a result of the patient’s extremely serious medical state rather than an expression of a primary psychiatric disease.Even though the patient has a positive family history of psychiatric disorders, the fact that the patient’s earlier psychiatric symptoms never responded to psychiatric medications but splendidly subsided with hydrocortisone treatment makes it reasonable to believe that the psychiatric disorders were misinterpretations of adrenal insufficiency all along. The fact that the patient was under severe physical stress may also be depicted by the presence of takotsubo syndrome, and the association between adrenal insufficiency and reversible myocardial systolic dysfunction has been reported in several other cases, for instance by Ukita et al and Elikowski et al.Moreover, it is interesting that the vital steroid treatment of adrenal crisis may in fact worsen cardiac function as the myocardium then becomes even more sensitive, than the cortisone-deprived myocardium itself, to catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^c93aafe0]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI), first described by Thomas Addison in 1855, is characterised by inadequate hormonal production by the adrenal gland, which could either be primary, due to destruction of the adrenal cortex, or secondary/tertiary, due to lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone or its stimulation by corticotropin-releasing hormone. This was an invariably fatal condition in Addison's days with most patients dying within a few years of diagnosis. However, discovery of cortisone in the 1940s not only improved the life expectancy of these patients but also had a dramatic effect on their overall quality of life. The diagnosis, easily confirmed by demonstrating inappropriately low cortisol secretion, is often delayed by months, and many patients present with acute adrenal crisis. Sudden withdrawal from chronic glucocorticoid therapy is the most common cause of AI. Currently, there remains a wide variation in the management of this condition across Europe. As primary AI is a relatively rare condition, most medical specialists will only manage a handful of these patients in their career. Despite many advances in recent years, there is currently no curative option, and modern cortisol replacement regimens fail to adequately mimic physiological cortisol rhythm. A number of new approaches including allograft of adrenocortical tissue and stem cell therapy are being tried but remain largely experimental.

### Epidemiology (...) [^a573eabc]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type II is not a common disease, but it has life-threatening consequences when the diagnosis is overlooked. APS II is the combination of chronic autoimmune adrenal insufficiency with autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 autoimmune diabetes mellitus, or both. Other associated conditions are listed in. Clinical Presentation Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are non-specific and common to many other conditions, and they may fluctuate in the early stages of the disease. Common signs and symptoms are listed in. A serum cortisol level less than 14 mcg per dL is considered positive and indicates an increased probability of primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. The test can be done at any time of day. A basal cortisol level is not necessary because the percent of change is not used as diagnostic criteria.

A low-dose test, done with 1 mcg of cosyntropin, performs equally well for primary adrenal insufficiency and may be superior for diagnosing secondary adrenal insufficiency. 13 The test requires intravenous administration and careful timing of the cortisol level. The diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency can be confirmed by an increased plasma ACTH level. Concomitant diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency and thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes does not necessarily confirm a diagnosis of APS II. An autoimmune basis for the components of the syndrome must be demonstrated to confirm the diagnosis. Adrenal cortex antibodies often are found early in APS II, but the levels may decrease after a long duration of disease. 21-Hydroxylase antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for primary adrenal insufficiency of autoimmune origin.

16 Adrenal cortex antibodies or 21-hydroxylase antibodies are virtually always present with APS II because autoimmune adrenal insufficiency is required for the diagnosis. Thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies and thyroglobulin autoantibodies are detected in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. 2 Islet cell antibodies can be demonstrated in about 80 percent of patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes. 2 Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies are the marker with the highest diagnostic sensitivity for type 1 autoimmune diabetes. 2 Because up to 50 percent of patients with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency may develop APS II, adults with the condition should be screened for thyroid disease and diabetes every five years.

### The diagnosis and treatment of Addison's disease (...) [^2918eb6d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

During the past two and one-half years we have treated thirteen cases of Addison's disease by means of the suprarenal cortical extract made according to the method of Swingle and Pfiffner. The diagnosis of each of these cases we have regarded as unequivocal. We have had seven deaths, and six of our patients are now living. All of the seven fatal cases have come to autopsy, and the clinical diagnosis of Addison's disease has in each been proved correct. Four were due to cortical atrophy. Of the three due to tuberculosis, case 1 was the first one in which treatment was given, and in the light of our later experience, adequate amounts of extract were not administered. The other two patients had advanced tuberculous lesions elsewhere in the body which probably caused death. An earlier report appeared in The Journal a year ago.

### Natural history of adrenal steroidogenesis in autoimmune Addison's disease following diagnosis and treatment [^7a9886aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Newly presenting Addison disease

Twenty newly presenting AAD patients (age range, 17–64 years, 13 females) were studied on the day of first presentation with adrenal insufficiency, either with random or ACTH 1-24 –stimulated serum cortisol measurements. Plasma ACTH was increased in all patients at presentation (median = 1050 ng/L, range 68-2630 ng/L, reference range 10-47 ng/L). They were subsequently treated with hydrocortisone, recruited for the therapeutic clinical trials and ACTH 1-24 –stimulated serum cortisol measurements were repeated 14 to 28 days later (median 26 days), before any other intervention. In 19 of the 20 cases, stimulated serum cortisol dropped substantially over the first few weeks of hydrocortisone treatment, from a median at presentation of 125 nmol/L (range < 23-257) to 39.5 nmol/L (range < 23-265), (P < 0.007; Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 1).

### Natural history of adrenal steroidogenesis in autoimmune Addison's disease following diagnosis and treatment [^5c788011]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AAD has a long latency before presentation in most patients and understanding the natural history once steroid replacement treatment has started is an important goal if we are to intervene to improve adrenal function in this chronic condition. The initial part of this study documents for the first time that serum cortisol concentrations drop rapidly within 4 weeks following diagnosis and conventional treatment of AAD. The most plausible explanation for this is that the ACTH drive, which maximally stimulates the adrenal cortex before diagnosis, is reduced by the institution of regular daily glucocorticoid medication under physiological feedback. Thus, before diagnosis, patients with AAD have constantly high circulating ACTH concentrations; these serve to stimulate proliferation and repopulation of adrenocortical cells that are being destroyed by immune-mediated attack. Hyperplastic adrenocortical cells were noted many years ago in the adrenals from deceased AAD patients. However, once glucocorticoid replacement therapy is started the plasma ACTH drops to low or undetectable levels after the morning dose of hydrocortisone is taken each day, reducing the tropic drive to steroidogenesis and regeneration. This change in ACTH concentration also correlates with the improvement in pigmentation observed in most AAD patients following successful treatment. An alternative explanation is that patients’ adrenal steroidogenic function is on a steep downward trajectory at the time they are diagnosed and that it is declining irrespective of the steroid replacement treatment and changes to ACTH levels. Either way, this phenomenon seems like the opposite of the honeymoon period in type 1 diabetes, where there is frequently a transient improvement in islet cell function and insulin secretion in the months following initial insulin therapy.

### Adrenal imaging: from addison to algorithms [^e523efd1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Despite their small size, pathologic condition of the adrenal glands is often far from insignificant. Imagers should therefore be familiar with the principles and techniques that underpin the ability of imaging to characterize most lesions. Ignorance of these techniques fails to deliver the necessary imaging value to referrers and patients alike. This article, outlines the range of possible abnormalities encountered in the adrenal gland, the imaging modalities and specialized techniques used to detect and characterize them, the principles based on which these techniques are used, and finally a working imaging algorithm that can be readily used in daily practice.

### Diagnosis and classification of Addison's disease (autoimmune adrenalitis) [^7da9589a]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune adrenalitis, or autoimmune Addison disease (AAD), is the most prevalent cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in the developed world. AAD is rare and can easily be misdiagnosed as other conditions. The diagnosis depends on demonstrating inappropriately low cortisol production and the presence of high titers of adrenal cortex autoantibodies (ACAs), along with excluding other causes of adrenal failure using other tests as necessary. The treatment corticosteroid replacement, and the prognosis following the treatment is the same as the normal population. Spontaneous recovery of adrenal function has been described but is rare.

### Autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency: understanding the past, present, and future [^4bd12dad]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), or Addison's disease, results from adrenal gland dysgenesis or destruction, leading to impaired production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens. Our understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of PAI has significantly evolved since this condition was originally described.

Results

Over the past 3 decades, the epidemiology and demographics of PAI has shifted, with autoimmune PAI now recognized as the most common cause. This shift has been influenced by increasing awareness of autoimmunity and the widespread use of immune modulating medications, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. The diagnosis of PAI is often delayed, likely due to its nonspecific clinical presentation. This delay may result in increased morbidity and mortality from adrenal crisis. While treatment involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy, optimizing glucocorticoid dosing remains a challenge. Emerging therapeutic approaches focus on preserving residual adrenal function and preventing disease progression, offering hope for improved long-term outcomes.

Conclusion

This review provides an updated overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and future directions in the care of autoimmune PAI. It examines key pathophysiologic and autoimmune features of PAI and explores future directions aimed at identifying genetic and molecular markers that may change the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of this important endocrinopathy.

### Recurrent nocturnal hypoglycaemia as a cause of morning fatigue in treated Addison's disease – favourable response to dietary management: a case report [^8fc70b85]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is managed with adrenal hormone replacement (glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid). Ongoing fatigue despite best practice hormone replacement is a clinical problem. Treated patients are not regarded as being at risk of hypoglycaemia despite loss of the glucose elevating effects of glucocorticoids (GC). We describe a patient with nocturnal hypoglycaemia diagnosed on continuous glucose monitoring that had resolved with a late evening dietary supplement with attendant improvement in morning fatigue and headache. This problem may be more frequent than recognised and a systematic study is required.

### First presentation of Addison's disease as hyperkalaemia in acute kidney injury [^e8f84007]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Addison's disease is a rare endocrine disorder that frequently presents with non-specific symptoms, but may deteriorate rapidly into life-threatening Addisonian crisis if left untreated. Diagnosis can be difficult in patients without a suggestive medical history. We describe a case of a 37-year-old man who was admitted with acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, resistant to treatment with insulin/dextrose and calcium gluconate. On clinical examination, he was found to be hyperpigmented; a subsequent random serum cortisol of 49nmol/L affirmed the preliminary diagnosis of Addison's disease. The patient's hyperkalaemia improved on treatment with hydrocortisone, and a follow-up morning adrenocorticotropic hormone of 1051ng/L confirmed the diagnosis.

### Addison's disease in evolution: an illustrative case and literature review [^58e41d12]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a case of symptomatic autoimmune adrenal insufficiency with initially normal serum cortisol and to caution about limitations of the current diagnostic algorithm for adrenal insufficiency, which does not reflect the pathophysiology of early disease.

Methods

We describe the clinical presentation and relevant investigations of a patient ultimately found to have Addison's disease, which is followed by a focused review of the literature.

Results

A 41-year-old Caucasian woman with autoimmune hypothyroidism, premature ovarian failure, and microscopic colitis presented with nausea, salt craving, increased skin pigmentation, and postural hypotension. Initial bloodwork revealed a normal morning cortisol of level of 19.2 μg/dL (normal, 7.2 to 25 μg/dL) but an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level 10 times normal, at 513.6 pg/mL (normal, <52.5 pg/mL). Her potassium was normal, but her aldosterone level was 4.12 ng/dL (normal, 12.3 to 62.5 ng/dL) and her renin activity was increased (23.0 mg/dL/hour; normal, <6.0 mg/dL/hour). Six weeks after initial presentation, she was found to have anti-adrenal antibodies. It was not until 10 weeks after her initial symptomatic presentation that her morning cortisol level was found to be subnormal and a formal diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was made.

Conclusion

The present case and literature review reveal that common diagnostic approaches will miss patients with (possibly symptomatic) early adrenal insufficiency. We suggest that serum ACTH level testing or tests of mineralocorticoid function be included in the initial step of investigation for suspected primary adrenal insufficiency.

### A challenging diagnosis that eventually results in a life-threatening condition: Addison's disease and adrenal crisis [^11a3734e]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Furthermore, this case report also denotes the intricate association between thyroid disease and adrenal insufficiency. On the one hand, in the presence of another autoimmune disease, for example, hypothyroidism, there is an increased risk of adrenalitis and the diagnostic boundary for primary adrenal insufficiency should be lowered.On the other hand, an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may be a mere feature of adrenal insufficiency, predating many other signs or symptoms.Note that in these cases treatment with levothyroxine may actually precipitate an adrenal crisis. Regarding our patient, he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a decade ago, based on a slight increase in TSH (5.6 mlU/L), while T4 and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were normal. As the patient was critically ill suffering from adrenal crisis, thyroidal laboratory results unsurprisingly indicated low T3 syndrome and are thus insignificant. Time will tell whether the patient actually suffers from hypothyroidism in addition to Addison’s disease, or if levothyroxine therapy, which already has been halved, can be ceased completely as thyroid hormone status may normalise by hydrocortisone treatment.

This is only one of many cases that depicts the diagnostic struggle of Addison’s disease. It is frequently mistaken for psychiatric disorders, such as depression, apathy, anxiety or even psychosis, and already in the originally described cases by Addison it is obvious that these traits often precede other symptoms.Another case, strikingly similar to our own, describes a young man lacking concern for his deteriorating health, who was appreciated to suffer from both obsessional traits and depression; later a mistaken diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was made before primary adrenal insufficiency was confirmed.Other cases presenting as anorexia nervosa can be found in the literature, which is not surprising given that vomiting along with weight loss are common manifestations of adrenal insufficiency.Even then, as always, the cardinal sign of extreme fatigue prevails and the importance of suspecting and not so readily dismissing this rare diagnosis cannot be stressed enough, before the symptoms of debility and lack of concern for their own physical state make the affected ‘sink and expire’ and eventually encounter a life-threatening adrenal crisis at a much too young age.

### Unusual presentation of Addison's disease in schmidt's syndrome [^a6dcbd9f]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

A patient with Schmidt's syndrome and atypical symptoms of Addison's disease is presented. Autoimmune thyroiditis was diagnosed at the age of 12 years and then at 15 years; a diagnosis of migraine was made following 10 days of headache, visual field defects and dysarthria. One week later the patient was admitted to hospital in critical condition. Addison's disease was diagnosed and replacement therapy was introduced which brought about a rapid clinical improvement. Positive adrenal autoantibodies confirmed the diagnosis. We suggest that patients with organ-specific autoimmune disease undergo annual screening for adrenal activity, and in the event of abnormal results, adrenal autoantibody evaluation should be carried out, to avoid a life-threatening crisis caused by Addison's disease, which is often difficult to recognize due to atypical clinical presentation, as in the patient reported here.

### Newly diagnosed T1 diabetes presenting with hypoglycemia due to simultaneous co-existence of addison disease [^5336d90e]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) classically presents with symptomatic hyperglycemia and many patients develop diabetic ketoacidosis prior to their diagnosis. However, non-classical presentation or co-presentation with associated diseases may delay diagnosis or lead to challenges in acute, clinical management. An 18-yr-old girl presented to hospital with severe, symptomatic hypoglycemia. Clinical history and serum electrolyte concentrations suggested a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. She remained hypoglycemic until glucocorticoid replacement was commenced, at which point she developed persistent hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy. Subsequent follow up confirmed the diagnosis of Addison's disease (AD), the treatment of which unmasked co-existing type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune diseases often cluster together in affected patients and first-degree relatives. Approximately 1 in 200 patients with T1DM develop AD. However, months or more commonly years usually elapse between the presentation of different autoimmune conditions. The co-diagnosis T1DM and AD in the acute setting is rare. Moreover, the first presentation of T1DM with severe hypoglycemia is even more exceptional. This case highlights the need for vigilance during the acute, emergency management of patients with autoimmune conditions and, in particular, to consider the possibility of concurrent antibody-mediated diseases which may need to be addressed during resuscitation.

### Clues for early detection of autoimmune Addison's disease-myths and realities [^46c3f280]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early detection of autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is important as delay in diagnosis may result in a life-threatening adrenal crisis and death. The classical clinical picture of untreated AAD is well-described, but methodical investigations are scarce.

Objective

Perform a retrospective audit of patient records with the aim of identifying biochemical markers for early diagnosis of AAD.

Material and Methods

A multicentre retrospective study including 272 patients diagnosed with AAD at hospitals in Norway and Sweden during 1978-2016. Scrutiny of medical records provided patient data and laboratory values.

Results

Low sodium occurred in 207 of 247 (84%), but only one-third had elevated potassium. Other common nonendocrine tests were largely normal. TSH was elevated in 79 of 153 patients, and hypoglycaemia was found in 10%. Thirty-three per cent were diagnosed subsequent to adrenal crisis, in whom electrolyte disturbances were significantly more pronounced (P < 0.001). Serum cortisol was consistently decreased (median 62 nmol L -1 [1-668]) and significantly lower in individuals with adrenal crisis (38 nmol L -1 [2-442]) than in those without (81 nmol L -1 [1-668], P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The most consistent biochemical finding of untreated AAD was low sodium independent of the degree of glucocorticoid deficiency. Half of the patients had elevated TSH levels. Only a minority presented with marked hyperkalaemia or other nonhormonal abnormalities. Thus, unexplained low sodium and/or elevated TSH should prompt consideration of an undiagnosed AAD, and on clinical suspicion bring about assay of cortisol and ACTH. Presence of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies confirms autoimmune aetiology. Anticipating additional abnormalities in routine blood tests may delay diagnosis.

### Latent adrenal insufficiency: concept, clues to detection, and diagnosis [^522b3ed3]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

In 1855, Thomas Addison described an illness now known as Addison disease (AD) caused by damage to the adrenal cortex and manifesting in weakness, weight loss, hypotension, gastrointestinal disturbances, and brownish pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes. Corticosteroid supplementation, corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] of medicinal use) test, and anti-adrenal auto-antibodies (AA) have come into use in the 100 years since Addison's death. Following the methodological innovations, 4 disorders which share impaired response to corticotropin in common have been discovered (i.e., partial AD, apigmented adrenal insufficiency [AI], subclinical AI, and the AA-positive state exclusively in subjects proven to have an impaired response to corticotropin). As they are hidden, potentially serious conditions, these disorders are bound together as latent AI (LAI). Diagnosis of AD is often delayed, which may lead to adrenal crisis. If LAI were widely recognized, such delays would not exist and crises would be averted. The 3 existing guidelines do not refer much to LAI patients outside those in acute situations. To address this, information relevant to clinical manifestations and diagnostic tests of LAI was sought in the literature. Signs and symptoms that are useful clues to begin a diagnostic workup are presented for endocrinologists to identify patients with suspected LAI. The utility of 2 corticotropin test protocols is reviewed. To endorse LAI shown by the corticotropin test, monitoring items following corticosteroid supplementation are cited from the guidelines and supplemented with the author's observations.

### The importance of testing for adrenoleucodystrophy in males with idiopathic Addison's disease [^47728767]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

X linked adrenoleucodystrophy (X-ALD) is considered to be a rare cause of Addison's disease, although several small series suggest a high incidence in young Addisonian males. A survey in the south west of England identified 12 male patients diagnosed with Addison's disease in the period 1987-99. In 10 of these (83%) X-ALD was the underlying cause; the other two were of autoimmune aetiology. Five boys had developed Addison's disease subsequent to the diagnosis of X-ALD. Of the remaining five, in three boys the diagnosis of X-ALD was considerably delayed (by six months to two years from that of Addison's disease) and in two it was only made as a result of this survey. We also identified a patient who presented with Addison's disease at the age of 5 years but was only diagnosed as having X-ALD at the age of 34 years; in the interim his diagnosis of adrenomyeloneuropathy had been missed. Our experience highlights the absolute necessity of measuring very long chain fatty acids in all males with idiopathic Addison's disease.

### Fine tuning for quality of life: 21st century approach to treatment of Addison's disease [^7845d138]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Despite treatment with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, the ability to work and quality of life of patients who have adrenal insufficiency remains low. There are no helpful objective measures of optimal glucocorticoid replacement, so this is best achieved by careful clinical assessment. Adequacy of mineralocorticoid replacement may be judged by assessing postural change in blood pressure, serum electrolytes, and plasma renin activity. Novel delayed-release and sustained-release formulations of hydrocortisone seem to more closely mimic diurnal serum cortisol rhythms than conventional hydrocortisone tablets. Such preparations are currently being evaluated and may play a role in management of patients who have adrenal insufficiency.

### A polygenic risk score to help discriminate primary adrenal insufficiency of different etiologies [^78e9366b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). Despite its exceptionally high heritability, tools to estimate disease susceptibility in individual patients are lacking. We hypothesized that polygenic risk score (PRS) for AAD could help investigate PAI pathogenesis in pediatric patients.

Methods

We here constructed and evaluated a PRS for AAD in 1223 seropositive cases and 4097 controls. To test its clinical utility, we reevaluated 18 pediatric patients, whose whole genome we also sequenced. We next explored the individual PRS in more than 120 seronegative patients with idiopathic PAI.

Results

The genetic susceptibility to AAD-quantified using PRS-was on average 1.5 standard deviations (SD) higher in patients compared with healthy controls (p < 2e - 16), and 1.2 SD higher in the young patients compared with the old (p = 3e - 4). Using the novel PRS, we searched for pediatric patients with strikingly low AAD susceptibility and identified cases of monogenic PAI, previously misdiagnosed as AAD. By stratifying seronegative adult patients by autoimmune comorbidities and disease duration we could delineate subgroups of PRS suggesting various disease etiologies.

Conclusions

The PRS performed well for case-control differentiation and susceptibility estimation in individual patients. Remarkably, a PRS for AAD holds promise as a means to detect disease etiologies other than autoimmunity.

### Hyponatraemia presenting as reversible cerebellar ataxia in Addison's disease [^7f88cbab]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Addison's disease is a common endocrinopathy often diagnosed in patients presenting with hyponatraemia. Cerebellar ataxia as a presentation of hyponatraemia is extremely rare. A 42-year-old man presented with vomiting, fever, ataxic gait and scanning type of dysarthria. Clinical examination revealed signs suggestive of isolated cerebellar involvement. Patient was found to have severe hyponatraemia and serum cortisol was found to be extremely low while MRI brain was found to be normal. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated and cerebellar ataxia was resolved following normalisation of sodium levels.

### 21-hydroxylase autoantibody-negative Addison's disease in a 5-year-old boy with adrenal crisis and type 1 diabetes mellitus [^883d1a73]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have an increased risk of other autoimmune disorders. The combination of Addison's disease with T1DM and/or autoimmune thyroid disease is known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 2 (APS-2). 21-hydroxylase autoantibody (21OHAb) is considered as a valuable marker for identifying patients with autoimmune Addison's disease (AD); however, it is not available in some countries. Here we present a 5-year-old boy with newly diagnosed T1DM, who developed AD with adrenal crisis within only six months, and after 1-year treatment, the test of 21OHAb was negative. This was a rare and the first APS-2 case in Taiwan, because APS-2 affects female adults more often, but not boys. At diagnosis of T1DM, we suggest that checking diurnal cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels as a baseline evaluations, and if it is available, checking 21OHAb as well. If there is subtle evidence of AD, such as unexplained hypoglycemia or unreasonably reduced insulin requirements, adrenal functions must be studied as soon as possible, even in the 21OHAb-negative T1DM patients. Even if nothing is abnormal, the patient still needs an annual measurement.

### Approach to the patient: the adult with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^dfeb8edc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). When the nonclassical (mild) form is included, 21OHD is the most common genetic disease in human beings. With the advent of pharmaceutical preparation of glucocorticoids starting in the 1960s and newborn screening starting in the 1990s, the majority of children with 21OHD are reaching adulthood, which has yielded a cohort of patients with, in essence, a new disease. Only recently have some data emerged from cohorts of adults with 21OHD, and in some centers, experience with the management of these patients is growing. These patients suffer from poor health, infertility, characteristic tumors in the adrenal glands and gonads, and consequences of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Their care is fragmented and inconsistent, and many stop taking their medications out of frustration. Internal medicine residents and endocrinology fellows receive little training in their care, which further discourages their seeking medical attention. Adults with 21OHD have a different physiology from patients with Addison's disease or other androgen excess states, and their needs are different than those of young children with 21OHD. Consequently, their care requires unorthodox treatment and monitoring strategies foreign to most endocrine practitioners. Our goal for this article is to review their physiology, complications, and needs in order to develop rational and effective treatment and monitoring strategies.

### More, less or both? [^032cd549]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case discusses the simultaneous presentation of Addison’s disease and Graves’ thyrotoxicosis (figure 1).

Figure 1 
An artistic impression of Dr Thomas Addison and Dr Robert James Graves.

Clustering of autoimmune endocrine diseases is well known, as is the case in Whitaker and Schmidt syndrome, also known as polyglandular syndrome type I and II.Relatively common is the combination of hypothyroidism and Addison’s disease that may present itself as part of polyglandular syndrome type I. However, the combination of Graves’ and Addison’s disease, as in our patient, is extremely rare.

To the best of our knowledge only three cases are known in the literature, which describe the simultaneous presentation of Addison’s disease and Graves’ thyrotoxicosis.The clinical presentation was highly variable in all these case. One case presented with a vasovagal episode and extensive vitiligo.Another case presented with general weakness and skin pigmentation that started several months ago. In both cases, the diagnosis of Addison’s disease was made prior to diagnosing a thyrotoxicosis. In a third case report, the patient presented with headache, paresthesia, heat intolerance, general weakness and vomiting. The diagnosis of Graves’ disease was established prior to diagnosing an Addisonian crisis.

One may speculate that the simultaneous presentation in our patient can be explained by the thyrotoxicosis unmasking a latent Addison’s disease, since thyroid hormone can increase the metabolism of cortisol.

Some clues in our case deserve special mentioning. First, we were puzzled by the patient’s normokalaemia despite having Addison’s disease. However, a recent study shows that hyperkalaemia is not universal in patients diagnosed with Addison’s disease.It is also possible that potassium was lower than expected due to sustained gastrointestinal losses. Another explanation is that thyrotoxicosis may lower potassium levels, possibly by affecting the Na/K ATPase activity.It is therefore possible for thyrotoxicosis to mask hyperkalaemia as is seen normally in Addison’s disease.

### Acute adrenal insufficiency [^90cbde9b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, usually with gradually evolving clinical symptoms and signs. Occasionally, an acute adrenal insufficiency crisis can become a life-threatening condition because of acute interruption of a normal or hyperfunctioning adrenal or pituitary gland or sudden interruption of a adrenal replacement therapy. Acute stress situations can aggravate the symptomatology. A simple strategy or diagnostic screening and early intervention with sodium chloride-containing fluids and hydrocortisone should be widely implemented for cases with suspicion of an acute Addison disease crisis. In contrast, the chronic replacement dosage for patients with adrenal insufficiency should be as low as possible with clear instructions for dosage adjustments in case of stress or acute emergencies.

### Autoimmune thyroid disorders in autoimmune addison disease [^c1a64946]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Very few patients were observed without treatment, indicating that even if the treatment is started on an uncertain indication, it is rarely reevaluated and stopped. Levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and often leads to lifelong replacement therapy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that up to one-third of patients remained euthyroid after thyroid hormone discontinuation, with a higher proportion of patients with an initial diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism compared to overt hypothyroidism. Our data indicate that more patients can be observed without treatment, especially if TPOAb is negative. However, the number of individuals observed without treatment may be underestimated because of the possibility that those with untreated subclinical disease were not registered as such.

International guidelines state that if TSH is in the range of 4.1 to 10 mU/L and the patient has symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, clinicians can consider treatment with levothyroxine. However, the relation between symptoms and TSH levels remains unclear. The question of starting treatment is especially challenging in AAD patients, who often experience fatigue and reduced quality of life due to adrenal insufficiency, and are themselves eager to start treatment. Thus, the threshold to start treatment is probably lower than what would be the situation in a non-AAD patient. We suggest that clinicians should optimize the treatment of adrenal insufficiency and observe slightly elevated TSH levels over time before they consider levothyroxine treatment. Similarly, clinicians should consider cortisol deficiency in non-AAD patients with mild subclinical hypothyroidism and high symptom burden. This is clinically important since initiation of levothyroxine in untreated AAD patients could lead to an adrenal crisis. Taken together, there seems to be a considerable risk of overprescription of levothyroxine in AAD patients.

### Addison disease presenting with acute neurologic deterioration: a rare presentation yields new lessons from old observations in primary adrenal failure [^6ecca6e8]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a rare case of Addison disease presenting with acute neurologic deterioration, and to discuss previous reports and illustrative clinical lessons drawn from the case.

Methods

We detail the clinical presentation and sequence of events leading to diagnosis of Addison disease in a 20-year-old man whose initial symptoms were those of acute neurologic deterioration.

Results

A 20-year-old man presented with acute, rapid neurologic deterioration. The patient required intubation, but his condition responded very well to mannitol and dexamethasone. Head computed tomography showed a fourth ventricle reduced in size and basal cistern effacement, changes consistent with mild cerebral edema. Primary adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed after a low morning cortisol concentration prompted a corticotropin-stimulation test and serum aldosterone measurement (undetectable). The diagnosis was almost missed because of suspected confounders of dexamethasone and etomidate use. Subsequently, the patient tested positive for anti-21- hydroxylase antibodies. Cerebral edema rarely occurs with Addison disease and is most likely secondary to hyponatremia. Diagnosis in such cases may be complicated by resuscitative therapies; however, low cortisol levels should always be thoroughly investigated. This patient's presentation was also unique in that he maintained a normal electrolyte profile despite hypoaldosteronism, a phenomenon that may be explained by enhanced mineralocorticoid activity of exogenous cortisol.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency may not be suspected in the absence of classic hyperpigmentation and hyperkalemia, but should remain in the differential diagnosis of acute confusion. While the use of dexamethasone and etomidate in initial resuscitation can transiently suppress adrenal function, any unusually low cortisol level merits thorough investigation.

### Six year old with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome: can genetics tell us the story? [^2754710d]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Children who have diabetes mellitus type 1 (DMT1) are at increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. These associated diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, Celiac disease, and Addison's disease. Since Addison's disease is potentially fatal if undiagnosed and untreated, it would be prudent to effectively screen individuals to determine if they are at risk of developing this disease. We present a case of a 6 year old male with a history of DMT1, who presented in adrenal crisis and was subsequently diagnosed with Addison's disease. HLA-DRB1 404/DR4 is one of the genes involved in the development of Addison's disease in children with DMT1. Our patient later tested positive for this haplotype. Genetic testing is not routinely done in patients with (DMT1) to determine if they will potentially develop other associated conditions. We propose using genetic testing of associated HLA haplotypes to screen children with DMT1 for Addison's disease.

### Newly diagnosed autoimmune Addison's disease in a patient with COVID-19 with autoimmune disseminated encephalomyelitis [^870b509e]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his 20s with a history of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was brought into the emergency department (ED) after his family found him at home collapsed on the floor unresponsive with a blood glucose of 28mg/dL at the field. In the ED, the patient was tachycardic, tachypnoeic and hypotensive, requiring pressors and intubation at 9hours and 12 hours after arrival, respectively. Laboratory results revealed a positive COVID-19 test, serum sodium of 125mmol/L and persistent hypoglycaemia. The patient was given a high dose of dexamethasone for COVID-19 treatment 1hour before pressors were started. He was then continued on a stress dose of intravenous hydrocortisone with rapid clinical improvement leading to his extubation, and discontinuation of vasopressors and glucose on day 2 of admission. The patient received his last dose of intravenous hydrocortisone on day 4 in the early afternoon with the plan to order adrenal testing the following morning prior to discharge. On day 5, the aldosterone <3.0ng/dL, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level >1250pg/mL, and ACTH stimulation test showed cortisol levels of 3 and 3 µg/dL at 30 and 60min, respectively. The anti-21-hydroxylase antibody was positive. The patient was discharged on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. The patient's symptoms, elevated ACTH, low cortisol and presence of 21-hydroxylase antibodies are consistent with autoimmune Addison's disease. This is the first case reporting autoimmune Addison's disease in a patient with COVID-19 with a history of ADEM. The case highlights the importance of considering adrenal insufficiency as a diagnostic differential in haemodynamically unstable patients with COVID-19.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^38cd3dda]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

2. Adrenal insufficiency

Primary hypocortisolism, or Addison’s disease is mainly due to autoimmune defects (70% of all cases), but it can also be caused by infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, fungi, or cytomegalovirus that can result in direct destruction of the adrenal cortex. In many cases, hypocortisolism is only diagnosed when patients present with an acute crisis during an intercurrent disease. Daily rhythmicity of circulating ACTH and cortisol is generally absent or blunted in Addison’s patients. Severe fatigue is present in about half of the patients and is associated with sleep disturbances. Basal concentrations of GCs are a poor diagnostic indicator of Addison’s disease. Thus, direct ACTH stimulation tests are necessary to assess adrenal functionality. Secondary partial hypoadrenalism, due to ACTH deficiency, is more difficult to detect, and its diagnosis often requires indirect measures such as the insulin tolerance test. In patients with either primary or secondary adrenal failure, inadequate replacement of GCs may lead to hypotension, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, poor stress responses, and electrolyte abnormalities. Conversely, overdosing with GCs without respecting the physiological daily rhythm will promote Cushing’s-like features such as glucose intolerance, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, as well as osteoporosis and disturbances of the immune system (–). There is evidence that the commonly used hormonal replacement therapy in patients with adrenal failure does not mimic the physiological circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion, resulting in a nonphysiological plasma cortisol profile, as well as a risk of over- or under-replacement, associated with increased morbidity and premature mortality. Thus, as will be discussed further in Section VII, mimicking the circadian profile of cortisol blood levels may help to minimize side effects and increase the quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### Severe multisystem organ dysfunction in an adolescent with simultaneous presentation of Addison's and Graves' disease [^36d2cbdc]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report an unusual case of simultaneous presentation of Addison's and Graves' disease in an adolescent female previously diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Hashimoto's.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old female with T1D and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department with altered mental state, fever, and left arm weakness for one day. Clinical work-up revealed coexistent new-onset adrenal insufficiency and hyperthyroidism. Her clinical course was complicated by severe, life-threating multisystem organ dysfunction including neurologic deficits, acute kidney injury, and fluid overload. Thyroidectomy was ultimately performed in the setting of persistent signs of adrenal crises and resulted in rapid clinical improvement.

Conclusions

Endocrinopathy should be included in the differential diagnosis of altered mental status. This case additionally illustrates the challenges of managing adrenal insufficiency in the setting of hyperthyroidism and supports the use of thyroidectomy in this situation.

### Italian addison network study: update of diagnostic criteria for the etiological classification of primary adrenal insufficiency [^a2c9d12e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is clinically evident in one in 8000 individuals. A correct etiological classification is critical for correct disease management. To update the diagnostic criteria for the etiological classification of PAI, a multicentric network was established in Italy, and 222 patients with PAI were studied. Both 21-hydroxylase and adrenal cortex autoantibodies (21OHAb and ACA, respectively) were tested in two independent laboratories on coded samples and found in 65-66% and 58-61% of cases, respectively. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome I was diagnosed in 11 of the 222 patients. Of the remaining 211 patients, 38 (18%) had a nonautoimmune form of PAI. In 145 subjects (65%), the presence of adrenal autoantibodies, without signs of other forms of PAI, led to a diagnosis of autoimmune Addison's disease. In six cases (3%), PAI remained idiopathic. Logistic regression analysis showed a 92.2-92.7% probability of correct reclassification for the two 21OHAb assays and 84.5-85.9% for the ACA assays. We conclude that the simultaneous presence of both 21OHAb and ACA permits unambiguous diagnosis of autoimmune Addison's, whereas subjects with low antibody titers should undergo both instrumental and biochemical tests to exclude other causes of PAI. Lastly, we developed a comprehensive flowchart for the classification of PAI for use in routine clinical practice.

### The interpretation of color-an endocrine cause of skin discoloration mimicking cyanosis [^e312c9ab]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison's disease, is very rare in the pediatric population. The diagnosis of Addison's disease is usually suspected in the presence of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, or when adrenal crisis develops. Pediatricians often are unaware of other presenting symptoms of the disease. As a consequence, diagnosis is often delayed by months and even years. One of the presenting signs of adrenal insufficiency is hyperpigmentation. We present the diagnosis of Addison's disease in an 11-year-old boy complaining of skin color changes that were misinterpreted as "progressive cyanosis". When skin color changes occur in a child, pediatricians should think of hyperpigmentation as a presenting sign of adrenal insufficiency.

### Increased infection risk in Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^5d351e7e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Study population and period

Our study population consisted of 2 “exposed” cohorts, comprising adult patients (≥18 years old) diagnosed with AD or CAH according to selected Read codes. (see supplementary materials) We excluded patients who were at any time point coded with a code consistent with other causes of adrenal insufficiency. We could not retrieve data on 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies in the study participants, due to the nature of the study. Therefore, in this paper, we defined AD as PAI not caused by CAH. To ensure accuracy of case definition in the AD cohort, we only included patients who had at least 1 prescription of both glucocorticoids (accepting glucocorticoids commonly used in AD) and mineralocorticoids. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to include only patients who had at least 2 prescription of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. We subdivided the CAH cohort in two subcohorts: (i) patients who had at least 1 glucocorticoid prescription at any point (using the same glucocorticoid codes used for AD patients) and (ii) patients who were never prescribed with any glucocorticoid therapy, since patients with CAH do not always require glucocorticoid therapy. For every exposed patient, we randomly selected 2 individuals from a pool of patients matched for age, sex, and GP practice who did not have a Read code consistent with PAI at any point before or during the observation period.

The study period extended from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 2018. Patients were eligible for inclusion 1 year from the latest of the following dates: study start date, patient registration date with the GP practice, and practice eligibility date (the date when practices have implemented an electronic medical record and have passed the assessment for acceptable data quality). The 1-year lag period was applied to ensure there was enough time to document all information accurately after registration with the practice or after a practice was deemed eligible to take part. To ensure acceptable data quality, practices were required to have used the electronical health record system for at least 1 year and have acceptable mortality reporting.

The index date (ie, the date when follow-up commences) was defined as the date of diagnosis for newly diagnosed patients or, if they were already diagnosed with PAI, the date when they registered with an eligible GP practice. Patients were followed from index date up until the earliest of the following dates: outcome of interest (only for estimating the incidence of infections), patient transfer date from practice, patient death, practice’s last data collection date, and study end date.

### Predicting the onset of Addison's disease: ACTH, renin, cortisol and 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies [^e87e253f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Autoantibodies to 21-hydroxylase (21OH-AA) precede onset of autoimmune Addison's disease (AD). Progression to AD can take months to years, and early detection of metabolic decompensation may prevent morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To define optimal methods of predicting progression to overt AD (defined by subnormal peak cortisol response to Cosyntropin) in 21OH-AA+ individuals.

Design, Setting and Participants

Individuals were screened for 21OH-AA at the Barbara Davis Center from 1993 to 2011. Subjects positive for 21OH-AA (n = 87) were tested, and the majority prospectively followed for the development of Addison's disease, including seven diagnosed with AD upon 21OH-AA discovery (discovered), seven who progressed to AD (progressors) and 73 nonprogressors.

Main Outcome Measured

Plasma renin activity (PRA), ACTH, baseline cortisol, peak cortisol and 21OH-AA were measured at various time points relative to diagnosis of AD or last AD-free follow-up.

Results

Compared with nonprogressors, in the time period 2 months-2 years prior to the onset of AD, progressors were significantly more likely to have elevated ACTH (11-22 pM, P < 1E-4), with no significant differences in mean PRA (P = 0·07) or baseline cortisol (P = 0·08), and significant but less distinct differences seen with 21OH-AA levels (P < 1E-4) and poststimulation cortisol levels (P = 6E-3).

Conclusion

Moderately elevated ACTH is a more useful early indicator of impending AD than 21OH-AA, PRA or peak cortisol, in the 2 months-2 years preceding the onset of AD.

### Cytokine autoantibody screening in the Swedish addison registry identifies patients with undiagnosed APS1 [^c2b611e7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1) is a monogenic disorder that features autoimmune Addison disease as a major component. Although APS1 accounts for only a small fraction of all patients with Addison disease, early identification of these individuals is vital to prevent the potentially lethal complications of APS1.

Objective

To determine whether available serological and genetic markers are valuable screening tools for the identification of APS1 among patients diagnosed with Addison disease.

Design

We systematically screened 677 patients with Addison disease enrolled in the Swedish Addison Registry for autoantibodies against interleukin-22 and interferon-α4. Autoantibody-positive patients were investigated for clinical manifestations of APS1, additional APS1-specific autoantibodies, and DNA sequence and copy number variations of AIRE.

Results

In total, 17 patients (2.5%) displayed autoantibodies against interleukin-22 and/or interferon-α4, of which nine were known APS1 cases. Four patients previously undiagnosed with APS1 fulfilled clinical, genetic, and serological criteria. Hence, we identified four patients with undiagnosed APS1 with this screening procedure.

Conclusion

We propose that patients with Addison disease should be routinely screened for cytokine autoantibodies. Clinical or serological support for APS1 should warrant DNA sequencing and copy number analysis of AIRE to enable early diagnosis and prevention of lethal complications.

### More, less or both? [^d88c72a4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Second, the low serum creatinine drew our attention, especially in the presence of hypovolaemia and a normal muscle mass. An explanation for this might be long-standing Addison’s disease, which can decrease muscle mass due to myopathy. However, thyrotoxicosis itself is associated with a low serum creatinine due to an increase in GFR and decrease in muscle mass.Since urea nitrogen is usually elevated in thyrotoxicosis, a raised urea/creatinine ratio, as was seen in our patient, may point to this diagnosis. Third, the lack of hyperpigmentation was also surprising, but several recent studies show that this is not always present in Addison’s disease.The clues in our patient for Addison’s disease were weakness, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, low sodium, low cortisol, low aldosterone and positive adrenal antibodies. These clues are highly specific for Addison’s disease.Finally, we did not perform an ACTH test before starting treatment with hydrocortisone. We had no reasonable doubts with regards to the diagnosis, since we did measure hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism and positive adrenal antibodies in a state of hypovolaemia, confirming the diagnosis of an ‘adrenal hypocortisolism’. It was not possible to measure ACTH as we had already started treatment. However, we do recommend to always include an ACTH measurement, prior to starting treatment with hydrocortisone, as this gives more strength to the diagnosis, since it rules out a possible coexisting pituitary failure. Furthermore, measurement of ACTH is also important in the follow-up of Addison’s disease since the value can give suspicion to over-replacement with corticosteroids. We did not perform a follow-up because the patient quickly returned to her home country after being discharged from the hospital.

### ESHRE guideline: management of women with premature ovarian insufficiency [^49eda499]. Human Reproduction (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, more specifically with respect to evaluation of primary ovarian insufficiency (adrenocortical and thyroid antibodies), ESHRE 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies, or alternatively adrenocortical antibodies, in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency of unknown cause or if an immune disorder is suspected.
Refer patients with premature ovarian insufficiency with positive 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies/adrenocortical antibodies to an endocrinologist for testing of adrenal function and to rule out Addison's disease.

### Autoimmune thyroid disorders in autoimmune addison disease [^efa1e0cf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common endocrine comorbidity in autoimmune Addison disease (AAD), but detailed investigations of prevalence and clinical course are lacking.

Objective

This work aimed to provide comprehensive epidemiological and clinical data on autoimmune thyroid disorders in AAD.

Methods

A nationwide registry-based study including 442 patients with AAD and autoimmune thyroid disease were identified through the Norwegian National Registry of Autoimmune Diseases.

Results

Of 912 registered AAD patients, 442 (48%) were diagnosed with autoimmune thyroid disease. A total of 380 (42%) had autoimmune hypothyroidism. Of the 203 with available thyroid function tests at time of diagnosis, 20% had overt hypothyroidism, 73% had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 7% had thyroid levels in the normal range. Negative thyroid peroxidase antibodies was found in 32%. Ninety-eight percent were treated with levothyroxine, 5% with combination therapy with liothyronine or thyroid extracts, and 1% were observed without treatment. Seventy-eight patients (9%) were diagnosed with Graves disease (GD), of whom 16 (21%) were diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism either before onset or after remission of GD. At the end of follow-up, 33% had normal thyroid hormone levels without antithyroid-drugs or levothyroxine treatment. The remaining had either active disease (5%), had undergone ablative treatment (41%), or had developed autoimmune hypothyroidism (21%).

Conclusion

The true prevalence of hypothyroidism in AAD is lower than reported in the current literature. Careful consideration of the indication to start thyroxin therapy is warranted. Long-term remission rates in GD patients with AAD are comparable to recent reports on long-term follow-up of patients without AAD.

### Approach to the patient: diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults [^e230a2d4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The term APS2 is sometimes used for PAI in combination with any organ-specific autoimmune disease, which most commonly includes autoimmune thyroiditis (48%), but other autoimmune diseases such as primary ovarian insufficiency (10%), type 1 diabetes mellitus (10%), vitiligo, pernicious anaemia, alopecia, and celiac disease are also relatively frequent. Nonendocrine autoimmunity such as myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, Sjøgren syndrome, or rheumatoid arthritis can also occur. Diagnosing autoimmune comorbidity requires vigilance both at the time of PAI diagnosis and during long-term follow-up.

Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal can be induced by drugs in rare cases. Autoimmune PAI with 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies have been reported in a few cases treated with programmed death 1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, although pituitary insufficiency and thyroiditis are more common side-effect with these drugs. Finally, deletion of mitochondrial DNA has been linked to autoimmune PAI, eg, in Kearne-Sayer syndrome.

What To Do If 21-OH Antibodies Are Negative?

If 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies are absent, other causes must be considered allowing for the age of the patients, history, and clinical findings. The next recommended step is imaging of the adrenals, preferably with an adrenal CT (Fig. 2).

Infectious destruction of the adrenal gland is now rare in Western countries. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of PAI from the 1850s, when Thomas Addison first described the disease, until the 1950s and may still be so in populations where tuberculosis is endemic. Usually, an adrenal CT will show visible adrenal enlargement early on and adrenal calcifications or adrenal atrophy in the later stages of infection. Other possible and very rare infectious causes include bacteria [including syphilis], viruses [cytomegalovirus, human immune-deficiency virus, herpes virus], and fungal infections [histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis].

### Estimated risk for developing autoimmune Addison's disease in patients with adrenal cortex autoantibodies [^21a206b1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Patients with adrenal cortex autoantibodies (ACA) without overt autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) are at risk of adrenal failure.

Design

To assess the contribution of different clinical, immunological, genetic, and functional factors in the progression to AAD, we followed up 100 ACA-positive and 63 ACA-negative patients without AAD for a maximum of 21 yr (mean 6.0 yr, median 4.8). ACA were measured by immunofluorescence and 21-OH autoantibodies (Abs) by RIA. Adrenal function was assessed by measuring basal levels of cortisol, aldosterone, ACTH, renin activity, and cortisol response to ACTH. The risk of developing AAD was calculated using survival and multivariate analyses.

Results

AAD developed in 31 ACA-positive patients and one ACA-negative patient. The cumulative risk of disease in ACA-positive patients was 48.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.8-56.1]. The cumulative risk was higher in children than adults (100 vs. 31.9%; P < 0.0001), males than females (68.6 vs. 42.7%; P = 0.006), patients with subclinical rather than normal adrenal function at entry (87.4 vs. 30.1%; P < 0.0001), patients with hypoparathyroidism and/or candidiasis than patients with other autoimmune or nonautoimmune diseases (100 vs. 29.7%; P < 0.0001), and patients with high rather than low-medium ACA titers (62.8 vs. 41.2%; P = 0.12). The presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 did not appear to contribute to the prediction of AAD. Adjusted hazard ratios by Cox model for the development of AAD were 3.37 for males (CI 1.38-8.24), 5.23 for hypoparathyroidism and/or candidiasis (CI 1.53-17.92), 3.33 for high antibody titers (CI 1.43-7.78), and 6.15 for impaired adrenal function at entry (CI 2.79-13.57).

Conclusions

These results were used to construct a risk algorithm for estimating the probability of developing AAD from the combination of gender, age, adrenal function, antibody titer, and associated autoimmune disorders at entry. The values of estimated risk could be used to decide appropriate follow-up intervals and future immunointervention strategies.

### Type II polyglandular autoimmune syndrome: a case of Addison's disease precipitated by use of levothyroxine [^e65dc8f5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 46-year-old woman was referred to the endocrinology clinic for evaluation of progressive fatigue, dizziness and treatment-resistant hypothyroidism. Initial laboratory results revealed hypothyroidism, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. Liothyronine sodium (Cytomel) was initiated, which exacerbated her fatigue and dizziness. Suspecting adrenal insufficiency, an 08:00 cortisol level was obtained and found to be low with failure to increase following cosyntropin stimulation test. Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency was confirmed via CT abdomen and pelvis revealing diminutive adrenal glands and elevated 21-hydroxylase antibody. Treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone 10mg every morning and 5mg at 16:00/day, with plan for patient follow-up in 3 weeks to assess need for mineralocorticoid replacement. Polyglandular syndromes are rare and have a wide variety of presentation. Thus, we recommend screening patients with a single autoimmune disorder who do not respond to conventional therapy to prevent possible life-threatening adrenal crisis.

### Residual corticosteroid production in autoimmune addison disease [^26d5a0bd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found residual GC production in one-third of patients with established AAD, more common in men than in women. Patients with residual production had overall shorter disease duration, but several had a history of AAD lasting for decades. More than 1 of 7 patients had residual MC production. These were characterized by shorter disease duration, lower FC dosage, and higher plasma renin concentrations compared with those without residual MC production. No significant associations were found between residual corticosteroid production and a number of clinical parameters. To date, this is the largest study on residual production in AAD, conducted on a representative study cohort from 17 centers in 3 countries. We are confident that the diagnosis of AAD is correct in all included patients as we required documented presence of 21-hydroxylase antibodies and chronic need for GC replacement therapy for inclusion.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^3145a79d]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune endocrine comorbidity and hypothyroidism evaluation—Type 1 multiple autoimmune endocrinopathies (MAE) include hypoparathyroidism, Addison’s disease, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, with autoimmune thyroiditis present in about 10%-15%; type 2 MAE comprises Addison’s disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes. In patients with adrenal insufficiency, the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be deferred until after glucocorticoid therapy has been instituted because thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels may be elevated with untreated adrenal insufficiency and may normalize with glucocorticoid therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ffc09635]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency—definition, pathophysiology, and clinical features: PAI is defined by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids and needs to be distinguished from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency due to insufficient production of ACTH and without impact on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The signs of PAI are mainly based on deficiency of gluco- and mineralocorticoids and include weight loss, orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, changes in blood count (anemia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis), and hypoglycemia; enhanced secretion of ACTH and other pro-opiomelanocortin peptides leads to characteristic hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes, and in women loss of adrenal androgens results in loss of axillary and pubic hair. Symptoms are nonspecific and include weakness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, weight loss, abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety; diagnosis is frequently delayed with potential presentation as an acute life-threatening adrenal crisis, and even with treatment health-related quality of life in Addison’s disease on standard replacement therapy is often reduced.

### Fludrocortisone acetate [^e9e53177]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Dosage depends on the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. Patients should be continually monitored for signs that indicate dosage adjustment is necessary, such as remission or exacerbations of the disease and stress (surgery, infection, trauma) (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, General).

Addison's Disease

In Addison’s disease, the combination of fludrocortisone acetate tablets with a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone or cortisone provides substitution therapy approximating normal adrenal activity with minimal risks of unwanted effects.

The usual dose is 0.1 mg of fludrocortisone acetate tablets daily, although dosage ranging from 0.1 mg three times a week to 0.2 mg daily has been employed. In the event transient hypertension develops as a consequence of therapy, the dose should be reduced to 0.05 mg daily. Fludrocortisone acetate tablets   are preferably administered in conjunction with cortisone (10 mg to 37.5 mg daily in divided doses) or hydrocortisone (10 mg to 30 mg daily in divided doses).

Salt-Losing Adrenogenital Syndrome

The recommended dosage for treating the salt-losing adrenogenital syndrome is 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg of fludrocortisone acetate tablets daily.

### Cosyntropin [^698fb806]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Cosyntropin for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section).

Severe hypofunction of the pituitary - adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of adrenal insufficiency and does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to adequate corticotropin stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a subnormal Cosyntropin for Injection test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or secondary.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient despite high ACTH levels (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises as the result of defective production of ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adrenal cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan's syndrome and pituitary tumors or ablation.

The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland cannot be stimulated by ACTH whereas a secondarily defective gland is potentially functional and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH. Patients selected for further study as the result of a subnormal Cosyntropin for Injection test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days. Under these conditions little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison's disease whereas higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### Autoimmune thyroid disorders in autoimmune addison disease [^5c4f9f79]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Patients and Design

We identified all patients with the combination of AAD and autoimmune thyroid disorder (Hashimoto thyroiditis and/or GD) enrolled in the Norwegian Registry for Organ-specific Autoimmune Diseases (ROAS). ROAS is a national medical research and quality registry for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), primary ovarian insufficiency, polyendocrine syndromes, and hypoparathyroidism. National coverage for primary adrenal insufficiency is 65% based on the latest national coverage analysis in 2019. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and antibodies against 21-hydroxylase or presence of associated autoimmune diseases were classified as having AAD. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency of other causes were excluded. Data from the registry and hospital records were compared with self-reported patient information regarding concomitant thyroid disease collected annually. The present study includes data compiled from the National Registry’s initiation in 1996 until the end of June 2021. During this period, 912 patients with AAD were included, of whom 442 had probable autoimmune thyroid disease. Patients who were found to have nonautoimmune hypothyroidism, for instance after cancer surgery or treatment of nodular disease, were excluded (Fig. 1). Thyroid hormone levels at onset were obtained from 203 of 380 patients (53%) with hypothyroidism. Information on thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOAbs) was missing for 3 of 380 patients with hypothyroidism. Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) levels were missing for 17 of 78 patients diagnosed with GD.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^f71837a3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

R 3.2—We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

Figure 3. 
Management of patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress.

Table 8. 
Suggested glucocorticoid regimens in patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress

Rationale

Adrenal crisis (also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis) can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, if drug availability suddenly decreases (eg, missed doses, gastroenteritis). It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms that are in accordance with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery (Table 9). The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood, but it is invariably characterized by volume depletion and vasoplegia resulting in hypotension and—if left untreated—shock and eventually death. Adrenal crisis can occur not only in patients treated with oral glucocorticoids but also in patients receiving only inhaled, topical, intra-articular, or other glucocorticoid formulations. This highlights the potential clinical risks associated with the untoward systemic absorption of non-oral glucocorticoids. As mentioned above, adrenal crisis should be considered in patients in the period immediately following cessation of glucocorticoid therapy.

### Autoantibodies in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II [^de4be9d3]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II (APS-II) is characterized by the association of autoimmune Addison's disease with thyroid autoimmune diseases or type-1 diabetes mellitus. 21-Hydroxylase autoantibodies enable the accurate diagnosis of autoimmune Addison's disease and, in patients with other endocrine autoimmune diseases, identify subjects at high risk for clinical adrenal insufficiency. 17 alpha-Hydroxylase (17OH) and side-chain-cleavage enzyme (P450scc) are target autoantigens of steroid-cell autoantibodies, and in women with Addison's disease, 17OH autoantibodies and P450scc autoantibodies are markers of increased risk for premature ovarian failure. Thyroperoxidase autoantibodies, thyroglobulin autoantibodies, H+/K(+)-ATPase autoantibodies, and GAD65 autoantibodies are frequently detected in patients with isolated Addison's or APS-II. Screening for other organ-specific autoimmune diseases should be performed in every patient with at least one major disease component of APS-II.

### Primary ovarian insufficiency in women with Addison's disease [^175f3ced]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Autoantibodies towards the steroidogenic enzyme 21OH have repeatedly proven to have the highest sensitivity in diagnosing autoimmune POI in women without AAD, even though this enzyme is exclusively expressed in the adrenal cortex. However, most women with AAD will already have disease-associated 21OH autoantibodies and they can therefore not be used to diagnose POI. Our study confirms SCC as the most sensitive autoantibody for autoimmune POI in AAD. Although the negative predictive value of SCC is high, the positive predictive value is low. Thus, a negative test result predicts that POI is unlikely to develop, while a positive score predicts that it might happen, although many will not develop POI, limiting the use of SCC as a sole screening test. We therefore recommend testing young women with AAD with symptoms of menstrual disturbances or concerns about fertility for autoantibodies against SCC.

### Addison's crisis in adolescent patients with previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus as manifestation of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type II – report of two patients [^4bbb41f4]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

We report on two female adolescents--both diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus in early childhood--who presented with signs of severe metabolic decompensation. In both cases recompensation was difficult, and during the stay in hospital increasing discoloration of palmar creases was observed. ACTH testing demonstrated cortisol deficiency in both patients. In addition, autoimmune thyroiditis was diagnosed in one patient. As a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome was suspected, autoantibody studies were performed and the presence of autoantibodies against thyroid and adrenal tissue was established. Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA) type II can lead to subsequent manifestation of deficiencies of several endocrine glands. Although PGA type II usually presents at a more advanced age, adolescents may also present with the full spectrum of the disease. Especially in the presence of Addison's disease, life-threatening situations can develop rapidly. Coloration of palmar skin creases of patients with known type I diabetes mellitus should serve as a warning sign to be followed up with investigation of endocrine functions.

### Hyperkalemia in a patient with myasthenia gravis: case presentation [^39e1adcf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2 
Patients with association of myasthenia gravis and Addison’s disease

Abbreviations: MG myasthenia gravis, AD Addison’s disease, PAS polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, NA not available

Our patient had no history of other autoimmune diseases even though she presented with mild hyperkalemia (5.6 mEq/L) and mild hyponatremia (128 mEq/L). Physicians may consider these symptoms insignificant. However, we successfully diagnosed primary adrenal insufficiency due to immune adenitis early based on the presence of mild hyperkalemia, whereas in other studies, diagnoses of the condition have occurred at later stages, as indicated by the presence of severe hyponatremia (Table 2).

The three primary causes of hyperkalemia are increased K + intake, K + release from cells, and impaired renal K + excretion. In our case, TTKG was low under the hyperkalemic status, indicating impaired renal K + excretion. A differential flow chart of hyperkalemia with low renal potassium secretion is shown in Fig. 2. First, impaired renal function and ineffective plasma volume should be eliminated as possibilities. Second, body fluid status should be elevated to distinguish the low sodium (low aldosterone action) and fast chloride types (normal aldosterone action). Finally, renin, aldosterone, and cortisol levels provide additional information regarding low aldosterone production and resistance to aldosterone action.

### Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency and autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes: autoantibodies, autoantigens, and their applicability in diagnosis and disease prediction [^df488879]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Recent progress in the understanding of autoimmune adrenal disease, including a detailed analysis of a group of patients with Addison's disease (AD), has been reviewed. Criteria for defining an autoimmune disease and the main features of autoimmune AD (history, prevalence, etiology, histopathology, clinical and laboratory findings, cell-mediated andhumoral immunity, autoantigens and their autoepitopes, genetics, animal models, associated autoimmune diseases, pathogenesis, natural history, therapy) have been described. Furthermore, the autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS) associated with AD (revised classification, animal models, genetics, natural history) have been discussed. Of Italian patients with primary AD (n = 317), 83% had autoimmune AD. At the onset, all patients with autoimmune AD (100%) had detectable adrenal cortex and/or steroid 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies. In the course of natural history of autoimmune AD, the presence of adrenal cortex and/or steroid 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies identified patients at risk to develop AD. Different risks of progression to clinical AD were found in children and adults, and three stages of subclinical hypoadrenalism have been defined. Normal or atrophic adrenal glands have been demonstrated by imaging in patients with clinical or subclinical AD. Autoimmune AD presented in four forms: as APS type 1 (13% of the patients), APS type 2 (41%), APS type 4 (5%), and isolated AD (41%). There were differences in genetics, age at onset, prevalence of adrenal cortex/21-hydroxylase autoantibodies, and associated autoimmune diseases in these groups. "Incomplete" forms of APS have been identified demonstrating that APS are more prevalent than previously reported. A varied prevalence of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in patients with AD and value of steroid-producing cells autoantibodies reactive with steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase or P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme as markers of this disease has been discussed. In addition, the prevalence, characteristic autoantigens, and autoantibodies of minor autoimmune diseases associated with AD have been described. Imaging of adrenal glands, genetic tests, and biochemical analysis have been shown to contribute to early and correct diagnosis of primary non-autoimmune AD in the cases of hypoadrenalism with undetectable adrenal autoantibodies. An original flow chart for the diagnosis of AD has been proposed.

### Impact of month of birth on the risk of development of autoimmune Addison's disease [^3a835d89]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Subjects and Methods

Month-of-birth effect was analyzed in United Kingdom and Polish cohorts of patients with AAD.

The diagnosis of AAD was based on typical symptoms and signs, confirmed by either the subject having a low basal cortisol with a high adrenocorticotrophic hormone concentration or a subnormal response to the short synacthen test (250 mcg parenteral synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone 1–24). In most patients, autoimmune etiology was confirmed by the detection of 21-hydroxylase antibodies, or antiadrenal antibodies in cases with more longstanding diagnosis. Patients with primary adrenal failure due to adrenal gland infiltration or infection, bilateral adrenalectomies, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or with secondary adrenal failure were excluded from this study.

The data for the United Kingdom cohort were extracted from a local database at the Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University. The United Kingdom cohort comprised 415 patients with AAD (312 females and 103 males). This cohort included patients who were recruited through local endocrinology clinics in the North East region and patients from other regions of United Kingdom who responded to an invitation, via the Addison's Disease Self-Help Group, to participate in research at the Institute of Genetic Medicine in Newcastle. The data were compared with the pattern of total live births for England and Wales during 1963–1972 (n = 8 180 180). Demographic information was obtained from the Office for National Statistics.

The data for the Polish cohort were extracted from the patients' records at the Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Internal Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences. The Polish cohort comprised 231 AAD patients (167 females and 64 males) attending the University Hospital and other endocrine clinics in the Wielkopolska region. The control data regarding total live births in Poland were derived from the Polish Statistical Annals for the years 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2012 (n = 2 421 384).

Data regarding year of birth, year of AAD diagnosis, and the age at diagnosis are presented in Table 1 ; 46% and 27% of subjects had isolated AAD in the United Kingdom and Polish cohorts, respectively. The reminder had at least one other autoimmune condition. Data regarding these conditions are presented in Table 2, these data were not available for 5 patients from the polish cohort.

### Hyperkalemia in a patient with myasthenia gravis: case presentation [^44ee853d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common disorder of neuromuscular transmission, and it is typified by fluctuating degrees and variable combinations of weakness in the ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Under rare circumstances, MG can be accompanied by Addison's disease.

Case Presentation

Here, we reported the case of a 57-year-old Chinese woman with MG. She experienced progressive muscle weakness for 1week. MG with acute exacerbation was initially suspected. However, further biochemistry tests found mild hyperkalemia (5.6mEq/L) and a lower renal potassium excretion rate. Consequently, low aldosterone action was highly suspected. Further findings included a suppressed cortisol level, a higher adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration, and 21-hydroxylase antibody positivity, supporting a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency due to autoimmune adrenalitis.

Conclusion

We successfully demonstrated that adrenal insufficiency could be diagnosed, due to the presence of hyperkalemia. This case suggested a need for clinicians to consider the possible coincidence of adrenal insufficiency in a patient with MG and hyperkalemia. Early hormone supplementation should be begun.

### Addisonian crisis in a young man with atypical anorexia nervosa [^18ba795e]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

A 22-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe hyponatremia, hypotension and somnolence. He had a 9-month history of weight loss and vomiting that had led to a previous diagnosis of atypical anorexia, and he had been transferred from a psychiatric clinic.

Investigations

Generalized hyperpigmentation and dehydration were noted on physical examination. Baseline concentrations of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, serum cortisol, plasma renin and serum aldosterone were analyzed. Determination of antibodies against adrenal steroid 21-hydroxylase, measurement of very-long-chain fatty acids and thyroid function tests were performed.

Diagnosis

Primary adrenal insufficiency caused by isolated autoimmune adrenalitis and adrenal crisis.

Management

Immediate administration of hydrocortisone (100 mg bolus dose followed by 100 mg over 24 h per continuous infusion) and physiological saline infusions (initially 4 l over 24 h). After stabilization, initiation of chronic hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (initially 30 mg per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg daily). The patient was instructed on how to adjust hydrocortisone doses in stressful situations and provided with an emergency card.

### Spontaneous and tetracosactide-induced anti-ACTH antibodies in man [^f07efde7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Intriguingly, the same autoreactivity has not been reported with soluble synthetic tetracosactide. Indeed, animal studies showed that whilst conjugates of the ACTH 1–24 peptide were antigenic, unconjugated ACTH 1–24 peptide failed to induce an antibody response in rabbits or guinea pigs. 11, 19 The N‐terminal segment (1–24) of ACTH peptide is highly conserved among all species and is believed to have low antigenicity. 10, 12, 20 Hence, it seems likely that the complex of ACTH 1–24 and zinc in the depot tetracosactide formulation preparation may be important in the generation of the humoral immune response.

Interestingly, five of the 13 participants from the RoSA study, who were never previously exposed to depot tetracosactide, demonstrated positive serum anti‐ACTH binding activity at baseline. Similar findings were noted in the larger cohort of patients with Addison's. These latter patients had all received one or two soluble ACTH 1–24 peptide injections during diagnostic testing for Addison's disease. Hence, we speculate that the anti‐ACTH antibody response could potentially have been generated from either previous exposure to soluble tetracosactide, or more likely towards native, full‐length endogenous corticotropin. This group of patients may be more susceptible to the breakdown of immune self‐tolerance, by dint of their autoimmune Addison's disease, but may also be susceptible owing to the very high levels of endogenous plasma ACTH circulating in the months before their diagnosis of AAD. Indeed, several previous studies have found an activity in the sera of patients with AAD that appeared to attenuate the in vitro steroidogenic response of cultured adrenal tissue to ACTH. 21, 22, 23 Although this was believed to be due to patient immunoglobulins that bound to and blocked stimulation of the ACTH receptor, several of the effects described would be consistent with antibodies that neutralized ACTH action in vitro. This then begs the question, could these ACTH antibodies that were found in 21% of the unrelated patients with AAD in our cohort, contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune Addison's disease? If these antibodies had functional consequences in terms of binding or clearing endogenous ACTH, then a state of relative ‘corticotropin resistance’ could potentially lead to an accelerated decline in adrenal function during the natural history of evolving Addison's disease. Plasma ACTH may be elevated for many years prior to the diagnosis of Addison's disease 24 and this ACTH drives small islands of adrenal hyperplasia and regeneration, 25, 26 slowing the ultimate onset of adrenal steroidogenic failure. Thus, early adrenal unresponsiveness to ACTH stimulation in evolving Addison's disease may have the potential to tilt the balance from subclinical or partial adrenal insufficiency to clinically apparent adrenal insufficiency.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^55d8bb09]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes mellitus—type 1 diabetes mellitus—Type 1 diabetes (formerly called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes) occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas and accounts for approximately 6 percent of individuals with diabetes in the United States. The primary characteristic of type 1 diabetes is absolute dependence on exogenous insulin to prevent profound hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Although more frequently diagnosed in children and young adults, type 1 diabetes can occur at any age; it may be caused by genetic, environmental, or other factors, and currently there is no known way to prevent it. Persons with type 1 diabetes may develop other autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto’s disease, Graves’ disease, Addison’s disease, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia.

### Residual adrenal function in autoimmune Addison's disease-effect of dual therapy with rituximab and depot tetracosactide [^05a226ff]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Thirteen individuals (9 female, 4 male; age 19-64 years) with a diagnosis of new-onset AAD within the preceding 4 weeks were recruited from endocrine or acute medical services in Newcastle, Exeter, Cambridge, or Cardiff, United Kingdom. Patients underwent robust clinical and biochemical screening at the point of trial entry to confirm unequivocally that adrenal failure was primary and of autoimmune origin. Eligibility criteria included age 10 to 65 years, clinical features to confirm primary adrenal failure, high adrenocorticotropin (> 47 ng/L), low circulating cortisol concentrations (basal < 100 nmol/L or stimulated 30 or 60 minutes post-tetracosactide < 300 nmol/L), and positive serum 21-hydroxylase antibodies (21OH Abs) (≥ 1 U/mL). A computed tomography scan and chest x-ray were also performed to exclude intercurrent illness or malignancy and to assess adrenal gland appearances. Exclusion criteria were significant cardiovascular or respiratory disease (including asthma), renal or hepatic disease, malignancy, pregnancy or breastfeeding, current infectious disease (including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, shingles/zoster, tuberculosis), unexplained abnormality on chest x-ray, and previous use of immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs (excluding GC).

Thirty-three potential recruits were identified and underwent preliminary screening across 4 sites. Seventeen patients provided consent and were formally recruited into the 72-week study (Fig. 1). Of those who consented, 4 of 17 patients failed 1 or more eligibility criteria for treatment (Fig. 2).

Figure 1. 
Screening, treatment and monitoring schedule in the RADS2 study. Initial screening was performed in person or by telephone or email. If a patient with primary adrenal failure who was willing to participate in the study was identified, then formal eligibility testing took place. Robust clinical and biochemical assessment was carried out at the study entry (baseline visit), before any intervention. Major outcome visits (shown in middle column) were performed with patients “free” of exogenous steroids, allowing assessment of endogenous steroid production. Interim safety visits (shown in right-hand column) allowed a shorter clinical assessment to take place, with the primary aim being patient safety. *Depot tetracosactide therapy started. One mg administered subcutaneously on alternate days. **Depot tetracosactide discontinued at week 12, or continued to a maximum of week 20, depending on response (increasing stimulated cortisol on week 6 and week 12 SST) and tolerability.

### Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion versus oral hydrocortisone replacement for treatment of Addison's disease: a randomized clinical trial [^2fe91f8d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy fails to mimic the physiological cortisol rhythm, which may have implications for morbidity and mortality in patients with Addison's disease.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the effects of continuous sc hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) with conventional oral hydrocortisone (OHC) replacement therapy.

Design, Patients, and Interventions

This was a prospective crossover, randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing 3 months of treatment with thrice-daily OHC vs CSHI. From Norway and Sweden, 33 patients were enrolled from registries and clinics. All patients were assessed at baseline and after 8 and 12 weeks in each treatment arm.

Main Outcome Measures

The morning ACTH level was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were effects on metabolism, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), sleep, and safety.

Results

CSHI yielded normalization of morning ACTH and cortisol levels, and 24-hour salivary cortisol curves resembled the normal circadian variation. Urinary concentrations of glucocorticoid metabolites displayed a normal pattern with CSHI but were clearly altered with OHC. Several HRQoL indices in the vitality domain improved over time with CSHI. No benefit was found for either treatments for any subjective (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire) or objective (actigraphy) sleep parameters.

Conclusion

CSHI safely brought ACTH and cortisol toward normal circadian levels without adversely affecting glucocorticoid metabolism in the way that OHC did. Positive effects on HRQoL were noted with CSHI, indicating that physiological glucocorticoid replacement therapy may be beneficial and that CSHI might become a treatment option for patients poorly controlled on conventional therapy.

### Primary ovarian insufficiency in women with Addison's disease [^25fc7df6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics

Altogether 47 of 461 women (10.2%) with AAD in The Norwegian Addison registry had POI (Fig. 1) with a mean age at menopause of 33.2 years (95% CI 31.5-35.0 years). The corresponding age for women with AAD without POI was 48.9 years (95% CI 48.1-49.8) compared with the general reference population 52.7 years (95% CI 52.6-52.8 years). Women with POI were nonsignificantly younger at AAD diagnosis (34.5 vs 37.0 years, P =.129), but had a longer AAD disease duration than those without POI (26.8 vs 20.1 years, P =.003). There was a strong positive correlation between age at diagnosis of AAD and age at menopause (P <.001), with lower age at AAD diagnosis associated with lower age at menopause. We found that POI was diagnosed before or at the same time as AAD in 27 women (57%), and after AAD in 15 women (32%) (Fig. 2). In 5 women the chronological timing of events was uncertain.

### X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia: a case presentation [^bbc18177]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients with congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) develop symptoms during infantile and juvenile periods, with varying clinical manifestations. AHC is a disease that is easily misdiagnosed as Addison's disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). There was also a significant time difference between the age at which patients developed symptoms and the age at which they were diagnosed with AHC. Most patients showed early symptoms during infantile and juvenile periods, but were diagnosed with AHC many years later.

Case Presentation

We are currently reporting a male patient who developed systemic pigmentation at age 2 and was initially diagnosed with Addison's disease. At 22years of age, he experienced a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a disease mostly seen in adolescents aged 8-15years, an important cause of which is endocrine disorder. Testes evaluated using color Doppler Ultrasonography suggested microcalcifications. Further genetic testing and auxiliary examinations revealed that the patient had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and DAX-1 gene disorders, at which time he was diagnosed with AHC complicated by HH. He was given hormone replacement therapy, followed by regular outpatient review to adjust the medication.

Conclusions

The typical early symptoms of AHC are hyperpigmentation and ion disturbance during infantile and juvenile periods, while few patients with AHC develop puberty disorders as early symptoms. AHC is prone to being misdiagnosed as Addison's disease, and then gradually develops the symptoms of HH in adolescence. The definitive diagnosis of AHC ultimately is based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results and genetic testing results.

### Multiple disease associations in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II [^e4209fac]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II (APS II) is characterized by adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), autoimmune thyroid disease, and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). Multiple other autoimmune diseases have been associated with APS II. Here we report a case of a patient with APS II who over the course of 10 years developed Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, DM1, Hashimoto's encephalopathy, vitiligo, celiac disease, seronegative arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. This is a particularly aggressive course of APS II, and this combination of autoimmune diseases has not been previously reported.

Methods

A 25-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), celiac disease, and DM1 presented to our institution with mental status changes. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto's encephalopathy and treated with high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). She recovered well from her encephalopathy but her posthospitalization course was complicated due to the development of Addison's disease, vitiligo, seronegative arthritis, and hypothyroidism.

Results

The current understanding of APS II and its autoimmune disease associations are briefly summarized. The association of UC and Hashimoto's encephalopathy with APS II is novel and discussed in detail.

Conclusion

A case of a patient with APS II with a dramatic development of 8 autoimmune diseases over 10 years is described. The novel APS II developments of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and UC are discussed. This case highlights the potential complexity and severity of the clinical course of APS II.

### Residual corticosteroid production in autoimmune addison disease [^a3857534]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Study design

From September 2018 through January 2020 we performed a 2-staged, cross-sectional multicenter clinical study comprising patients with AAD at 17 hospitals in Norway, Sweden, and Germany (Fig. 1). All authors vouch for the accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the study protocol.

Figure 1. 
Flow chart of study procedures.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before study entry. At stage 1, we registered patient characteristics including age, sex, disease duration, medications, self-reported frequency of adrenal crises and infections, comorbidities, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 (APS2), disease-related symptoms, physical health (body mass index [(BMI], blood pressure, and presence of hyperpigmentation), and HRQoL questionnaires. All participants were prescribed hydrocortisone for intramuscular use and instructed to take their replacement medications upon symptoms of precipitating adrenal crisis. Thereafter, patients returned on an agreed morning for medication fasting blood sampling after abstaining from GC and MC intake not later than 2and 8the day before, respectively.

At stage 2, patients with quantifiable levels of serum cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol and/or quantifiable levels of serum aldosterone and corticosterone were asked to return for a standard 250 μg cosyntropin stimulation test (Synacthen). Blood samples were collected before (0 minutes) and 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous injection of cosyntropin. Participants with a long commute to the hospital were offered to combine screening and stimulation testing on the same day. At Haukeland University Hospital, we also invited all patients without quantifiable serum cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol to serve as negative controls. Before testing, patients abstained from their steroid replacement therapy in the same manner as described above. A normal response was defined as peak cortisol exceeding 412 or 485 nmol/L after 30 or 60 minutes, respectively. The peak response was defined as the highest serum cortisol value recorded at either 30 or 60 minutes.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was frequency of residual GC and/ or MC production in patients with AAD. Secondary endpoints included comparison of patients with and without residual GC and/or MC production with regards to patient characteristics including age, sex, disease duration, steroid replacement therapy, peak cortisol in cosyntropin testing, frequency of adrenal crises and infections, physical health (BMI, blood pressure, presence of hyperpigmentation), and HRQoL.

### X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia: a case presentation [^5dee63d9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

A high likelihood of the misdiagnosis of AHC

AHC typically manifests as adrenocortical hypofunction in infancy and early childhood and hypogonadism in adolescence. Most patients are not diagnosed with AHC at the time of their initial symptoms and are misdiagnosed with CAH, aldosterone deficiency, and Addison’s disease (Table 5). One case of a 21-day-old baby boy who was admitted to hospital due to feeding difficulties and poor growth has been reported. Physical examination showed skin pigmentation and normal external genitalia, and laboratory tests showed low levels of sodium and high levels of potassium, hypoglycemia, decreased cortisol levels, slightly increased 17-OHP levels, and significantly increased 11-deoxycortisol levels. These results have led to an early diagnosis of CAH. However, the results of the genetic testing suggested missense mutations in the DAX-1 gene, and therefore the patient was later diagnosed with AHC. In 2016, a 12-year-old boy with gonadal dysplasia was reported. The patient was diagnosed with Addison’s disease on the basis of8-year-long repetitively relapse salt-wasting syndrome. The diagnosis of AHC was not made until the patient was 12 years of age when he visited a hospital due to gonad dysplasia. Two misdiagnosed cases (cases 1 and 6) were also included in the 2019 report, which included seven case-child patients. Case 1 was first diagnosed with CAH, but was later found to have significantly increased levels of ACTH, decreased levels of 17a-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone, as well as retarded growth and bone age. After genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed with AHC. Additional cases that have been misdiagnosed have also been reported. As such, it is of great importance for clinicians to correctly identify AHC, CAH, and Addison’s disease. CAH is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects both males and females, and 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a commonly seen disease type. In addition to salt loss, female patients may have varying degrees of virilization, and male patients are prone to peripheral precocious puberty with homosexual manifestations, elevated levels of 17a- hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione, and obviously bilateral adrenal hyperplasia upon imaging examination. Unlike CAH, AHC is an X-linked recessive disorder that only affects males, typically manifesting as sexual dysplasia, normal phenotype, normal or decreased level of 17a- hydroxyprogesterone, decreased levels of testosterone and androstenedione, and identifiable atrophy of the adrenal glands. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is generally associated with various primary diseases, and patients with the disease have no family history and can be diagnosed with genetic testing.

### X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia: a case presentation [^d5a33c60]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years, continuous advances in diagnosis and treatment of AHC have contributed to an increasing number of cases diagnosed, but lack of knowledge regarding AHC may lead to misdiagnosis as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), aldosterone deficiency, or Addison’s disease, which may result in patients experiencing delays in treatment, as well as improperly medicated. We are currently reporting on a male patient who developed systemic pigmentation at age 2 and was initially diagnosed with Addison’s disease. At the age of 22, he experienced a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The incidence of SCFE was 1 ~ 24.6/100,000, mostly occurring in children aged 8–15 years. Among its many etiologies, endocrine disorder is an important cause, including changes in the levels of sex hormones, growth hormones, and other hormones. Further genetic testing and auxiliary examinations revealed that the patient had HH and DAX-1 gene disorders, at which time he was diagnosed with AHC complicated by HH. As part of the current investigation related cases have been reviewed and their clinical manifestations, laboratory, and genetic monitoring results have been summarized, with the aim of improving clinicians’ understanding of AHC, avoiding misdiagnosis, and providing assistance to family members of patients during prenatal consultations.

### Autoimmune thyroid disorders in autoimmune addison disease [^ba55ab24]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of Autoimmune Hypothyroidism

Altogether 68% of patients diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism had TPOAbs greater than the reference range (see Table 1). Only 20% had overt hypothyroidism at onset, while the remaining had subclinical hypothyroidism (73%) or thyroid levels in the normal range (7%) when they were diagnosed (Fig. 3). Most patients with overt hypothyroidism were diagnosed simultaneously with AAD. The group that had onset after AAD had the highest proportion of mild subclinical disease, with TSH levels between 4.1 and 10 mU/L (Table 2). The group that had onset before AAD had the highest proportion of TPOAb-negative patients (Table 3). The relationship between TPOAb positivity and the degree of thyroid dysfunction is shown in Table 4. For 177 patients (47%) it was not possible to obtain thyroid hormone levels at onset from hospital records. Many of these were diagnosed before 1995.

### Premature ovarian failure in patients with autoimmune Addison's disease: clinical, genetic, and immunological evaluation [^6786619d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Design

The design of the study was to investigate the prevalence of the following: 1) premature ovarian failure (POF) in patients with autoimmune Addison's disease (AD); 2) steroid-producing cell antibodies (StCA) and steroidogenic enzymes (17α-hydroxylase autoantibodies and P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme autoantibodies) in patients with or without POF; and 3) the value of these autoantibodies to predict POF.

Patients

The study included 258 women: 163 with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 (APS-2), 49 with APS-1, 18 with APS-4, and 28 with isolated AD.

Methods

StCA were measured by an immunofluorescence technique and 17α-hydroxylase autoantibodies and P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation assays.

Results

Fifty-two of 258 women with AD (20.2%) had POF. POF was diagnosed in 20 of 49 (40.8%) with APS-1, six of 18 (33.3%) with APS-4, 26 of 163 (16%) with APS-2, and none of 28 with isolated AD. In patients with APS-1 and APS-4, POF developed after AD, whereas it preceded AD in patients with APS-2. StCA were detected in 31 of 43 with POF (72%) and 51 of 198 without POF (25.7%). StCA were present in 22 of 38 with APS-1 (57.9%) (11 of 13 with POF); in five of 13 with APS-4 (38.5%) (three of four with POF); in 53 of 162 with APS-2 (32.7%) (17 of 26 with POF), and in one of 28 isolated AD patients (3.6%). Twelve of 13 patients with POF with a duration less than 5 yr (92.3%) and 18 of 25 with duration longer than 5 yr (72%) were StCA positive. Twenty-eight of 31 with POF (90.3%) were positive for at least one steroidogenic antibody. Forty-one women with AD less than 40 yr were followed up for a mean period of 9 yr. Eight of 21 women (38%) positive or seroconverted for steroidogenic autoantibodies developed POF at a mean age of 23 yr (six with APS-1, one with APS-2, and one with APS-4), and none of the 20 patients negative for steroidogenic autoantibodies developed POF.

Conclusions

This study indicates that AD is frequently associated with POF and that steroidogenic antibodies are markers of patients with POF. Steroidogenic autoantibodies are predictive markers of POF in patients with AD.

### Autoimmune adrenocortical failure in Norway autoantibodies and human leukocyte antigen class II associations related to clinical features [^ad0e9af7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex is the most common cause of primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison's disease) in industrialized countries. We have investigated a large Norwegian cohort of patients with Addison's disease in terms of clinical manifestations, autoantibodies, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II haplotypes. The study comprised 94 patients (54 females) of ages 6-85 yr (mean 45 yr) with, either isolated Addison's disease or part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II. Among those diagnosed before the age of thirty, 53% were men, while among those diagnosed at 30 or above, 30% were men. Altogether 77 (82%) of the 94 patients had autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase (21OH). Thirty-eight of the 40 patients with disease duration 5 yr or less had such autoantibodies. This frequency fell to 60% among patients with a disease duration greater than 35 yr. Five women had gonadal failure. This failure correlated with antibodies against side-chain cleavage enzyme (P = 0.03). Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and IA2 correlated with the presence of type 1 diabetes (P < 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively). The frequency of the HLA DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DR3-DQ2) and DRB1*04-DQA1*03-DQB1*0302 (DR4-DQ8) haplotypes were positively correlated to Addison's disease, whereas the DRB1*01-DQA1*0101-DQB1*0501 (DR1-DQ5) haplotype was negatively correlated. In addition, the DRB1*04 subtype DRB1*0404 was increased among Addison patients relative to controls. We verify that autoimmunity is the main cause of Addison's disease in our cohort. In younger patients, the disease is equally common in men and women. Measurement of autoantibodies against 21OH is a valuable tool in establishing the etiological diagnosis, especially in patients with a short disease duration. Addison's disease is associated with the DR3-DQ2 and DR4 (0404)-DQ8 haplotypes. A particularly high risk for disease development is observed when these occur in a heterozygous combination (DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8).

### Residual corticosteroid production in autoimmune addison disease [^1a30a212]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Stage 1: Frequency and clinical characteristics of residual corticosteroid production

Frequency of residual production. We included 197 patients with AAD. Five patients declined to proceed to medication fasting blood sampling and were excluded from the study. Baseline characteristics for the remaining 192 patients are presented in Table 2. The medication fast was generally well-tolerated, with only a few individuals reporting increased tiredness and/or headache at blood sampling. Fifty-eight (30.2%) patients had quantifiable levels of serum cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol (Fig. 3A, B), and 26 (13.5%) patients had quantifiable levels of serum aldosterone and corticosterone (Fig. 3C, D). In 24 (12.5%) patients, all 4 hormones were quantifiable. There was a strong positive correlation between serum cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol levels (r = 0.796; P < 0.001) (Fig. 4A), as well as for aldosterone and corticosterone (r = 0.605; P < 0.001) (Fig. 4B).

### Nonischemic cardiomyopathy associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II [^ea84bd1f]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of nonischemic cardiomyopathy associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II (APS-II).

Methods

We describe our patient's clinical features, evaluation, and outcome. In addition, a literature review of cardiomyopathy associated with polyendocrinopathy syndromes is presented.

Results

The component disorders of APS-II are Addison's disease in combination with either autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes. Although numerous other autoimmune conditions have been reported in conjunction with APS-II, cardiomyopathy has not been previously described as part of this syndrome. The current patient was a 32-year-old man who, during a 5-year period, was diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, and Addison's disease. In 2001, he presented with severe heart failure that progressed rapidly and eventually necessitated cardiac transplantation.

Conclusion

Although autoimmune cardiomyopathy has been associated with other autoimmune disorders, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of cardiomyopathy in association with an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. Patients with this syndrome should undergo clinical evaluation for heart failure.

### Endocrine and immunogenetic testing in individuals with type 1 diabetes and 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies: Addison's disease in a high-risk population [^4a7c19d8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) at risk for Addison's disease (AD) can be identified with RIAs for autoantibodies to the adrenal antigen 21-hydroxylase (21-OHAA). Screening individuals with T1D for 21OH-AA shows a relatively high prevalence of positive autoantibodies (1.4%, 38 of 2696 subjects). After detection of 21-OHAA, individuals were evaluated with endocrine testing, including baseline cortisol, ACTH, and plasma renin activity and low (1 mug) and high (250 mug) dose cortrosyn stimulation. Typing for DR and DQ alleles and for the major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A (MICA) gene polymorphisms was performed. Six individuals were diagnosed with AD; five were identified on initial endocrine evaluation. Follow-up over 2.9 yr yielded one additional diagnosis of AD. Endocrine testing showed a correlation between baseline ACTH and peak cortisol (r = -0.61; P < 0.0001), baseline and peak cortisol (r = 0.70; P < 0.0001), and stimulated cortisol after low- and high-dose testing (r = 0.92; P < 0.0001). DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 with DRB1* 0404 was associated with expression of 21-OHAA. At 2 yr, individuals homozygous for MICA5.1 had AD-free survival of 60% compared with 100% AD-free survival in those who were not homozygous for MICA5.1. Homozygosity for MICA5.1 may increase progression to overt AD among 21-OHAA-positive individuals.

Alternative Hydrocortisone Formulations

Continuous Subcutaneous Hydrocortisone Infusion

In healthy individuals, cortisol levels increase overnight to an early morning peak and then decrease throughout the day to very low or undetectable levels by midnight. However, in individuals with cortisol deficiency, conventional oral hydrocortisone treatment cannot replicate this physiologic rhythm, so patients are often under- or overtreated. Thus, use of the continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) has been explored, using insulin pumps programmed with variable infusion rates to replicate physiologic cortisol secretion and potentially improve hormone control (Fig. 2). In proof-of-concept studies in adults with Addison disease and 21OHD, CSHI was shown to decrease morning ACTH, 17OHP, and/or cortisol levels, with 24-hour salivary cortisol curves that resembled normal circadian variation. In addition, mean glucocorticoid doses were decreased from baseline, and there were improvements in subjective health scores.

### Recurrent nocturnal hypoglycaemia as a cause of morning fatigue in treated Addison's disease – favourable response to dietary management: a case report [^c000723c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Late dosing of GCs is sometimes associated with sleep difficulties, presumably due to the known effects of GCs on arousal. Hence, studies of GC regimens have focussed on short-acting GCs given at various frequencies, but avoiding administration 4–6 h before bedtime, in an attempt to mimic circadian plasma cortisol levels and improve short-term non-blinded measures of quality of life. Two studies have shown that circadian cortisol rhythms are closer to physiological if HC is given on a thrice-daily 10/5/5 mg schedule. Weight related dosing reduces inter-individual variation in cortisol levels. Cortisone acetate, which is converted to HC endogenously, has been shown to produce greater ACTH suppression and more physiological cortisol levels in Addison’s when given as a thrice rather than twice daily regimen. A four-dose regimen of HC produced more physiological circadian cortisol levels than 2-dose, but quality of life was similar. A practical limitation is the patients reported difficulty in adherence to frequent dose schedules. Overall, although these studies have shown that more frequent GC dosing can more closely mimic physiological cortisol levels there is limited short term data on quality of life and the optimum GC replacement regimen in PAI is not known.

Studies of two types of sustained release HC, once daily dual release Plenadren and twice daily enteric coated Chronocort, have shown more physiological circadian cortisol profiles than regular HC. In the case of Plenadren, metabolic studies have revealed lower HbA1c, waist circumference and LDL cholesterol despite similar cortisol peaks and integrated values and lower ACTH levels in patients with Addison’s switching from HC to Plenadren. Blinded controlled studies, using a visually identical rapid release HC preparation to assess the effect on well-being, have not been performed. Improved quality of life has been reported in patients receiving HC via an unblinded subcutaneous infusion on a circadian schedule, although quality of life did not change in one placebo-controlled double-blind study.

Administration of DHEA, an adrenal steroid that is not secreted in appreciable amounts in PAI, has been shown to have variable effects on wellbeing and quality of life in several studies, but the results of a meta-analysis did not demonstrate a consistent benefit and for this reason DHEA is not recommended routinely.

### Concomitant presentation of IgG-negative idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis and Addison's disease [^bc8472a8]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We describe a patient who was admitted to our medical centre with acute renal failure, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a retroperitoneal mass with bilateral ureteral obstruction. Biopsy revealed fibrosis with inflammatory infiltrate, but rare IgG 4 -positive plasma cells. After placement of bilateral pigtail nephrostomy catheters, renal failure improved but metabolic derangements remained. Morning serum cortisol level was equivocal, but with blunted response on cosyntropin stimulation testing indicating adrenal insufficiency. Serology for 21-hydroxylase antibodies was strongly positive, supporting the diagnosis of Addison's disease. In addition to nephrostomy catheters for obstructive uropathy, idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Physiological doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for Addison's disease were also initiated. The patient continues to be monitored for regression of the mass. Based on review of the literature, this is the first reported case of IgG 4 -negative idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis presenting with autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency.

### Time course of 21-hydroxylase antibodies and long-term remission of subclinical autoimmune adrenalitis after corticosteroid therapy: case report [^5fec0293]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Subclinical Addison's disease is characterized by the presence of adrenal autoantibodies (ACA) and steroid 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies (21OHAb) with or without adrenal function failure. In our previous longitudinal study some patients with high titers of ACA and at stage 2 of subclinical adrenocortical failure showed disappearance of ACA with recovery of normal adrenocortical function after corticosteroid treatment for Graves' ophthalmopathy. To investigate whether corticosteroid-induced modification of the adrenal autoimmune markers can also involve 21OHAb and to evaluate whether the remission of subclinical adrenocortical failure can persist over a long period of time, we followed-up for 100 months the levels of 21OHAb and ACA as well as the metabolic markers of adrenal function in one patient with Graves' ophthalmopathy and at stage 2 of subclinical adrenocortical failure before and after corticosteroid therapy. A 34-yr-old woman with Graves' disease and active ophthalmopathy who was found to be positive for ACA and to have high PRA, low aldosterone levels, and normal basal ACTH and cortisol levels, but impaired cortisol response to ACTH was studied. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroid therapy for 6 months. After corticosteroid therapy, 21OHAb, initially positive, became negative in concomitance with the disappearance of ACA and the restoration of normal adrenal function. The disappearance of both 21OHAb and ACA and their prolonged absence during the follow-up suggest that corticosteroid treatment can induce long-term remission of subclinical adrenal insufficiency and prevent the onset of the clinical phase of the disease. Our pilot study may pave the way to future trials aimed at preventing the onset of the clinical signs of Addison's disease in ACA/21OHAb-positive patients.

### T cell responses to steroid cytochrome P450 21-hydroxylase in patients with autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency [^8653bc9c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Autoimmune Addison's disease is thought to result from T cell mediated autoimmunity. Autoantibodies against the steroidogenic cytochrome P450 enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21OH) are found in most patients, and 21OH is therefore a likely target for antigen-specific T cells.

Objective

The aim was to study cellular immunity to 21OH and its associations with 21OH autoantibodies and human leukocyte antigen alleles in autoimmune Addison's disease.

Design/Patients

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 33 patients with autoimmune Addison's disease and 21 controls. Cellular proliferation and production of cytokines in response to stimulation with 21OH or 21OH-derived peptides were tested.

Results

Cellular proliferation (P = 0.0009) and secretion of interferon-gamma (P < 0.0001) in response to 21OH was significantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls and associated with the presence of 21OH autoantibodies (P = 0.0052). Furthermore, the 21OH-specific production of interferon-gamma was enhanced in the presence of 21OH autoantibodies. This effect was partially inhibited by antibodies against the Fc receptor for IgG, CD32. Moreover, mature dendritic cells proved superior to the other antigen-presenting cells in invoking cellular responses to 21OH. An association between cellular immunity to 21OH and the high-risk HLA genotype for Addison's disease, DRB1*0301-DQ2/DRB1*0404-DQ8, was observed (P = 0.0089). Finally, a significant association between the DRB1*0404-DQ8 haplotype and cellular responses to a 21OH-derived peptide predicted to bind to DRB1*0404 was detected (P = 0.0055).

Conclusion

Patients with autoimmune Addison's disease have circulating 21OH-specific T cells, with amino acids 342-361 of 21OH possibly constituting a disease-specific epitope presented by HLA-DRB1*0404.

### X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia: a case presentation [^12eb27b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients with congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) develop symptoms during infantile and juvenile periods, with varying clinical manifestations. AHC is a disease that is easily misdiagnosed as Addison’s disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). There was also a significant time difference between the age at which patients developed symptoms and the age at which they were diagnosed with AHC. Most patients showed early symptoms during infantile and juvenile periods, but were diagnosed with AHC many years later.

Case presentation

We are currently reporting a male patient who developed systemic pigmentation at age 2 and was initially diagnosed with Addison’s disease. At 22 years of age, he experienced a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a disease mostly seen in adolescents aged 8–15 years, an important cause of which is endocrine disorder. Testes evaluated using color Doppler Ultrasonography suggested microcalcifications. Further genetic testing and auxiliary examinations revealed that the patient had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and DAX-1 gene disorders, at which time he was diagnosed with AHC complicated by HH. He was given hormone replacement therapy, followed by regular outpatient review to adjust the medication.

Conclusions

The typical early symptoms of AHC are hyperpigmentation and ion disturbance during infantile and juvenile periods, while few patients with AHC develop puberty disorders as early symptoms. AHC is prone to being misdiagnosed as Addison’s disease, and then gradually develops the symptoms of HH in adolescence. The definitive diagnosis of AHC ultimately is based on the patient’s clinical presentation, laboratory results and genetic testing results.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^434743b2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15-25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20-35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (∼8 mg/m(2)/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease.
